0,"I have just arrived home from hospital. I have a loving girlfriend and very close friends to support me, so this is not what I need help with.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as the head of a large team at work, they don't know my situation but know that I suffer from an illness which excuses my sick days (depression).

&amp;#x200B;

I forwarded a picture of my hospital admission as proof of my sickness, my company is very respectful of mental illness but I am not sure whether I should disclose confidentially to my manager what occured. My greatest fear is that they think I am not really that sick and my absence will hurt my good reputation. I feel responsible to my job which I love and my team but I need to sort this out so that I can focus on myself for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated!",08Oct2018,1
1,"There's something my mom had told me to change, so I did. . . But later on, it came back when I had something precise on the head. Pigtails. 

What my mom told me to change is the fact I was still acting like a little girl at 8 years old, when inside I was pretty mature. I did change that, but now, as I'm soon 13. . . Something's off. And somehow, I'm conscious about what happens.

When I have pigtails, two or three, I suddenly change of personality and become an immature 5 year old. And I can't help it.

Can someone help me? I feel confused, honestly.",08Oct2018,1
2,"For the past two and a half years, I have had no self control/ regard for myself and I have had constant thoughts of suicide. After going through an abusive relationship and the death of my s/o during the next one (that was last spring/ summer respectively) (they really helped me grow as a person and cope with my suicidality), I have become really anxious/ nervous, indecisive, and increasingly suicidal.
I am 17 and my parents don't really bother to get help for me. My mother just thinks I haven't figured out how to cope with these feelings (although, through all of this time I've tried everything I and my closest friends could think of, next to admitting myself to a mental hospital or seeing a professional). My dad just pushes me (he doesn't believe in mental health or psychology at all), and when he walked in on me trying to take my life, he kept pushing me to do it. All of my closest friends just tell me little things that I've tried for months and they have not helped me with anything at all. 
I have so many important things to do (apply to colleges, keep up with my job, keep up with what I do with music) and I can't take time off to get better. I've tried and tried and tried to get better but nothing has helped. 
I don't want to die but I really feel like I might. I don't know what to do anymore. ",08Oct2018,1

I'm probably unsafe and toxic. I've probably dishonored my parents by admitting this, and I'm releasing my last connections and trust.

But I really don't understand how people enjoy life past teenage year what apart from bothering with money and a place, having a kid(I fucking hate kids honestly as unpopular as it sounds they're annoying as fuck) and I just don't enjoy people and speaking to them because I honestly couldn't give a shit about small talk or as arrogant as it sounds anyone elses problems. I work with many people older than me within, lower and know others higher class than me but don't understand what the point in living like that is(it it pussy or a good amount of dick? cos I've tried with relationships for like 3 years and I don't connect with people at all can't be arsed checking up even once a day with someone)
Just feel like I need to know what the attraction with growing any age 20+ I guess cos it's definitely there just feel like I'm missing something. I urge you not to 'kid' me cos of my age as well cos it annoys me even tho it shouldn't at the thought of it happening.
I'm not gonna off myself anytime soon haha I just need to see why people bother are they just too stupid or have bland expectancies for how life goes?

8,"I tired to kill myself a couple of months ago and after that my sister made comment about how I should kill myself because no loves me during a fight. At the time she didn’t know I had attempted this but she did know that I was dealing with some dark stuff and that I had tried before too. I thought we moved past that stuff because she apologized and I forgave her but these days whenever I have an opportunity to hurt her verbally I do it. I think it’s maybe because of what happened between us a couple of months ago. Although I’m past my dark phase, I still feel pretty upset about the comments she made and I personally think that she’s going through some stuff as well. My question is how do I move past this ?",08Oct2018,1
9,"I’m currently seeing a psychologist after I had an overdose. She’s been incredibly helpful in helping me understand a lot of things about my mind. But I always seem to pick up on stuff after talking to her that might be a symptom of something. Usually things I’ve done or experienced my whole life. 

The first thing happens practically every time I start falling asleep and closing my eyes. I know everyone’s mind starts wondering and you start thinking about random stuff; going through the days events or making up stories. I have a really overactive imagination so I normally make up stories or something. But for as long as I can remember the people in my head never look how they should look. They’re too tall or too small or they’re paper thin or I can think of their face it’s just a head. Or the environment does weird things like warping around itself or the ground starts sinking. I try forcing them to just look normal or for the ground to stay still but it’s like something overrides this and it never lets the image be. I’m like shouting in my head ‘no, stay this way’ but I never helps. 

It can also turn into other things like having a spoon that has something gross on like vomit or tomato ketchup (I hate it sm) and my head won’t stop imagining the spoon going into my mouth. Like I’m physically pushing the spoon away. I then try putting tape over my mouth but my head starts finding ways for the spoon to go in my mouth like it seeps through the side of the tape. This is just one example that’s the easiest to explains. I don’t have an issue with vomit or spoons it’s the fact my head is making me watch / experience the whole thing. 

The second thing is really common too, again while I’m falling asleep or I’m not doing anything stimulating. I can hear this voice that’s like slow motion but it’s stuttering. The sentence is always jumbled but one I remember a lot is ‘s-t-t-t-t-t’ and then I see a 30 something year old woman with brunette hair on a street next to a fence. Then I hear other sentences that are slowed down and it starts to feel like the room around me is in slow motion or that I’m in slow motion. 

I don’t know if these are anything. The first issue bothers me more then the second but I’ve had these things for as long as I can remember. I have GAD, depression and OCD so now I’m thinking maybe they’re intrusive thoughts or something? But just in a really strange way of showing themselves. Does anyone have any idea what this is? Is it even something or just a thing that happens?",08Oct2018,1
10,"Let’s say someone were to go through several traumatic events in their life, and after each one of these events, the pain became less significant. The person becomes more resilient since they have been through so much. However, they aren’t the person they used to be. Their range of emotion has become limited. They find themselves protected from the pain they were once vulnerable to, but also shielded from positive emotions such as happiness. They have developed a mental wall so thick that nearly nothing gets through anymore, even when they want it to. 

Is this a disorder?",08Oct2018,1

13,"hi, i’m not sure if this is the right place to post this. i’m back on reddit with my throwaway, looking for advice. my partner suffers from mental illness (not professionally diagnosed). he cries for help, but won’t actually accept it. if i am to stay, i am looking for support. is there a subreddit for support living with a partner’s mental illness? or is there anything like that in this subreddit? please and thank you.

we don’t know exactly what’s wrong. it comes and goes, but is more and more often now. and it is becoming more extreme. he claims it has been occasional since adolescence, he’s now in his 30’s. but i’ve really seen an increase in this past year (compared to the two before it). his symptoms come and go, but center on anxiety and paranoia. he also commonly exhibits depression and misplaced anger. he believes he is never at fault for anything and that he is constantly a victim of something or another. he’s never apologized for lashing out. but it’s almost like he doesn’t remember when i recount some of the nasty things he said when he was in a state. most of it doesn’t make sense or is a completely over-the-top reaction to something that is real. it is obvious to me that he is in need of help. he believes this too. but he’s also terrified of doctors. and i happen to believe that he is afraid of not being the center of attention anymore; he’s afraid of a normal life outside of being sick.

if he won’t see a doctor, this is how it’s going to be. and if i’m not going to leave, i would like to know if there are others in my situation that i can talk to. deep down, i believe that he can be helped and i want to stick it out, if possible. i am in the process of seeking a therapist for myself, but i think that talking to people in similar situations will help me more / in a different way. does anyone have any information? thank you.",08Oct2018,1

16,"Hi r/mentalhealth \- my name is Dr. Mick, and I am a couple &amp; family therapist in the United States with a PhD in Human Development. I've lurked in this subreddit on my personal account for a long time, and I appreciate how supportive this community is and I fully endorse the mission of the mod team. 

I see a lot of posts on here that focus on trying to find some level of community and support for mental health, whether in the space between therapy sessions or otherwise. In part, I think this is because (I'm sure most of you will agree) there are very few spaces online (and especially in-person) where mental health can be openly discussed without at least the fear of stigma.

If you find yourself looking for a safe, supportive space where you can speak openly about your mental health &amp; where you are free to remain anonymous, I would invite you to join me and my growing community at [twitch.tv/dr\_mick](https://twitch.tv/dr_mick). Now, before you write this post off as shameless self-promotion, I invite you to consider the following:

1) The community: there is a tight-knit group that is able to engage with you and each other in real-time from the comfort of your own terms. This community (900+ followers) has proved to be an incredible source of strength, support, and encouragement for each other. They'd welcome you with open arms.

2) The stream is facilitated by me - a real therapist. Though I can't ethically offer professional therapeutic advice on-stream, I can answer mental-health related questions and provide general information and resources. I am open to any and all questions, and I also monitor the chat (along with a dedicated mod team) to make sure it stays safe and supportive. So far, there have been no issues with trolls or negativity.

3) There is a dedicated discord channel that stays active when I am off-stream. Many have told me that they have appreciated the sense of community as well as the ability to pop in and out as they please.

4) It's free, and it's consistent. I have no expectation for donation or otherwise. You also don't have to engage if you don't want to - feel free to watch and lurk if that better suits you. I stream every night (with a few exceptions) for at least 1.5-2 hours. I start at 11:30pm Central Time, which I know is a bit inconvenient, but I pepper in bonus streams whenever I can.

5) If you like video games, you'll feel right at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to reach as many people as I can. My mission is to provide a platform where all of us can feel comfortable talking about mental health in a more familiar, accessible space. My channel seems to have helped many, and I hope it can help you too. Stop by - we'd all love to meet you :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm open to questions (an informal AmA, if you will) if you have any. I'll answer them if I am able (I cannot answer questions that solicit therapeutic advice). 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Note: I approached the moderators of this subreddit to ask permission to mention my stream, and was not told 'no'. If a mod sees this, I would be more than happy to provide proof of my education/credentials. ",08Oct2018,1

18,"Hello Reddit. 

I'm a 13yo girl, and last December my parents put me in therapy because I told them I was very nervous around people. 

The problem is I didn't trust my therapist. I didn't really tell her much, so while I attended therapy weekly, my mental health declined. The sessions weren't helping, and they were kinda costly, so I told my parents I was better and now it's been four months since I last saw a therapist. 

But I'm not better. If anything, I'm worse. I hate feeling this way, like my chest is too heavy and my thoughts wanna choke me and like this is all my life will ever be, even though I'm just a kid. So I wanna go back to therapy. 

I don't wanna go back to my old therapist, because I didn't trust her at the beginning and I feel as though it'd be hard for me to trust her now. But I do wanna see a new therapist. 

My parents believe a lot of stigma, though. It took convincing for them to find me a therapist last time. And I'm afraid if I tell them I want to see a therapist because I'm feeling depressed they'll just shut me down or just pray and leave it like that or tell me to try harder. How should I go about it, Reddit?

NOTE: My school does have a guidance counselor but it makes me really anxious to approach her and because teachers come and go at my school there's really none that I trust that much.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, when I am shopping with her she'll glare at another customer and say weird things under her breath while trying to move away from them. She flashes her headlights and turns the windshield wipers on when it's sunny outside when she passes a car she doesn't trust for whatever reason. She'll refuse to take a new phone number if she doesn't like that the numbers match a relative's age or birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

She's an irritating person, and I can tell that other people are annoyed by her. She will go up to the cashier at a store or fast food place, ask the prices of things that clearly have labels on them, tell them to take things off then add things back again to the purchase list, insist that they gave her too little pieces of food or rung up an item two times. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean she is still able to have a job and function in society despite how she acts, so I don't know if this concern of mine is urgent.

She will probably refuse to get help if I ever suggest she does, so this is more for my own understanding. I remember always feeling embarrassed to take her anywhere because of her odd behavior ever since I was 5.

In my marriage, I don't feel connected to my husband and I don't remember a time that I have. I can count three people I've felt deeply attached to in my life. None in a healthy manner and really only one as an adult. 

I wonder if, because I struggle with connecting with my husband, I ignore any positive efforts on his part to bond with me? Can i only see the times he's let me down? How much can I trust my own view of how things are? I know at least in part my view is tainted by the neglect. Am I the only person who can answer my questions?

28,"I'm 24 years old. 3 years ago, I escaped an abusive relationship. The last 3 years of my life have been coming to terms with that. It wasn't until recently when I began writing a personal statement for law school, and reconnecting with people who I'd fallen out with during that abusive relationship, that I realized that it wasn't just a relationship with an abuser--it was a relationship with a predator. It started when I was 15 and he was 30. I hadn't ever let myself think about the childhood component of it, hadn't let that shape my understanding of myself. I finally have let that in and am trying to move forward, but it's hard. I recently went back to therapy and for the first time have been fully honest. I've also started opening up to my friends about some of the details of what happened to me, though very few know much. I also went to the police and have a meeting tomorrow with federal officials. I feel like I'm doing all the right things, but there's a part of me that is frustrated at myself and scared. There's the part of me that is scared of my abuser still, and what will happen to me if I cooperate with law enforcement (though I still plan to), and there's a part of me that's scared of never being able to move on. I've put off applying to law school, moved cities a few times, and generally just never been able to fully feel ready to live my life. And once I started to feel like I had a handle on it, I went to therapy to gain some closure, and it opened up a whole new array of things I needed to consider. I know I'm not back at square one, but I do feel like I've been set back and that it'll never be over. I'd love advice on how to handle this feeling.",08Oct2018,1

30,"Hi!

I’m seeking explanation/empathy/advice/similar situations. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18, and then borderline personality disorder at 20. I truly have borderline, and have had INSANE struggles with medication over the years. Nothing, I mean nothing has worked for me. I have all of the classic symptoms, day to day my immense emptiness/anger/irritation/anxiety nearly cripples me and my interactions with people. I have a good heart, but often I’m too anxious, anger, and am filled with emptiness and exhaustion and feel hindered trying to do what I want. However, when I take adderall, EVERYTHING subsides.


I am not prescribed. However I have a friend that gives them to me occasionally for overnight shifts/holiday shifts, and most recently a big move. Adderall does not make me jumpy, or annoying, or overwhelming. If anything, I feel calmer, my anxiety disappears and I feel like time is on my side, to-do lists become enjoyable, but most importantly my interactions become so much more like I’d like them to be. I’ve been putting people off due to my symptoms, but on adderall I call them all, check on them, ask them questions, and feel genuinely interested and not bored with what they have to say. I tell my mom I love her more, play with my sisters hair, make the customers I’m helping feel 1000% more attended to and connected with. Adderall days are days I look forward to because I feel like my true self is finally exposed and I can be the kind, interactive, caring, helpful person I truly am without my mental illness getting in the way.


I’m struggling with how to approach this with my psychiatrist, but this literally feels like a miracle drug to me. It makes me so happy, and that makes me feel useful/important again. I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or could help me pinpoint HOW or why it makes me feel soooo much better. I wish I could be prescribed it but it’s not used for BPD. I know telling my therapist I used it “recreationally” will be a huge red flag to her and will affect my future prescriptions. Does anybody have any suggestions on how I should approach this? Thanks in advance.


TL;DR I have BPD and adderall feels like the miracle drug to me and I want to understand why, and if this is something I should bring up to my therapist.",08Oct2018,1

32,"Throwaway account.  


As title says, I'm struggling with whether I should go back into therapy. I once went through therapy back in high school for depression (I was categorized as a high stressed individual). However, my parents found out and talked to my counselor, telling them ""there is nothing stressful at home for u/Collegementalhealth to stress about"". Not too long after their ""intervention, my older sibling passed away and I went back to therapy again. Another fiasco happened and I ultimately thought I was ""clean"".  


Fastforward to the present, I've been noticing something odd. I can no longer retain information well enough. I will write memos down but read it a day later and I struggle to remember why I wrote it. What's worst is that I cannot understand anything now. You tell me a direction, I hear it, but my brain is not processing it. I just got a paper back from a professor that told me that I'm not writing at a college level along with other professors telling me that I'm not writing the same as I used to. I've been in college for 5+ years! How is this possible?

Home life has gotten worse and its been a rollercoaster; potential divorce, fights, restless nights etc. It has its cooldowns and hot spots.  


I've also noticed I've become extremely emotionally sensitive to others. When someone tells me I've got something wrong or they tease me, I'm down in the dumps for days, thinking its me being dumb or worst, I cry it out. I doubt myself a lot now. When I start to worry about things, I develop these types of attacks that make me feel nauseated, clammy, hot flashes, anxious, and start to breath irregularly. I don't know whether these are panic or anxiety attacks. I've been counting them down on what days and time I get them.  


Most days I feel pathetic. I don't like doing any of hobbies. I feel like my friends are judging me relentlessly and I no longer feel like I should be with them anymore. I prefer to be alone and whats worst is that when someone, either family or friends, ask me for something I get angry. Irritated. Moody. I don't want to be with them. After telling them no but I get pulled into anything with them, I feel like I have no choice in anything.  


Physically, I've noticed that I've been loosing hair...a lot. It's not one strand but 3-7 strands of hair when I take a shower every time I run my hand through my hair. And when I'm not showering, I still lose a lot of hair. I feel sluggish, tired, fatigued, and plagued with headaches. My right eye has been twitching for the last 4 months.

Thoughts of escaping out of my normal life when I'm driving and almost everyday, I don't want to be here.  


I understand my symptoms of depression back in high school but this is another level I cannot understand. I'm afraid that if I go back into therapy, I will find out another medical condition or worst; I will think back to suicide again. I'm at a crucial part of my college career as I'm almost done with my BA and getting ready for grad school applications.

I'm 16 and  for the past three almost four years have been some pretty dramatic moodswings that I dont show, I have periods of really bad loneliness that just burns me out then I'm really damn perky but I dont know if I'm just over reacting. I feel like everyone is disappointed in me and everyone is going to leave me. They didn't get as bad as they did until I got my heart broken, by a guy who was a close friend, which was my fault not his ( I left public  school and became homeschooled) and I feel like I kinda drove myself like this, because I mean I was constantly writing letters to him and still to this day thinking about him, and now when I see him in Walmart it feels like I'm going to die. My heart starts to beat really fast and I feel like throwing up and crying, my mom doesn't know about him and i know she will probably won't understand it. I have been talking to her about therapy but I'm not someone who talks about feelings, I rather slap a bandaid on it and shove it in a corner. I'm not sure if its because of horomones or I'm a girl (Eyeroll) but I have mention my moodswings to my mom before and she says she has them also, which isn't okay, she does struggle with mental illness a lot and it does affect our family.

When I was 10 years old back in the summer of 2011,I had seen something  that had caused me to have a series of panic attacks for whatever reason, it changed me,I was a worry freak and became compulsive about health and such. a few of these bouts of panic  led trips to my GP and the hospital once by ambulance unfortunately. It was the evening of august 30 I think and I felt the same dreading panic attack symptoms the fear, the cant breath feeling and  my dad got really pissed,everyone got pissed because yet again I had to go to the doctor. It was late at night and the usual hospital wait times in ontario,which was 2-6 hours,in fact I had to stay the night can't remember why though.Anyway I had a few tests done the next day and was told my appendix had to by removed within the next few hours or else it could burst.the strange parts that stumps me is that I never felt any serious symptoms,even though the doctors said it was maybe a few hours away from bursting.People usually experience vomiting and nausea and severe stomach pain,All I felt was a little dull pain,but the breathing of course bothered me which of course was just anxiety and unrelated.Prior to my bouts of anxiety,Like I said before,I never worried about pain and never went to the doctor for anything,So I think that had I never seen that show that somehow ticked off something in my mind, I never would of went to the hospital that night and appendicitis would never of been caught and I could of been dead,as a burst appendix is almost a death sentence without immediate medical response.Its just a thought,do you think maybe it was a good thing that these panic attacks came about.I wonder alot about this.",08Oct2018,1

Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study at the University of Chester, UK, on daily functioning and psychological wellbeing in cancer patients

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and all that comes after this can often be a distressing, worrying and confusing time. Our aim is to investigate how cancer has affected your daily functioning and emotional wellbeing. We are particularly interested in how this then affects decisions you make about your treatment. Our goal is to help others that might find themselves in your position in the future. To do this, we need your help.

Anyone who is over 16 years of age and been diagnosed with any type of cancer can take part. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that will take around 30 minutes to complete. You will be also asked whether you would like to participate in a phone or Skype interview at a later date, but you don’t have to agree to this to take part in the questionnaire study. While we hope that taking part will be a positive experience for you, we also understand that answering questions about your illness may be upsetting. You can always stop the questionnaire at any time. All your answers and data will be anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

47,"Let me start with - I am not asking for a diagnosis. I have a loved one who has been experiencing some kind of mental health problem and lately been exhibiting extreme paranoia, obsession with conspiracy, and had a psychotic episode a couple nights ago. If anyone has advice about how best to help them I would appreciate it. I am worried they are isolating themselves and are refusing any kind of therapy or psychiatric medication other than ADHD medication which they claim is for concentration (they have only been taking it the last few months and I think it is making their symptoms worse). They have been hospitalized for evaluation but I don't think they are being forthcoming with their doctors about their paranoid thoughts and I think they might be in denial of their need for help (anosognosia?).  Once they are released their family is trying to decide what to do but they are in their 40's and we can't force them to get treatment if they don't want to even though they have at this point stopped being able to work and are living at home with their parents...  I've tried to talk to them about therapy but they keep saying they are only circumstantially depressed and don't need help or medication and spend hours on the internet reading about conspiracy without sleep or food; I am one of the few people they talk during their sudden decline and they only want to discuss the conspiracy theories with me and paranoid ideas (possibly hallucinating being watched). The psychotic episodes seem to be getting worse every time and  I am worried if I confront this person about their behavior to try to get to them to open up they will even further isolate themselves. Am I supposed to keep talking to them about their paranoid ideas? Every time I begin to counter an conspiratorial theory they just shut down saying I just don't understand and hole up again.

After their fight last month they haven’t talked to each other and don’t feel an urge to restart communication process. It never used to be this way earlier, but somehow it has been going downhill now. Did they miss early warning signal?

It’s a fictitious story but very close to what some of us are going through in our relationship. We don’t pay attention to warning signs and get into a situation which become difficult to repair. Trouble in marriage also causes mental issues such as depression, stress, and anger etc.

While every relationship is unique, there are a few common warning signs that indicate the existence of some serious conflict or differences in a marriage. Often times, couples brush these differences under the carpet rather than discussing and ironing them out. With busy work schedules and the buzz of daily life, couples often fail to even pick up cues that indicate trouble. We’ve put together some of the most common symptoms of marital distress to make sure you aren’t caught off guard.

📷

* **You don’t make decisions together –** Marriage is a partnership between two people who are equals. If you or your partner often find yourselves shutting the other out and calling the shots alone, there’s trouble brewing.
* **Self Care –** When you lose interest in nurturing yourself physically, staying healthy and well turned out and notice a dip in emotional wellness or the surfacing of an eating disorder, chances are a troubled relationship is nagging you at the back of your mind.
* **Lack of Intimacy –** Decreased levels of intimacy, separate bedrooms and reduced physical closeness are signs of a troubled marriage. Whether its work stress, family or other issues, don’t let it creep in between the two of you.
* **Ghosts of the Past –** If you find yourself often discussing past problems and conflicts that lead to arguments and name calling, chances are there’s a lot of emotional baggage that you are carrying that’s been left unaddressed.
* **Lack of Communication –** Not sharing details of your day, health, work-life stress, new friends or colleagues are all indications that you don’t look at each other as a friend you can share things with. Sharing everyday happenings is a sign of a healthy relationship.
* **Ignoring the Elephant in the Room –**When you can go days without thrashing out a gnawing issue while giving each other the silent treatment and behaving like all is well, you are definitely in a relationship that requires fundamental rebuilding.
* **Loneliness –** If you feel a sense of loneliness despite being around your partner and find yourself relying on others for emotional support or a fun time, there’s certainly trouble brewing between the two of you.
* **Hiding Information –** Often walking to another room to answer calls, deleting texts, toying with the idea of a casual affair, indulging in flirting with the opposite sex and hiding information about outings or acquaintances from your partner are activities that if indulged in, indicate that your marriage is on the rocks.
* **Fighting &amp; Impact on other Relationships –** You often find yourself fighting in front of friends, your children or your parents with shouting, teasing, name-calling and absolute lack of mutual respect; If you notice the reflection of your troubled marriage affecting the emotional well being of your child with anger management and child psychology issues spewing, your marriage is certainly in the doldrums

A troubled marriage certainly doesn’t spell out separation. One important lesson we must all imbibe is that no marriage or relationship is perfect. Every couple must constantly work on improving their relationship, learning more about their partner and working together to beat out differences and problems. After all, it does take two to tango.

56,"Hi everyone,

So I've had this problem for a few years now with excessive, uncontrollable, surprise crying. I am almost never sad when it starts (though I am often slightly anxious) and once it has started, it won't stop. It is BIZARRE and I have no idea what to call it or who to talk to about it (aside from a therapist, but I'm putting that off until I have exhausted all other options because I'm not really able to afford therapy rn).

My first experience with this uncontrollable crying was when I was maybe 14? I used to rock out to my stereo for hours. It was my favourite thing to do and it relaxed me after a long day at school. But for some reason, at one point I developed an aversion to the band No Doubt. Whenever a No Doubt song came on the radio I would burst into tears, and was unable to stop for a while. I would suddenly be filled with a deep, heartbreaking emptiness that I couldn't quite fill. I don't know why this particular band caused this issue lmao. I don't experience that association anymore as an adult.

When I got older I had a similar experience. I was about 16. I was having a really good day at school. I had all my favourite subjects that day, it was sunny, and I was feeling uncharacteristically chirpy. I was called to the dental bus for a checkup during one of my least favourite subjects. I showed up, chilled out chatting to a few kids who were also waiting, and enjoyed the sunshine. I felt pretty confident about my checkup because I had always had ok teeth. When I was finally called in, I said a cheery hello to the nurses... and promptly burst into huge heaving sobs.

I scared the shit out of them. They even asked if I had been 'hurt' (see: molested) by a healthcare person in the past. They thought I was experiencing flashbacks. I actually laughed at them.

""omg are you ok!? Do you want us to call your parents?""

""Nah lmao I'm algood - I just do this sometimes. It's my 'thing' that I do.""

I have NOT been molested. The members of No Doubt did not bully me in school. I am not depressed. I honestly don't know why I'm like this.

As an adult I developed a much stronger persuasion to crying. I cry much more than I did as a kid, but ironically I'm happier now than I ever was then. It's awful and bizarre and it's affecting my relationahip with my partner, who is struggling to understand my crying habit.

When I first realised how my issue is affecting the people around me, I worked really hard on controlling my crying spells. When I failed, I would walk away, cry in bed for a few minutes, reapply my makeup, and return to life as normal. Sometimes I can feel my spells coming on - I'll spend a full day 'on the verge' of tears, and I have to be extra vigilant. I AM NOT FUCKING SAD THOUGH.

Recently I have been dealing with a completely different health scare and I have found myself feeling much more anxious than usual. This has increased my crying spells. I have cried at work many times in the last month and it's time to stop. My partner is wearing down with the stress of being with someone who cries constantly at home. While I don't feel bad about anything in my life, I AM worried about the people around me.

About an hour ago I found out about an disorder called pseudobulbar affect. It is a mood disorder characterised by uncontrollable crying or laughing - completely inappropriate to the sufferer's real mood. It is the best explanation I have ever found for my problem and I would love to hear something about it if anyone else has some personal anecdotes or advice. If you also suffer from similar symptoms PLEASE contact me.

I 100% intend to visit a psychiatrist if all else fails. I understand the importance of mental health. But I want to do my research and maybe get some advice so I can save A= money, and B= My family the added stress of knowing I needed to see a therapist (I've just had a cancer scare - I can't scare them like that again. If I do see a therapist I'll probably keep it on the down-low for a while).

Sorry if my writing is garbled. It's 2:30am and I'm trying to do this on my phone in bed. I would LOVE some advice if you guys have any.

Thank you.

I'm pretty sure actual clinical depression doesn't just magically disappear like that, and I never went to confirm with a doctor that I had such a disease last year. ",08Oct2018,1
59,"Hello to all of you Shane Dawson's fans. Since  controversial documentary about Jake is not yet finished I had decided to post here about ASPD.  While I am sure that I am not sociopath or psychopath I had noticed few things about myself.

Let's talk about empathy. I had noticed that over last few years that my empathy to certain things and events had lowered if that's the correct way to say.

First my reaction to certain things. Since there are many things that are happening in our daily lives, I decided to pick up one - my grandmother crying. My grandmother cries a lot, especially lately. When I was a kid I often had asked why she is crying, now that doesn't happen anymore. I just think to myself ""here she is again crying, such an emotional wreck"" and I just leave her as her weeps begins to anger me.

Now about the events and I am going to talk about two that happened in recent years, both are dealing with death.

About two years ago, a female classmate that I knew committed suicide, since my group of friends along with me celebrated birthdays with her I got news about her suicide through one of my friends.  I was shocked of course as she did not seemed to be that type of a person who could do this and that's it.  My only emotion at that time was ""why?"" Of course I knew the basic reason - just not in detail why she had done this.  At her funeral I often thought to myself - ""get over this already, I am tired."" Now sometimes when I think back to the events question about why she had done this, had disappeared.  Instead I began asking myself questions about her existence ""did she really existed?"" ""was she just a pigment of my imagination?"" Despite that I know the facts my mind could not get over those questions.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing is my grandfather from father's side.  He had died a few months ago - due to the many health complications in the past half+ year if I am not mistaken.  I was waken up by my mother - early in the morning - my mother had lead me to my father who was smoking, I immediately knew that something had happened. There he told that my grandfather had died,  I did not reacted as I was still pretty much asleep and just went to the WC and back to my bed. While it seems like I had no reaction to the unfortunate news, I had accepted that my grandfather's clock is very close to the 12:00. This happened when I visited him along with my dad less than 2 months ago before his death. When I saw him, I couldn't recognize him, he looked like a shadow of his former self. My father and he talked for about an hour or two - I can't really remember, however I did not viewed that man as my grandfather. I viewed him as a ghost - a shell of what was my grandfather, while understanding that he is my grandfather - just after many health complications. As I and my father had left the hospital, I accepted that soon he would no longer be with us.",08Oct2018,1

62,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this. I'm just mentally and emotionally exhausted from dealing with this and trying to be strong for my parents that I just need to get this off my chest. I would be grateful for any advice or anything, but this ordeal has effectively made me a mess. My sister and I both have our own challenges and long histories with them. I have ADHD and concurrent bouts of depression and anxiety by extension and she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder &amp; depression 3 years ago. We are 10 years apart, so for most of my life, I'd say I had a fair part in raising her alongside my parents considering they both work, so I was responsible for picking her up from school/dinner/starting homework etc. Because of this, we have 9or so I thought) this great hybrid bond of parent/sibling and I guess I've always felt more responsible for her than a typical sibling would. She is in her second year of college a few hours away and for the most part had been doing okay or so I thought. This is not to say that there were no setbacks, she has had frequent ups and downs but normally she would go speak to the counselors on staff at the school or we would talk at length about whatever was bothering her. I made sure to always be in touch and accessible whenever she might need me and did everything in my power to make sure she had access to any tools and resources for self-care and well-being. Normally when she vents she prefers we keep things between us without getting my parents involved because previously, it has been business-as-usual type of setbacks and we didn't want them needlessly worried. Towards the end of last week, her messages to be became increasingly intense and it took much convincing from myself and my best friend (her de-facto bonus big sis) for her to come clean to my parents that she was not doing well. In the recent past, on a couple occasions, her panic attacks have caused blurred vision/tightness of jaw/involuntary ticks/memory blackouts and she had gotten an MRI (which came back normal) when those symptoms first appeared so we though it was just a one-off. However, this time it was happening again, bad, and while she was working at a job she had just started a few weeks ago. Work sent her home and a friend took her to the ER because of what we now think was a focal seizure. Upon reaching the hospital, she signed herself in and I'm guessing they made the connection to her mental health issues and had her placed on a 72hr involuntary psychiatric hold. My parents of course drove up there Friday night and are still there now, but I am at home, manning the fort and feeling unbelievably horrible. My parents have updated me as they learn new information and I am just distraught. They tell me she says she is scared and wants out of there. They can't hug her as the facility has a no contact rule. She can't write or draw or do anything really. They even took the underwire from her bra. I get that these precautions are a necessary evil so to speak, but knowing she is in a place like that is just breaking my heart. I am scared and worried for her. I am so hurt knowing how badly my parents are taking this; a phone conversation with either one of them doesn't last for longer than a few minutes before they begin crying and have to get off the phone. I can't really admit to my parents how badly I have taken this myself, as I feel I need to be strong for them &amp; venting to my boyfriend and friends has provided little relief. I know it isn't logical, but I feel so incredibly guilty &amp; helpless that she is there. She's my little sister. I'm supposed to be able to protect her. And I failed. Pending a psych eval today she will hopefully be released, but, what now? The uncertainty is just another factor adding to my current cocktail of emotional turmoil and I am just spent. And if that wasn't enough to deal with on it's own, I am also currently in school and it's time for mid-terms.

63,"Throughout the past few years, I have noticed that my ability to feel emotions that others feel such as sadness has greatly dwindled, I find myself unable to feel for others, I finally decided to create this post because of an event that happened in the past few hours where my sister has failed a critical examination which would allow her to enter the school of her choice, my whole family was crying and yet I wasn't moved in the slightest; furthermore, my depression has also gotten worse over this period of time for I find myself completely demotivated to do any work until the last minute where my anxiety kicks in, that is the only motivator that I currently have, by grace, despite my de-motivation , I have been able to ""wing it"", and successfully pass with high marks, however now I have started the next step in education where I must work hard in my own time, I worry that I will be unable to do what I have done in the past, and often experience suicidal thoughts for many reasons, where the only reason I continue is so that I dont ruin my family and make those around me feel bad; with the stupidest being the fact that I am circumcised, which causes me to feel extremely embarrassed about my body, and on top of that, because of my manlet height of 5'5"" my self confidence is below the floor. For me every day is hell and i have no idea what to do about it

I have planned to get a psychiatrist to see me once i move out from my parent's house, however at the earliest that is still \~2 years away and I hardly have confidence that i am able to hold out until then before i have a complete breakdown, I do not wish to speak out about it while still being under my parent's care for I feel great shame being the most successful  member of our family despite feeling like i have no future, and in school i also do not want to say anything directly to teachers for a similar reason.

Over the time i have suffered,  i have frequently made jokes about depression and me wanting to die trying to make it obvious to them so that they will report it allowing me to skip the anxiety over admitting it, but in all that time not even once has anyone said anything to a teacher, leaving me to suffer, I can understand that though since i am often seen as the ""joker"" amongst my friends and they just simply brush it off as another one of my ""jokes"".

Please somebody suggest something that will help me to feel once again rather than my black and white emotions where any happiness i feel disappears in moments putting me back into my apathy, the closest thing i have got of a chance of recovery it my feelings of wanting to better myself for a girl I want to ask out, which has pulled me out of my sparse eating where before i would barely eat 1 meal per day, although even that hasn't helped me.

64,"Hi everyone! I know you guys aren't doctors and I'm not looking for any sort of medical advice but just wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience to mine. I was on 60mg of Prozac, 5mg? of a Abilify, 10mg of Adderall, and ??mg of Cybalta. I'm 19F from Ontario, Canada and have suffered from depression, anxiety for about 7 or 8 years minimum now. I've also been diagnosed with ""school avoidance disorder"" and have not been able to complete high school yet (even though I was a straight A student).

I was put on Prozac back in 2014 and the medications have slowly been added over time by my psychiatrists (Multiple because a few have dropped me but thats a story in itself). I stopped taking my birth control pill a month ago after I spent some time in the ER with abdominal pain and I wasn't sure if it could be related to my pill. When I turned off the reminders for my more important birth control, I kept forgetting to take my psych meds. It was about a week of taking them whenever I remembered until I decided to just stop them because I was barely taking them at that point.

I expected the worst as I've been on these meds for so long and I can remember how bad I was in that time before I got professional help for my mental illnesses. At most I had a possibly slightly more depressing two to three days after I stopped but honestly, I was going through something else at the time that was affecting me. 

I've had no symptoms of going off my medications which is so bizarre to me and it's been over a month. I quit four medications that were supposed to be keeping me stable and I'm pretty much no different. I'm not saying I'm better off the meds, but I'm definitely not worse. I'm still tired all the time and occasionally depressed just like I was on the meds. I haven't followed up with my psychiatrist because my next appointment isn't for a few months but I'm worried he will be mad I quit cold turkey. 

I guess I'm wondering what your experiences were with psych meds. I always assumed they were making me better but looking back, I'm honestly not much better and any places I am better, I kind of worked through my problems on my own and learned how to efficiently cope. 

Thank you if you read all this and I look forward to hopefully hearing from some of you. :)",08Oct2018,1
65,"Whenever normal people have problems, I hear them say they do things that distract them like hanging with friends, gaming, meditating, etc. They do these hobbies and think through their problems in a healthy, normal, rational way.

I, on the other hand, can’t do this. The minute anything bad happens to me, I feel like I’m genuinely too emotionally weak to handle it. For example, my car broke down recently and I need it for work. Most people would say “this sucks, but I’ll get it fixed and just tough it out until then.” while I actually contemplated suicide, even though it’s not that deep.
Another example is with my ex; we broke up recently after 3 years, and while most people handle the misery in a healthy way and just wait for it to go away, I almost shot myself and got high on several substances daily. 

It feels like my brain cannot tolerate any type of emotional pain. I’m physically strong (180 pounds of mostly muscle) but I get defeated emotionally easily. My family also comments on how I can’t handle too much and how I need to “man up.” 
I go from mild inconvenience to suicidal thoughts quickly and I can’t figure out why. I don’t want to be like this. Almost feels like I’m not built for this world.

68,"Hi, just looking for some opinions really from anyone with similar experience. 

I've been on citalopram for 3 years or so. 4mg dose. During my worst periods of depression and anxiety I was drinking heavily and developed alcoholism and cocaine dependences. In march of this year I entered rehab having developed deeply suicidal thoughts. Since leaving rehab 7.5 months ago I have been clean and sober and haven't suffered any depressive episodes let alone suicidal thoughts; I have had general anxiety. I have been attending 12 step programmes as well as meditating.

6 weeks ago I spoke to my doctor and we agreed to reduce my medication to 30mg given my progress, I hadn't had any depression at all during the 6 months that I'd been out of treatment. All has been going well too a degree, my anxiety had gone which was a surprise and generally I've been feeling happy and productive. The one sticking point is my work. I am completely unmotivated to do anything, like nothing at all. If work is put in front of me I will do it but otherwise I can't bring myself to engage. Work was significantly important in my initial depression and anxiety and was a driver behind my emotional state that led to my substance abuse. The inability to motivate myself is leading me to feel unconnected at work and beginning to make me feel depressed. 

I spoke with my doctor who has advised me to keep at my current, lowered dose and to check back in a further 6 weeks. I am concerned about my emotional stability and the best effect it might have on my sobriety and consequently my mental health.

Has anyone got experience of losing their medication? Is this to be expected and should I be giving myself more time? Should I be prepared to feel low for a period as my body and mind adjusts? Do I need to find a new job or so for a transfer or something - is the issue I'm just not happy in my role having suffered mental difficulty in that position before getting help? 

I'm generally quite confused. I don't want to up my medication again although that would seem like the obvious answer. I'm going to get some counselling to discuss the issues and see if I can overcome the mental block around motivation/procrastination and see if that helps, but was any to know if this is normal in others experience.

Thanks.

I am 17 years old and come from Europe.

I am currently attending the second hardest school in my country in a special program for a certain subject.

Over the last few years I had trouble going out,being social etc.

I became very lazy and have no motivation to learn my subjects and get good grades.I have no real interests and I just waste most of my time doing nothing or browsing the internet.

Many times I wanted to go talk to an adult and seek professional help but I never had the courage to do so.

When I was little I was a happy and a cheerful child but bullying in the elementary school destroyed my  character.

Many years I had no friends and I was very lonely.I remember my parents telling me to go outside and socialize and I just kept reminding me I had no friends and nobody liked me.

I was close to ending my life a few times and often have suicidal thoughts.

When I started going to highschool I got a few close friends and finally a girlfriend,but I still feel empty and useless.

I really do not know what to write.

71,"**This is going to be long, but I genuinely need advice on this.**

So to make a long story very short, my boyfriend is possibly one of the most emotionally abusive people I've ever been with. I ideate with suicide whenever there's an argument, because he's fantastic at making me feel like literally everything that he does is my fault (gaslighting -- he is an enormous narcissist) and that I'm not worth as much as any person around me (constantly picks the feelings of others over me). I'm having a weird moment of clarity right now because of remembering something that happened during my breakup with the other abusive ex that I've had: I remember the extremely anxiety I had that he would never change. That he would go on to hurt another woman, and that to him and his family, I would be the bad guy of our story, even though he physically, sexually and emotionally abused me. It hurt me too that I'd gotten to attached to his family, and that I would also be the bad guy to them. When you're around people a ton for a year and a half, you begin to become invested in their stories and lives.

I remembered all of that. And then I remembered that now, I couldn't care any less than I already do about him. It was a long 3 months of me almost not being functional at all and having constant panic attacks when passing anywhere that was an old haunt of ours (when he dumped me, I had to live in a homeless shelter even though he played a part in me becoming homeless -- I was 18. I am 21 now). But then I moved away from that city (Houston) and lived somewhere else and it helped in me getting over it. I met someone new, and I cried here and there, but 3 years later, it doesn't hurt at all anymore.

Today, I'm in a program for software development that really does everything for the people that enter. For 6 months you learn something tech related (I'd already had some web dev experience before coming in) and then for 6 months after that, they send you on an internship with a Fortune 500 company -- 90% of students that finished are hired either on their internship or during the 4 months of job placement help they give you after you graduate. I'm receiving a stipend while I attend that isn't much, but it covers my half of rent and a bit more. Something I've been considering lately is relocation... for those that are willing and that do particularly well, some companies are willing to make an offer and pay for your relocation if the location they're at doesn't have the space to hire someone for your role, but an out of state location does. I'm genuinely considering doing this, because I am actually financially dependent on my boyfriend (this is part of why he's able to abuse me) and this would kind of... force me to leave him. I also got hit by a car while on my moped 2 months ago, and as a mixed blessing, it should result in me getting a check through my lawyer from the case. I'm hoping it'll be alot so it'll give me a safety cushion. As a narcissist, he's fantastic at convincing me that he's going to change when he never does. I recognize that I'm really bad at recognizing when people are genuine or when they aren't. And he's mad some changes here and there since we've gotten together, but I'm just seriously doubting it'll ever be at the rate it needs to be or that he'll ever completely change. He's great at roping me back in, and if he keeps doing this, I'll end up marrying this guy, I know it.

I'm terrified of being alone. I have no parents, and no family really (Mom was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive. My father was never present). I'm not that great at making friends because people my own age don't have remotely the level of responsibility I do (taking care of bills, not spending my money or time drinking because I don't have anyone to come get me and help me if I go overboard, etc.) and I can't relate to alot of older people either... so I have problems being alone. It'll be just me. I was a serial monogamist (something I DON'T want to do again) before I met my SO because that's usually the only kind of re-inforcing touch/emotional re-assurance I can get from anyone. I'm scared, too, because as a woman, I know we get targeted alot for burglaries and that sort of thing.  I've also felt bad because he's given me alot (to lots of moaning and bitching and groaning about how he does sooo much for me and would rather not be) and the plan was for me to pay the almost 5k back to him. But I'm feeling like that will 1.) break me financially to do, and 2.) he's never worked on paying me back emotionally in the fact that I've been his emotional punching bag and have been carrying this relationship for the last 2 years. I pointed this out to him, and he's pretty much let me know without saying it directly that that's not nearly as important as tangible money.

But my point is... I know that this (this relationship) is wrong. I know that I can't keep this up. How do you all deal with being alone (and for the ladies, living alone), and how do I deal with these feelings of guilt I'm having? Of leaving his family too (his nieces have been around me for 2 years now since they were both 2 years old and refer to me as their aunt)?",08Oct2018,1

Thinking of you is only sad now mom, I’ve forgotten the sound of your voice now mom
You’re memory is a scary beast mom, I’ve got to tame it, keep it locked away in a cage mom

If I keep myself numb mom, I can keep you in a locket mom
You’re separate from the beast mom, when I’m high I can feel you hug me mom
Nothing can stop me now mom, as long as I can afford my drugs now mom 
I’m working everyday mom, and taking pills and smoking mom 
They said I coped with you well mom, I never even told them mom 
How scary you had become mom, imagining your body dead mom
Im running out of cash mom, I can’t let this beast outrun me mom 
I thought these drugs were friendly mom, but now the beast has doubled mom 

I’m doing the best I can mom, I wish you could’ve stayed here mom
I would share my bowl of cereal mom, then we’d go about our day mom. 

Your loving daughter,

75,"I can't tell anyone. My mother is a psychiatrist and would absolutely freak out, my girlfriend is too wrapped up in herself to care and my dad would say I'm lying. I don't know what to do, it's been haunting me for ages.

It started a few months ago when I started university. 

I was washing the dishes alone at home when I started thinking about how shameful and disappointing I must be for only managing to get into biomedical sciences rather than medicine. I knew my parents were disappointed with me even if they said otherwise.

I then thought about how it would feel to die. As soon as I did, I couldn't stop. I felt my stomach drop as I realised life would probably just... go on? I wanted to know how it felt to not have responsibilities and stress hanging over my head. I wanted to know if I would be reincarnated into someone else and see if I could watch myself die.

I felt worthless and empty, exactly like a single particle in this huge world. I never stopped thinking about how much weight would be lifted off my shoulders if I wasn't so afraid of death. 

I just want these horrid thoughts to go away and I don't know how to make them stop.",08Oct2018,1
76,"Called my mom this morning in a full on depression rant and finally told her I don’t want to live anymore. I’ve been keeping it to myself, but I just couldn’t anymore. These thoughts are scaring me and I need help. 

She told me to call my psychiatrist and book an appointment so I could talk to her about starting on Latuda. I tell her I’ve wanted to try it but it’s WAY too expensive for me, and she told me to not think about the cost because she’ll take care of the money. She just wants me to be okay. I’m too desperate to tell her not to help me, and I definitely feel guilty about it but I need the help, and I can’t turn it down at this point. 

Latuda is literally the only medication that has ever worked this well for my mom. She’s been committed for suicide attempts a few times in my life, and the older I get the more my mental health begins to look EXACTLY like hers. Our body chemistry seems to be very similar and our depression/anxiety/mood swings and even our adhd manifest in exactly the same ways. So I feel like I can trust Latuda to help me. 

Since being on Latuda she’s lost her mother to cancer, then her husband (my father) to cancer, then immediately following that she lost her own father, and a good friend of hers. Despite all of that she kept her head up and her state of mind was okay. Before Latuda she would have definitely ended up in the hospital. It’s also helped her anxiety to the point where she’s been able to stop taking her anxiety meds. It helps her adhd tremendously, and even has helped her finally feel good enough to lose weight.

I’m asking on here for only positive experiences with Latuda any of you have had. I know people have had negative ones too but please don’t tell me about them. I’m just afraid and need to hear some positive experiences. I’ve been avoiding the medication route for years but I just have no other choice now. I’ve tried everything the natural way and it hasn’t worked. I’m afraid to have to depend on something to feel normal but I’d rather that than to feel like wanting to end my existence every day.

77,"its a long one but if anyone has time and is interested i am at a complete loss and i dont know how i'm supposed to be able to continue to keep my job and function and live a normal life when i have so much anxiety about driving and i can never seem to get from point a to point b without something fucked up happening. i dont even know if im posting this in the right thread.

&amp;#x200B;

i never considered myself a bad driver.. in fact.. i consider myself a very good driver.. the best of the best. i showed horses growing up so i can navigate a 2,000lb beast with my legs and a pair of reins in a 100x100 closure with 55 other beasts going 30mph in circles and over fences.... i'm 22 &amp; since last october i've been in a handful of car accidents.

&amp;#x200B;

first, i hit a deer. worst fuckin day of my life.. i love animals, and if i had time to stop i would've but i was going 50mph at 4am and he came at me on a diagonal and smashed my truck to bits (died on impact i think).. i cried in the street for a half hour before my boyfriend arrived and taped my headlight back in and we were able to get my truck a mile down the road to his house because i didnt want to deal with authorities i was a mess. good thing i got out of there and didnt call any cops because apparently the insurance for my truck was in my dads name at this time, i didnt know he was trying to save money because mine was already through the roof - i just knew what i paid him every month to pay the bill for me. now before anyone jumps down my neck for not knowing how my own insurance works at 22 - realize i live alone with my dad and he had done it for me up until this point and even after ASKING him to explain it to me and show me how to do it and understand it for myself, i got nothing. i just had to send him money every month to handle it and that was that. i know better now and i do all my own accounting and finances. anyhow i tried my best to handle the truck situation by myself so i filed an insurance claim a few hours later thinking i was doing the right thing. because my name wasnt on the policy, and i was the one filing a claim - they started inspecting the hell out of both me and my dad and saying that they wouldnt help us unless i got my own policy so we just had to drop the entire company completely because i cant afford to pay $500 a month in insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

my boyfriend helped me fix the truck so i was paying out of pocket for parts and maintenance and eventually a paint job.... the final part that my truck needed (this was around november/december) was a grill. i had been driving to work and back for about a week grill-less after not being able to drive it for a month or two.. i had been rely-ing on other people for rides or missing work entirely and pissing my bosses off. i didnt really have a choice but to take the truck to work... it drove fine, headlights worked - just missing a grill. well on my way home directly underneath a yellow light the person in front of me SLAMMED on their breaks, and in desperation to protect my front end and not rear end the idiot in front of me, i checked the lane next to me and NOBODY was in it - so i turned on my blinker and switched lanes but another woman in a truck was trying to shoot the gap that was there/the red light and i hit her. well, we hit each other but i was so hysterical by the time she called the cops that i ended up getting blamed. also, at this time i still didnt have insurance and was in the process of trying to find a new company - i just didnt know how the fuck it worked and im so busy day to day just trying to make my day job that i really didnt have time. so now im getting tickets for causing an accident, and not having insurance. which ended up being $300 total i think... then i got a letter in the mail saying i owed the department of treasury a separate $500 for not having insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

then a month or two later i spun out in the snow because i wasnt in 4wd because im am asshole and i could literally SEE my work so i didnt think i needed it but i did need it because i spun out straight into my work's driveway, split a tree in half, and then grand-theft-auto 360 spun right into the parking lot. didnt report that to insurance or the building because 1. i cant pay for the tree 2. i had my own insurance policy now for like a few weeks and i didnt want it to go up :(

&amp;#x200B;

i had to take my truck into a shop at this point, and i ""personally knew"" the guy that was working on my truck. he said bring 500 in cash and he'd give me a great deal, fix a bunch of the mechanical problems that i fucked up i just needed to give him two weeks. i cant even remember what i needed done, it had major alignment issues and a few other things but i was ecstatic about the deal. the guy's shop was called ""one man and a wrench"", so it was literally JUST him working up in this shop. 2 weeks go by, he hasnt started my truck. 4 weeks go by, he's so sorry, he's been so busy, but he still hasnt started. 5 weeks go by and now he wont answer my calls. 6 weeks go by and im fucking losing my mind bc nobody can get ahold of this mechanic and now theres neighbors answering the shop phones saying even THEY dont know where he is but everything will get handled, the family is getting involved, etc - what the fucK&gt;&gt;!?

&amp;#x200B;

two more weeks go by and the ""neighbors"" (aka the people who ended up acquiring the shop HMM) say they are working on my truck ""for free"" and still no word from the guy who took my cash. i ended up going to the fucking sheriff's office because that was the last of my money and now my vehicle is being held hostage potentially... even though that's the LAST place i wanted to be as i've had a lot of abusive encounters with ""officers of the law"", and i also had popped half a tab of acid earlier that day because i didnt plan on going to a fucking!police!station but my boyfriend (who was living in california at the time) was INSISTING i absolutely HAD to file a police report THAT day. so because i blindly and stupidly listen to everything he says, i went to file a report. and instead of helping me, the cop was trying to psychologically break me with intense eye contact the entire time because he could tell by my saucer sized pupils that something wasnt right but luckily i got out of there with a case number and directions on how to take that shit to civil court. oh, and when i mentioned my mechanic's name, he said ""oh yeah we know that guy. he's been found. thats all we can tell you"". like WHAT THE FUCK so if he's been FOUND how come i have NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON OVER THERE??? what a fucking shit show. the car ended up being fixed two weeks later and mechanic was back at the shop working the day after i took my ass all the way to the SHERIFFS OFFICE on LSD.

&amp;#x200B;

while all of this was happening my boyfriend had let me borrow one of his spare trucks and it BROKE DOWN on me in the middle of a major road on the way to work. no fucking clue what happened, the entire back end dropped and was dragging, granted the truck was older and purchased used so who knows what coudlve already been wrong with it but i think they told me it was the driveshaft or drive train or something that snapped? maybe? all i know is my bf said its typically user error so who fucking knows im probably just bad luck because i was being so careful with his truck its not even laughable. i was driving that truck like the tires were made of eggshells. at this point i had completely used up every last MILE for my allotted AAA towing lmao.. 

&amp;#x200B;

finally my truck is done at this nightmare mechanic's so i pick it up and on my way from the shop to my HOUSE i got rear ended at a red light by a kid in a jeep. i dont even want to elaborate on this situation because yet again, another shit show.

&amp;#x200B;

then two months later i tried to swerve and miss a SHARD OF CONCRETE that was in the road (on my way to work per usual, its the only place i go because i HAVE to go there) and i got a flat tire.

&amp;#x200B;

now before anyone tries to be a dick and suggests that i dont know how to drive a truck you can eat my actual ass because i taught myself how to drive a pickup truck when i was 16, i've been driving a pickup for years, i've never had this many problems with any other vehicle up until now. ever since i leased this truck a year ago, BAD shit has been happening to me and the truck since. i'm sorry this is so long winded and bless you if you're still even reading at this point. i spun out again today in the rain just trying to PASS someone going 10 under. i wasnt pulling any crazy stunts i literally just wanted to pass someone because i have my bosses texting me and rushing me, whining and bitching about ""ETA? you need to submit your time card!!"" on the one day i come into this stupid fucking job late in MONTHS because i've been sick all morning with lady pains. god forbid we get a slight drizzle here and everyone wants to go 10 under, i dont have time for it. but my dumb ass also didnt have time to remember to switch into 4wd so i almost swerved into oncoming traffic and ruined my life again but thankfully i didnt hurt anyone else or myself.

&amp;#x200B;

 i've been embarrassed and ashamed for this entire year. i have no patience left, though. everyone else on the road is either old as fuck and shouldn't BE driving AT ALL, or has their fucking nose in their phone, or is scared to drive (um ME too hun but that doesnt mean i go 15 under everywhere), or on fucking xanax and probably a myriad of others pills and their reaction times are just so fucking slow and their depth perceptions are so fucking POOR that every time i get on the road i am seething with anger because nobody else knows how to drive swiftly at the speed limit. everyone wants to go 5-15 under and they wanna bunch up and drive RIGHT next to each other and drive side by fuckin side, nobody wants to space themselves out diagonally in the lanes to give each other room. i am perfectly fucking fine on the road when nobody else is on it, but as soon as i am being boxed in and trapped by people who are swerving in their own lanes because THEY are struggling, it makes me struggle, and then i lose my cool for 3.5 seconds and then i cause HUGE fucking problems just trying to distance myself from other drivers. i cant handle it anymore. i dont want to drive. i try so hard to go out of my way to avoid these situations and only drive at certain times but i always seem to get caught up in bullshit somehow. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've gotten accustomed to waking up at 4am &amp; leaving for work 2-3 hours earlier than i need to every day just so i can drive before rush hour traffic starts. i get off work at 6pm and i sit there in the parking lot until at least 6:40 before driving home because i wait for traffic to die down. every day it gets worse. the area i live in is constantly under construction at all times of year. sink holes, shitty roads that they only ever manage to patch of half-ass until it breaks again the next year (but teh union unemployment rates are down, go u synder! gr8 strategy!) new installments everywhere. my neck of the woods used to be relatively peaceful but now theres a new school right by my house, brand new freshly cleared acres next to that school, new condos going up slightly farther down the road because they just cleared out even MORE acres of trees by the OTHER school (which is directly across from like 10 more condos and another school) all clusterfucked up between about 25 million plazas. i can never get anywhere in a timely manner, or peacefully without losing my temper at some idiot somewhere along the line in my commute directly west through suburbia-disturbia and even if i can manage to physically control myself and NOT drive like a dick or in a hurry so that i can put some space between me and everyone else - driving still makes me shake with anxiety and rage. and now im exhausted every day because i work 2 jobs and i spend a lot of hours just trying to avoid driving and bad driving experiences but i just cant because driving is a huge part of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

and i still have two crinkled fenders and a passenger door that needs to be bumped out and basically the body is really ugly and im so behind at this point i can barely even afford to fix it before it's time to turn it back in next july. i got 12k miles a year on this truck and it's only got 8k on it....

&amp;#x200B;

i'd honestly just go see a therapist about this one but i'll probably have a mental breakdown if i have to drive to one more appointment or pay one more copay. between the orthodontist, the vet, the first dr appointment i had in 5 years a few weeks ago that tried to charge me $300 for labwork even though i pay that much a month in health insurance, the grocery store/gas stations.. between my day job and my indoor garden and my 3 animals (plus the additional 3 in my house that arent mine) and everything in between i barely have time to eat, let alone consider a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

if anyone has any words of wisdom ill take them.  i feel like a raincloud follows me around everywhere i go and ive been working really hard to be calm and collected and patient and on top of my life like a good adult but i cant catch a break and if i cant catch a break then i'm going to eventually end up doing a backflip out of the bed of my truck and not landing it. everyone tells me that the truck is just cursed...

80,"I don’t know why I am posting, maybe it’s silly, maybe I am going crazy, but my mental health is breaking apart piece by piece.

On the surface my life is great, I’m 22, self-employed, get to travel the world and make a good living. It seems like I am living the dream of all milenials, but inside I am dying, everyday gets worse and I can’t cope.

I have aways been unstable but never showed it to anyone. I grew up alone with my mum, but since I was 12 she had cronic depression, we had no money and my family fought between themselves. I pretty much grew up alone from the age of 15, only seeing my mum on my drive to and from school and when collecting my meals to take to my room. I always scrubbed it under a rug and did my thing, managed to go to a top university and started my first company. But this year something changed.

I guess it started with the death of my grandmother to cancer, inheritance problems, my family being mentally broken and me being on my own, traveling, growing a business but alone not wanting to bother anyone with problems. I went from a happy, outgoing guy, that cared about his life, looks and health to a self-destroying wild card. I started partying a lot, taking party drugs, smoking, got a tattoo, a ton of one night stands, shaved my head, going into wild mode. I have my good days and weeks, where I work hard and laugh when I have friends over. But when I am alone I get depressed, get bad thoughts, sleep all the time and get sad. 

I don’t know how to get out of the spiral, success and money can’t but the satisfaction I seek. Social media likes don’t cut it, the pride of my family about me wont either, I just feel alone. Maybe I need a stable partner to help me stabilise? Or maybe a support group, I am considering moving to LA just to escape London but I don’t know. I went from a go getter to a crazy mess. 

I guess I just had to let it out to an anonymous audience. I don’t expect replies or anything, I just had to write it to confess to myself that I have problems that are worsening.

I just don’t know, sorry to bother you reddit",08Oct2018,1

I love anime manga and video games and would love to have someone to share these interests with. Id also be interested in someone with similar issues like health wise or ssi. Just so I can relate and not feel like a leech off someone who has a job. I dont want to bring anyone down.

 I met a guy online recently who is very nice. But I have many concerns which I dont want to say too much.. I havent met him in person. I get very depressed and stressed about some issues but dont want to say too much cause I dont feel like Ill ever find someone as nice. I have voiced concerns a few times but it just gets brushed off. Im not sure what to do as I like him a lot and I dont think anyone else would ever want me.  Ive always suffered from depression and anxiety and it really messes with my head. I only have 1 other friend with similar interests but i havent talked to them in a long time. I wish I had the life of other people who can go out with their friends to cosplay and game and have fun. 

Im just very depressed thinking about how boring my life is and how alone I feel. Im not sure if I should just be happy with what I have right now or try to find something that could make me happier thinking about the future. 

If anyone is on ssi and has a spouse - are they also disabled? are they okay with you not working and not being able to give financial support? did you settle?

83,"My sister's love affair with John Mayer began after she saw him live in concert in Vancouver about 10 years ago. She describes this event as a spiritual, transformative experience that redefined the course of her entire life. After the concert, she quit her fairly cushy marketing job and decided to pour all of her energy into becoming a photographer, writing, and shooting short films.   
  
My sister has always been a very fragile person, and about 11 years ago, she tried to take her life, so because of the timing I think discovering John Mayer represented something of a ""rebirth"" for her. She struggles with feelings of abandonment and seems to have something resembling borderline personality disorder.   
  
For the longest time we didn't realize the extent of her obsession with John Mayer, because she sort of kept it secret. We knew she was a huge fangirl who exclusively listened to John Mayer and wrote John Mayer fanfics. We knew she lived on rice and beans so that she could save up money to fly out to John Mayer concerts. We all teased her about it because no one else in my family cares for John Mayer, but at the same time we were happy she had found new meaning in life through him.  
  
However, during the last few years it started to become clear that this went way beyond simple infatuation. She started writing letters to John Mayer on her public blog in which she raved at length about his indescribable beauty and creative prowess (which would sound hilarious to me if this weren't such a serious situation). It became evident to us that she structured her entire life around John Mayer, dedicating poems and short stories and music videos to him. She wrote and published online a short story about a struggling artist who met a famous writer when he was on a book tour in her small mountain town, and they bonded through their shared appreciation for art and creativity and fell in love. This was very obviously about her and John Mayer and she made a video about the story that actually has pictures of her and of John Mayer as the protagonists.   
  
After a while, she began to claim in her blog that she spent hours a day talking to John Mayer on the phone. She talked about their huge plans for the future and the names of their future children. She wrote a long, ranty post in which she expressed concern that her maltipoo would not get along with John Mayer's labrador. Mayer is apparently very active on Twitter, or at least used to be, and she reads herself into every one of his posts.   
  
Earlier this year, she self-published and printed copies of a 500-page book which was largely composed of letters she had written to John Mayer and pictures she had taken for him. In the book, she talks about John Mayer almost as if he were a religious icon. It is truly mind-boggling and I was shocked to find out that my sister was capable of this level of insanity. But it is clear that she sees herself as in an intimate relationship with John Mayer, whom as far as we know she has never spoken to or met.   
  
At various points, we have tried to confront her about the whole thing and bring her back down to earth, but when we do so she completely breaks down screaming and crying. She doesn't understand (or does, but doesn't want to admit it) why we're suspicious that a famous musician who has flings with Jennifer Aniston and Katy Perry would be interested in an amateur photographer living in a one-horse town on the other side of the country.   
  
Now we're at the point where she isn't talking to any of us. However, I am still her friend on Facebook, and lately she has written a series of despondent posts about how John has been too busy lately to keep in touch with her and that she sees no reason to live if she can't talk to him every day.   
  
I am scared for her but I have no idea how to help. I know she needs professional help but I live in a different place and don't know how to get it to her. She does not respond to any of our calls, texts, Facebook messages, etc., and we don't really know anyone in the area that could go by and do occasional welfare checks. I imagine she has close to zero income so even if we convinced her to get help, it might be too costly for her. I'm just at a total loss for what to do. I know this all sounds far-fetched and I can provide some proof if necessary, but I'm hesitant to do so because I do not want my sister to face online harassment from strangers -- it would be too much for her. We are all in the US.           
  
EDIT: Another concern of ours is that she may actually be talking to someone who is masquerading as John Mayer and possibly scamming her for money or using her in some other way. 
    
  
--- 


**TL;DR** Sister's entire life revolves around John Mayer. She thinks she is in an intimate relationship with him but we are 99.9% that she has never met or spoken to him. Lately ""John Mayer"" has stopped talking to her and we're scared that she is on the brink of taking drastic actions. ",08Oct2018,1
84,"Hello

I don't know really how to start...
I had OCD since childhood and always had some kind of social anxiety. I've always preferred to be alone, avoided people and new situations because they've made me anxious.
I went through life avoiding things and living in my world up until college where it all broke down, the pressure got me, even though I completed the first semester I was sure that the school is too hard and left the school... I went to a psychiatrist at this time too and got diagnosed with OCD and social anxiety and prescribed SSRI medication.

I failed college again after that and now I'm trying again ( mostly because my mother wants me to have college ) but I'm still in great anxiety, every day, just the sight of other people on the street gives me anxiety and I'm losing motivation.
I lost many hobbies, have no motivation to study, I think about death every day.

I even had a job in the field that I study, the place was nice, the people there were very nice but even in that place I was anxious, uninterested in other people and after work I went straight to bed.
I can't imagine what the future will be, no matter where I am I feel anxious around people.
I am also getting angry in social situations, I will curse in my head, judge other people, etc.

I tried talking to my family but there is not really much they can do, they will get sad, tell me something comforting and that's it.
I tried talking to my psychiatrist, but it goes like ""it's just anxiety, hang on"" and get a prescription. It feels like as long as I don't try to commit suicide nothing is going to change.

I'd like to die but I'm too weak to do it myself... I stopped caring about my health.  Every day when I go to bed I wish not to wake up in the morning, just fall asleep forever.

My whole life is starting to feel like a prison. I'm too weak to commit suicide yet it seems like the only option.
I really have no reason to live when I think about it, what is the purpose of living a life where more than 50% of each day is filled with anxiety and it's just getting worse ?

I don't know what to do. Each day I'm getting more demotivated in living this life. ",08Oct2018,1

I've noticed that it actually makes my anxiety a lot worse and when something triggers my depression it seems to blow up pretty quickly.

86,"I'm on the cusp of ending my current, abusive relationship, and a friend and I have been talking about my next one. I ABSOLUTELY do not want to be in one for probably a year after this one (it's been so emotionally draining that I would not be the sort of person I would want to date in terms of my insecurities, and I need to re-discover myself as well before engaging romance again). My problem is that I'm always finding ""fixer-upper"" guys. I feel like people are conditioned to think they're ""Shallow"" or ""Picky""  or ""Judgmental"" when we pick up on mental health red flags and avoid people because of him. ""What if he's nice?"" ""What if you're missing out on your *soul mate?*"" But I've just been reading through articles on breakups and processing things and moving on when someone mentions the concept of the ""[Principal of Least Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_interest)"" -- basically the person that's the least interested in the relationship has all the power. EVERY ONE OF MY RELATIONSHIPS has resulted in me being the one that's more interested, and I've been abused the same way by every boyfriend. 

I've heard that you have to ""play hard to get"" and ""not make yourself available so fast"" to play into this very concept, and I fucking hate it. People have *hurt me* by doing this over and over and over again, and I don't want to do it to someone else in order for ME to get ahead. I am a very affectionate person, and definitely an ""Anxious Attachment"" type -- I want to be able to love someone unconditionally and for them to do the same to me.

90,"Ultimately to write about my struggles with anxiety and depression has been a long time coming.

Looking back on my whole life and seeing each instant where I have been labeled dramatic, drama queen, crazy, irrational, psychotic, out of control, etc. is very painful for me.

I guess to start I will try to describe what the different parts of my anxiety feel like. There are days where I wake up with a sick feeling in my stomach, feeling like something is wrong, without being able to put my finger on it, with seemingly no trigger. Sometimes there will be tears in my eyes during this and I don't know why they are there. There is an ever-present heavy feeling as though something is pressing on my chest, and a nauseous feeling. The one that you get when you've done something terribly wrong and dont know how to fix it. But in this case you don't know what you have done wrong so you don't know how to fix it. So you wrack your brain trying to pinpoint what is causing this pain. How can i cut this cycle NOW NOW NOW? I can't do this again, i cant feel this way again, i need to fix it, i need to fix it. 

In the beginning I was not cognizant enough of what was happening to do some meta thinking. Now i can stop and say “this is anxiety” and try to use various coping skills to move through it. This involves just getting up, trying to stay busy and forgive myself for having those feelings. Acknowledge them and then let them slide. But those feelings are fucking adamant. So maybe i have pushed them to the back of my mind for a few hours and gone on with my day. At this point no one has noticed anything differently about me. I am still smiling and interacting, however I may not be a bubbly and jokey as normal. 

Then one of two things happens. I either attach my anxiety to something where it can be released, so that it has meaning. This might mean that i start an argument with someone for no reason, or take something small and use it to release all of my anxiety. This way the anxious feelings can have a purpose and a name. They can run themselves out and be gone and I can be released from their grip for a time.

OR I have pushed those negative thoughts deep down inside and used alllll my coping skills to get through that moment. And i am fine. I am happy, i believe all of the positive thoughts that I have about myself and i continue to try to grow this part of my feelings.

I go on with my days, things are fine. I have occasional anxious thoughts throughout the day that i have learned to brush off. But where do they go? I think they build but I am not sure.

One day, Ryan doesn't text me back for 6 hours when he normally texts me back immediately and I get the instinctive “worst case scenario” thoughts that he decided I’m awful or whatever and am able to squash them and am fine, just slightly more on edge until i hear from him and confirm it was accidental.

The next day, Sarah doesn’t text me back and my immediate thought  it “oh shit what did i do? Why is she mad at me?” depending on my state of mind i either let these hit me and slide off OR they stick and circulate circulate and grow in my head until i need to do something about them.  Now, if i have let these thoughts circulate enough in my head, i end up believing them. I try to talk myself out of them. “No, no, she is busy. How many times have you read a text and forgotten to respond? Or hell maybe she even thought it was a stupid text and didn't think it needed a response. Nothing you have done would make her stop wanting to be friends.” - but how do i PROVE this? I need to see, to feel, to hear PROOF. Because i don't know what is real. 

I start the big, deep anxiety starting to form. Frantic thoughts. Strong thoughts. Powerful thoughts. I have these thoughts and feelings simultaneously with the logical thoughts that this is just anxiety lying to me. Nevertheless, I BELIEVE she hates me, I BELIEVE she will never talk to me again. I am not worth it, why would anyone continue to put up with my shit? After all this time, i wouldn't want to be around me either. I try to do all my coping shit but i can't get the thoughts under control i cant calm them down because i truly don't know what to believe. I HAVE TO FIX IT NOW. 

So i ask her what is wrong and she says nothing. That can't be true, my anxiety has told me that EVERYTHING is wrong. So it builds and i push and i push and i push no matter what she says because i need relief of this pressure in my head and i need answers as to why this pain is so heavy and powerful. I PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH her.  I am crying and pacing and digging my fingernails into my hands. She tells me she can't talk right now but she can call in 30 minutes, no she is not mad, everything is okay, she will call me in 30 minutes.  I am instantly calmer. She cares. I have proof I am not alone. If she is willing to care then I must be worth at least that. That is a true fact i can hold on to and reassure myself of so I try to believe it and do my breathing.

31 minutes go by and i assume she won't call me , i fucked up, i dug this fucking hole that i can't fix and i always this and why do i always ruin everything and i'm making an ass of myself again. Then she calls. And I am so stupid, why did 30 minutes have to mean EXACTLY 30 minutes? That's ridiculous.  She speaks to me in a calm voice, she tells me what is true, she tells me no one hates me, she tells me people care about me, she tells me to breathe and that everything is okay, she is patient and tells me she thought she responded to the text and laughs it off. She is so genuine and caring and patient that I know it is the truth. I breathe, I apologize for the thousandth time. How many times have we done this? I assure her I am still getting help. 

Before hanging up I ask her if she can text me because I know that I am humiliated and now convinced that that was all the last straw and that she will hang up and decide i am too much and not worth this shit. She says of course.

Over the next chunk of time, i text her small things, demanding her help and to reassure me of things, feeling the guilt sitting heavy in my gut and the gratitude pouring out of me.

The thing is, I see the world through the veil of my anxiety and depression. But when I am thinking it and when I am in those poisonous thoughts, it feels as though I have pulled the veil off the world and am viewing it for what it really is. 

I try to convince myself that this is not true, BUT HOW DO I KNOW? I need someone to ground me, reassure me, comfort me.

But who the fuck am i to ask that of someone?

Do I see how selfish this is? More than anything. 

I hate myself for it - but I am trying to learn not to.

I have never wanted this. I would never wish this on anyone. I would do anything to rid myself of this. There have been so many times in my life where I have felt guilty for getting close to someone because they would have to “deal with me”.

I am doing much better now than I ever did when this all began, or at least when it got serious.

I used to have full panic attacks multiple times a day to the point where I failed a class my Freshman year of college. Now I am medicated (again), going to therapy (again), I can recognize a lot of what is going on with my mental health but the struggle daily. And currently going through a breakup with an amazing man and an amazing friend because he does not think he has the emotional capacity to help me.

97,"Hi all! Last week I returned to work after a month off due to MH problems but I'm struggling to find my feet again.
I'm not really posing any questions here, more so just getting feelings off my chest.

Background: I work in a call centre, stress comes with the job - anyone who's worked in a call centre knows how it goes.
The company I work for are incredibly supportive of me and my problems, I'm very honest and open with my MH and I'm allowed extra breaks/absence isnt taken into account etc..
I love my job, I love my colleagues and I wasn't expecting to hit the ground running when I came back at all. We have the option of doing paper work as well as phone work so thats what I did last week to adjust to the environment.

Today I was due to work a 12-8 shift, I took my first call since coming back and it was only a transfer to another department, easy peasy. The call went perfectly but as soon as it was over the panic set in and I just couldnt focus.
When I panic I get amnesia and a really bad stammer which frustrates and upsets me even more. I spent an hour sat in a 'quiet room' with a  team manager and my department manager calming down and getting help.

I feel really angry and frustrated with myself for not being able to do something I'm so used to.
It's never been this bad before and I just feel so guilty for not being able to do my job properly.",08Oct2018,1
98,"I don't know if this is the right sub, but I wanted to ask about some bizarre feelings that've been developing with me. I'm pretty badly depressed so maybe it's related? Also, I'm fairly certain I have some degree of Bipolar disorder.

I have this weird revulsion towards being a human being. I feel ashamed and embarrassed about normal human things, and knowing that I am a human being. I hate that I am made of biological stuff (Skin, meat, veins, blood), I feel like it's shoddy and badly put together. I feel horribly embarrassed that I have normal human functions (Going to the bathroom, eating, etc.), and other things. I found out the other day that I talk in my sleep a lot, and it made me feel so horribly ashamed. I feel like being a person makes me so horribly deficient and awful.

It's not even feeling bad about myself... I feel like my mind is fine, I just feel like I'm trapped in an inefficient, dirty vessel. This makes me feel ashamed to talk with and associate with real people, like I shouldn't be interacting with something that I feel that way about. I know this is entirely illogical, I don't hate people, I don't dislike people, I have consistently been a very compassionate and loving person my whole life, I don't know why I feel this way. I hate my quirks like the one I mentioned before, I hate the little flaws that come with being a human, I hate it because I feel like it's a result that I'm a poorly made species, and I shouldn't be this way, if only I wasn't stuck like this.

I don't know why I feel this way. I really want it to stop but since it's wormed its way into my mind, I can't help but feel that way. I want it to stop. Is this an established thing? Is there a name for this? Thank you in advanced for any answers.

99,"every mental health person in my life has now said the same thing to me.

* my therapist just told me my case is complicated.
* my substitute therapist said my case is complex.
* my psychiatrist said my case is complex

i know my therapist and psychiatrist have diagnosed ptsd but no one has used the phrase “complex ptsd.” i don’t know if that’s what they mean. if that’s what they mean i want them to say it outright. but it could mean something else, or something else to each one of them.

also afaik none of these people have spoken to each other and have told me this independently. i don’t know how to understand this. when i asked my therapist what he meant, he said something like “it will take a long time...” so that wasn't super specific.

how would you interpret this statement that i am “complicated” or “complex”? have you been told this by a therapist? i mean, i guess i could just take it at face value as the basic definition, but because it was in reference to my brain and its dysfunction i am overanalyzing it and wondering if i will ever really truly make it out of this mess.",08Oct2018,1

I’m a teenager and felt like it was just kinda hormones or something but this year it was worse than last year, not really looking forward to anything not wanting to meet friends and do stuff. So I decided I’d tell my Mum and go to the doctor. I got an appointment before school and explained what I had been feeling and he said that he didn’t think I had it. He took blood and nothing unusual came back, I wasn’t low on iron like he had guessed.  I know he is qualified but before when I wanted to go on the pill he said I am healthy enough but let his personal opinion into the conversation and told me that I was too young, I explained that it wasn’t for sex it was for my period.

I asked Mum when we left that morning why he knew I didn’t have it and she said “he’s known you since you were a little girl, he knows what your personality is like.” That I wouldn’t be one to be depressed, (that’s her thoughts) I don’t know what to do, I mean he could be right, but I just feel like I need a second opinion which my Mum doesn’t see a point in doing, it also could just be winter blues but it has a pattern and really affects me in school.",08Oct2018,1

104,"I've dealt with depression and anxiety for a little over than six years. Its been a roller coaster. I graduated undergraduate, got a job, graduated grad school, and started a new job throughput this. My new job started in February. I love the work but not the environment - had no idea how much OT I would be expected to do or that I'd be expected to log on for hours after the workday. 

Then some changes came about (ie personnel) and the stress has been too much. It had almost been a year since I cut and I started cutting again. I became more depressed and anxious than I had been in years. Horrible combination when both are high. I either wasnt sleeping or sleeping too much. Stopped working out or really doing much of anything like writing because I was so drained after work. 

I was crying every day at work and having anxiety attacks. Eventually I had a full panic attack and was able to talk to employee assistance and between eap and my pcp it was decided I should take time off on short term disability. I see a therapist Thursday and I'm trying to get into a psychiatrist. 

I just feel guilty leaving my team and feel like I should be canceling anything fun I have planned. Like I have two college football games to go to this month and a couple Halloween parties. My days are primarily gonna be spent trying to get better self care habits (meditation, yoga, running, therapy) but I'm looking for other ideas too
