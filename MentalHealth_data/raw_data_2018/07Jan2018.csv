2,I have had mental health issues for a while. Been taking meds and going to therapy for years. But it just hit that I’m ill and it will never change. Also I thought it’s ok to be depressed everyone gets depressed it’s a chemical imbalance. But I have mental illnesses and personality disorders. And personality disorders can’t be cured at least without meds. I’m devastated. ,07Jan2018,2,
3,"Does anyone else ever feel a lack of interest in almost everything? Not depressed or anything like that, just bored and lacking a strong resolve to do anything.

5,"First time posting here, and using mobile so excuse my formatting.

So this happened a couple hours ago, but i get these once every few months.

I was at my sisters house dropping off some money for the car i bought from her, but as soon as i started knocking on the door, i got an extreme sensation of deja vu, like, everything i saw and heard i could swear on my life had happened before, but it was also like i was seeing in third person, and everything sounded distant.
Afterwords everything just felt off, and i felt intensely sick to my stomach, on the verge of throwing up, and i just felt wrong in my body, and any memoies i thought of felt almost like they weren't mine.

Its a couple hours later and i feel perfectly fine now, but i get these every couple months, with varying degrees of intensity.

I remember one from highschool, i was doing a math problem and i kinda got stuck in my head doing it over and over and over, until i felt really sick, and when it was over i looked around at my friends, and i knew them and had all my memories of them, but they felt like strangers and like i didn't know them.

Im 22 years old, in reasonably good health, and i have no history of any mental conditions, never had anxiety or panic issues, very stable moods, very calm kind of person, these events are the only things that kinda freak me out about my mental health, but they are very infrequent, always go away after a couple hours, and the only comments on my change in behavior during them is being quieter and looking confused.

Sorry for the wall of text, but can anyone help identify what this might be, and if i need to see someone about it?

Posted in /r/anxiety but didn’t get much response.

Tl;Dr - how to I support and help myself while being supportive of a wife with high anxiety.

Been having trouble figuring out who to talk to and figured anonymously on the Internet is as good a place as any.   

My wife goes through various ebbing and flowing of anxiety and has been doing really solid for a long while but I must have forgotten how bad her anxiety can be.  During the week we spend time apart because she is in school and I work and then we make the most of our time together on the weekend.  Its been stressful on the relationship but we’ve been doing it a few years and only have a semester left.

This past few weeks I’ve had some rough stuff going on in my life and it’s coincided with my wife’s high anxiety.  I’ve been feeling really alone and unable to lean on my wife.  I’ve always tried to do what I can to help my wife when her anxiety gets bad but I’ve realized that when I do, I do it at the cost of my own sanity.  

So I’m here asking for advice and also some words of support...

10,"Hello everyone,
I decided to write this here, since I feel like a lot of you have probably experienced something similar to this, and can give advice from experience. 

I have been dating my current boyfriend for going on 5 years, (and I’m 4 months from turning 18 years old). Both of us, for the most part, are pretty mature for our age. And please, please don’t say “just break up” because we’re young right off the bat, treat it as you would a friend looking for advice. Anyways, I will be living  on my own for the first time in April, and for the past 4 and a half years, have planned on my boyfriend to be there with me. We’ve been compatible for quite a while, but recently we’ve been experiencing hiccups in our relationship (due to being young and trying to figure ourselves out.) We’re both experiencing depression, and I’m experiencing anxiety, too. The prescriptions I’ve gotten have not helped, so I’ve resorted to the good ol self help books and willpower to be happy and better myself, which obviously without professional help, can only get you so far. The problem is that there are certain things that he does that act almost as a trigger for me, because we’ve argued about them so often. For example, he smokes weed because he swears up and down that it helps him. I’ve done the same in the past couple of years, but have recently kicked the habit because I wanted my recovery process to be authentic and from me, not a substance. Well, he has a problematic mindset when it comes to smoking weed, (and any other thing that he wants to do that is not necessarily good to do) where no matter how calmly I address the matter to him, he refuses to see my point of view when I try SO HARD to see his. 
It hasn’t always been like this, though. But with time, more harsh things have been said during arguments, and now it’s almost emotionally abusive. I want to fix things so bad, but I feel like he doesn’t respect my opinions and concerns like a good partner should. All of my concerns are very valid and reasonable. But he almost looks at me like a self-righteous, goody-goody person because I decided not to continue down the drug induced depression path like the rest of my friends. This includes acid, coke, mushrooms, NOT just weed. 

This is not just some middle school romance, I actually do love my boyfriend and want it to work out. I would probably walk away from him if he had always been like this, but I know this isn’t him. 

I’m sure someone will comment and say just let him smoke if it makes him feel better, but the issue with that is he’s lost a job from failing a drug test and got kicked out of his house for smoking weed and STILL thinks he doesn’t have an issue and in my opinion, if you’re willing to lose everything for a substance, no matter what it is, then it might as well be treated as an addiction.

11,"oof, where to start off. I got an appointment with a psych recently, my first one ever. However, I seem to have encountered a dilemma. When I was a child, my mom was an alcoholic and opioid addict. Under the use of these things, she often verbally and mentally abused me. She only ever got physical with me once, and after she realized what she did, she checked herself into rehab and has been clean ever since. In the time since, our relationship has healed and I have forgiven her. Sadly, I recently have been experiencing flashbacks of these incidents, and it has been causing a huge mental strain on me. I've told my mother about this, and she was the one to get me the appointment. My issue is that I'd like to tell the psych about this, but I fear he may contact CPS or something, since I am only 15 and I still live with my mother. I don't want to create any issues, and the last thing I want is to be taken away from my home, but I don't think I could honestly continue on with whatever the fuck is making me feel like this. idk. any advise is very much appreciated. &lt;3",07Jan2018,2,
12,"I had something's that are very important to say to my friend. It was things that I had been very carefully analyzing all day. They included life values, and plans for the future. As well as important questions. However, by the time it got dark, my brain had mostly forgotten what I needed to say to her and only a few things stuck. I was left sounding heartless and emotionless about an important to me topic! Barely achieving anything at all.
~~

Shouldn't the brain automatically keep track at all times of what I need to tell to someone? Or at least be able to automatically TAP INTO that information at will? Cause ""that information"", for me, it's just been disappearing. I remember back in the day I used to be able to remember exactly what I needed to tell someone. But now, I've definitely thought about it, but I just can't remember it!!

This morning it was so bad I had wrote the letter ""M"" for Memory on my hand. Anything I kept thinking of, just instantly disappeared. I literally couldn't remember what I had thought of just seconds beforehand. The brain processes something, but then it... kinda let's go of it as well. It has been like this for about a few months where it noticeably bugs me.

Could this be a side effect of my dose of Effexor being too low? (I'm at 150mg but I've been taking 20 pegs out) I've been reading of some side effects of too low dose- and maybe I need the full 150 or more. (but then I get other side effects)

Or just that the Effexor has ""pooped out"" and stopped working and now just produces this cognitive memory side effect? Like literally everything else is FINE, I don't get any other noticeable side effect (except for some just mental fatigue, and poor attention span, that I've been fixing with some Modafinil), just this CRAZY Memory issue that I've been having for ever now. And it's bugged me sooo much now, and I feel sooo much like a vegetable and a robot, that I decided to finally come clean, and post about it on here..

This has been happening to me over and over and over again, where I need to tell a person something, and it's crisp and clear in my head, but by the time it actually happens, I go blank and there is barely any emotion in my voice about a topic that had been so important to me a few hours ago! It's such a strange, un-human phenomenon. It both scares me, and I've been countlessly trying to find a solution but I can't seem to find one (my #1 clue is that it's the Effexor causing this- but it's been SO hard to come off it or to switch, so I've just been trying to fix it, but to no avail. I say ""Effexor"" because I'm not saying my memory has been amazing in the past- but I was definitely able to keep up day to day, and wasn't feeling this ""chemical"" sensation of something constantly causing my brain harm! That's how I feel now- this constant ""buzzines"", like something is definitely not right! I've been plagued with a terrible memory now...) If I didn't make a note of THIS situation too, I wouldn't forgotten about it as well. (or, just the examples. I'm sure there's many more that I've forgotten about!)

When I am doing my own research as well, I'll have memorized something (that I need to tell my Psychiatrist for example) but when I get to the appointment: complete brain fart. Forgot everything that is important in my life. it's like nothing even matters to me! It's been like this EVERY DAY for about 3 months now... 

Each day that goes by like this, I am living in HELL, disappointing my friends and family!! forgetting literally everything I had been thinking about in a constant centrifuge! I am not exaggerating it's that bad. 

Shouldn't it be normal for a person to have some sort of, vivid recollection of their memories, values, etc? That's how it was back in the day for me anyway! I think? A person should have a head on their shoulders and remember about the things that bother them- and those that don't- remember what they need to tell different people in their life! But it all goes in this ""whoooooosh"" spiral, and I can't find answers to it!

Sometimes I'll forget about forgetting something, that's how bad it's become. My memory is just SO messed up. I keep telling myself this, and then I forget about it, and I feel ""fine""... cause the Anti Depressant always makes you feel ""just fine""...

I just want to know what it's like for NORMAL people to remember something. And idk if it's just my ADHD that's gotten so much worse, or if it's the Effexor causing this side effect where the brain doesn't remember anything and goes in a centrifuge. But something has seriously been wrong with my ability to recall important facts to me- and I am praying that I will get help with this phenomenon!

14,"Okay so fair warning before I type for who knows how long. I've posted about this problem before and all I get are people telling me I need to see a professional and while I understand why they want me to, that's not going to happen. I don't want to get into that right now and it's been suggested a million times so if you're thinking about commenting that, just don't and go comment on someone's post with depression or whatever. I don't want random people who don't understand what I'm going through trying to help because it's not going to.


If I seem a little on edge it's because I am, and I really don't want fake ""sympathy"". Also another stupid warning before I get into my problem, I'm not going to hurt anybody and I'm not going to hurt myself I just want to know if there's anyone out there going through what I am. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one with this problem, but I know I can't be the only one because it's not something you would EVER tell anybody, not even your closest friend.


So finally getting into it, sometimes I think about killing people. Well sometimes is an understatement, it's been piping up a lot more these few months. It first showed up in middle school, when I discovered it was a possibility via the internet. I was raised seriously religious, so death was never real to me in the first place, and when I renounced my religion it became enticing. I liked thinking about how they don't exist anymore. I liked thinking that they were in so much pain, but then they didn't feel anything at all, ever again. I'm not saying it's religion's fault, but I feel like a thousand tiny things caused me to be what I am, religion included. I would(N'T)* (jesus fuck that typo) kill anyone, but at the same time, I wonder if a lot of killers thought that before they actually did something. I wouldn't know, because I can't talk to anyone else like me. It's just people afraid of me, or what I might do. I can't say fucking anything to anybody or else they'll create a mental image of every single fucking piece of who I am as a person before they really get to know what I'm thinking and feeling.

Before being diagnosed, i was dealing with the symptoms on my own trying things like meditation, yoga, exercise, changing my diet, reevaluating my life, etc. Since being diagnosed, went to regular therapy sessions for several months and I still felt like nothing was really helping me. My doctor prescribed me Prozac, but I'm uncomfortable trying out the antidepressants because of their side effects and history. My boyfriend is also against them. However, I'm running out of options. I was wondering if Marijuana would be a better option for me than the medication. What are your thoughts? Have you tried both? Which one works better for you?

I'm considering switching therapists and wanted to get opinions on this.

 So growing up I've dealt with depression, anxiety and even ptsd from past abuse. I've never experienced anything like the following before until I hit 20. (Currently 20 rn)
I recently (not the first but the most troubling) had an incident where I was going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. So in order to not wake up my roommate I tried turning the door knobs as I closed them. But I felt really strange. It was like I couldn't close the doors, I couldn't tell if it was closed or it was hovering back and forth between cracked a bit and closed. They felt heavy but very light at the same time. If that makes any sense at all. As I walked it felt like I wasn't walking and that I didn't know where I was walking to. Like I had no control of where I was going. Even though I definitely knew I was headed to the bathroom.
I've been having these weird thought processes too. Like I keep asking myself if my friends are actually here or am I just talking to myself. When I'm out in public with my friends I wonder if everyone is looking at me because they think I'm talking to myself. Questioning whether things are actually happening or not. 
Sometimes I feel like people are watching me. drugs make it worse, alcohol and weed as well.
I'll be in the bathroom and suddenly feel like someone is there with me. I don't feel scared though. Its kinda like that feeling you get when someone walks in on you in the bathroom only its over and over again. 
I'll be in the car with my friend and red lights and such move around. Not all crazy like but they'll be in a different spot for a second then I'll blink and it'll be gone.
I sometimes pinch myself to make sure I'm still awake/in reality. I want to be normal but this doesn't feel normal tbh. 
I feel like everyone knows whats wrong with me except for myself. Like they talk about my issues, I know they don't but it just feels like they discuss me.

31,"tl;dr - recurring depression, having a hope that it's not coming back has kept me going in the past but now I don't know if it's possible anymore

Basically, I've had depression as long as I know, I started getting treatment about 5 years back. Antidepressants worked wonders for me, I remember the first time they started working that I hadn't even known before it was possible to feel this good. I had my first treatment about 2 years and then for about a year, I didn't have to take them (and felt even better).

I started doing everything I knew was scientifically proven to reduce depression - working out, eating normally, cognitive behavioural therapy, sleeping enough, worrying less etc etc. And I started them gradually and tried to enjoy life and not being too harsh on myself.

Yada yada, time went past, about a year ago I had a drawback, so I started taking medication again which didn't work as well as last time and about 2 months later my psychiatrist added another drug to the mix.

So I think I've been getting worse for the past month (I usually don't notice before it's really bad), I feel like I'm living in a foggy glass box (thinking about metaphors how to describe other people what I'm feeling - another good one, I think, is that living is like constantly having to eat dried out bread without a glass of water - sure it gives you calories, but at first you don't enjoy it and after about 2 weeks it gets really really hard having to take another bite).

So right now I'm trying just to stay alive for the sake of those around me, and looking for the hope that would keep me going.

If anyone has a positive example of getting better and could give me hope, I would be enormously grateful.

I have noticed this phenomenon where I get crowded by these emotions which affect my day to day actions negatively and I struggle to act wisely or at proficient level but I for some reason can't let it slide I feel it is necessary to find the right method on how to carry out such interactions. 

These emotions get stronger and stronger as the day goes by and my actions become more and more negative I am only saying it very roughly I have yet to actually realize that this is what actually happens. Anyway my only worry is how to prevent disturbing myself so much that I get affected by others and start acting on there behalf rather than have my own thought.

37,"Direct or ""correct,"" a lot of people tell me this in one way or another. Strangers, family, friends, most of them have told me in one way or another that I can be a real jerk, and... they're not wrong.

I mean, at times, I know that I'm able to quietly deny that to myself, but it's true. And if I need confirmation, I rely on a quote from the Horn family: ""If one person calls you a Hutt, ignore them. If a second person calls you a Hutt, begin to wonder. If a third person calls you a Hutt, buy a drool bucket and stock in spice.""

In some respects, it has served me very well, this biting anger. The ability to be a bitch when I need to be is something that has gotten me jobs and has let me complete ""impossible"" projects at some of those jobs. It helps me to be a bloodhound with the tenacity to follow through without ever backing down or being shied away by ""social norms.""

In that respect, it's what some in the mental health industry refer to as ""loyal soldiers."" There are various origin stories for the term, but the leading one seems to tie in to Japanese warriors, and, effectively knowing when ""the war is over,"" going back from being a soldier to being a member of society.

Unfortunately, I never learned to shut that off. I'm certain it comes from being a child abuse survivor, going from living with an abusive and mentally unstable parent, to living with an emotionally manipulative and abusive step parent, to being in schools with bullies and jerks who loved to pick on me. Almost 20 years of direct abuse has a way of giving one some toxic coping skills. Worse, it has taught me how to be that manipulative and at times, emotionally caustic.

Right now, I'm also trapped in a toxic job that keeps these tendencies sharp, too, and then it feeds back into itself - and it seems like the modern corporate world is strongly conducive to that behavior. Yes, I need to get into a new job for starters, but I'm so emotionally drained every day, it's almost impossible to do that.

I'd been in therapy for five years, and the only therapist who ever REALLY worked for me left the country after about a year. (Insert joke about being that bad of a client.) I was also on meds for about that period, and while they let me get better control of depression and thoughts that just left me circling the drain, they seemed to do nothing for this aggression and anger.

So, what I'm indirectly asking is how I can start dealing with this - tips to be mindful of who and how I'm being, and how not to engage with the toxicity at my job. I need to get myself in order emotionally so I can try to get the rest of my life in order, too.",07Jan2018,1,

I have an all-or-nothing mentality and if this anhedonia does not go away completely and I am not my old self again then I do not see the point in living my life. No amount of therapy will get me to change this. My issue is purely chemical induced. So as somebody who has lived their entire life up to this point without anhedonia, I do not want to learn to cope with a horrible disorder like this. Sorry. ",07Jan2018,1,
41,"Hey y’all, sooo although I’ve never been clinically diagnosed, I’m like 99% sure I struggle with some sort of Anxiety Disorder and have been struggling for a long long time. 

One of the ways that I have learned to cope with my anxiety is by digging my nails into my skin - either my wrists/arms, or the back of my neck/upper back. 

I don’t love doing this because it basically leaves my skin pretty raw for the next few days (esp if it’s really bad) but it’s one of the only things that really make me feel under control. That being said, I still want to stop doing it. 

Does anyone else do this? If so, have you found another less harmful way to cope when Anxiety starts to creep in? 

Thanks in advance!! Love to all. ",07Jan2018,2,

It's fun to write things down like this, but I'll have trouble looking back and seeing when what happened, and how long it lasted. Like an odd symptom, a doctor's visit, results, diagnosis.

45,"Hey guys, so I've just been thinking a lot about what I should go about with my mental health now that I have health insurance.

I'm a 21 year old male, 135lbs 5'9

Let's just say, I don't THINK I am depressed. I have suffered from depression in the past - but I don't believe that is the root of my mental health.

All my life, I've been extremely hyperactive and anxious. Since a young kid I have had an extremely hard time focusing on tasks - I leave a lot of stuff undone, I get distracted very easily, and my mind is always going 100mph. I could say it's ADHD (though I've never been diagnosed), but this really was the root of my mental health issues throughout my teenage years. My thoughts would just bounce from one thing to another.

An example - I would be at school, I could focus on the class work for two minutes, then I hear someone flicking their pencil on their desk, I analyze and hyperfocus on that for 5 minutes, I then hear and see a cool bird in a tree outside - I hyperfocus on that, next thing I know class is over and I didn't get any school work done, all my work is unorganized, etc... I got awful grades all throughout school.

Around 12 years old I started getting severe panic attacks - because these jumbled thoughts and not being able to focus/calm down on individual thoughts started to turn into negative thoughts. For instance, I would hyperfocus on my breathing patterns, then I would hyperfocus on reality. My thoughts would scatter from thought to thought to the point where I would have a full blown panic attack and disassociate. This went on for about two years, then I learned to cope with it and eventually it just went away.

But the ADHD like tendencies never went away. In High School I then started to get depressed, I believe, from my ADHD/social anxiety. I couldn't do good in school, I was terrible with social situations, I was shy, I couldn't focus on conversations cuz my mind would be elsewhere.

At 18, I got 51/50'd for trying to overdose on Ibuprofen (I know, lmao... Should've done my research first cuz all I got was an upset stomach). This suicide attempt was because my girlfriend left me for another guy at the time, and she was really the only person keeping me stable. The only one that made me feel good about myself, and made me feel like I wasn't messed up mentally.

I got prescribed Zoloft for my depression at the hospital, and took it when I got dishcarged for two weeks. Worst feeling ever. I cut them cold turkey. I would have muscle twitches, disassociate panic attacks, vivid dreams, couldn't eat, it was absolutely terrible. I felt my personality changing. I then came to the conclusion I would never, ever take antidepressants again. I can't go through that experience, I don't care how depressed I am.

At 20, I started the use of cocaine when it got introduced from one of my friends. This almost seemed like my medicine (in a delusional sense). It helped me focus... It made me feel productive... I could now get tasks done... But I was naive, and really didn't know much about the drug. I used pretty heavily for 5 months believing this was helping my ADHD like symptoms, little did I know, it just wasted all my money and left me cranky when I was coming down and messed with my sleep patterns...

Now - lastly, about 3 weeks ago I tried crystal meth for the first type (snorted), which this I KNEW my purpose of using it. I figured, if I have had ADHD like symptoms all my life, and I can't get a script because I have health insurance for any medication for ADHD, this has some of the same properties as Adderall etc. Now I didn't dose this correctly at all... I did it for about 3 days dosing way too much (0.3-0.4g a day) and I barely slept and barely ate, and had to go to the hospital because I legit was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack...

Now, I have health insurance. And I know for a fact my drug history (which they KNOW about) is gonna affect psychiatric prescriptions. I really want to try to get a script for Vyvanse or Adderall, because I have tried both (XRs), and they helped me so much... I had NO anxiety, I focused, I prioritized, I was extremely productive. It's like I was getting everything I needed to get done, done. And it felt great. It made me feel like I found the cure to my mental state.

I never abused them, I knew how to dose these. And I treated them like an actual medicine when using them. I have never had anything help or work as well, medicinally, as these... 

Now - my question is; if I go and see a doctor and elaborate on basically everything I said right here ^^^ and give them a clear thesis of my past and my drug use, do you think I could possibly get a diagnosis for ADHD, and get prescribed the medication that could help me?

Or do you think my history of cocaine abuse / the time I did crystal meth and got hospitalized just blew my shots at getting medicated any kind of med in that category? They ARE on my health records.

Thank you guys - any advice helps a bunch... I live in California by the way and have Medi-Cal insurance (the free insurance for poor people like myself lol)

47,"Hi everyone.  I am hoping someone will have suggestions for subreddits or online support groups for adults who were parentified as children.

I have suffered from depression and anxiety as long as I can remember.  I stumbled onto a term that has switched on a huge light bulb in my mind.  The parentified child.  I read more into it and I am the poster child for this disorder.  I contacted some of my oldest friends (one who has a BS in Psychology) and they said that my picture would be next to the definition.

I was parentified at age 11 after my mother became life-threateningly ill.  My dad couldn't cope and emotionally collapsed, and as the eldest, I stepped up.  That has continued to be my life for the next 29 years up to today.  

I've just begun therapy because I am having suicidal ideation and have only had 2 appointments so far.  I am trying to find a support page for those like me as I work through recovery.  I have some huge changes on the horizon in terms of how I see myself, my roll in live in recovery, and how to live for myself.  I would like to connect with those on the same road.

My parents weren't addicts or narcassists, are/were aware of how screwed up it is, and feels/felt incredible remorse for how it happened, so I'm not sure if I would be welcome or relevant in /r/raisedbynarcissists.  

Does anyone have ideas?  Thank you so much.",07Jan2018,3,
48,"We met online through and app and started off really strong, with a great connection, etc. talking for a month straight. We met in person and got pizza, talked, hugged, nothing more than that. Afterwards we continued speaking for a week and he started to get flaky on me. He blamed it on his mental health (depression). We would often speak for a day and he would just leave in the middle of a good conversation, or it would go on for two or three days before happening. I was the one who always reached back out. We admitted we had feelings for each other and he was ready to take a step into working to get to know each other better but he disappeared for a month after telling me all that stuff. He would ignore me completely during this time, not even reading my messages or interacting with me on social media when I reached out, even though he would sometimes post his own stuff. 

I finally got him to talk to me and he said he is suffering a loss right now and feels very numb, it happened shortly after we saw each other in person. He said he was ready to start to try and form a stronger relationship with me but now he doesn't even know what he wants right now. I asked him if he wanted to meet me at a coffee shop the other day because I was with some friends in his town, and he played along all day like he was going to show up, but he ended up just ignoring my messages when the time came around.

I know depression is serious and different for everybody, but I'm really struggling between continuing to reach out and just giving up completely because being ignored makes it feel like he doesn't want anything to do with me despite what he told me (which is, that he cares but is just scared and numb, lost, etc.). He is also active on social media and I know that's an easy way to release dopamine and everything, but I still feel ignored. I've talked to him about this and I even straight up told him to tell me if he wanted to be friends or not but he kind of just pins everything back to his recent loss and feelings. In his messages, he sounds extremely ashamed and sorry for what he has been doing, and he acknowledges that I'm a very sweet and caring person, but it's him that's dealing with trauma. I also told him multiple times that I'm here, etc. I know it's horrible to doubt the accuracy of his loss, but I'm just confused with what's going on because the other half of me believes that he just *isn't* interested in me, because all the signs are there. I also hate texting, it's so easy to twist things and lie, which may be the other reason I am doubting him because there's no body language or vocals for me to observe.

I've never dealt with anyone with a mental illness before, my friend has depression but she manages it very well. Any advice or input would be appreciated.

53,"I’ve kept this hidden for a while but over the past 1.5 years i feel as if I’ve gotten progressively worse. I’m 23 and I feel really disconnected the majority of the time. I’m not the same how I use to be. I feel kind of like a zombie and lack emotions most of the time. I do have anxiety, I don’t particularly “like” going places but I won’t refuse. I just find it pointless to hangout with my friends. I do go on dates occasionally, but i lose interested in women relatively quickly. For whatever reason I’m usually much more skeptical of people for no particular reason. Especially someone I’m considering dating. Almost as if I’m trying to find something wrong with them.

I’m not particularly happy or sad. Just existing. I do genuinely laugh occasionally but mentally I dont enjoy life the same way as I did before. For some reason I’m extremely irritated for no reason to particular people. Especially my parents. I’ve gotten a little violent a couple of times (throwing things). Everything they do annoys me, more so on some days. 

My energy is usually drained everyday. Especially if I don’t have to get up early and do anything. I’ll lay in bed and just be on social media or maybe play video games until the day is over to help distract myself. 

I want to see my doctor and tell him anymore but I don’t want to become dependent on a medication. Sometimes I feel like it’s just a phase I’ll get out of eventually. But I’m starting medical school in the summer and I need to get better by then because I have to be at my best as a student and can’t let it get into my career. I eat very healthy and I workout 6 times a week which helps me but I just don’t know what to do anymore.

54,"So I had to switch my prescriptions over to another pharmacy location for the holidays because I went out of town. Turns out they didn't actually give me the right number of pills when I picked up from there. I only just realized this because, silly me, I didn't think to open each bottle there in the pharmacy to count each pill right after I picked them up like people do to make sure they got the correct food from a take-out order. I had to call my regular pharmacy and explain to them why I needed a new refill ASAP, and they gave me a hard time about it. I guess they assume that it's more likely that I am trying to abuse my antidepressant/anti-anxiety meds than the possibility that someone screwed up at the other pharmacy location. I hate that anytime I have to do anything regarding my medication, the people on the other end of the phone or the other side of the counter always seem to err on the side of me being shady. I know that some people abuse medications, but I think most of us are just trying to take care of ourselves and make sure that we stay on our med schedules to be healthy. I don't know, maybe that sounds crazy. ;) ",07Jan2018,1,
55,"Hello.  I am 15.  I suffer from a brain fog that comes to me every day.  The brain fog is at its worst starting at about 1PM or 2PM.  It is a terrible blankness in my mind every time.  I zone out often.  I have some clumsiness.  When I talk, it sometimes comes out as a mess.  Instead of saying ""Don't push the door"", I would say something like ""The door... Don't push it!"" and mess up with ""that"" and ""those"" often.  On multiple occasions, my swim instructor told me to do one thing, but I forgot and did the other thing instead.  Forgetting is so embarrassing and frustrating because my mom will ask me questions and rhetorical questions for me to remember stuff.  I hate it.  She would ask ""Do you have your robe?"" and ""Do you have your goggles"" because it's something I forget often and she probably already knows that I don't have them some of the time.  Curiously.. I make good grades with little effort.  I find that really strange considering my situation.

What has caused this?  Well I have a few theories:

- I have wasted a lot of my life just playing video games hours on end day to day.  I've stopped and I regret spending the amount of time that I used.

- When I was younger, I think I ate a lot of chocolate.  Chocolate has caffeine, which affects the brain, and if I expose myself to it many times, the brain probably developes differently.

- When I was younger, I used to have sugar free syrup with a side of waffles.

Can someone help?  Give advice?  I really want to get out of this brain fog.

Thank you!",07Jan2018,1,
