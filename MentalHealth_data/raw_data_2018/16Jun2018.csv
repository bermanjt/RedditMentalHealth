1,"I dont really know where to start with this, I just feel like venting. I guess i'll just get to the point. Pretty much all of the time, for the past 5 months, there HAS to be a song in my head. I can change the song, start the song over, but I can't make it stop. For fucks sake, i dont think that mental silence is too much to ask. Im pretty sure its the result of dissocation brought on by excessive cannabis use (which i quit), but I don't know. i've honestly just grown numb to it. I find that changing the songs up helps, and listening to new songs helps to freshen up the mental playlist5. I used to get anxiety over it, it would just feel like my brain was being flooded with this shit. But honestly, i do feel like its starting to fade. the music only plays when im bored, but something i've also noticed is that i don't feel bored anymore, i just feel the music. i dont fucking know. i've read about other people with dissociation who have music in their head all the time, and they say its been going on for +20 years, and i just cant fucking accept that. i feel trapped in my own mind sort of, and as long as the music is playing, i cant really focus on the real world. trying to appreciate at the beautiful summer leaves is just overpowered by american pie. when i try to work, its just constant music. the only true escape is listening to music, which im doing right now. it feels like a hamster is just constantly running around a wheel in my brain, and honestly it gives me a headache after a while. i'll just leave it at that, thanks for reading.",16Jun2018,2

3,"Lately, I’ve been getting more aware of some “problems” that Im facing. Its been bothering me and I feel like I need to ask for some advice. I want to give some recent examples and give some background information about myself. I’m in my early 20’s and I’m working a full time job. I consider myself happy and I enjoy doing my job and hobbies.

My probems have been mainly revolving around my “attention/focus” itself. Let me give some examples:

1. I’m having trouble with listening. In a meeting, I can focus on the speaker and a couple of sentences in — im zoned out. Im not actually listening anymore and when I notice this and try again, the same cycle repeats itself. Unless it’s a topic directly about me or my activities, I feel like I’m the only one not listening with full attention. It’s not that I’m going on my phone or do something else, I actually try to focus. At the end of the meeting, I’m usually the first one to stand up. And someone pointed out to me that after every meeting, my coffee cup is always completely destroyed, folded 32x times and drawn on. It’s not that I don’t like the topics or that I’m bored. It’s just almost physically hard to listen. I started thinking about if this happened to me in other points in my life. It also happened in school and during conversations with family or friends. They talk about something genuinely interesting, but after a couple of minutes I can only watch their mouth move but the sentences don’t reach my brain.

2. The same as above, but for reading. In school, I had to read a lot. Sometimes I finished a page and my mind was already in a far away land — I just realized I did not read a single word and have no clue what I read. Time to read the whole page again.

3. I’m easily distracted. If it’s a busy room or people message me. It’s nearly impossible to work for me.

4. I’m getting late for every appointment. With my parents, friends, work and in my past for school. And I hate it. If it’s absolutely crucial, I can manage to get on time.

5. Anything with a deadline is a nightmere. Procrastinating is a big issue. In school, projects were often done on the last possible day. Dentist appointments get cancelled at the last moment. Renewing passport? Last possible week. Also last week, I wanted to order a keyboard. “Order before 23:00 and receive it the next workday”. Yes, I ordered at 22:58 and I’m not even kidding. I don’t want to sound clever or anything because I hate it.

6. The most basic tasks feel extremely hard and I want to avoid doing them for as long as possible. I hate the idea that I have to fill out some online form to renew my insurance or whatever. I know it will just take 5 minutes, even writing this makes it sound absurd. Something in my brain prevents me from doing it.

7. I can never finish a hobby project. This one has been hitting the hardest lately. I have videography projects. I like doing it a lot. I can start the project but eventually I can’t finish it even though I *want* to finish it. It feels so hard to start it but I can’t explain this one. Sometimes I get some sort of rush (especially later in the day / at night), I’ll work on it and before I know it, it’s 5 hours later; 1am and I should be sleeping. I also had no trouble writing this post in one sitting, weirdly enough.

8. I go to bed way too late every day because I procrastinate that as well, and somehow I always get triggered to do all the stuff I didn’t want to do during the day because going to bed becomes a sort of deadline for me and I go into that now or never mode.

9. I feel like I get a new hobby almost monthly before giving up because it’s either getting boring or I realized I can’t do it as perfect as I’d like without commiting a lot of time.


I should just eliminate the excuses I make when I don’t want to start/focus on a task and I should be all fine, right? No. I’ll find another pointless thing to do. And when I finally “browsed that 1 more reddit post”, “watched that 1 last youtube video”, “got something to drink”, “pet my cat”. I’ll be sitting on the couch and deep inside me I want to go and finish that hobby project, but I can’t do it. And this particular time, I was fully concious about it and I realized I couldn’t explain it and needed advice. Yes I waited before even writing this post. I hope someone can give some advice. I always thought I was lazy or had a bad sleep schedule but I think there’s something behind it all because somehow it all feels connected now that I think about it.

4,"I've always loved road trips and escaping my city, even for a day. But lately, I've had this intense feeling where all I want to do is move away. 

To give a little more context to the feeling, I've been emotionally numb for a while now, as in I haven't been feeling emotions. Somewhere between September to November last year, they vanished. I don't feel happy or sad or nervous. The closest thing to a feeling is when the emptiness, where my emotions should be, echoes, for lack of a better word. I'm not sure if this is making sense but the emptiness in me feels more intense and consumes me. The desire to move away basically feels like something is inside the emptiness but it's hot and it consumes me and it's like I have to act upon it or else it will destroy me. It would be impractical for me to move, as I don't have a lot of money or education other than high school. Sometimes things get intense with my family, but other times it's good and overall, it's nothing that would drive me to move away entirely, even if I think about it in those intense moments. I think I just want a change of scenery because I'm so bored with my city, and maybe just a fresh start where I can meet new people and change who I am. To go where nobody knows my name. I don't know what to do about the feeling. It just suddenly comes and drives me to tears and making me want to do anything to stomp the fire out, to just fill the void so there's no more room for the fire to exist. It just consumes me entirely and I can't focus on school or work properly or anything, really. All I can think about is running away and escaping. 

Sometimes I think it would be easier to self-destruct entirely and ruin every single thing in my life so I have a real reason to move away. Sometimes I fantasise about ruining my life and moving to a small town to get away from it all. I even know which small town I'd run away to and an idea of how life would be. I've even searched how much rent is for a one bedroom place there is. I don't know what to do. I used to have a goal of being a successful criminal lawyer and living in New York City in a penthouse apartment. Now all I can think about is that it would be the biggest accomplishment if I could live in a small, coastal town in California with a nice, minimalistic designed house and heaps of land where I could grow and sell marijuana and spend time writing a book or something. My mum is one of the many people questioning where my motivation and inspiration went, I'm wondering, too. I don't know what to do. I'm destroying my life and the desire to move away is accelerating it. Anything will help. Any advice, any of your own experiences about any part of my story. 
Thank you.",16Jun2018,8
5,"Hi.
I'm currently sitting in the hallway for a local at a local tournament for a game I like to play.
I've been to maybe six of them, yet every time, I just cannot talk to others. The most I've said was my tag so they could enter me in with my boyfriend.
I go to these because I'm trying to work on both the game and my social skills. Speaking to strangers makes me very, very scared. I can talk to my friends just fine, but these are people I met before 8th grade. During 8th grade, I started to get scared of this kinda thing, and now I cannot find myself able to start conversations with others. When they speak to me, I am fine. Someone had just asked me where the restroom is, I answered just fine. But I really want to improve in this game, but in order to do that I need to play others. In this scene, it is a very relaxed atmosphere. People just walk up to each other and ask if they want to play. I know that there is nothing wrong with asking these people to play. I don't THINK I'm scared. But then I try to do it and before even getting to them, I get so scared and just cannot do it.
I don't know how to help this. I thought it was something to fix by working on it, but it's the same feeling I get with spiders. I see one, and I cannot handle it- I am so frightened. I've tried so hard to just talk to someone, but I just cannot so it. It makes me feel like I just...I'll never improve. And at that point, why waste all this time living, if I'm never going to make it anywhere on this issue? I want to make new friends and play this game with others- to get into this game scene. But I just cannot...What do I do? See a counselor? I'm just so...Confused.",16Jun2018,1

8,"I've always wondered what makes a stranger reach out to a suicidal individual to give them advice or hope to pull through.

What is the reasoning behind why a human would feel so inclined to do this? I know obviously humanity and kindness and feeling fulfilled by helping another but.. beyond that.

What do you think.. unconsciously scared of another person following through with that? Are they scared they will end up on the planet alone?

I seem to think it boils down to individuals being scared of others dying because it makes them feel vulnerable to suicide or loneliness.. I don't know. 

From my point of view (frequent suicidal thoughts) I smile and tell others to 'hold on' etc. but if they actually die I will be/have been 1) jealous and 2) relieved for them, that their pain is most likely over

9,"Anyone. Please. Can someone just please take this seriously for once and not as a meme. It's not a joke, and i apologise for decided to reach out to reddit to share my opinion. 
Please, id like it to see if someone can help me or advise me. 

I'm a young girl, nearly 19. I dont have the biggest friend group, if that. 
I adore my boyfriend. He treats me well when we are together, but have struggled in the past like most couples. 

Now we have matured as a couple and made some ground rules.
Communication is key and no lies. 

So here's a predicament. 

Why treat a girl (being me) so harshly like it's her fault when something goes slightly wrong for 40 mins. My real life example is since we are in a long distance relationship, it hurts when the other person doesn't allow what little communication you have to begin with. Imagine being blamed for changing your BitEmoji on Snapchat, and discovering somewhere along the way my location wasn't on, for a whole 30 mins, and once i had realised, it was too late and i was being snapped at and felt like my boyfriend in the relationship, when far away, doesn't see the simple mistake or error not done on purpose... and INSTANTLY PUTS THE RELATIONSHIP ON AN EDGE, so I started hurting myself. I just don't have no one to go to. So this is where I will be posting my days and tough times to tell anyone who will read my story.

10,"I'm a 20 year old male. I would say this is one of the biggest things that I struggle with for social anxiety. I've had this problem for the last six years, and I've made little progress with it. I always feel like people don't like me that much or think I'm weird or nervous and a weakling. A lot of times when I go out with my brother or someone, the employees or other strangers almost always acknowledge my brother or whomever else I'm with instead of me. Even if I'm the one making a purchase!

Like if I'm making a purchase with a cashier or my brother and I are talking to someone, the other person only makes eye contact with my brother, smiles, and talks to him as if I'm invisible and not there. It frustrates me when people ignore me. Why do people favor my brother over me? I'm not a bad guy. I'm a nice guy.

Or when someone is making a purchase with the cashier in front of me, and the cashier is very friendly and smiley to that person, but once it's my turn, the cashier doesn't smile at all and is very cold towards me.

Or when I'm out for a walk with someone, and a passerby only says hello and smiles to the person I'm with and not me. I remember another time I was out to eat with someone, and the waitress only greeted the person I'm with and not me. She said to my friend when she came to our table, ""Hi how are you today?!"" completely ignoring me.

I wish I could get back to the point where I didn't care whether or not random strangers like me or talk to me. This problem makes it hard for me to go out and relax without worrying about people's approval of me and whether they like me or not. I'm so anxious for people's acknowledgement and approval to the point where it's insane.

I didn't always have this problem. It stemmed from when my 8th grade history teacher didn't like me and pretty much ignored me the entire school year. He acknowledged all of his students except for me. I was always so anxious for his acknowledgment and approval to the point where I would stare him down hoping he would say something to me, and he never did. That experience traumatized me because I was usually always my teacher's favorite student, and would always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of that. That was the first time I've ever been treated like that by a teacher. And I still haven't really recovered from that.

I'm trying to overcome this, but it's so hard. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Jun2018,4

It's like being stuck in a permanent state of exhaustion that no amounts of sleep will fix because I'm stuck in a nightmare. I don't enjoy life, but I'm too scared to die. There have been months when I've thought I've overcome the worst, only for them to creep back into my life. It has been over a year and a half since I've felt genuinely happy.

I know I can’t fix anything for her, but how do I support someone in this situation without completely neglecting my own health and needs?

The last several months have been particularly difficult for her, seemingly due to stimulus from politics, family, work, social situations, and relationship issues with myself. Emotionally, she’s very fragile right now and It’s not uncommon for her to get angry at me over seemingly smalls things that result in her dropping to a place where she feels like she has no value.

21,"Hey Guys, 

I've never posted here but I'm really thinking something is wrong with me.  I've come to realize that I don't really know how to be happy and grateful for what I have and I can't figure out why.  Its to the point where it's getting to be super self destructive and is going to cause me to make some very very life altering decisions that you really can't come back from.

  
I guess the major thing right now is my marriage.  I've been married for three years now and I just find myself thinking that this isn't the person for me at all.  There's some other stuff going on in our relationship that has certainly caused rifts and she's done some hurtful things, but I'm to the point where I can't find the energy to love her like I used to at all.  Even can't find the energy to put anything into the relationship.  Her and I have always had a rocky road.  We dated for 2 years, I broke it off.  Got back together and then I broke it off again, both times because I felt there was just someone else out there better suited for me.  Both times we were apart I also found myself missing her and wanting her back.  This time feels different, but who knows.  We have a house together and an amazing little fur family.  It all just feels like a pattern though.  I've tried to talk to her about it but she's been pretty dismissive of the whole thing.  She says I'm stressed at work and it will be fine etc etc.  But again, we've grown so distant over the past six months that we're more like roommates.  We don't eat together.  She's gone before I get up every morning and most nights is in bed or ready for it by the time I get home from the gym after work. She's been spending a lot of weekends lately with her friends. It's just not working.  As a result, I'm looking up how to get divorces in canada at 1:30AM on a Friday night, figuring out what my share of the house equity would be and looking at condo's downtown.  As a person, there is nothing wrong with my wife.  She's beautiful, intelligent and caring.  And I used to love her so much.  But now its just numbness I feel for her.

Its not even just my marriage though.  If I look back I've done the same thing with my career.  I've had several fantastic jobs with great companies so far.  I've actually been very very lucky.  That being said, I've never stayed at one position for more than two years.  I'll be two years at my current job next march, and can't help but feel like I'll want to jump ship.  I've been promoted once in the year I've been here and still want more.  I don't want to move.  I love my team and my company and honestly the work most of the time.  I just know myself and as soon as there isn't an opportunity for advancement on the near horizon I'll be entertaining calls from recruiters.

I guess overall I'm just always looking to upgrade something or make something better and that can't be healthy.  I know a lot of people who seem happy as hell with everything they have in their lives.  I want that.  I've been looking up the symptoms I describe and it almost seems like some kind of bi-polar or other personality disorder.  I've toyed with the idea of seeing a therapist, but haven't committed to that.  

Sorry this is so ranty.  It does feel good to type it all out though.",16Jun2018,2

24,"Life is hard. For one reason or another, thats a fact that everybody on the planet can agree with. The reasons vary, but theres levels to this shit that nobody likes to bring up or even think about. Race, sex, sexuality, finances and where you were born are important variables when it comes to being beaten to death, raped, starving, dying slowly and painfully from an asthma attack or having a fucking bomb dropped on your head. These atrocities happen daily, hundreds of times because of a genetic accident you had no part in putting you in that position. Gay, straight, rich, black, white, poor, born in Europe, born in Asia, it's all a fucking genetic accident that you had no say in. These basic traits can get somebody who's never met you or talked to you, get so emotional that they'll throw acid on your face or become so afraid that they'll pull out a gun and blow your fucking head off in broad daylight on a busy street and within themselves, will feel completely justified because you're x y z. Your skin is too this, your dress was too that, you have a blood relationship with a certain person, the most basic shit can get you so fucked before you even exit the fucking womb.

 Oh, a pregnant woman who takes heroin throughout her pregnancy? The baby is literally born with a heroin addiction and is fucking wailing at birth because its going through a heroin withdrawal. How heroin works is it relaxes EVERY muscle in your body. When you're a heroin addict, the withdrawals are all the muscles in the body all start to tighten up and you feel like you're going to die. It's one of the most miserable painful experiences in life, yet, because a woman is an addict to a drug that makes you numb to ll kinds of pain when most of your life has been a horror show, has an infant that craves heroin and believes its dying because their entire muscular system is stiffening on them. It's not fair, it's horrific, but nothing on this fucking planet is fair or equal.

 Mainstream news pushes stories of equality for women and gays and fuck if somebody who feels oppressed isn't going to support them, because when an issue is addressed that speaks to my soul, you're fucking right im gonna do what I can to spread that message because I hate feeling guilty or like people think its okay to shit on me because im x y z. You see it all over now. Theres a group of people called “furries” that dress up in sports mascot outfits and fuck each other. For the most part, they get shit on by the general public, but they're still people, they need to eat and even if its out of a  fucking doggy bowl, who is anybody to say that they're less than and don't deserve respect or some kind of representation on the world stage. Priests literally rape children in churches, mostly boys so not only is it rape, but its gay rape and the conniptions religious people have about homosexuals, in GODS OWN HOUSE mind you and nobody gets as bent out of shape as they do when they see somebody trying to fuck in like a Mr. Met outfit like that's even on the relative scale of filth of shit humanity has done.

It never really registered with me what women are subjected to the very first thing in the morning until I was listening to Bill Burr's podcast and his buddy was pissy about an exchange with some younger girls at the mall. They're comedians, they did their shows, kicked back a few drinks after and went to the mall looking for one of those frozen yogurt places. Both of these guys were middle aged half drunk white guys in a mall late, they came across two younger women and they asked them if they knew where the yogurt spot was, which was legit, they wanted yogurt and the chicks blew them off. Bills friend was angry and saying they were cunts, but Bill was the voice of reason and told him if he was aware that they're the creepy old guys now, the ladies were probably freaked out because the two of them was drunk, but then he said some of the most profound shit i've ever heard. He goes “you ever watch those shows about those insane prisons and immediately think, what the fuck would I do to not get raped there? Thats what life is like for them every day.” Holy fucking shit if that shit didn't wallop me over the head. Every day a woman goes to the dresser or closet, while shes picking out clothes, a thought bounces around “is this too x y z” with the followup being that is this going to make a stranger draw an attempt of robbing me of my humanity, changing my life forever, erasing any sense of privacy I have in the most violent offenses on the planet, being brutally raped. Off the strength of the length of the dress or tightness or whatever the fuck. Thats a consistent thought and fear women go through just getting to the fucking dresser in the morning. I never hear anybody speak on that shit publically, but it's a good buzzword to say you're a feminist and talk as if they give a fuck about what women have to go through. Whens the last time you heard any mother fucker make a point about a good amount of womens hygiene products in local jails or prisons or any of these places where people are passed through on bullshit arrests and being held for 3 days. Think about that lovely time of the month hitting you while you're in a holding cell with nothing for it in the scorching summer heat with no shower for 3 days. You see that being a talking point when it comes to crime often? If you do, link me, let me know how I can help spread that message.

There is no such thing as justice, equality never existed in the first place, the only thing we can all agree on, is that we live on the same planet. Whether its ran by jews, lizard people, if its flat or round, five thousand or five billion years old, the consensus is we all live on this rock. Those experiences can strut into your life by basic genes. When your genes turn against you, in the forms of general mental function, that's when you can really get a full hands on on injustice, really get the sting of inequality and convince yourself, pretty convincingly too, that this isn't Earth, this is hell.

I'm a 30 year old male, a decendant of the Ashanti tribe in west africa, Jamaican, scottish, Italian and Irish blood in my background. I'm a male who grew up in The Bronx My mother was a criminal defense attorney who fought for the people and what she believed in. Despite being a lawyer, we werent rich by any stretch. She did a lot of work for free because she knew other lawyers would take their money and fuck off on their cases, so she fought for them in court. She almost died the week before I started middle school. That incident spawned a now 20 year battle with bipolar 1, major depression, anxiety and OCD. This will be a series of me sharing my experiences with each illness as a man of color who grew up being fed to keep my emotions on the inside and never tell anybody your problems because people will think you're a pussy or crazy or that they just don't fucking care. I will lay out my experiences no matter how embarrassing or how cringey they are, because we all know somebody dealing with mental health issues and one thing every person with mental health issues share, it's a consistent feeling of being alone, even in a crowd of 75,000 people. I speak candidly and mostly without a filter, this morning was the tipping point and I hope you can make use out of this and my story as I share more.",16Jun2018,16

Every experience is valuable and necessary. 

There is no such thing as ""bad"" and ""good""; these are imposed values.

A person can make radically helpful adjustments in their lives; they can even benefit from talking about it with an unabashed Expert by Experience. 

This one is very aware of what the extremes of life can feel and look like and how to transform anything and everything into more of what you want.

26,"I'm not trying to get help or anything like that; I just need to get a thought out.
Life isn't worth itself -
The positive experiences will never be worth the constant negativity that I feel.
Even the best feelings that I've ever felt only last a few minutes to a couple days maximum. Once that positivity fades I always return to the never-ending nightmare that is reality.
No matter how hard I try I consistently fuck up at least one important aspect of everything I do. My brain only operates under the ""panic"" setting. 
I'm so god damn tired of people telling me that I need to find something that makes me happy. Every time I find something that makes me feel good the people in my life make me feel bad about enjoying it.
I'm so sick of pretending to be somebody that I'm not. 
My last job really opened my eyes -
You can't trust people in positions of authority over you and people do not really want to know about you. When somebody asks ""what's up"", ""how are you doing"", ""what makes you happy"" or ""what do you want to do"" they are just waiting to hear a scripted answer along the lines of ""I'm fine, don't worry about me"".

Here's the ""real"" me.
I've wanted to die for over half of my life (I am 26).
Literally the only thing that I think about is suicide.
I have a very minor desire to find another person that brings a sense of warmth into my life that is always replaced by an extreme craving for death when I interact with another person.
While I may not kill myself right now it is my main goal in life. 
I believe that 98% of the time the customer is wrong and doesn't know what the fuck their talking about - that's why they're paying somebody else to do it. 
Windows 7 was and is the best Windows operating system.
Goku stole Vegeta's kill in Resurrection F.
Phil Fish is a bitch.
HuniePop is one of the best puzzle games of all time.

28,"I am going through an incredibly tough time right now and having, shall we say, some very very dark disturbing thoughts (about myself only). I recently started therapy. I know vaguely that the therapist will report things in regards to self harm or harming others but I don't know to what extent they are legally bound to report. I feel like I need to talk about some of these thoughts but I do NOT want to be reported or be sent to the psych ward. I have been down that road before and I don't want to do it again.   


So what is the line? How can I talk about these thoughts without triggering a knee-jerk reaction, legally or otherwise?",16Jun2018,1
29,"I have had issues with anxiety for as long as I can remember, though at the time I didn't know what it was. I can remember always thinking I would get ""bus sick"" on the way to school in the morning but looking back now I know I was having panic attacks every morning. Over the years my anxiety got worse and kind of controlled my life, for example I could never stay over at friends houses because I was so uncomfortable or go on field trips because of being ""bus sick"" when I was almost 15 my best friend was killed in an accident and my anxiety and feeling of isolation was amplified exponentially. A few months later my parents separated and we sold our nice country home and moved into a smaller place in town with my mom. Needless to say when I was around 16 years old I was not having an exceptionally great time, my anxiety was worse than ever (though I still didn't understand what it really was) and I was very depressed. I went to my family doctor and he put me on some medication (SSRI's). From this time on I tried many diffrent kinds of pills to try and find one that made me feel ""good"". In the end I stayed on cymbalta, apparently its not an ssri but is similar. I was on these pills for years tell I suddenly stopped when I was 21. At the end i felt like a complete ghost of myself and was in an extremely dark depression, I could not take it any longer. At first I went to my doctor and asked to be taken off, his response was to ""treat them like they are a daily vitamin, if you feel depressed and numb it's not because of the pills"". That was not the answer I was looking for  so I went home and threw my medication away and stopped cold Turkey (bad move lol) the withdrawal symptoms were really not fun but I pressed my way through and they subsided for the most part ( I still get brain zaps 2 years later). After this I changed doctors as well, the new doctor said she would recomend cognitive thought therapy before pills and referred me to a place that specializes In that sort of thing. The cognitive thought therapy worked very well and I was able to get my anxiety to a manageable level! Depression is still something that I struggle with but not to the extent as before. BUT! After all the pills I never got  back to feeling""normal"" I still feel like my emotions are almost non existent, for the most part I feel very ""meh"".  I was at a funeral for my grandad today and I found myself in a room of people who are all crying... except me. Sure I was sad, but not the kind of sad you would expect to feel in that situation. After the pills I also started having issues with PE (pre mature ejaculation) and after around 2 years it has not gotten better or gone back to normal like I had hoped. I feel like these pills ruined me and I really don't know what to do. I want to feel normal again but I think its probably time to accept that its probably not ever going to happen again in this life time.

I've been getting better, as I started therapy and began medication today. But I feel like I have no desire for anything, other than to die. But even that desire itself is low; I'm not feeling any suicidal ""urges."" Is this normal?

33," My father had **Bipolar Disorder Type 1**.

 I have **Reoccurring Major Depressive Disorder**

So....there are some distinct differences between each of our conditions and experiences with depression, and I want to share those distinctions with you.  Maybe it'll help some clarify thoughts and/or ideas. 

**DISCLAIMER:** I only learned of my Dad's illness through those who witnessed it.  I didn't get this information from my Dad directly, unfortunately, he passed away before I was old enough to ask him myself. 

....Anyway....

My mom used to tell me that my Dad's emotional state would **switch quickly**, as in seconds, bouncing from **one extreme emotion to another extreme**. ie: Intense mania (either happy, aggressive, angry) to debilitating depression (guilt, shame, sadness, irritability/anger/apathy)  He would also have bouts of **unusual physical behavior** if the situation influenced him in that way when he was in either extreme state, to which, he had little to no control over regardless of which extreme he was experiencing.  These ""flips"" were **mostly impulsive** as I was told.

An example of unusual physical behavior during one of his extreme moments, he took me and my 2 siblings hostage at gunpoint (I'm not sure what triggered this event, just that it happened). It prompted the whole calling out a police negotiator, shutting down the street and everything else.  Im not sure how or if he was talked down or if the episode simply had passed, but luckily no one was killed during this incident, but after the mania had passed he would almost immediately plummet into a debilitating depression.  Because as everyone knows, what goes up, must come down, and that's true for Bipolar disorder as well.

Now with my experience having Major Depressive Disorder is that it's a **gradual slide down** into a depressive episode.  There's nothing ""instant"" about my descent into depression.  It is **a slower process** for me.  Where **each day got a little worse than the day before** until it finally debilitated me completely and i **became bed ridden** and completely **consumed with anhedonia**. I never experienced the unusual behavior patterns the same way my dad did.

Ultimately, the biggest differences between my Dad's depression and my own wasn't so much intensity but duration of the episode itself and the rate of descent into depression.  My dad would quickly ""pop out"" of a depressive episode where as I would stay in a depression for weeks to months on end.  My dad never experienced depressive episodes for that long, just a constant back and forth between two extremes sometimes all within the same day.  Creatively speaking, depression for me was like being slowly pulled down into quicksand where as my dads descent was equivalent to skydiving. 

Lastly, Here are some similarities....

Both conditions are life long, both are life-threatening, both require proper medication regimens, treatment plans and proper support/understanding from others. Both are neurobiological conditions that originate from inside the physical brain and not from the consciousness of the mind, and both are still heavily misunderstood throughout the majority of the general public.

34,"I had a really emotionally draining day in group therapy today. I had a panic attack because we were on the topic of forgiving people who have hurt us, and hearing everyone talk about this stuff made me rember all the shitty and horrible things that happened to me when I was younger and I was already on the verge of a panic attack, and then someone said something that hit way too close to home and I just bolted out of the room and completely crumbled in the bathroom because I was crying so hard. I fucking hate crying because it makes me feel overly sensitive for the rest of the day, but one of the therapists at the program talked to me and it helped. I thought I'd be able to make it through the rest of the day with out falling apart, because I was volunteering at the art museum later and I didn't want to be an emotional mess.  When I was there I felt really drained and tired from the panic attack, but I figured that being here would be better than being alone with my thoughts at home. Everything was going alright considering I felt like shit. Then out of fucking no where this  old guy starts saying stuff to me and the guy who works at the museum, and I was just so confused and I kept thinking to myself ""is...is this really happening????"". First he says something that I'm still in disbelief about. He said that me and the employee were both girls, which left me with my mouth open because the dude who works there is trans and that's just such a fucked up thing to say to someone, and even more insulting coming from a complete fucking stranger. Then the ass wipe proceeds to tell me that I should smile more, and walks off. We both just stared at eachother for a few seconds after this happened with a ""What the actual fuck just happened???"" facial expression. I didn't think that what he said to me was nearly as offensive as what was said to the employee, but he took what was said to me much more seriously than I initially did. And after seeing his reaction to what had been said to me was, I realized that I'm kind of numb to that sort of stuff because I've had people tell me worse things. Like when I had an internship, there was this guy who would always tell me ""you should smile more, you look miserable all the time"" which was the most irritating thing in the world because at the time my depression was at its worst, and hearing that shit just made me feel even worse. I was never sure if that was enough to say anything about it to my mentors. But after I was told I could take a break at the museum, I just went straight to the bathroom and broke down completely. I was so angry at myself for crying about it, but at the same time I was pist off at him for telling me to *smile* when I had just had a horrible fucking day of remembering childhood traumas, having panic attacks and just feeling like shit.

36,"I know that no one can diagnose someone over the internet, but I am looking for people who have had similar experiences or just support. I have a therapist that I see every other week and have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon but I've come to some realizations that are hard to deal with right now.

I have diagnosed clinical depression which was greatly exacerbated by pregnancy and postpartum. Also generalized anxiety disorder. I take sertraline and it has helped, also life changes have helped such as therapy and I pretty much rarely ever feel suicidal anymore. But I think that I have bipolar disorder and that I am currently in a manic or hypomanic phase. I think this has been going on for my whole life. Normally I feel either sad or overwhelming nothingness. Sometimes the nothingness is worse. I rarely get to actual contentment - happy but not over the top. I have had occasional times where I feel SUPER happy and confident and social. But it is very occasional so I'm not sure if it could be considered bipolar disorder. I'm talking years in between ""manic"" phases. 

Honestly these phases are great. I most recently started a diet and exercising and I feel amazing. But I always take things too far particularly with men. I like to drink and party and have casual hookups in these phases, but that isn't really an option currently. So I feel overly hyper and like I have no outlet. I'm going to try exercising more and maybe that could help burn off energy but idk what else to do. I don't feel like I can talk to my spouse which I know is bad but I know he has noticed certain things like my energy levels and constantly having to be moving and way abnormally high sex drive (though I assume he sees that as a positive) 

It's funny because I wish I could keep this feeling forever but I have kids now and I know I can't just completely lose control like I used to. I'm also terrified of the crash. Generally my ""manic"" phases are shortlived and depression goes on for much, much longer. I'm just scared that I don't know what true happiness is. I feel like I only truly experience happiness with my daughters. 

I don't ever get violent or anything, just extremely hyper and poor decision making. If anyone has had similar experiences I'd love to hear from you even if you don't have advice. ",16Jun2018,1

It’s just odd how many people when listening don’t know what their doing, or are actually harmful. 

• Don’t say “I know” or “I understand” because you probably don’t. You could of been through the exact situation in the exact same way, but unless your the exact same person as the other one you can’t perceive it the same way. Instead of “I understand”, try “I imagine that’s ____” or “That sounds ________” 


• Asking “How are you?” doesn’t cut it for gaging how someone else is. “How are you?” Is a formality. People at the bottom of the emotional rut will answer “Good, you?” Try “You ok?” when asking. It requires more of a self reflection to answer. 

• For the love of god, if someone injures themselves (NSSI / Non-Suicidal Self Injury) don’t threaten to harm yourself if they hurt themselves. If they are injuring themselves with the intent of suicide, call an emergency number. If they are injuring themselves without the intent of suicide (most of self injury), gently try to ask them to move the tools they use away from themselves, then reassure them and calm them down, then if they actually did harm themselves, have them clean and treat injuries.

The thing is, I have a lot of health anxiety, including a massive fear of losing control of myself and passing out. Some days I will wait as long as possible to eat my first meal, but once I start feeling lightheaded, I will eat the food I don't want to eat because passing out is the only thing scarier than gaining weight. All the while, I'm having thoughts like, ""Don't you dare lose control and overeat unless you want to go back to being completely worthless like you were when you were fat."" To compensate for the fact that not eating isn't an option, I  track every calorie with a food scale to ensure it is mathematically impossible to gain any weight. On days when I try to give myself a break from the constant calorie counting, I feel mildly panicky out of fear that I might start to like this a little too much, stop tracking all together, and go back to my previous weight.

I'm guessing after that I developed a very strong imagination and started biting my nails and seeing a shadow man which is something I remember always doing but never knew when or why. I don't know what to do.",16Jun2018,1
52,"Thought the day would never come. I feel like crying. It's so nice having the feeling that someone actually cares. I feel so sad. Not depressed. Sad. Well I still feel depressed and I still feel suicidal and I told her and after having that session I feel so empty. I feel nothing inside of me except emptiness. I'm only 14 so she had to tell my dad and make a plan if these thoughts of suicide come. The thing I don't understand is that I feel suicidal every single day. What am I supposed to do then? I am scared to tell because if I do, I could get fucking hospitalized or something, and I don't want that. I still don't feel like life is getting better. And I still feel fucking miserable.

53,"Hey there. So I think I have some pretty significant mental health stuff going on. I've always been pretty stressed and prone to feeling like shit, but I just can't do anything anymore. I burst out crying for no reason (like driving or something), can't eat, can't leave bed, can't sleep (to the point of visual hallucinations, which are actually welcome and nice, like an escape). Anyway, my sister witnessed a ""shut down"" where I laid frozen in the fetal position in the grass for hours. That was triggered by something stupid and small. She just ignored me and then sent a weird text later saying ""sorry I just don't know how to help when you're so stressed"" Then today I called my dad and told him how I haven't been able to leave my room or eat and am having crazy insomnia. At night I stay up and furiously write. It's like something takes over and I create these insane rabbit holes with my words all night long. Typically everything in my peripheral vision is breathing and swirling when this happens. To me this is concerning. He just told me I need to focus more and find motivation to work and deal with short term needs. Then I can just shift perspective and start to work on longer term needs. It's like he didn't even register all the stuff about ""I stay in bed all day, never sleep, cry for no reason, visual disturbances"". I dont' really know what to do. I feel like it's just brushed off as me being dramatic and stubborn as it has been my whole life. This has happened my whole life. I am at a breaking point and they still don't hear me when I'm desperately needing their help. I feel so stuck. ",16Jun2018,1
54,"I'm very confused on my panic attacks and science I can't understand. My trauma was that I was sheltered for 10 years away from people by my parents. My parents were very abusive towards me. They kept me away from anybody and I never went to public school until I was 17. Had no friends.

Whenever I go into a panic attack (even though I'm aware I'm safe) all I can see is darkness. I see myself as a little girl trapped in a room with no way of getting out. I'm all alone. I scream for help and feel as if suicide is my only means to a end. I completely black out.

55,"I came out with my disorders not too long ago. I got a lot of support—a lot from people I didn’t even expect to hear from.

So many people offered their ear.

But, when it comes down to it, it was all feigned. There were many  started conversations (either by them or myself) and, after three short messages (that weren’t even about my problems; just small talk), poof!

They disappear. They said their message. We said a quick hello, and that’s their contribution. That’s their support.

Out of all these conversations, only one person has continued talking to me, and it has been 90% about his problems, and I can’t do that anymore. Like, dude, I’ll gladly pick you up from time to time, but I clearly have my own problems, too, and I don’t want to be dragged down by you. Can we talk about a fucking movie or something?

57,"After developing schizophrenia in my teenage years, I was placed on antipsychotics. As with most, I gained a lot of weight on them. It's been eight years since I was placed on antipsychotics and the only time I've been successfully able to lose a significant amount of weight was when I lowered my antipsychotics and was engaging heavily in eating disordered behaviours. Predictably, my mental health worsened and I had to start taking all of my antipsychotic dose again: I very quickly gained back all of my weight and more.

I'm really not happy with my current weight, but I rarely ever hear about people losing and maintaining while on their full dose of antipsychotics and having a healthy relationship with food and it can make losing this weight healthily feel kind of hopeless. I was wondering if anyone has stories of losing weight healthily and maintaining on antipsychotics?

(For reference, I'm on 675mg of quetiapine and 1mg of risperidone.)

TL;DR: Has anyone lost weight and maintained while on antipsychotics?",16Jun2018,2

I'm an atheist, but can't tell my religious family because they would quite literally disown me. It drives me crazy to listen to their religious bullshit, but I can't do anything about it because I want a place to live. 

My best friend is a literal fucking Nazi, and I really want to quit being friends with him, but he's the only person who will actually put up with my shit. Well, I did have another best friend that I can actually stand being around but he moved 5 hours away, so now we can only talk via text. 

I tried talking to my crush and getting a date, and it went fine for a little while, but now Im in deep shit. My anxiety and fucked up brain nearly messed up one of her important plans and almost got people hurt, I made her pissed at me, and even though she said she forgives me, I know that there's gonna be an akward tension between us. On top of that, there's a 0% chance that I can date her now, but I'm not over her. 

I'm having reoccuring dreams where I try to apologize to her, but before I can she always disappears or turns into a monster. No matter what I try to do, she always lurks back into my mind. I've tried gaming for hours on end, but the the thought is always in the back of my mind. I've tried binging The Office and Parks and Rec, but those shows have a lot of relationship arcs, which just bring back the memories. I've tried focusing on my job at Cracker Barrel, but the couples there just make me think of what my crush and I could be doing. My family took a vacation to D.C. for a week, but everytime I would see a tan girl with shoulder length black hair, I would think it's my crush and go back into depression.

62,A teen who is suffering from depression.,16Jun2018,1
63,"I've been playing video games for nearly 12+ months now. Among other things, I've been following the same routine everyday for that long and got depressed the longer i went on for. I've stopped that routine for sometime now because I've concluded that burnout may be responsible if It's not a mental illness (I can't get a diagnosis until September). Although I am cornered about that, around the same time I started experiencing particularly unsettling thoughts and became way more sensitive towards some I was never sensitive towards. Although I'm not getting as bothered by them now, It's odd things like getting distracted that movies are acted out, video games or animated pieces of art are voice acted, there is dialogue behind every movie, TV show etc.

I concluded that this is all happening because my mind isn't occupied by the need or stress to complete any work commitments like I've always had to for the longest time (Studying for an exam, etc.) but at the same time, I have nothing to do or  I've been following the same routine everyday till burnout/boredom and so my mind  takes in these thoughts since there is nothing to occupy my mind. I personally think that such a conclusion probably doesn't make sense and so I have come to Reddit for  any insight I can get. If I get positive advice, thank you in advance.",16Jun2018,3
64,"*I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in... if it's not, I apologise.* 

December 2016: Went to the doctor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; was prescribed Prozac which didn't work, then Zoloft which didn't work either. 

Fast forward to October 2017: I move home to my country of birth due to worsening mental health (was studying abroad). 

January 2018: I start seeing a psychologist and psychiatric doctor for my previous symptoms. We quickly realise that it's probably a different issue causing the depressive and anxious feelings. We begin several diagnostic tests, and I score all over the place. ADD, Aspergers, Borderline personality disorder, schizoid tendencies, and antisocial personality disorder, to name a few. I've been trying ritalin for nearly two months now, but it gives me terrible anxiety when it wears off; I don't enjoy the feeling while on it either. 

I'm male, 25  

Symptoms I can currently recall are:

Hyper focus - I get really, really, really interested in a subject for one to two months, then it changes to something completely different. F.ex Making music, to mixology (making cocktails in a bar). It's as if I can do nothing else than that one subject; nothing else is important/interesting. Been like this since childhood. 

Interests - I NEED to be interested in something in order to do it. If it doesn't interest me, I can't do it. This can cause weeks or months of ""downtime"" - if I currently don't have an interest, I'll sleep. Since Childhood.

Inability to keep routines - Short and simple; I can't keep a routine going. Sleep, work, medication, school. It's all the same. I needed someone to force me up, and force me to go for school and work. On my own it falls apart. Been like this since childhood. 

Manipulative - I will lie, distort the truth, and make things seem different than they are in order to achieve something (almost always to avoid doing things; social interaction. Work. School, etc.) I have never hurt anyone, but I have gotten away with petty crime and scored higher on tests/exams, for example. Since childhood. 

Disregard for the law - Terrible child, bad teen, awry adult. Arson, breaking and entering, theft, and vandalism as a child, to drug dealing, theft, and fraud as a teen. Getting arrested, threatened and so on did nothing. It didn't matter. Now as an adult I don't partake in criminal activities. I don't see it as bad, but I know it is, so I distance myself from it. Note I've never physically harmed anyone, or anything. The worst thing I did, was, through poor judgement, shooting a duck with an air-rifle as a teenager. (The duck was OK after, I made sure.) Since childhood, obviously.

No motivation, drive or lust - I literally have no goals for my future. I do not know what I want. This sometimes floods me with apathy; I can sleep through important events like a job interview, exams, funerals... If I've recently discovered an interest, or returned to something I've been interested in before, it may seem as if I'm having a burning desire for it; it goes out as soon as the interest changes, though. This has often lead me to an unhealthy investment of time into video games or TV-series; time just flows. This is post-teens. 

Social interaction and friends - Friendships are hard. Really hard. I have little to no contact with people I've counted as friends. I tend to avoid most people, as I either don't like them, or they don't interest me. It feels awkward. Social interaction is strange; feels forced. However, I'm really good at it.  I can befriend anyone. I'm charming, full of knowledge and I have a great sense of humour, or so I've been told. I've explained it to my pshych as being a ""social chameleon."" I can blend in with anyone, anywhere. I have no issue with social queues, body language, facial expressions, lingo, sarcasm, banter, and so on. I actually do really well. This is nothing but a well performed act, since I feel like I have no personality of my own. I just pretend to be whoever I need to be. When I did have a ""close friend"", or a group of friends, however, I went out of my way to help; be it with late night talks. Planning an event. Babysitting. Proof-reading important documents, and so on. Maybe I wanted to feel needed, important or included. It's a bit tricky since I'm torn between feeling lonely, but wanting to be left alone.

Relationships - I don't understand ""love"" and why it makes people do the things they do. It feels alien. Living, and sharing with someone is a weird concept I can't grasp.  Sometimes, albeit rarely, I'll enjoy sex, but as ""no strings attached."" I have a need to perform well, so I do. I'll go all out with food, setting the mood, foreplay and giving a hundred percent to my partner. Sometimes it can last a few weeks, sometimes it's a one-off and I lose interest. (Again, interest making things difficult.)

Mood changes drastically - I can think I'm the center of attention one second, to ""everyone hates me"" the other. If I think someone ignores me, or dislike me, I take it hard. If I see people talking, I'll assume they are talking about me in a bad way. I'll assume the worst. 

Manic episodes? This one's a bit strange. Since the contrasts are so great. I was straight edge for 5 years; didn't even drink tea with caffeine in it. Then suddenly it was a lot of drugs, a lot of alcohol, often. Sometimes daily. Now I'm back to no drugs and alcohol; I do drink coffee and tea, though. I'm also vegan, and I exercise to the best of my ability (energy comes and goes.) It's as if I completely lose my inhibition and feeling of self perseverance for a time, then it comes back in full. 

Perfectionism - Again, I need to be good. I want people to notice how good I am. Seems narcissistic, but it's not like I think I'm better than everyone else; I know I'm good when I get good feedback, if I don't, I'll keep at it until I do. This leads to unhealthy attention to detail, investments, self-critique and paranoia. I MUST be good. 

Really bad with money - If I have money I will spend it. Often forgetting about bills, loans and necessities. I do a lot better with a minimal budget that can cover the basics of living; I'm forced to be wise. (Again back to routines; I need to be forced to do most things.)

Inability to keep jobs - Back to interests. I'll get physically ill if I have to do something that doesn't interest me. Nausea, anxiety (panic attacks even), depression, apathy and just wanting to sleep for the rest of my life. 

Living on whims - I dropped out of school when I was 18; over the course of two weeks I found a job in a different country, moved on my own, and settled into a company flat. I've randomly jumped on trains to far away destinations. Started a bachelor in a different country (again). Tattooed my entire arm, chest, and other locations just because I suddenly felt like it.  I've done so many things throughout my life that I've lost count. I think this goes back to my interests again; it's a sudden interest and I feel a need to do it, disregarding my safety, calendar, bank account and so on. I'm not as bad now, but I still do most things on whims. 

Night time binge eating - Sometimes I wake up with an insatiable hunger. I'll raid the fridge. It's as if I can't stop eating, and I never feel full. 

This was a bit chaotic, but I hope someone might have insight in what might be the cause for all this. I'm currently stuck in limbo; I don't know where to go, or what to do. I'm slowly withering away. 

If you read this far, I appreciate you taking your time. ",16Jun2018,5

72,"Ever since I was young I've had these kinds of extreme emotional reactions to people where my opinion of them changes from one extreme to the other in a span of hours or even minutes.

Coming in at work on a bad day and a co-worker does something annoying and in my mind I can envision myself acting really bad towards them or screaming at them, then maybe 30 minutes to an hour later I warm up to them and my feelings dissipate and I feel really friendly and warm. I then feel super ashamed in my mind for thinking about being nasty towards them and having such hostile thoughts.

It's like two polar opposite reactions in a span of an hour.

This isn't just regarding people and relationships, it also goes for any kind of activity or event. I either 100% feel against it or I'm all for it.

It's difficult for me to see the grey neutral areas of life. 

These extreme emotional opposites have been in the background of my life for as long as I can remember.

I was reading recently about Borderline personality disorder and one of the hallmarks of it seems to be a kind of love/hate relationship with other people which matches my own experiences very accurately.

78,"Hey, thanks for reading. I know it’s a bit strange but I’m having these weird moments where after a good day, I hop online and all I can think of as a solution to my problems is giving up and killing myself. I just feel defective no matter what I do.

I’m currently:
1. Reading self help books
2. Eating right
3. Exercising regularly
4. Trying to move out of my home town (finding a job first)
5. Quitting where I work now based on 4

I don’t really speak to anyone about anything anymore. The odd chat on reddit since I’ve joined. Tried tinder and bumble to make some friends but that’s not really working. People at work are much older so I can’t relate and they’re not exactly sociable. Tried making friends in the gym and wherever I can meet people but I feel like no one wants to know me.

I’m not exactly weird or crazy or major depressive or anything. I’ve had really good and positive relationships/friendships before so I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me socially. Yet, I can’t seem to make any decent connections. Ever. And as with that evidence I just want to give up really since it makes me feel defective, useless and worthless.

But it’s with anything, no matter how hard I seem to try, I don’t see any desired results. I’m not overweight by any means and have been training in the gym for years and trying to stay on top of my nutrition - yet I still look like shit.

I have a masters degree and I can’t even find a fucking job in any field let alone the one I’ve studied in (chemistry)

And yet people I know seem to have it all. And I’m not jealous and I’m happy for them - it’s just...I always seem to be on the back foot and never have a piece of the pie. Trying but never achieving. Trying harder than most and not getting anywhere. It’s disheartening. Soul destroying more than anything.

Eventually I end up in this cycle where I focus all my effort into just staying alive. Hit rock bottom. Pick myself up. Change something. Try again. Doesn’t work. Hit rock bottom. Change something.... you get the idea.

I’m just sick of it. Any ideas?

I’ve tried traveling but I ended up feelin worse. My eating disorder came back in full swing so I put on a lot of weight, I was barely sleeping because hostels suck as they are. I enjoyed parts of it don’t get me wrong, but I never felt a connection to anyone that I met. I was with great people yet felt so alone.

Now I have considered that it’s most likely me being an ass and not letting people in or something of the sort. (Expecting too much? I don’t know) but I have no idea how to change. Maybe I feel entitled. Who knows.

79,"I’m pretty sure it’s the right word. I’m am speaking about my ability to shift into different ways of thinking that are dramatically different
 Confusing, I need to give an example.

I  did something terrible to someone. I didn’t want to hurt them. However, I hurt them in the worst way I possibly could. It was an ongoing, thing. It’s like I would disassociate from my true feelings and loyalty, because I did love her. I would feel pangs of guilt for a second and then my brain would switch and I was able to hyperfocus on what I wanted to do, and “forget” about her. I honestly can’t explain my thought process. I have problems with detachment and I used to get disassociation, where nothing felt real. 

I have done this other times. I am able to justify my bad behavior extremely well. It is very bad. It has happened, since I was a kid. I used to steal food daily. I didn’t even have guilt about it. I deserved it, in my kid mind. I stole from my parents. *I deserve it, they don’t fulfill me emotionally. I can pay them back later.* I am an adult and I still do that, mainly with my addictions. *I did deserve it, I might hurt someone, but I will make it up to them by getting better later. I am sacrificing my coping tool for them. I deserve a reward.* 

My shrink said I’m narcissistic.,and that kinda rings true, but I don’t think I’m a narcisssit. I have deep empathy. Another shrink told me I was sociopathic. 

I feel like dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde. I’m capable of great kindness. I give until it hurts. I will give you the shirt off my back. However, when I compartamilzd, I am capable of hurting you in the worst way possible. I also have splitting in terms of humans. I hate and love them. At the same time. I also turn around quickly to the point where it’s weids. Like I was fighting with someone who was being extremely mean to me. I was hella pissed and hated him. All of a sudden, I felt sad and sympathy for him. Like what kind of life he must’ve had to be so cold. 

I have a great deal of empathy. It often gets me in trouble. I’m kind of rambling. My point is..this is abnormal. When most people fuck up, I feel like they’re more malicious. Maybe I’m just flattering myself. It really is like I’m disconnected, though.

1) I had some particularly shitty situations with an ex coinciding with the death of several close family members in a very short period in late 2015. This left me with an aversion to connecting deeply with women and it is a problem because I want to get married in the next 5 years and it won't happen with my propensity for ditching the work necessary to connect with someone for work or other personal projects.

2) I have the tendency to avoid progression on relationships and putting meaningful work into long term goals. The main issue with this is that I'm a busy body so my time ends up getting filled with somewhat meaningless ""work"" to keep myself from feeling guilty about doing nothing. The problem is tough to identify because my life involves a meaningful career with people I like, a close friend group and physical fitness, but I have very lofty aspirations that get deflected all the time due to the problem described above.

3) I want to learn how to become a little more content with my life situation because every time I think I've made it to the ""okay all the critical things on your to do list are done, time to get to those things which were put on the back burner"" finish line, my brain struggles to find more critical things to put on that list, keeping me perpetually at some level of ""something important isn't getting done"" stress.

I have been considering sexual health specialists (to deal with the aversions to relationships) and cognitive therapy for the organization of the mind problems, but I want to seek one one therapist who can help me in all of those aspects. What qualifications, experiences and certifications should I look for when considering a professional to help me?",16Jun2018,2
81,"One of my friends committed suicide a few days ago, and I haven't felt right since. What kinds of physical symptoms can anxiety and grief cause? Everything feels so surreal, and I feel almost high. Minor pains, I'm really tired, but I also feel really restless like I MUST move my arms and legs. ",16Jun2018,4
82,"Both are depressed, yet very different.


Person 1: sees the world as a terrible cold, merciless place. Almost forsaken by God. He just wants to do his duties and log out of life forever. He wants to sit alone, eat alone, live alone because no one ever bothered to get to know him. He's still hungry for love but thinks he isn't worthy of it or that it's for normal people. This dude feels nothing but cold.


Person 2: sees the world as a terrible cold, merciless place BUT fixable. He just wants to go out and hug every single person he meets, chat with girls, find new guys to befriend. He sees the world as a bad place but wants to spread the love and just make the most ouf this dark pit. He is bothered by the fact that he has no one but is eager to get intimate with the world and make friends. He's hungry for love and willing to search far and wide for it. This dude feels good despite being depressed


As you can probably tell, it's hard to keep relationships. People don't realize it when they sign up for a relationship with Person Nr2 but he instantly swaps to person Nr1. I am person number 1 80% of the time. When I'm person Nr1 I feel like person Nr2 is fake and cringy. But when I'm person Nr2 for a while I feel like I'm real and that person Nr1 is fake and edgy.


I don't think I have bipolar or any other mental illnesses besides depression. How do I deal with this? Anyone else feel like this?

84,"For some time now, (couldn't tell you how long), I've had little motivation to do anything. As a 21 year old, with a car addiction, and father of a toddler, I have plenty to do and be motivated for. I just can't seem to focus. I feel mentally blocked.  

So, I guess I'm looking for a bit of advice from someone who's going through or has been through this as well. What did you do to knock over this mental wall? Or what have you done to help get yourself up and moving? I'd appreciate any and all advice. ",16Jun2018,5
85,"I am a junior in high school and my mind has been confusing. My thoughts are scattered and I can’t keep an idea for very long. I have been drawing since about forever and I’ve been on writers and artists block for years now. I stoped reading, I used to read a lot but now I don’t and maybe that’s why I lack so much creativity. I can’t think or anything. Forming sentences and paragraphs that make sense is hard. I lose my focus while writing and my thoughts shift. Does anyone else get it where they look at paper and there are these invisible lines that you can but can’t see? I don’t think it counts as schizophrenia because the lines are really really translucent and I can barely see them. I see colors sitting my vision very very faintly and if I move to look at them and they move away. They’re like clear but you can see them and it’s like your mind or instincts are telling you what to draw and weird drawings come out of it. Mine usually consists of jagged lines. I try to focus on these lines and make art but then it gets hard to see the lines and I’m straining to see the lines and draw. I used to be a top student but now I’m not sure what to do because it’s like my mind and talents are disintegrating and the things I felt so passionate about are fading and I still value them but it’s getting so hard and frustrating to do them because my mind is so mixed up and cloudy and confusing and I’m not sure what’s going on with me is this normal. I feel like someone’s reading my mind sometimes. Sometimes I feel I have to choose the correct side of a car to walk around like if I go left I’m sticking with my one of my ex boyfriends and the right side is choosing an ex boyfriend that was abusive. Why do my thoughts get so random I’m sorry for the confusing words.",16Jun2018,1
