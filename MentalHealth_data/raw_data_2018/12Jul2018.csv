0,"I can never be in charge of anything or do anything with real responsibility. I can see myself doing these things and want to but my emotions stop me. I have no idea why it happens but it’s uncontrollable. My voice cracks and I get teary eyed. If it gets worse I’ll cry but I’d been able to avoid that for awhile. I’ve tried meds, therapy, eating this or that, etc but nothing ever seems to work. 

 You’ve seen grown men that are shy and timid but have you ever seen a grown man break down over the slightest sign of trouble? It leads to me quitting many jobs because it’s so embarrassing. People tend to eventually start walking over me at jobs because they’ll see that I won’t challenge them at all. Wether they realize it or not it it always eventually happens. I can’t even talk to someone higher up about it cause the same emotional response happens. So I get fed up with people walking over me and just end up quitting my job. I have no problem talking to people or just being normal otherwise.",12Jul2018,0,
1,"I feel as if I’m watching a simulator or looking through a lens and not actually doing the things I’m doing,  sometimes I will even be holding something and physically can’t feel it or lose coordination.
What is this? Please ",12Jul2018,1,
2,"This is going to be long so if you don't want to read it then I understand.  


 I’m in a state of not wanting to live but not wanting to die. For some background on me, I'm almost 18 and currently clinically diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD. The latter control my life and put me in a state of not wanting to exist. 

I’m scared and am sure my partner isn’t interested in me anymore. We’ve been in a LDR for just over a year and we met the other day but she has avoided contact with me the whole time. She will touch my friends and hug them but I feel like she’s disgusted by me. I hate myself so much and don’t feel like I’m worth anything. She knows what she’s doing and we’ve spoken about it as a group and I’ve stopped being clingy as her friend has told me that it makes her uncomfortable. I’m not sure what to do or if anything makes sense. I feel like I want to crawl into a hole and disappear, I crave affection so much and feel like I always have to be loved but at the same time I hate it because of how attached I get and frustrating I can be. I grew up with an alcoholic mother until a few years ago and have a fear of drinking or drunk people. My partner also likes drinking and I always ruin it for her. I’m always scared and can’t talk to her but at the same time I worry that she’s not safe and I don’t know what to do. I’m a mess and don’t even know if this makes sense, I need help.   


 Secondly back when I was around 12 I had a friend that I was really close to, we liked the same things and did almost everything together. I was always outgoing and despite the arguments we had like kids do, we remained friends for a few more years before growing up and having our own groups of friends.

Back when I was younger I didn’t realise how much I put up with while being friends with her. She would get violent if she was in a bad mood, biting and hitting. She was bigger than me and always portrayed herself as the one in charge. She used to make fun of the things I was interested in but I ignored it and figured it was all part of being friends. However after a while I started having nightmares about her where she would brutally stab me and kill me. I was still only around 12 when these started. We spoke about shit like that after I’d had my first dream and she explained to me that she wouldn’t kill me but if she did it would be with a “medium sized kitchen knife.” This was without me telling her anything about the dream itself. So naturally I was freaked out but brushed it off as much as I could. It was around this time that I had started develop symptoms of ocd and was later diagnosed after a few years so I was skittish and still am to this day.

However, I don’t see her anymore. She’s a druggie and doesn’t talk to me but I keep having nightmares about her hurting me or just being near me or someone forcing me to talk to her. I’m terrified of her and get uncomfortable if I see her even from a distance.

Is there something wrong with me or is it just my anxiety acting up? I don’t know what to do because she’s always on my mind and I hate it. I just want to forget about it all.

I've noticed myself going downhill a lot recently. I've never been an angry person but recently I've started to snap at people even if they're just trying to help me. I know it's bad and I know I should do it but I still do. I'm losing interest in everything and get pissed off over the most simple things. I can go from being in a good mood to suddenly wanting to tell my friends to fuck off and never talk to me again. I hate it so much and it's not me, I've never been like this and it scares me. I don't want to be nasty but it just comes out and I can't stop it. I feel like I should feel guilty about being mean to people but I don't. I'm just angry and empty but so full of emotions at the same time. I need help, what the fuck is wrong with me? ",12Jul2018,2,
3,"I really don’t know where to begin. 
I have been married for 18months but with him for 10yrs to a lovely man.
Previously my relationships were abusive one way or another so felt lucky to find someone who loved me. 

Now I have an issue! 
After suffering mental health issues recently, I have been getting professional help and have started realising I’m an ok person and deserve to be happy. 

I think I have fallen in love with my female best friend. 
I have known her now for around 4 years. She just seemed great to begin with. Now is a true person who I trust entirely and I communicate with daily.

But, even just now I came across an app that suggests those kinds of things and like... as I saw it I felt myself shrink away from it from like inside me.... why am I (late20's/f) so afraid of things that could help me not feel so depressed. I'm scared of that stuff, I'm scared of addressing the ptsd stuff, I'm scared of confronting the dad stuff.... I'm so afraid of some of this shit that certain topics cause me to have seizure-like panic attacks. I don't even know the proper name for them. 

Why am I so afraid of this shit? Even just making a simple list makes me shrink away and I avoid it.",12Jul2018,1,
5,"Writing an attractive post is always difficult. Nevertheless I'll give a rough summary. Dealing with agoraphobia, depression and social anxiety. Not working at the moment so plenty of time to communicate. I don't play video games or watch much Netflix. I have nothing against either it's simply that I have lost interest. Pretty intensive when it comes to friendships or relationships from the beginning. Not a strong small talk connoisseur but it you want deep and long lasting conversation I am the guy for you.

The mental health stuff that came up resonated with me, and the story is the only thing I’ve been interested in in a month (my depression has taken away my interest in anything else lately). My mood journal has drawings in the same style and I’ve been listening to the music a lot, one could easily say I’m obsessed with it lately. But now I’m finished with it, and I’m not sure what to do/think. I feel so weird for feeling this way towards just a game, and am just wondering if these feelings are okay...",12Jul2018,0,
7,"My life for the last 5 years has consisted of me sitting at home all day almost every day. For reasons outside of my control that thankfully will be resolved within this year hopefully, I can't work or go to school. I'm under a lot of stress, and have been for the last 6 years. I'm in a position where I can't express myself freely without adding even more stress on not only myself but my husband as well, who is also clinically depressed, but is medicated. I've never been able to get therapy or medication for again, reasons outside of my control. I've started having violent fantasies and dreams about other people in my life who are the main contributors to my stress. I'm scared I'm going to have a mental breakdown or black out, and when I wake up I'll have done something terrible. I've gotten close a few times, where my skin feels like it's on fire and my ears start ringing. Usually I leave the situation before it goes any further, but the fact that it gets to that point scares me. I can't and won't force my husband to deal with the stressers on his own, that's not fair. I just don't know what to do, I feel like my mind is deteriorating at a pace that is going to leave me as an empty husk before I'm 25 (I'm 22).

I once had someone tell me “If someone is suicidal or depressed, they’re the type to shoot up a school.”, I don’t think that’s true at all and was personally offended by that statement. I’ve had a history of Depression and Anxiety Disorder, so for someone to say that without getting to even know me, made me feel alone and hopeless. Why are so many scared of those who struggle with mental illness? Is it just lack of understanding? Sometimes I feel like we’re almost social outcasts...",12Jul2018,1,
10,"I suffer from both depression and anxiety, both of which stem from my fear of death. I was brought up in a strict Christian household, going to church every Sunday and forced to pray every night before bed. I had believed that if I had faith in God and retained my Christian values then I would go to heaven. It wasn't until the age of about thirteen that I began to think for myself and question everything, including the existence of God and the possibility of an afterlife itself. After a while of contemplating and trying to gather any possible evidence of the existence of any higher power at all, I became Agnostic because *I just don't know*. I'm not certain that a higher power exists, but I really hope one does. Whenever I think of death, I think *nothing*. No consciousness, no feeling, no sense of self, void. And that honestly scares me more than anything. To this day, I long for the promise of an afterlife, or straight up immortality. I just can't imagine not existing. I tried to distract myself by simply living my life and that was working out well until recently.

About two months ago, I had an allergic reaction to something I ate and I thought to myself *this is it, I'm really gonna die tonight.* All I could think about was the inevitable void that awaits and the fact that neither my s/o nor my family (all of whom I do not *ever* want to be separated from) were there for me to say my last goodbyes to. I was immensely thankful to have survived that but for the next several weeks, all I could think about was death and the fact that I could be gone at any given moment. I was in my head 24/7 for days on end and had constant panic attacks. I thought I had gotten better a few weeks later but then I was presented with another health scare. I found a lump in my breast and immediately panicked, but calmed down after doing some research and coming to the conclusion that I'm far too young to have breast cancer (20). I still went in for an ultrasound and four different medical professionals told me that they're 99.99999&amp;#37; certain it's benign because of my age, the characteristics of the lump, and the fact that I have no symptoms. I'm still going in for a biopsy just to be sure but the earliest appointment I was able to get is still two weeks away which gives me more time to panic.

All I've been able to think about lately is death. I often find myself too depressed to get out of bed in the morning, and too hysterical to go to sleep. I have panic attacks and extreme emotional outbursts throughout the day, and even when I'm spending time with my s/o, who always makes me immensely happy, all I could think about is how dying means losing him too and that makes me panic even more. I haven't gone to therapy in years because I really can't afford it but this is really ruining my life. I feel like even if I do stop thinking about death, I will be merely distracted and my inevitable demise will still be there. I'm absolutely terrified and I don't see any way of solving this.",12Jul2018,2,

12,"I’m a 17f, living in a small town in the United States of America. I have a lot of symptoms that may of may not be related, so I’ll start with a list and then explain 

My main issues are periods of time in which I’m extremely happy, basically in ecstasy, followed by periods of extreme sadness and feelings of worthlessness and an inability to deal with basic emotions or tasks. My memory is so bad that I think there’s something wrong with it, so I’m not sure exactly how long these periods last, but it seems like about 3-5 months.

When in the “sad” state I feel like even breathing is more than I can handle doing, I get back pain, insomnia, exhaustion, migraines, and worse memory loss and confusion. I also tend to become even more afraid of those around me than usual (which is already too much). I fantasize about killing my self very vividly and descriptively, and about what people would think if I told them what I’m feeling. Then there are these strange moments where for hours at a time I simply stop feeling any emotion at all, and I find it impossible to fake any reaction to anything, someone could run up to me and stab me in the gut and I’d just stand there. I have attempted cutting twice (succeeded once, couldn’t get a blade the second time), and once spent almost three hours staring at, feeling, and even tasting a large kitchen knife trying to convince myself to stab myself and just get it over with.

Regardless of which state I’m in I project love onto whoever I spend a lot of time with, only to realize upon beginning to switch states that I never loved the guy at all. I’ve also tried to go to a therapist before, then just ended up convincing them that I’m totally fine just enough for them to let me go, even though I’m clearly desperate for help.

Anyway, the bottom line is that I’m wondering why this is all happening, what I can do to stop it, and if it’s normal or not, because people seem to think that this sort of thing is just a part of growing up but I can’t see this being normal.",12Jul2018,1,
13,"I wanted to write this out, because writing things out is always way easier than trying to talk about it out loud but I've struggled with serious issues for awhile, but something happened recently that has made me realize that I might be in serious trouble and I need to know what is wrong. 

I found a full time job recently after 2 years of working a part time job and on my 3rd day I quit. I had pulled an all nighter that night because I was up all night puking my guts out and worrying about the 3 billion tasks I somehow had to figure out how to do in the next few months. I was in really bad shape. I remember my hands were ice cold, my whole body was hot, my head was throbbing, I could barely do basic things like write my name or even say a single word to anyone. And the sheer amount of panic and paranoia I was feeling was unbearable. So I quit. Partly because I was afraid of passing out in the middle of the work place and partly because no paycheck is really worth my sense of sanity. It wasn't the flu- it happened at 90% of my jobs, the 1st job I had I accidentally went days without showering or even eating. 

Its not that I dont want to have a full time job, its just it feels like my brain wont let me. I'm screwed if I cant figure out how to find a full time job. But it always feels like my head is full of cotton balls or that theres a wall separating me from everything else. Sometimes certain things make me feel stupid, like if people are talking to fast or trying to verbally give me directions I'll have no idea what they are talking about. I like talking to people. and I like having something to do but I like doing those things at my own pace and a full time job gives me so little control over my schedule that it just throws my whole life out of line and can't figure out how to find some sort of balance for myself. 

I've also increasingly (but try to block out) noticed that I feel people kinda look at me like I'm psychotic or like a druggie ( I'm neither) for instance I really like wandering around stores and looking at product. it has an oddly therapeutic effect. (fred meyers is my favorite. or the mall) I also like to listen to music and literally walk in circles, or walk around outside if I can. for a good hour, maybe two.) I also love anything that let's me stare into space for literally hours, like, absolutely love it. Or little things like a lot of times people will say something to me (especially if they try to play tease) and I'll just stare at them. 

I've been to drs, therapists, behavioral classes, and the only thing I've gotten is depression, but idk if that is right. I'm sorry if this sounds rushed I had to retype everything because I accidentally exited out. If anyone can relate, or has some tips or advice, leave a comment, because I'm at the end of my rope. Things might get really bad for me if I dont figure something out. ",12Jul2018,2,

She later told me my way of thinking, which is that it is her body and her life and she owes me no explanation is a bad way of thinking. She said she felt I treated her like a stranger. I do feel hurt that she cheated but I was just in her way she wanted the other guy anyway. I don't want her to feel bad about not wanting someone else more. ",12Jul2018,0,
15,"When I'm not at home I'm typically very respectful and kind to everybody. When I'm at home I don't put up with ANYTHING. I obviously respect my mother; my father not at all considering he does nothing but drink... but that's a story for another day. But I don't put up with anything from my siblings/other people when I'm home. I'll be 100% honest and tell people I can't stand them/or that they're being really obnoxious/acting like an absolute idiot.

I'm a big counter-strike player. It's a VERY competitive online game. I will typically tell bad players that they suck and if somebody loses a round because they made a dumb decision I'll tell them they made a stupid play and ask them to try and take the game more seriously to win. Considering I'm a pretty good player people usually get mad around me because I'm honest and don't lie to make people feel better. I do try to make myself come off as somebody who isn't a jerk because I don't MEAN to be rude but I don't like the thought of lying to people. The fact that people typically don't take criticism too well doesn't help. They usually end up trying to argue with me

When I'm at school, every now and again I'll act like my home-self. I feel like my ""rude"" personality usually comes about when people are stupid/ignorant or are just rude and annoying. I can't stand stupid people. It gives me a headache talking to an ignorant person. I think that online there is an abundance of people like that online which may contribute to why I am like I am at home. I think some people feel intimidated by me when I'm honest with them and usually end up getting really defensive. I don't know.. I feel like something is wrong with me... It's not like I don't have any friends or people that I talk to. I have a tight circle of friends all of which share respect for one another. I just feel like I'm different than most people simply because I'm not the kind of person to try and preserve other peoples feelings if that makes sense....

For the past 7 years I have struggled with this, but because I was a teenager pushed it out of my mind and passed it off as just a normal teen thing (even though I was aware that when I could sleep was much different than my friends). The first experience with sleep paralysis that I can recall I was probably 7 years old. I experience it quite often, not always experiencing visions mainly voices and pressure on my chest, feelings of choking or falling, and things of the like. Lately it is only getting worse and worse. I started to get night terrors, which my mother didn't understand until we were in the same room on vacation and she woke to me screaming and couldn't wake me until many seconds later. I hear voices before I sleep now almost every night (I usually can get to sleep around 4:30 or 5AM and sleep until 9 or 10) which I have since found out to be hypnagogic hallucinations. This can be things like hearing my dad yelling my name from upstairs when I'm home alone or random voices sounding like they are circling my head. Just this past night, I woke up into sleep paralysis twice, in ONE night. It feels like every night I go to sleep unsure of what will happen. I'm trying to decide what to do. I've made an appointment for another sleep study (my last was inconclusive) and am waiting on that, but if it has the same results as the last I know I need a back up plan.

19,"I think I might have OCD. Not the OCD mentioned by everyone about anything mildly unsatisfying, but actual OCD. So, for my whole life, I've had many different quirks. When I was younger, I had this insatiable urge to jerk my head downwards. It got to the point where I would give myself headaches from shaking my head so much. I just couldn't resist doing it, but, luckily, I grew out of it. A problem I still experience today is having to make small humming noises in long silences, or clearing my throat. Even though I try not to, I can't help it. Especially when I'm falling asleep, it's the worst. I also experience smaller things like the urge to read words in a book over and over again. Sometimes I'll read over a paragraph, and then, even though I finished the paragraph, I HAVE to go back and read it again for some reason. Or I repeat words over and over. Another issue is the need to touch things over and over again. I might touch a piece of cool metal, and then I'll touch it again. And again. And again. And if someone calls me over to do something else, I need to touch it one more time before I leave. I also am constantly thinking of very painful social situations and worrying about the way I act. I don't have classic symptoms such as excessive hand-washing or a need for symmetry in everything, but, from the little research I've done, many of the issues I experience are also symptoms of OCD. I was hoping to get a professional opinion on here from someone on whether or not they think I might OCD or some other disorder. Thank you.",12Jul2018,2,

22,"Of course, I will not tell you my personal information, like my credit card number or my social security. But I will tell you about what happened after it all began.

*Note: I am not here to debate beliefs or any other subject matter. I am simply here to tell you my story.*

I am growing up in a Christian fundamentalist household. Being a Christian for 14 years of my life has been good until I saw all that the fundamentalism was doing to my life. I wanted to be an artist. I am bisexual. I am the only liberal in my family. After a point in time during last year, I decided to open my world up a little. It was no longer a game of isolation and studying an ancient text--now, I had come to fully embrace myself. I am an atheist.

That doesn't do very well with my family's beliefs despite my older brother also being atheist.

I live in fear constantly. I live in fear of many things, really. I fear my parents finding out I'm bisexual. I fear my parents finding out I'm more liberal than they'd like. Fear. Fear fear fear. And anger, too. I just don't want anything to do with this reality anymore.

I also forgot to tell you (*this may be a bit of a trigger up ahead, so* ***be warned****):* I have POCD. 

Top off that cake for me, will you...

There is a subreddit on here where I've posted about POCD, but I'm too tired to link it at the moment. But for now, I will try and go through what life has been like being the odd one out, the ""sinner,"" the ""intellectual.""

I've always been an artsy guy. I need art to survive. But my POCD gets in the way. My perfectionism gets in the way. When I wake up, the first thing I get is an intrusive thought. I try to distract myself all day, but in the end, I go straight back to the thoughts. When I'm by myself--trying to work on my art or homework--the thoughts come up. 

  
However, my social circle is very limited.

I have two close friends. My family is the closest thing to a social life. And when they say things that I believe in are stupid or just wrong (like everyone does within their own spheres of belief), I feel down. Undermined. Stupid. 

My friends rarely hang out with me. One is on a trip right now. The other is very busy over the summer. It's too bad. I really want them to hang out with me, as it's one of my remedies for anxiety. But, alas, I've asked multiple times in the past, each time disappointed when I am left on read or declined with a ""I have to work"" or ""I have something to do."" They're not bad friends--it's just they actually have the capacity to *do* stuff. They have jobs. They have money. They can drive (well, *one* can). They're both in a relationship. I just feel like the third wheel. Outside of their timeline. Irrelevant. 

A ghost.

Same with my family, other than my mom or, sometimes, my younger brother. My dad is a difficult person to deal with sometimes--whenever he's around, my anxiety flares up badly. Then I feel guilty. Then I get irritable. But oh man, I feel like I have to change my beliefs on the spot sometimes just to not start an emotional riot. It's difficult. 

Right now, life is just a downhill slope.

I have thought about me not being in this world. How many people I would save (as my POCD tries to trick me into). How many conflicts I would resolve (with my family). How many burdens would be lifted (for my friends). Though these are just things that pop up when I'm squirming in bed trying to mentally run away from the thoughts.  These don't happen frequently, and I've never planned anything because I don't feel that way. A big part of me says, ""There's gotta be some way.""

All my life, I've felt defective. Introverted. Empath. Highly sensitive. Underappreciated. I am not able to register any amount of positivity. Told I was a sinner all my growing up, threatened with hell. The only way I was able to feel good was if I prayed about it, but now that I am free from a controlling, conforming sect, I am hurting. Yes, I follow Recovering from Religion and talk to my therapist about it, but I'm still stuck with my family. Grew up in a sex negative environment and have not had sex-ed in such a long time, so now, I feel like I'm not ready for any type of sexual relationship in college (this is not so important to me, but if it happens, I want to be safe.) I've been dealing with self doubt and people-pleasing tendencies all my life. I've had anxiety since I was 11-12. I'm 16 now. I just got OCD last year. I've had some depressive episodes (mainly during OCD periods). I don't know. I just don't know what to say.

I've had so many accomplishments, but I can't seem to register them. I like to make the parallel to me as a defective robot. First, he starts of with faulty coding--he absorbs everything that drains his batteries. Then, his code runs like crazy. That's me. My mind is running a million miles an hour with 95&amp;#37; negative thoughts. I just want the negativity to stop. I want the POCD thoughts to stop. I want to live like a normal human being. I want to have friends who will be there for me. I seriously cannot believe that even after I explained to my friends that I am going through a hard phase in my life, the one who could be available decides not to hang out. I guess I haven't really made clear to them how painful this is. 

If anyone wants to PM me to just talk about this, then please, do so. I'm in need of some positive contact. Someone who will listen. I have therapy next week, so I'll also have time to get treated for some of the things I've been holding back out of fear. And sorry if any of this is overbearing. Just know that I'm going to keep that soliloquy playing in my mind: ""There's  gotta be some way.""",12Jul2018,1,
23,"Hey guys, for the past 3 years, (for some reason) I’ve felt abosolutly horrible. Here are a majority of the symptoms ive experienced (Most of which have worsened):

-I no longer experience the joy I once had while pursuing my passions.
-I struggle to do things I was once good at. (Some abilities I’ve even lost completely.) 
-I forget everything within a matter of seconds.
- My thought proccess has extremely slowed.
-I struggle to convey my thoughts into words.
-I’m easily confused.
-I sometimes act without forethought.
-My level of personal hygiene has decreased.
-I get anxiety over ridiculous thoughts.
- I feel as though I’m living life with a glass pane in front of me. 
-I have sudden changes in my mood or personality. 
-I have the inability to cry, though I can feel sadness.
-I’m easily frustrated.

I have no clue how I’ve gotten to this point. Perhaps I’ve been doing something wrong, or maybe I developed something. Anyway, I’m open to suggestions or opinions on what you think isn’t functioning properly within me. Thanks!

25,"For as long as I can remember I've had issues with getting too obsessive over crushes. I can't stop thinking about potential romantic situations, even if I've been rejectes or the idea of a relationship would be   inappropriate for other reasons, such as work ethics or the other person being unavailable. I don't think that I've ever truly let go of a crush, I just start thinking less and less about it once the person is out of my life, but the feelings usually return if I'm ever reminded of a person.

I find that this obsessive thought pattern causes me distress, because the unrequited crushes make me feel anxious and sad, yet I can't stop feeling it. Is this how it is usually for people or am I just weirdly obsessive?

31,"Hi everyone

I'm posting from a throwaway because this is honestly a humiliating problem for me.

So for most of my life, i've struggled with depression and Anxiety. They've been with me for as long as I can remember and i've learned that how to deal and manage with them.

A few years back, I developed an issue with talking and speaking. I would frequently forget words, stutter, or most egregiously, call people by another persons name. This problem cleared up after a small shift in my medication, and i still sometimes trip up over words but its not as bad as it was.

Two to Three months ago, I developed a difficulty comprehending things I was reading. It started with rules text in games I play, but eventually reached the point my partner (who is long distance and communicates mostly through text chats like discord) said to me that she felt i was not properly paying attention to her messages and misunderstanding.

I went to my psych 2 days ago, and they diagnosed me with a cognitive dysfunction affecting my reading comprehension. It makes sense with my struggles over the past few months. The best way to say it is my mind seems to remove or add words at random to the text im reading.

This is humiliating and very upsetting for me. My hobbies, board gaming and card gaming, my job, media based, and relationships are all text focused. I also worry about my condition deteriorating and my understanding getting weaker. Recently i played a new board-game with a close friend and had to read a segment of the rules out loud multiple times before i could grasp it.

I fear losing my ability to read entirely. I recognize part of this is because of my paranoia that i've got, but im afraid of losing my cognitive abilities. I dont know, i am beginning to ramble.

I've started a treatment of Concerta today, and im hoping it helps me grasp the things im reading better.

I just wanted this off my chest

32,"Hello all!

Long story short, I am what you call a Highly Sensitive Person. I have three psychiatric diagnoses, which I won't get into now. My problem is that during this period literally everyone around me are very depressed, and it seems like the only time they contact me is when they need support. It's at the level where I only get frustrated when I hear about their problems. So I fake it, and usually that turns to real within 10 minutes.   


These people have a tendency to make contact around 10 pm, when all I need to do is sleep (I get up to work at 6). If I don't reply I notice their disappointment or distance in conversation afterward, and sometimes they stop contacting you for long periods of time. I apologize (don't feel like I should have to), and ""ofc it's ok, it was late"", but you can tell it really isn't. *I feel I have to make it up by being there* ***more****.*   


Many of these people are family members, without friends or anyone to talk to, from broken backgrounds with their own diagnoses. At any point where I do not reply or feel like I don't want to, I get worried that they're gonna hurt themselves, directly, or with alcohol and drugs etc, or simply just be very disappointed with me.  


I have painted up this image of myself where I'm like ""ofc I'll be there for you, contact me if things are bad"", but that to me still means they should keep it at a somewhat normal level, and also try to maintain a normal relationship with me.

During this time, I am also very depressed, and I don't have many friends I connect with and I'm just not sure how I should maintain MY life. Help? Any recommendations are welcome.

34,"I originally went in for ADHD. My depression is my normal so I thought nothing of it and ADHD runs in my family. They prescribed me Adderall which was nice. It doesn't really do much though. Other than I was more aware that I feel empty more often than not. So I talked to them about that. They said I was depressed. 

Then they prescribed me Zoloft and I got super irritable and angry for the first week or two. I don't remember the timeline it was more of a blur than anything. 

But after the extreme irritability, I got extremely happy like singing and dancing on my walk to work. People at work were complimenting me. I got work done. I also couldn't track time I don't even know how long it lasted. All I really remember was that at some point it felt wrong. Everything felt wrong. I had two voices in my head. One telling me something was wrong, another singing out into the world that everything felt right. I flushed the pills and told the Doc I'm done and left it at that. 

I gave up at that point. Every since then Ive felt more acutely aware that I'm getting more and more depressed. But I have zero energy to do anything about it. Every once in awhile I feel amazing. I started investing money and had this grand plan and delusion that I was going to make millions be the next Warren buffet. I put all my money into it. Luckily I could pull out at a later date. Without losing all my money. 

Other delusions pop up every once in awhile. Like one time with gambling I thought I could see the future on a roulette table I flushed a thousand dollars in an instant. But most of the time it goes away quick enough and I'm not in a position where anything is feasible so no real damage is done. 

But it's happening more and more often. Sometimes I get into these odd moods where I feel wired but also have no energy. I just want to go go go but feel so heavy. It creates this dissonance that feels like I'm tearing myself apart. I get irritable and say things to people and also my very good friend that I don't mean and half the time aren't even true. I've started contemplating suicide. Not even contemplating. I have an entire plan. I feel pretty good about it. Which I think should scare the fuck out of me. But even now typing it out all I feel is that it's right thing to do. 

I don't know what's going on. I don't want to go back to the mental health people and have those major mood shifts happen to me again. I'm tired and just want to go to sleep. I don't know what to do.",12Jul2018,1,

I am sick of therapists' invalidation and I am becoming more insecure with going to therapy because of their excuse-makings.
The one thing I like about that therapist however, is that they are always cool about whatever they say and it's never emotionally-charged, and even if it is it is mostly very subtle.

39,"To start things off I have zero sexual attraction to corpses. I am intensely attracted romantically/emotionally to the dead. I fall in love with beautiful, attractive dead women to the point its almost as if I want a relationship with a deceased person. I believe in an afterlife so for me, I think that they are still here with us and possibly a bit of their soul remains in their body after death, sort of like animism. I sometimes envision corpses as having a white, glowing aura around them of their soul remnants still contained inside their flesh. I dream of girls I am attracted to as sleeping or unconscious, and cuddling with them to the point I would no longer  feel lonely. I'm attracted romantically to living women, too, but I'd have to say I would prefer a deceased one if I had the chance. For me, being socially inept plays a huge role in this. I know I'm almost incapable of having a real girlfriend, so in my head a deceased or unconscious one would be ideal since there would be no fear of rejection or judgment. I've been socially isolated for years and my loneliness has gotten so bad that I feel physically drained and have trouble sleeping.

Since theres no sexual attraction, would this classify as some form of necrophilia or another term? I know theres several different terms starting with ""necro"" so I'm not sure what the label for my attraction would be.

45,"Today I find out if my employer will give me my reasonable accommodation.

It has been an uphill battle filled with a lot uncertainty and anxiety. When I first started the job, my boss allowed everyone to work from home as needed as long as we had our work done. This autonomy was great for me, because I could work work home when I had flair ups and panic attacks.i disclosed to my coworkers and boss that o had a disability but didnt get into specifics. I even became the lead our first Disability business resource group and was advocating for others with disabilities. I was thriving, up until my boss quit and the VP became my direct supervisor. 

At first it was fine, and the VP applauded my work.  Until I had two flair ups in one week and worked from home two days. She questioned why and I told her it was due to my disability. She let it go, but me being an advocate I wanted to tell her my story. When I told her I had OCD and panic. her demeanor changed immediately. She started laying down edicts that we could only wfh once a week and it had to be scheduled in advance. She started micromanaging me and coming down hard on me for minor mistakes that are common in my line of work. She even made me cry.

At this point I went to hr and asked for a reasonable accommodation to wfh when needed, but little did I know my VP was friends with everyone. They had my doctor out one form, when I sent it to them they said they no longer needed that and needed an entirely new form filled out. Once I had that form, they asked my doctor to fill out an additional form that required him to specify EXACTLY when I would have flair ups and panic attacks and for how long. My VP also said that while this process is running its course , I needed to take the day off and use my sick days even though I could work, but couldn't drive. So I have been using up my PTO and vacation time.

3 months in and yesterday I had enough. I went to the top and emailed my experience to the head of HR. Within minutes she responded and said that by the end of today I will get my answer.

I love my job, I'm good at it. This is the first time I've stood up for myself. I'm afraid of what will happen. I love in an at will employment state and I know that the VP already dislikes me. I'm worried she has friends in the highest of places and I will lose my job today.

I've been confused since I got off my antidepressants (because of the side effects), trying to treat myself in more natural ways.

The point is: since I know myself, I have trouble caring for the News, and I have trouble caring or being interested in most of the conversations.

But things were different when I smoked. My empathy went huge, I was so interested in so many things and very social. Weed is the only thing that helps my shitty libido (but I enjoy masturbation), to the point that I may start searching for sex in this state of mind.

When we reached middle school puberty affected them way more than it did me (I still had it, like boobs, period, etc.) Except next thing I know their dating boys and girls every week and one's suffering from depression and the other (I'll call ""Lia"" cause this post is about her) suddenly cares about her weight even though it didn't affect her in elementary. I don't think I changed much (no crushes, no dating) my biggest problem was I couldn't be open about anything; I never said I love you like they did, I never talked about boys like they did, and I would never say my insecurities out loud like they did, they both came out to me about their bisexuality but when mine came to question I would just say I was asexual to avoid it. I still feel like I can't help with any of their problems.

So ""Lia"" has always been more overweight than the rest of us. It was just a thing, it didn't matter cause we were all overweight in elementary. I didn't notice how bad it got until I looked at older pictures of her. She always ate a lot of food but I know it's not her fault because we all had hard times that we coped with in different ways. Starting in eighth grade when we'd have to get undressed in the locker rooms, Lia would start commenting on my body, like how skinny I was and how fat she was. I was always silent when this discussion came up because I was still overweight (I'm just a small person in general) but it was my problem that I would deal with by myself.

Lia has since developed asthma and sleep apnea. In 7th grade she told me she was 200lb and 270 now  it didn't help that she was also the shortest one in the group. Still I never said anything about her binging or having self esteem-issues. I was so awkward that I couldn't even tell her that I was there for her I could only grab and drag her outside when no one noticed her having panic attacks in the corners of school dances. I just told myself it was hormonal and would go away when we were adults. In the past year at school she refuses to eat lunch, and starts talking about going on days without food. All I did was slip into conversations that anorexics lost hair and bulimics had rotting teeth (her hair and teeth have always been nice)  instead of having a heart to heart with her. 

Anyway, I visited her this summer and she seemed fine, she ate normal and seemed really happy to see me. She still remarked about me being skinny when I was changing but I'm hoping it wasn't a put down to herself since I had a conquest to lose the extra weight I had over the summer and she knew about it.

Because of Instagram I'm constantly informed about the US and I don't even live there and I'm just devasted it affects me so much and the hate in general, not only in the US

And I just got madder and madder and I've already been in a really bad mental condition that's getting worse. About half a year ago I collected the courage to tell my mom about my mental health and I wanted to get therapy, but I'm still not getting any help. Now we're moving in about a month and it's gonna be a lot of driving and tons of stress.... I've just gone through this last year and had a nervous breakdown, I can't support this

I have to wait until after we'll move and only then I could get therapy... But I'm afraid not much would change, because my mother is the queen of procastination AND there would probably be a waiting list for therapy, who knows how long it'd take until I'd get the help I need... I'm considering online therapy during the wait, but only after moving because here I don't have privacy and a good wifi connection in one place... 

Right now I wanna know how I can calm down in this moment, because I don't like how fast my heart is beating and I can barely breathe right now

If I lay down, draw Mandala, play piano or something everything just comes into my head again. I can't contain this shit anymore ",12Jul2018,1,

Yes, you will have bad days…..BUT make sure you are keeping track of your thoughts.  Preventing a Major Depressive episode is much easier than coming out of one.  Ask yourself, when is the last time I showered?  Did I brush my teeth today?  Am I drinking too much alcohol? Am I drinking or using a substance too often?  Have I done something productive?",12Jul2018,2,
61,"As was my experience, yet I still was not close to completely better.",12Jul2018,3,
62,"I'll try and keep this as brief as possible because it's long.

Recovered alcoholic for 13 years tomorrow. Dealt with bad depression afterwards, was on anti depressants for almost 10 years \[paxil\]. 

Decided one day I would come off \[last August\] them only tapering for 7 days \[upon my general practitioners request smh\] needless to say that 2 months was a terrible time for me with the withdrawls. They say you need a stable lifestyle to come off them, during that phase. Well it wasn't and a bunch of bad stuff happened. Anyways

Then in January I went to a psychologist and we did EMDR and she revealed to me that I suffered child abuse \[which also made sense to me\]. after 2 sessions I started getting really bad anxiety attacks and panic attacks. I am still not on anti depressants but they switched my ADHD meds afterward. I also gave up drinking caffeine because of this which helped a lot with the attacks they occur less frequently now but I still have them.

My problem now is that I seem to hold my breath a lot and not breathe properly, my resting heart rate is always really high \[lying down it's like 96-100 most of the time\]. I go to the gym every day and do cardio and it slows it down a bit but not much. Does anyone have similar experiences ? Is this maybe my body adjusting with not being on anti depressants anymore? I also lost close to 40 pounds since last year since I came off them too. I also have a really hard time winding down at night to go to sleep

It's also not ideal because I work out of town by myself all the time with no co workers.

The self care things I do: 

1. Meditate twice a day \[when waking up then before sleep\]
2. Pray several times a day
3. Go to AA meetings
4. Talk on the phone to a friend once a day or twice a day \[I often cry every day when I talk to someone about myself\]
5. Staying single because I know I have to in my life right now

I also have really low self esteem I don't know how to really build that up anymore.  If anyone has any suggestions or experiences regarding the high pulse and the not breathing properly let me know. I know the not breathing properly thing was happening before I did the EMDR. Thanks Reddit &lt;3",12Jul2018,2,

65,"maybe i just need to vent this one out over text and wont even post this and i dont wanna make it super long. 23 yr old Male, feeling like the girl ive been seeing the last year or so has attached so hard to me that it's moving too fast. i should just man up and tell her we should slow things down, but i dont want to change her perspective of me because she's a great girl, almost too great. always do more than she needs to, to the point where it's borderline frustrating and i tell her that.

anyways, i've been cheating on this girl like pretty much every girl that i have had since 15 or 16 whenever we start dating now adays. It's a tough thing to type out and admit to the internet, nothing to be proud of but I grew up surrounded by the hip hop culture and so that sort of conditioned me to look at women in a certain way, not to mention sexual abuse (molestation) from a family member as a child multiple times, mixed in with an abusive step dad and bi polar mother. Life was really tough growing up, I made it through sober and focused but once I turned 18 and finished High School I started smoking weed and my subconscious trauma really started opening up, some would say the demons came out. I love smoking weed, but I do think it's become an inhibitor to my clear, sober mind. I dont think with everything I've been through it's good for me. I get really lustful and ""horny"" when I come down off weed, which I've heard is normal, but I've went as far as to have sex with a transvestite because of how low of a point I was at with smoking and being lonely from my ex that had a baby with another guy, or is about to. by no means does that excuse my actions, I went through a lot of shame and depression for doing that. But through my use of LSD, I was able to sort of rid myself of that guilt and really apologize to myself and my soul for what I had done, I've also let a 2nd Transvestite give me head which is also not cool because I basically relapsed to what made me feel so guilty initially. I am by no means homosexual and have no physical or sexual attraction towards males but again I feel like with the social conditioning of the media and society, I have become a byproduct and exactly what they want to morph me into. Through having to go through molestation as a child, I always knew I was never gay and eventually realized what happened to me wasnt right. I've told my mom and my cousin, because it's her brother... and I didn't want her kids to see him so I was proud of my ability to step in and let it be known that dude's a monster.

Anyways guys and gals, I hope I didnt make your head spin with this last long paragraph. I would consider myself to be very intellectual and keen to my surroundings, in other words; I feel like I'm 36 living in a 23 year olds body watching him waste his happiness and precious time away through Lust for smoking weed every day, wanting to fuck more and more women. I honestly feel like theres a sort of demon attached to my spirit, my mom was raped multiple times when young and as an adult and went through tons of trauma so that right there should remind me to be a better human. But i'm just hoping somebody reads this because life has become sort of this vicious cycle of being trapped in lust and i try to stay conscious and get out of it but it always reels me back in, I've wasted so much money on tinder, not a TON but a few hundred dollars. Something that could have been more properly allocated ya know. I've burned so many bridges with people who love me and people who could have potentially loved me. Honestly I want to talk to a therapist but I dont want to bring up those sexual decisions it's a shame to think about and I have to take a deep breath just typing about it. I know God is forgiving, and I have forgave myself but at the same time it feels like I am sort of wrapped in this spell of lust and I want to break free.

Surprisingly, over the past few weeks I have sustained from watching any porn (big contribution to my desensitization initially) porn... ha lets talk about that for a second. I have watched porn for over a decade. I know some people watch it religiously but I would only do it to bust a nut.. ha ha thats what every guy says!! The thing is, where they get you is you get ADDICTED and u start busting multiple nuts multiple times per day, ive done a fair amount of research on kundalini energy and transmuting sexual energy into a creative one but again I just feel like staying away from porn is a good idea all around.

Also, I have fell into the trap of creating new tinder accounts and then deleting them, thats twice in the last few days after staying off it for a few weeks.

TLDR: my brain's original hardwiring has been rewired through the social conditioning of lust in the media and my ability and authority to access it. Thus, causing my inner morals and integrity to be questioned. Leading me to believe I need to let go of my weed addiction in order to suppress the valve of subconscious trauma from re entering my mind and causing a relapse of lustful desire. I used to be a person with loads of joy to give all kinds of people and now I sort of find myself all alone because i lash out at everyone who loves me. I'm even considering microdosing shrooms to promote nuerogenesis in my brain to reset my response to fair and sort of heal some of that trauma in a sense. for those who dont know much of what i am saying i would suggest reseraching paul stamets.

i really hope you guys can give me some good reccomendations on how to go about ridding myself of this energy and getting back who i truly am. honestly feel like i already can just after typing this, it's amazing what your thoughts can do for you when you type or write them out, very good feeling.

so long guys i hope i am not judged too hard for what i did, i know im not the only one who's experimented like that sexually but i just know it's not who i truly am and that after my ex left me and had a baby with another dude, i think it just really did something to my confidence. sad part is, im an attractive dude too so if i went to a bar it would be nothing to pick up a decent chick, but i sit in my room and swipe on tinder. shits sad, i want to get back to the real me.

66,"Hello there. So. I’m just looking to see if anybody feels what I feel and can help me find some clarity. For most of my life (I’m 27), I’ve used drugs, drinks, or girls to distract myself from this feeling I’ve got. Somewhat recently (6 months) though, I’ve become sober as a nun. I had a bit of a breakdown and ended up committed. During that time I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder along with some PTSD issues. At the time I can confidently say I felt depressed.. but here’s my issue: I’m okay now. I’ve got a good job, a girl, all is well. I don’t feel especially sad or depressed or anything like that. But still, I’ve got this desire to end my life. It’s not so much that I want to kill myself, it’s just that I want to be dead, yanno? I’m not in any kind of passionate decision making fit, and like I said - everything is mostly okay. Including my mindset. 

So my question is this .. do you folks have any idea what this is? I’ve experienced the bleak outlook of depression and the crippling anxiety and this is neither of those. I’m content but .. I just want to end my life. Any ideas? ",12Jul2018,2,
67,"I'm 23 and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as a very young boy. As years went on and I became a teenager, I was also diagnosed with Depression, and ultimately Social Anxiety Disorder. Things were so bad I dropped out of high school at the start of Sophomore year, and lived as a virtual recluse until I was 18. I've now beaten my Social Anxiety for the most part and hold a job. I'm also finally heading back to college this fall. But through this burst of activity and motivation I'm having, I've been worried that I'm going to crash and burn and become depressed again at the worst moment, losing all of my motivation.  


For the past few years, I've thought there's something more to what I'm feeling than social anxiety and depression. I don't have many close friends to speak to since I spent most of my teenage years in a bubble, and when I've spoken to my parents about wanting to see someone and try to figure out what's going on, they've been very discouraging. They think I'm just ""over-analyzing"" (which I'm admittedly guilty of), and ""looking for something to be wrong with me."" They think I should just ""stop thinking so much and roll with the punches,"" like they do. ""You're in a good place, so don't worry about crashing and burning or you'll bring it on."" They don't understand that I'm not in complete control of the way I think and feel, nor do they want to.  


To be honest, I don't completely understand it either.

I feel like I've been looking at myself in the mirror for years, seeing a shape staring back at me. And as much as I try, I can't see myself. I know myself pretty well, I just don't understand myself. I don't have a good explanation for my highs and lows. I just want to be able to grasp why I can be such a mess at times. I've started writing a journal every day, keeping notes on my thoughts about things and my behavior. I'm hoping it's going to be helpful for me to get a better picture of who I am. Sorry for the long post, guess I just really needed to put this out there. Has anyone else ever felt the same way I do?",12Jul2018,2,

69,"First time poster in here. 

To cut a long story short a few years ago I was meant to be getting married and that ultimately went west when the fiance cheated and left. I was in a mess at that point and went off to Thailand and Germany for a few months (UK based). 

In Germany I met the most amazing woman who I'm now living with, albeit for no much longer. The relationship is coming to an end and I am to blame as my money situation is dire, I'm in debt and can't pay my way as I or she would want. 

I'm not depressed as saying so would be an insult to those who truly are. However I'm in a bad place and see no way out at the minute. The money situation could be solved with a new job but that's proving more difficult to sort than imagined. The relationship is all but over, we are still in love and she means more to me than I think she knows, the not having any money and relying on her I think gives her the impression I don't care and that I'm holding her back. 

I've become a lot snappier for want of a better word and I feel angry at the smallest things at times. Add drinking when in a shitty mood and I stay up in the early hours on my own. I worry constantly that she is in trouble if she's out on a night out or allow my imagination to run wild that she's with someone else. I know she isn't but I can't help think it. 

Earlier when just sitting by myself thinking I though I was about to pass out and was close to having what I assume was a panic attack. I'm an over thinker to say the least which doesn't help. 

Telling her all this at this stage is pointless and unfair. She will assume, and I wouldn't blame her that I'm trying to emotionally blackmail her to stay. 

If or should I say when she leaves I have no idea what I'm to do. I know I'm not strong enough anymore to just brush it off, and I don't think I was a few years ago. I've clearly bottled things up deep inside that are eventually coming to the surface.

Here is the main thing;I am struggling to live up to other peoples expectation of me.  But here is the thing I am not even sure if this is what is happening or if this is just something I have manifested.

Not to brag but I have always overachieved at things, I have never played on it and am usually quite modest.  Recently I feel like my reputation is built on lies and I cant keep up all the extra effort, I lie awake thinking things over and I am 90% sure my issues are all in my head but I can't shake the thoughts.  It cripples me mentally and often zone into my own world completely oblivious to my surroundings.

I have intentially left out a lot of context and havnt said much about how I actually feel, but to pur bluntly the way my mind thinks is cureently putting me in quite a dark place.

72,"Hey guys. this is my first post ever in this subreddit. (United States)
M,22

I’ve recently been through a traumatic health experience and I genuinely cannot tell if I’m suffering from a continuation from that previous(possible health problem) or if I’ve convinced myself I am and actually went through an extreme type of panic. 

About 2 weeks ago I began getting sick with what I think I’ve convinced myself was HIV. 

And before I get too far into ( well how would you think that?)
It’s only because I’ve googled symptoms. 
My risk factors are extremely low. 
I’ve never touched a hard drug in my life, as well as I’ve never had sex with like gross prostitutes. 

I’ve had my share of unprotected sex, but it was even to the point I was so upset and nervous that I had reached out to every past partner I’ve had in the past year and let them know so they’d get tested. All of them have been tested and are clean. 

To be fair, I had plausible reason to have freaked out over this. 

Out of nowhere I began getting fevers, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, sores in my mouth, thrush, etc. 

All the typical main indicators of HIV. 

And I’ll give it, I must have some sort of underlying health anxiety deep down. 

I eat healthier than anybody I’ve ever met, as well as I know every single fact about every single health food product that exist. 
I worked out daily prior to this event. 
And followed a strict vegan diet for all the health benefits that follow it. 

A bit of background on my mental health, I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, extreme anxiety disorders, and my biggest factor OCD. 

My OCD if I’m gonna be honest kinda ties in with my BPD a lot. Even though I’ve made mountains of progress during 2018 on both. 

I really started facing my compulsions, and started fighting my ego. At one point I began to experience slight ego death. 

Or at least I thought I did. 

My OCD mainly is filled with the constant need for knowledge as well. I would read everything I possibly could get my hands on. Try studying things from other people’s perspectives(things like seeing through the eyes of somebody in a lower income area and the struggles they need to go through). Obviously things I don’t live on a daily basis but things that would keep my mind open to understand and appreciate things and people of different cultures. 

Read a lot of things politically, medically, and pay a lot of attention in the psychology of most things. (Music, visual art, movies/TV shows)

Myself, I’m an artist. 
Poetry, graphic art, music. Honestly anything thrown at me, I could probably figure out and create my own style. 

I’ve experimented with TV show scripts/Movie story boards, animation, photography, have written/recorded music videos. 

I’m a heavy believer in people getting the help they need mentally as well, I’ve been in and out of therapy since 2015. And honestly have learned so many coping mechanisms and better ways to appreciate life. 

Well, sorry to have gotten off topic of the situation that has put me in this thread. But I figured I’d give a good strong idea of who I am as a person before I dig deeper into the dilemma that is currently challenging me. 


Like I said, two weeks ago I began getting very sick.

I came home from the tattoo shop I apprentice at after working around 70 something hours that week. Drink some sleepy time tea, and begin getting horrible chills. 

I wake up the next morning soaked from night sweats. Fever that’s just kicking my butt beyond belief too. 

I had to alert my job I’d be coming in late that day as I wasn’t feeling good. 
I couldn’t even stand up in the shower I was so weak. 

Next day, same fever. But sore throat and sores now have taken over my mouth. 

In so much agony that I could barely use my tongue to annunciate words, let alone be able to eat. 

So after a visit to my local patient first(urgent care), they tell me it’s some upper respiratory bullshit and give me an anti biotic. 

Obviously that doesn’t do much, and a few days pass without me being able to ingest any food. 

Well, that Saturday I begin google snooping to possibly see what’s wrong with me. 

And a lot of my symptoms matched HIV’s early seroconversion signs. 

Well, that was the beginning of the end for me. 

Everything I did, I thought about how I could have HIV. 

I told my family who I live with about the matching symptoms and they just thought I was being a hypochondriac. 

I kept googling more and more even though every part of me knew that I needed to avoid doing that. That there must’ve been some sort of alternative cause of these symptoms. 

But I was stuck. Days passed and I felt like my world was starting to piece away at the thought of having a life threatening illness. 

I still had my sense of self at this point. 

Still my sorta apathetic punk mentality. Even though I was scared to death. (I started to sorta relax at the thought of knowing how advanced modern medicine was and that I’d be okay. 

(After reading at least 50 articles of people who somehow got HIV in the last 30 years and their stories) 

Well, last Tuesday I woke up around 1-2am. And I had this feeling of “WHO AM I/WHERE AM I”

And oh boy was that when this got bad. 

I remember my heart skipping a thousand beats and ramping up to full speed to the point I thought it would’ve fallen out of my chest. 

I ran downstairs and stared in my family room decorative mirror directly into my eyes and mouth (looking at how bad the comparable symptoms have become) 

And deep on the inside all I heard was “IMMMMMMMMMMMM DYYYYYYYIIINNNNNGGGGGG”
and my world began to melt. 

I had to take a 2 hour hot shower just to tire myself out enough to fall asleep (I was honestly about to rush myself to the emergency room, but I knew it would be better to go in the morning than the middle of the night like that)

Well after I fell asleep and woke back up that night, I’ve had this numbing feeling in the top left side of my head. I can’t tell if it’s still there or if I’ve just gotten used to it. 

But ever since that became apparent, my coordination has been off. As well as a huge delay in my cognitive ability, my memory had been mush, and just my overall sense of self has been non existent. 

I go from questioning if I’m okay to thinking that I somehow received extreme brain damage and that I belong as one of Howard Stern’s guests. 

The following days, everything had been extremely dizzy (not so much now). 

I couldn’t drive, my sense of time hadn’t existed. As well as like I said, my overall cognition had slowed it’s roll completely. 

I’d oddly become a lot more empathetic too, which I can’t tell if that’s major sign that somethings truly wrong based off that (LOL)
But I had for sure dropped a lot of pointless frustrations realizing how minuscule they were in comparison to the situation I was in. 

What was the weirdest part is, my OCD compulsions were no longer there. I haven’t felt the need to do my rounds of numbers or question my identity from the moment I wake up till the second I fall asleep. 

But, as nice as that sounds. It really alarmed me. Knowing that something is wrong based off that. And possibly the new compulsion that I’m dealing with is a health anxiety related one. Considering I can’t sleep, I can’t stop reading things online related to the symptoms and possible diagnosis, I’ve probably posted on /askdoc forums as well as the subreddit for HIV such a ridiculous amount of times that I’m sure anybody who catches me posting in there anymore wants me dead LOL. 

Well that Tuesday I sucked it all up, went to the hospital. They diagnosed my virus as “Hand, Foot, &amp; Mouth” which didn’t seem right either but they gave me medication for it. They also did routine blood work and told me that if I had an autoimmune disease such as HIV currently in my system that my white blood cell count would be completely out of whack, as well as a lot of other complications that would be noticeable. 

That still didn’t relieve me what so ever. 

I go to my family doctor a few days following. 

I tell him about the coordination issues, I tell him about my concern of HIV, I tell him about every oral symptom I have and the possibility of maybe Lymes disease since a tick bit me a week and a half prior to this health disaster. 

At this point I haven’t eaten any solid food in 5 days, barely have water in my system, and have at least 3 vegan protein drinks in me that I forced down. 

Running off of not sleeping for 2-3 nights as well. 

He tells me it could be some random unknown virus, but from my risk factors HIV doesn’t seem plausible. Even with the hefty amount of symptoms. 

But obviously for peace of mind of everybody, he writes me a script to go to an outpatient lab and get full blood work. 

I go immediately. 

Later that night my entire world gets extremely dizzy. 
Like everything was spinning, watching tv wasn’t possible either. I couldn’t follow the dialogue. I couldn’t even tell what the world around me was. 

My world begins tilting even more on an axis. 

Like my vertigo was so deep that everything looked sideways. 

My memory at its worst. 

I could barely walk. 

I couldn’t even talk properly, or think, or comprehend conversation. 

It’s about 1am now. 

I Uber myself to the hospital. And I say this with full confidence that I genuinely believed I was going to die in that hospital that night. 

I get there and tell them my symptoms. Everything happening with me, and they fucking threw me in the crisis center. 


Still running on no sleep, I felt like I had finally lost control of my mind. I was doing things physically that was against my regular mannerisms. 

I couldn’t completely soak in the situation. 

I couldn’t think of anything funny or anything. (Which has always been my regular coping skill. But I haven’t laughed since before the dizzy spells happened) 

At this point 
Day 6 without food
Dehydrated
Day 3 and a half without sleep. 

I’m begging for an MRI or CATscan of my brain. 

I’m convinced at this point that I had HIV and that it quickly effected my central nervous system. That it was going to give me onset dementia at the age of 22. 

That my brain, the one thing that I held so dear to my heart was going to turn against me. And all the knowledge I had searched for for all these years was going to fade away. My self awareness was going to fade away. 
My life, goals, sense of self was going to fade away until I would ultimately be in a vegetated state until somebody pulls the plug on me. 

Nobody believed me. Nobody believed that there was something causing my brain such distress. 

Something that would be making the left side of my head/face so numb. 

Something that would erase my cognitive ability. 

Something that would begin making my coordination faint and I would grow old and frail in a months time to wear I wouldn’t be able to even turn the faucet to have the water on in the shower. 

They told me it was all in my head. That I didn’t have hiv. And if I did that’s not how it works in the beginning. 

That I am so anxiety ridden that all of these things are me having a nervous breakdown. 


I didn’t believe them. 
I couldn’t and still can’t believe them. 

Every person I’ve talked to told me it’s all in my head and that I’m making this all up. 

There’s no way. 

I got the results back from a 4th generation HIV test the day I left crisis. 

It was negative. 

The most accurate test that is medically available to the market. 

Told me that everything I believed was wrong with me, is now false. 

This should be good news, yes?

I don’t even know how to handle that. 

Now everything in my system is out of whack, and I don’t have an answer. I don’t have an answer. 

I don’t have something that scientifically or medically proves what is going on with me. 

But everyone’s telling me that it’s my anxiety. 

My anxiety has never done this? If anything my anxiety has always kept me aware, strong, and given me such utensils such as a photogenic memory and strong decision making skills. 

But where are these things now...?

I couldn’t believe that test. It must’ve been false. 

But I’ve had 3 sets of blood work by now. 

... then what is wrong with me!? Is this going away. Is my memory going to return? Is this test wrong and doctors are gonna let me continue to slip further until I’m mentally to the point where I belong on the short bus and can’t take care of myself!?  What is it that’s causing these problems. Is it seriously me!? Why would I do this? If I had anxiety symptoms which I’ve experienced being the POLAR opposite of this, then I’d get them under control. But I can’t control this. What is happening.

Lucky my roommate was there and saw me take some tackles me and shoves his finger in my mouth to make me puke (pretty sure I bit the crap out of him but it’s all in the past). Anyway after my friends failed attempt he called 911 I remember it was hitting me at this point and I couldn’t walk nor really stay awake actually couldn’t do much from what I remember. I have no clue how I got to the er. Next thing I remember I’m puking think I was getting my stomach pumped,I  do vividly remember drinking the charcoal it’s not as bad as people say it is even though it was like drinking tar. Anyway after a few hrs (I think) everything was wearing off, and I had talked with my family a bit. This lady came in, she wasn’t the doctor, she wasn’t the nurse, I honestly don’t know who she was, didn’t state her name or what she was doing. She was just asking a bunch of questions. Mind you from what I remember I think this lady was on call and I’m the middle of something because she acted like I just completely screwed her day up she was definitely rude in 6 kinds of ways ( and I vowed to this day if I ever saw her again I would tell her how big of a b she is). I can’t remember all the questions she asked but here’s where the legal part comes in she said you can take the easy or hard way, she was very hesitant to tell me what the easy and hard way were but she did option A was go to a rehab center for a “mandatory” 3 days or B the police would come get me and take me to wherever they please. Me just turning 18 flipped out. So of course I went with A not wanting to deal with the police. Any was it even legal for the police to get me “I didn’t think it was a crime” only thing I could think of was because of the drugs but no one ever asked me where I got them or if I was using them prior. Could the cops have done anything is what I want to know or was she bluffing me into going to rehab? FYI if your over 18 you can request to get out of rehab if you don’t want to be at least where I was at. Stayed a total of 5-8 hours and my mom was there by 7am the following day. Just had to talk to a psychiatrist. Btw don’t attempt that stuff over “love”. ",12Jul2018,1,
74,"I'm wondering if I have some sort of disorder or a condition because ever since I've been in my current relationship I've never been able to actually feel love or a connection, however, whenever I think about breaking up or losing her I feel like I'll be hurt",12Jul2018,1,
75,"For the majority of 2011 I was 15, I look back on the. Years in orgasmic nostalgia, they were so beautiful, I turned 16 in November 2011 but as soon as 2012 started women ruined my life because of the pure malice and cruelty of how they treated me, every year has gotten worse and more depressive and bleak, I’ve endured 6 years so far of this bad trip, I feel as if I’m in purgatory itself, not that I’m religious but the reason I say purgatory because it’s only going to get worse, if it hasn’t gotten better in 6 years it’s only going to get worse, I consume large quantities of alcohol and smoke huge quantities of cigarettes hoping to give myself a premature death, I suppose you could say it’s like using a cheat in a video game, women, why did you do this to me? Why did you inflict this pain and suffering on a 16 year old child?",12Jul2018,0,
76,"So my GF and I have been together for about 2 and 1/2 years, we’ve talked about her over using I’m sorry, and how it’s related to her anxiety and depression, but lately she will make other plans, tell me about them, but still apologize for not hanging out, what do I say to her in without making her anxiety worse, I too suffer from anxiety/depression and may be over thinkin",12Jul2018,1,
77,I honestly dont feel much. I just kind of blink and blankly stare. It doesnt hit me very hard.,12Jul2018,1,
78,"I feel like my ~~unstable~~ fucked family and my personal problems caused by BPD  
are making it look and feel like I am gaslighting my girlfriend. I'm fucking terrified because her Dad that she lived with has been an alcoholic for as long as she can remember and she's very sensitive to this gaslighting behavior and rejects me when the whole package of gaslighting seems to appear from my life and my BPD.
