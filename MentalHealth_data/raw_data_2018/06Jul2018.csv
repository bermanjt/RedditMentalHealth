0,"Exactly 4 year ago I told my mom in our language, ""If you don't take me to get help, I won't be here anymore.""  I got diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, OCD, dysthymia, and body dysmorphia. I've been suicidal since i understood the world around me. She refuses to recognize that anything is wrong with me, even after several attempts (if you know what I mean.) I'm suffering. The last thing I need is my own mother forcing me into severely triggering and embarrassing situations. (Note: she doesn't understand english, she comes from a country where there is not one mental health facility, they believe all mental health problems are from the devil.) ",06Jul2018,5,
1,"I want to go ahead and preface this by saying that I am sorry if this is not the correct subreddit for this and I encourage anyone who wishes to crosspost this to a different subreddit to help me think this through to do as they wish.

Roughly two years ago or so I was diagnosed Bipolar Type II with symptoms of psychosis. I take 0.5 MG of Risperidone and 20 MG of Fluoxetine. Antipsychotics and antidepressants.

I have a story I have held close to my chest for 5 years now that I would like to share. It's nothing anyone did to me, and I have concluded it was either what made me mentally ill, or the very first true sign I was mentally ill. I would like to get the skeletons out of my closet and tell my story. 

At my middle school back in the day, I am graduated and attending college now, an obsession with the illuminati took the school by storm. Most people ended with ""Oooh, Jay-Z is in it hurr-hurr"" but I wanted to go a step deeper. I started looking deeper at government control conspiracy theories, stuff like that. I took it a step deeper eventually and looked into Satan worship and occult groups in general, so it just steadily branched out.

I was digging and became fascinated with the figure I'll just call ""B-met"" someone below can fill in the rest. I still have an uneasy fear that if I say the name or even think it it will all happen again. It being the rest of the story.

I got an uneasy feeling I was always being watched, I had terrible nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I was always anxious and terrified.

The scariest and most unexplained thing that happened to me beyond simple explanation was when I decided to stand up to whatever I thought was following me. I got in front of a bathroom mirror to cover my back, and just reached out head held high and tried to show that I wasn't scared. Suddenly, and I swear this is true, I smelled a horrible, rank, burned smell right over me. I sprinted out of the room, and I feel like as I ran there was something right behind me. I'm nearly willing to swear that I saw something out of my peripheral vision as I sprinted out.

This awful feeling only intensified, until one day it stopped. I've held onto this awful feeling and dread for so long, and I keep having flashbacks to repressed memories about the whole thing. Sometime later I noticed that I was always having a dull, distracting white noise of talking in my head. Like whenever you get into a room with up to hundreds of people in it and they are all having conversations, but much quieter. Just noise.

I keep having these flashbacks and moments where if I think about it too long I can almost feel it creep back up. Even just saying all this I am forcing myself to not think and just write.

That was either my first hardcore sign that I was mentally ill, as I was diagnosed two years later, or that experience was the experience that cracked me and made me start hearing voices and having up and down swings. I never noticed them until after then. 

I just want some insight. Feel free to crosspost to occult or demon focused subreddits so I can get some other insight, supernatural and natural. 

Thank you for your time.

Fun fact: I actually started my medication the same day as GTA online heists released. I know that because it ruined my experience because I felt awful and couldn't feel happy. 

Anyways, that's my story.",06Jul2018,1,

If the hardware is broken, then the software will never work properly.  It is amazing how various nutritional and lifestyle issues can sneak up on you without your awareness and basically fuck up your life.  You would be amazed how many reports I read from people who made various nutritional and lifestyle adjustments and their emotional issues evaporated.  With this in mind, I have this list that you may find useful.  This is the list that I give everyone who is depressed and/or anxious and is asking for help.  Or even if they aren't asking for help.  All of these items have helped my wife and myself.  I did not dabble in them.  I used them to help my mental health.  I have had 50 adult years to develop this list:           

*  **Cut out 100% of all refined foods, particularly refined carbs and sugar.   (reddit.com/r/keto/)**          
*  **Intermittent and extended fasting.  (https://www.allaboutfasting.com/  ,  https://zerocarbzen.com/dry-fasting/)**          
*  **Ketogenic/paleo/carnivorous eating.   (The FAQs at reddit.com/r/keto/, reddit.com/r/Paleo/, and reddit.com/r/zerocarb/)**
*  Pranayama, Yoga, and/or meditation.   
*  3 grams of fish or cod liver oil every day.            
*  8000 IUs of vitamin D3 every day.   
*  Magnesium supplementation.   (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdJ23faQWkI&amp;feature=youtu.be)                       
*  EFT or Emotional Freedom Technique, affirmations, and self-hypnosis.          
*  Exercise.  The best is HIIT and weights. 
*  Get purpose in your life.    
*  Cold showers (aka contrast showers, cold conditioning, and cold shocking) /r/coldshowers.  
*  Good sleep.     
*  Nutrient dense food like spirulina, moringa, yeast, lecithin.                                       
*  If you don't own a dog, buy one and love her with all of your heart.  If you already own a dog, love her with all of your heart.  The more love that you give (anyone), the more love that you have for everyone and the happier you will be.    

I **bolded** the first 3 items because I believe that they are central to most mental health problems.  Is there any harm in trying any one or all of those suggestions?

3,My life is nothing close to perfect. I'm 20 years old and since I was 17 I've lived in a total of 9 different places. My mom was always to focus on other things then me and my dad well his new wife hates me and would always say her or me and well out of the house I would be. Now I'm back living at my dads house and since being back my stepmom has called the cops on me and try to force me to move out. My dad is always in the middle and I can't stand her all she does is drink all day I'm talking from 8 in the morning she has coffee or orange juice then wine all the way till 4 first margarita at 5 and then wine again till 7 then she has her second one then wine till bed. I have no respect for someone like her when my dad will go and buy me something she tells him I'm 20 and I should buy it. I do agree with this up until 2 months ago I had a good job and was living good I wasn't happy all the time I have bad depression and I started to self harm again. Anyways he spends $8 a pack on her cigs and about $120 a week on wine she drinks a box a day. I wanna live with my mom but she doesn't want me and tells me I have no other choice it's my dads or the street. I want to be with my mom so bad not that o think things will be better but I just want my mom. I hate that she's never there for me and my dad isn't all the time but he does try. I'm currently looking for jobs I only have my permit due to problems in highschool with my mental health. I just feel so helpless at this point. I get the cops called on me for trespassing in my own home. The cops I know are tired of her calling because my dads name is on the house as well and he says I can stay but when he's at work it's a whole other story I have no choice but to leave the property. I just don't know what to do.,06Jul2018,1,
4,"I realized soo many things before I was diagnosed. Once I was diagnosed in December with major depression and anxiety, all things I was oblivious towards became very eye opening. I ended toxic relationships, started changing my life choices, etc. It’s been about 7 months already and I can only say, this school year was total crap. I mean, yes, I had a wonderful boyfriend/bestfriend who eventually understood a little about my mental illness. I had graduated high school—which was tough due to not going for months. I finally felt life was just beginning. But then the mood changes, the distance between loved ones, the side effects from my medication, not having more appointments with my therapist and skipping my meds led up to chaos. Also, it’s barely July and even MORE chaos happened. My grandmother found out she has pancreatic cancer, so ya know how that’ll end, my boyfriend and I broke up—I realized it was my fault though, plus I’m always alone. But I’ll type the rest tomorrow.",06Jul2018,92,
5,"As the title says I keep seeing very disturbing and graphic images when I close my eyes. 

Ok so first of all I'm usually never one to come asking for help or to give much thought about stuff like this, but now this bs is getting annyoing. 

This has happened to me randomly for as long than I can remember but the images have gotten worse during the years, and sometimes these images/videos or series of images and videos/visuals are somehow so incredibly disturbing that I can't sleep and almost Begin to cry out of uncontrollable fear. Now look, I'm not a sensitive guy, so crying for any reason is a big deal for me and I can't explain why it happens. 

What are these images and what do I feel when I see them you ask? They are usually weird spooky disturbing ""inhuman"" looking faces or humanoid looking things, sometimes they do something like clearly scream or appear to speak. But sometimes shit gets a lot worse, you see that is the standard what I see often and while it does make me anxious I can deal with it. Sometimes like for example tonight I see ""videos"" of for example one of these faces distorting into something weird I can't quite wrap my head around and there usually is a lot of gory imagery or visuals of strangers, people I know and these weird creatures/Faces I'm seeing. Now while it does spook me it alone wouldn't be enough to make me act on it, but on these more hardcore occasions a panic and a need to escape and a very deep fear take over me without me having any control over it. And you have to keep in mind that I never panic aside from thsese moments. 

In conclusion I'm not Even sure what I seek in making this post, I just want to know if this stuff happens to other people and if there is a name for this phenomenon. ",06Jul2018,1,

7,"From Wikipedia (lol, sorry) ""physically or mentally, tracing contours of objects"".

I've been doing this since I was a kid. I would sit and try to project the corners of a ceiling (or, anything with a sharp edge) to another corner. See if they lined up perfectly in the middle. Over and over again, the same shapes, even though it didn't change. I did this for hours at bedtime and it made it hard to fall asleep. I have OCD and ADHD. In my therapist's office (recently; I'm an adult now) I'd trace the shapes of the shadows that a lamp made on the wall, and I'd do this for the entire session. I'd try to see if it would line up with the edge of a chair but it didn't. But I'd keep tracing it, not really expecting anything to change, but just doing it obsessively. It clearly was distressing to me as a kid. This was constant, when I wasn't counting things or performing OCD-related rituals. I was perfection-obsessed with my OCD as a kid (both sides of something had to be equal, I liked even numbers, etc.). I prefer things uneven now.

I only do it when I have absolutely nothing to distract me (easy to avoid boredom though when I have a smart phone). So I don't know if it's still distressing or more as a way to dissociate.

I was wondering if there's any good articles or resources to read up on this? It interests me a lot and I'd like to figure out if it's a symptom of my OCD or ADHD or both. I suspect I am also on the spectrum but I haven't been really tested extensively.

Anyone else have experience with this, especially those with OCD or ADHD? Thank you for reading.",06Jul2018,1,
8,"So, a first time poster here. I'm F18, currently studying and living on my own. My parents are divorced and I have 2 siblings. (Sister and half-brother, though I think of him as a full brother)

 I also want to put out a trigger warning for self harm and suicide right now, as it they will be mentioned. 

I've being dealing with some sort of mental issues for a while now, a couple of years to be exact. I think I have anxiety and perhaps depression, as well as an eating problem and troubles with self image. Both physical and mental.

I don't think I know who I am or what I want in life. I feel ugly, fat, revolting, lazy, selfish, unaccomplished, stupid, unworthy and meaningless. I have cut myself and have considered and almost attempted suicide. That is the gist of how I feel and have felt for quite some time now.

This all began to show once I moved out to pursuit my studies. Don't get me wrong, I got a great start at my school, I made friends that are dearer to me than any other friends ever have been. But I suppose I started cracking under the pressure. At first it was insomnia that got to me. I was so tired that I thought that feeling numb was normal. I couldn't seem to find joy in almost anything. Then I began to get anxious. More than I had before. (I'll make another post about my childhood and its influence in my current state if anyone is interested.)

 I started to become more and more aware of my flaws, blamed everything on me, demanded perfection and feared other people's opinions on me. My studies started to go downhill as my attendance was shit, I overate because I couldn't feel anything and didn't want to, so I distracted myself with food, my grandma (whom I love very much) told me I had changed and asked me if I was depressed. She has asked that a handful of times now.

 I had a couple of attacks where my heart felt like it was about to burst and I wanted to vomit form the overwhelming emotions. Then summer break came, and I felt a little better.

Then year 2 began. At this point I had only cut myself, but hadn't had any suicidal contemplations. Now, fall semester went surprisingly well. My attendance was still bad, vut not as bad as last spring. There were some bad days, but there were also good days. It was maybe October when things turned pitch black again. In the spring not even getting my driver's license could make me happy. I missed a lot of lessons and didn't manage with the extra credits I had. (To fill in for my absences)

 A couple of weeks before summer vacation I just stopped going to school for a week. I didn't feel anything and just didn't find it in myself to get out of bed. It was during that week that I thought of killing myself seriously for the first time. During the fall I had ""played"" around with the thought and shared my feelings on the subject with a friend. But this time I had my prescription meds in the palm of my hand. I got scared, so I went to bed. A day after that my friend messaged me telling me how worried she was. 

And I had a breakdown. I couldn't understand why someone could care for me or my life. I had another one like that with my other firend. I cried and screamed in my room.

I'm sorry for this sorry excuse of a rant. It's such a mess I'll be surprised if you find anything interesting or relatabe in it. ",06Jul2018,1,
9,"So a year or two ago i sat next to this girl in math class, and we became friends and eventually helped each other through depression, anxiety etc. From this, we became really close, until my dumb ass went and fell in love. I told her after a month or so of losing sleep because i was so worried of messing up our friendship, and in that time i convinced myself she liked me back, which only helped strengthen the feelings i had for her.

After this, it’s fair to say i became clingy and overall a bad friend, and while she definitely could’ve handled it better this led to our friendship taking a turn for the worse. We’re okay now, but definitely not what we once were and we pretty much never talk. I thought i was over the feelings i had for her until fairly recently when i found out i wasn’t, but in the time i thought i was i told her i didn’t feel like that any more, and she still thinks i don’t. 

Even if we barely talk any more she’s such an important friend to me, but the feelings i have often just lead to periods of time where i have repeats of depression or anxiety attacks because i know she is doing other things with her love life. I know how unfair it is for me to cut her off when the problems are entirely mine, but any sort of contact with her reminds me of my feelings which almost felt like they were gone while we hadn’t been talking and i almost feel like i’m left with no other option

So do i talk to her about it (knowing that she will feel uncomfortable and doesn’t want to hear me going on about how sad i am that we aren’t together), cut her off completely (knowing i’ll probably hate myself for a LONG time after and she’d be really upset) or just leave it and continue trying to move on (which i seem to have failed at for over a year, although i’ll admit i don’t love her as much as i used to)

tl;dr: fell in love with my best friend and seeing/talking to her makes me sad that we were never and will never be more. do i talk to her, cut her off and move on or just try to stay friends and move on
(bear in mind talking to her will almost definitely not end well)

11,"My friend (mid-to-late 20s) read a book a little bit ago that altered his entire worldview essentially completely.  He entered a pretty intense creative/manic state that became increasingly concerning and ultimately resulted in parental intervention.  

I visited my friend recently, and while he is able to perform daily functions, I am still a bit worried about him.  His entire philosophy and outlook (including political beliefs) are unrecognizable from even three months ago, he spends almost all his free time developing what he clearly believes is an all-encompassing philosophical/scientific/physical/chemical system, claiming that he has basically intuited new physical laws.  He has started making increasingly bizarre claims about human personality (connecting it to various other traits with little/no evidence) and clearly believes he is in possession of a unifying theory of existence, basically.  I have also picked up on hints of some sort of Messianic outlook.  It is like he is unable to think about or do anything else.

Any of these things in isolation is not necessarily alarming, but in the aggregate they are a bit concerning given their general speed and their extremeness.  I already have a plan to develop a safety net of sorts, and I am not concerned about him in the immediate sense.  I just do not know whether this kind of epiphany is normal or whether I should be as concerned as I am.",06Jul2018,1,
12,"Before I explain my feelings to you all, I think a little bit of not-so-unusual backstory is necessary. I grew up in a pretty religious family. Nothing overbearing or cruel, but we believed in God, the importance of love and empathy, and the ideas of good and evil forces in the world. We believed that every human being is equally invaluable and all of these ideals were central to my being for years.

As time has gone on, I do believe I have grown (slightly) less naive about the world, and have come to understand how complicated things are, but rather than stepping from one stage to another, I feel as though the carpet has been pulled completely out from under me and I'm floating in a void, completely detached from everyone around me.

While cognitively I still think there is a God, I know longer really believe it deep down. Come to think of it, I don't believe in anything really. I TRY to fight for equality and argue for social justice with my peers, but I don't feel any fire inside or real belief in what I say. I struggle to read fiction right now because I can't seem to properly connect with characters anymore, and I can no longer suspend my disbelief when reading worlds. I used to write avidly but, again, I can't connect with my characters or empathize with them. Most shockingly, I'm starting to think I've never felt love (platonic or romantic) and that I fear I will never be able to recognize it if it does occur to me. The old notions of good and evil don't really hold anything for me right now, as I'm constantly questioning ""what is 'good'?"" i just can't understand right now why people strive to help others. I mean, I KNOW it's good and should be achieved, but WHY is it good?

I'm certainly not asking you guys to fix my religious uncertainties, but mental health is a constant thorn in the side of family, as many members on both sides, including my mother, have had severe mental illnesses their whole life. Is this downward spiral I'm in merely me over analyzing the world around me, or is it mental illness rearing its ugly head at me and I'm now suffering from depression?

Would appreciate any help you guys can give me, as I really don't know what do and am deeply afraid right now, and I wish you all a good day.",06Jul2018,1,

15,"I just have no idea what to do. I’m afraid, I feel tortured, and I’m angry to my core. 

About 8 months ago I noticed that something was horribly wrong with my mind. I started having severe problems thinking: my thoughts were all garbled and incoherent and producing thoughts was like trying to suck water from a stone. 

Before this all started I had depression, but it was pretty manageable and was really more of me just choosing to ruminate and my failures and stuff that bothered me. 

8 months ago I was dabbling with some psychedelics, and then one day I noticed that my thinking was FUBAR. 

So, I quickly set up a psychiatry appointment and told them about my drug use and thinking issues. They feared, despite the fact that I wasn’t showing any clear symptoms, that I had possibly triggered a schizophrenia or similar disorder. 

Since then I’ve tried 3 different antipsychotics along with several antidepressants. I tried risperedone, abilify, latuda, lithium, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin. 

None of them did anything to help with my thinking or my severe depression as a result of my thinking problems. Some I would say just made it even worse. 

I haven’t experienced a single hallucination or delusion or even a paranoid thought in the course of these 8 months. I even had a neuropsychological assessment and they said that I’m clearly not psychotic at this time and that it’s unlikely I’m developing schizophrenia because all of my cognitive tests came back average or better than average. 

So now my psychiatrist is almost certain that this is OCD, but honestly that seems like a load of bullshit to me. I have no compulsions, and even though I know that “pure O” OCD is a thing, it just seems like kind of a stretch that this is purely OCD related. 

I had an mri 2 months into this illness (around November last year) and it came back fine. 

I’ve determined this is one of three things: schizophrenia prodrome, ocd, or something neurological. 

Everyday is literal hell. My mind is constantly torturing me with its inability to function normally. I feel like a moron. I’m incapable of doing anything besides moving, eating, and shitting. And that’s coming from someone who had straight A’s throughout his life. 

I’ve been contemplating suicide pretty aggressively since this disorder began. I can’t live with this forever, and I can’t even live with this for more than 2 additional months. I’m at the end of my rope and I have no idea what to do. I sincerely hope this is some sort of curable neurological disorder, because if it’s not that means there’s a huge chance this is indeed schizophrenia. And if it is, well I can’t do it. 

I just need some advice as to how to approach this further and at least get me a definitive answer as to what is causing this. Thanks!

16,"Inb4 ""only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose you."" I'm fairly sure I'm not, but it's nagging at me. Also this is throwaway IN CASE THEY'RE WATCHING (by which I mean a few people know my main username and I don't want them to come across this if they randomly get bored and stalk my history). 

So basically, one of my paternal uncles suffer from schizoaffective disorder, and an uncle on my mother's side suffers from. . . something that involves paranoia and social isolation. An aunt on my mother's side also suffers from something that involves paranoia and social isolation. So basically, I definitely feel as though there's a chance as though I may have the genetic vulnerability towards developing a psychotic-type illness, if not schizophrenia proper. 

Anyway, onto my 'delusions and hallucinations.'

Basically, I've always suffered from extreme anxiety and depression. In the past year and a half, though, the anxiety has gotten worse to the point where I think it might legitimately qualify as psychosis, although I'm not rightly sure. 

These anxious/delusional thoughts have mainly involved fears for my health:

1) Health:
Over the past year and a half, I've been to the ER four times for health concerns that ended up being literally nothing. Basically, I'll experience a symptom (let's say ""pain in left shoulder"") and then google it. Google inevitably tells me it's a possible symptom of a heart attack. While this is highly unlikely (I'm 26, and in generally good health) I'll google something like ""heart attack at 25"" and ""can you be having a heart attack with no chest pain."" Google directs me to articles about people who have had heart attacks with no warning signs, and about how ""silent heart attacks"" are more common in women. And, typically, these articles warn you that if you're having signs of a heart attack, you should go to the ER immediately. 

I'll hem and haw for awhile, try to talk myself down, etc. But it's the sort of thing where a false negative (I.E, not going to the ER when you should) has much more dire consequences than a false positive (I.E., going to the ER when it's nothing.) So I'll go to the ER, feel stupid as the doctor asks me to assess my pain level (""Maybe like three? I don't know, it's so subjective!""). After a few hours, I'll be sent home. 

Fortunately, I've gotten better at talking myself down from these delusions, but they still come. I've been worried about gallstones, and a hiatal hernia, and at one point was worried my esophagus had ruptured (thanks to googling ""sudden sore throat""). Right now I have a bad headache, and have been having eyeball spasms, and this morning got a nosebleed-- basically, I constantly notice symptoms and then convince myself it means I'm going to die. It's exhausing, and legitimately makes me feel insane. 

I think I have had mild hallucinations, though. Like, I almost felt like my teeth were hot (like, internally; I don't know if I convinced myself I felt it or if I was actually hallucinating), and I subsequently had the fleeting worry that they would explode. Fortunately, almost as quickly this occurred to me,  I realized that this was impossible and was able to not stress about it. The feeling of 'hot teeth' also went away quickly, but I have no idea what caused it. 

Also, I've noticed that while lying in bed and staring at the roof, it starts to kind of look like I'm looking at it through moving water. This happens at the end of the day when I'm tired, so maybe it's a fatigue thing.

I am fairly sure I'm not becoming psychotic/schizophrenic, but basically I was reassuring that I'm just an extremely anxious person (and yes, I know I should get help regardless of whether I'm psychotic or not. I've been on medications before and they haven't been worth the side-effects). 

But yeah, I feel like I'm going insane a lot of the time.

17,"My ldr boyfriend and I meet up twice a year.
On a recent meet up he told me if I wanted to be skinnier all I had to do was eat less. He wasn't being malicious and often he was motivated to say something by my own comments rooted in insecurity about my body. I would look at myself in the mirror and go ""ugh I'm so fat"" or I would buy shorts and they'd be too tight and I would show him my muffin top. 

I constantly degrade myself and my self esteem is in dirt now because my family has been giving me shit about my weight my whole life. I don't know why I'm so rude to myself about it but when I hear it from my parents I usually end up crying about it so it is somewhat of a trigger I suppose (and my therapist has said this too). Around my boyfriend was the only time I truly felt confident to a degree because he never indicated to me that weight was an issue and he showed me love No matter what I looked like. 

Since this trip though I simply can't shake his comments and I see them differently. To me he is telling me that I'm fat and that he isn't attracted to me because of it. We have had a talk and I've always been vocal about us breaking up if either one of us is unhappy or not interested anymore. He's assured me that he's staying but I'm never going to be able to see him the same way. 

I even told him this but now I feel weird eating around him, wearing certain clothes, or even saying those off comments about myself. Today when my housemates boyfriend came over and they were laughing I started sobbing because I kept thinking that she's lucky to be skinny and her boyfriend is actually attracted to her. 

My boyfriend is great. He's supportive (we've decided to work on being healthier together since he wants to make some changes too); he's stuck through multiple breakdowns I have had; he's trying his best from a distance to make things work (he even changed life plans so he could apply to and go to school with me). But I constantly think about what he said and I'm always going to think I'm not good enough. I thought I was making progress with my boyfriend around but now I just feel as alone and unloved as before I met him.

18,"SORRY FOR BEING SO LONG BUT I NEED YOUR HELP IN MAKING A DECISION. Firstly, i'm 23 (Indo-canadian, F) and im currently doing my graduate studies. I don't think that my moms emotionally abusive in anyway, but every time i talk to her, i feel pretty bad. I was always an overachiever till 2 years ago. Till then i had a lot of extra circulars, and did really well at school. Even then, i dont really remember her ever telling me ""GOODJOB"" or ""you did really well"". her responses were always an ""OK"". I always thought this was because she didnt want me to become cocky, and always be grounded. My dad has a business and he was really intent on me going into a specific grad program so i could take over the business, (which i listened to at the time because i didn't really have a preference at tht point). once i started doing the program i hated it (the students, the profs, the working environment, the subjects, everything), but put too much effort time and money to get in at this point, so i stayed with it. i failed 4 subjects (partially because i wasn't feeling the program, and also because i was in a slightly emotionally abuse relationship at the time). My school forced me to take a year off (bc thats what happens when you fail at my uni), and my mom wasn't having it. i think that was the first time i was completely broken...a very low point in life. having been an overachiever, i was now kicked out of my university for a year, had a really abusive long distance boyfriend, no job, no hobbies, no friends, and had no idea what to do with anything in life. That was the one time i needed someone to be by my side. But she crushed me. everyday, it was ""you failed because you're lazy, bc you're dumb, bc you're  etc."". Just constant putting down and stepping over my face when i was at the lowest point of my life. she would make sure to bring up the fact that i failed atleast 3-4 times a day. it was then i started to realize that she was just more intense this time, but things like this always happened. When i was in grade 12, my first boyfriend broke up with me, and i was balling my eyes out. she came home that day and i was hoping i had a shoulder to cry on.., all she said was ""I knew it, i knew he would leave. he's a smart guy...knows how to flirt with girls and leave once he;s bored. not dumb like you, to cling on like an idiot. why are you crying like an idiot now, wipe your tears and go do your work"". This was a big deal for me then... im never open with my emotions. This was THE FIRST time i was balling my eyes out to my mom, crying about someone that hurt me. And she called me weak for crying, and him smart because he knows how to slyly ""flirt with girls, and throw them when their use is done"". tht was the last time i cired or showed any sort of emotion of feeling infront of anyone, because she made it seem like only loosers cried, and successful winners didnt. Thankfully i took that year off, to find a part time job i loved doing, dump that asshole of a boyfriend, and find the man of my dreams. Not only did my current boyfriend offer all the emotional support i needed at the time, he introduced me to his friends so i never felt sad for not having friends, stayed up with me on a daily basis till i studied and passed every single one of my exams, and made sure to be there whenever i had a breakdown or anxiety attack. a sweetheart in every way. although her really mean comments stopped after i passed/cleared those exams, there have always been comments here or there, comparing me to other girls, or telling me i dont know how to do anything right. i've never mentioned my current boyfriend to her but i feel like she's got an idea of who it is and makes random comments like "" your last boyfriends were horrible, so im assuming your taste is really bad nextime tooo. im not going to deal with more drama at this point, so please just dont date and we'll find you someone"". she doesnt even know who he is, but she dismisses it because my past decisions have been bad. She constantly talks about another girl we know who found a guy who was rich, goodlooking, and from a higher caste (im indian so caste/community/sect is a big thing here). My boyfriends the best guy out there, but he's definitely lower than me in terms of money, looks, and caste, so i dont think she's going to like him. I personally have no problem with any of this because ive been with guys who have had all the qualifications my mom has put out, and have been the biggest douches (AKA my ex). I havent mentioned a word to my mom about my current boyfriend, but the fact that she keeps slipping in these random topics, and random talks is making me think she knows who im dating, and is trying to manipulate me out of it.  not only that, she still tells me im never going to succeed in life because im lazy, and cant take care of myself etc. BUT THIS could all be in my head and i could just be reacting really badly to general statements she's telling/sharing with me. what do you guys think? I've always had low self esteem and self doubt issues, because ever since i was little, every decision i made was put down and made to feel like a bad decision. So i guess im really confused about this too...has my mom changed for the better after i passed (and im just over-exagerating things now because im an idiot) or is she still subtly  trying to manipulate me and put my opinions down and make me feel worthless (in which case i need to move out, or kill myself, one of the two)?  i've tried to make this as unbaised as possible because i truely want to know whether im at fault and need to fix myself, or my mom!! PLEASE HELP!! on a side note, i love my mom too much to ever confront her about my actual feelings and potentially hurt hers... i guess she also has her own set of issues because of her parents, and alot of family stuff going on atm, and im really understanding of it. maybe im just her punching bag to get all the tension out? i just cant be the punching bag forever....there are days when i feel like im a worthless peice of shit, that needs to die because im so indecisive and apparently cant do ""anything right"" in her words.

19,"About a year ago I had gallstone attacks which lead to avoiding food a lot. I stopped getting the attacks but my eating patterns continued. After a while I began avoiding lunch and now I often will only eat 1 meal a day and it's usually very small. I'm hungry all the time and tired and irritated but I can't actually eat for some reason. Also I've dropped 20kg in 1 year. I'm not vomiting and I don't want to bring the food back up, It's just that I don't want to eat in the first place even though I'm really hungry and I don't really know why that is.

I’m writing this with the fear that talking about it will fear it might trigger again the anxiety attack. Yesterday I had an anxiety attack and has lasted up until today. It’s on and off throughout the day. I am a little better today but when I was in class in the morning it started and oh boy I left in the middle of lecture and starting crying a lot at the campus. Now, it started yesterday and I don’t know what triggered it. I have never in my life experienced an anxiety attack and oh boy now I feel bad for the people who have suffered them for a long time. I’ve been a lot under stress like no joke and to be honest I haven’t take care of my body and mind. I’m always all about school and work and not worrying about myself. So, it started yesterday and I feel like my body , ear and hands are numb and sometimes I don’t feel my body and that’s when I start to freak out . I’m guessing my head is like how you feel when you are high. Like a ballon, and my heart pounding a lot like my heart is ripping out. My boyfriend has helped me a lot and yoga too. Like , today I practice breathing and it has been helping a lot. Also, I was able to nap a little bit because since yesterday I’m afraid of sleeping since I feel my body is leaving my mind and I get paranoid and scared. Has anyone experienced this ?

24,"I'm not personally a huge believer in self-diagnosing, as it can cause more problems than it solves, but a while ago I was browsing Wikipedia and reading up on personality disorders just out of boredom (I have an ASD and I got into clinical psych for like a week) and realized that the page for avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) describes what I'm like remarkably well, almost to the point of being scary. Here's everything from the symptom list of that page that applies to me: belief that one is socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others; excessive preoccupation with being criticized or rejected in social situations; unwillingness to become involved with people unless certain of being liked (ADDENDUM: only to certain extents; I don't wait until I'm absolutely certain, but like 80% sure); avoidance of social or occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fear of criticism, disapproval, or rejection; Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed; Is unusually reluctant to take personal risk or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing; Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.

30,"This is gonna be long so skip to the bottom for a summary if you don't want to read all of it.

Basically, I spent about a few weeks home from school when I was roughly twelve with a bad flu (not bad enough to be hospitalised though). I had quite a large amount phlegm build up in my nose and throat, as well as feeling very fatigued, and a little sensitive to light. 
I put on a movie (pirates of the Caribbean number three) and about half way through I had to stop. This was due to feeling very tired, and also because I found the TV too bright. Also, the scene where Jack Sparrow is pulling a ship along an endless sea of sand (and a bunch of weird rocks turn into crabs and pull the ship away) kind of freaked me out; I'd always found that scenes where characters are surrounded by never ending nothingness, or just a blank landscape unbelievably upsetting (they could walk for miles and get nowhere. They have nothing to look forward to; that sounds like my personal HELL).

Anyway, so I go to bed, and I vividly remember having a pirates of the Caribbean themed nightmare. It went something like those little rocks kept turning into crabs and then the crabs would turn into rocks, and I couldn't tell which was which or what was real, and their colour kept changing from white to black to checkered, and for some reason I had this desperate urge to hold onto a rope; and if I didn't, I would fall or something imminently bad would come if I let go.

When I woke up, I couldn't breath properly, and I felt unbelievably afraid. I had a desperate desire to hold on to something, but whenever I gripped my blankets, it didn't feel . . . Enough. It's really the only way I can describe the feeling - I had to grip something because if I didn't, waves of anxiety would overcome me, and I felt like crying. Also, at the edges of my vision, and whenever I closed my eyes, I could see the same interlocking black and white patterns that I saw o the crabs. I remember getting up and running to the kitchen, and desperately trying to find something - I remember gripping the table, the chairs, the phone, but it always felt to unstable or not enough to support myself. It felt like hours of running around the house in near tears, just grabbing things to hold onto, and feeling as though something terrible would happen if I didn't, all while the checker patterns flitted around my vision, further heightening my fears. 

Sometime later, I ""came to"" in a sense; I found myself in the study, hanging on to the back of the chair, while the black and white pattern had faded enough for me to ignore it, and the feelings of intense fear eased enough for me to be able to confidently recognise my own home. (before, I didn't really process or know where I was; the panic had consumed any feelings of familiarity towards my surroundings) I realised that I couldn't breath properly - not in the same way that you can't breathe when feeling really nervous or when you have a panic attack, but as in I literally could not get enough air into my lungs because of the phlegm blocking it. 

I managed to call my mum (who was picking up my sisters from school at the time) and told her that I couldn't breath properly, and ohhhh boy it was sooo relieving to hear her voice. She told me to wait just a little bit, she was almost home, and that it would all be fine in a moment. I waited for her to come home, watching our drive way through a window, just trying to breath slowly enough to get enough air. Within twenty minutes, I felt my throat clear up enough, and when mum came home, I told her it was fine now, and I've never spoke about it or thought about it to this day.

Could anyone shed a light on what caused this, or what it was? The more I write the more i wonder if it was more like a panic attack and less like a hallucination. TBH, I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

tl;dr: I suffered from a rather intense nightmare and woke up seeing black and white interweaving patterns moving across my vision, as well as extreme feelings of panic that made me temporarily unaware of my surroundings. I had this desperate urge that I need to hold on or grip something, and if I let go of any object, I would feel waves of anxiety and fear overcome me. This felt like it lasted for hours (but probably only lasted 20mins or so), and when I ""came to"" I found I couldn't breathe properly due to my throats and nose being blocked by phlegm.

I feel empty, and i realized today that i've been feeling this way for years. I don't know how i feel, i don't know what i want. I'm breaking up with my boyfriend because i've been dishonest about how i feel. I've been convicing myself that i'm in love, when i was not. I just felt nothing. I couldn't tell the truth because i didn't have it.

I just have no idea if i have emotions anymore. I might, but i don't process them. I'm in autopilot, even right now riting this, and i feel disconnected. Time passes without me. I live in the past because i juste can't exist in the present. I laugh, i cry, i get angry, but i'm empty. Those things i want, i think i don't even actually want them. What i'm thinking, it might be all wrong. What i try do to, i do it all wrong, because i have no idea what is happening. I only apply lessons that have been put in my head, i feel like i'm a machine, executing natural human things, when really there is nothing going on inside.

I thought i was a caring calm person, but i keep being the opposite. Or sometimes not. I doesn't even make sense.

I feel like crying, but i can't get those tears out. I feel guilty, and i don't agt the same time. I want this, and yet i want that, all to realise that maybe i want nothing at all.

I feel like fighting for the best life ever, but at the same time i could just sit on the floor and wait until i starve.

My ex has told me he thought about if i was bipolar or lunatic. I don't think i am, but again, i just know nothing.

I've lost all landmarcks. Even worse, i never had any, i just pretended and convinced myself i had some. The way i think, the way i act, i've been building a fragile personnality that actually doesn't exist. The real me, i don't know anything of it, i don't even think i truly exist anymore.

37,"I guess I'll start with an explanation and see where this goes.  I was sexually abused as a child from the ages of 8 to 15 by my step-father.  I never came forward about it because by the time I realized what was going on, I also knew the stigma tied in with being a male sexual abuse victim would never go away, and I never wanted to be labeled a victim.  It's something I never talked about until very recently, 16 years later.

I also served, in a combat capacity, as a Security Contractor, in Iraq.

Up until very recently I have been able, for lack of a better word, keep my shit together.  My prior abuse, private battle with depression that was left untreated, and everything else never really effected my day to day life, and in general, these things never bothered me or left me feeling 'weak', again, for lack of a better word.

Roughly three years ago, major changes took place in my life over a very brief period of time.  My father died while I was moving to a different state and was unable to attend the funeral, I started getting help for my depression after an involuntary commitment to a mental health facility a few months later, and a few months after that, in the middle of out-patient treatment, my ex, who was out of country for a few months, broke up with me over Skype, forcing me to move back in with family from the State I moved from.

Now, I guess this is where things get strange for me.  Since all of the above, it seems my capacity to handle stress, sadness, my depression, and emotions in general has gone out the window.  Things that never got to me before now effect me, sad or happy parts in movies always move me to tears when they never did before.  All in all, I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions.

I am sorry for the long post, but I guess my questions are as follows;  Do traumatic events cause personality shifts?  Is there anything I can do to reverse it, or is the damage done?  Have I just been holding in all of my emotional problems until I mentally no longer could?

Again, I apologize for the long post.  I am just really confused about all of this.  Thank you for reading.",06Jul2018,0,

40,"I’ve had anxiety, rumination/worry and sometimes panic since a bad THC trip in early February. Also: feeling just that bit more somber when sad since then. 

Unsure if it’s triggered by the drugs, the stress, some harsh realizations (see below) or a combination. 

Kept working. Then in April and esp. May it became a regular rhythm: day starting too early (lack of sleep) with high anxiety, also rumination and worry. Nights of 5-6 hours tops. The anxiety usually decreased in the evening. But it became less predictable as the days went by. Again: kept working. Have a creative job so this was tough sometimes. 

My doctor and therapist (not psychiatrist, have been seeing him for a year) both agreed I should start on escitalopram 10 mg. I did, that Saturday (June 9th) and promptly stopped going to work that Monday due to feeling low. 

Because: within 3 days I felt that much worse. More lethargic and less motivated. Also less emphatic, more purely self centered. Was I slipping in this direction or was it the pills? Also: many memories from childhood and adolescence surfacing, most of them painful. And as said, I had already come to realizations about life that are pretty harsh (I turned 40 in April and feel like I don’t have my life in order as much as my friends, being single and renting, and having what outwardly seems like a dream job but can’t quite make ends meet). These had been the subject of my worry and rumination (also: the inevitability of death and partly uncontrollable nature of life). 

Unsure if it’s depression, anxiety disorder, burn out or a combination. And again: unsure if it’s triggered by the drugs, the stress, the realizations or a combination. Is it just out of whack neurotransmitters? I had insecurities before but could handle them. 

I’ve been on escitalopram for 28 days, with a bump to 15 mg 4 days ago. Sleep hasn’t much improved despite adding low dosage quetiapine (25mg) and mirtazapine (7.5mg) which I think is a pretty heavy mix (was recommended by a psychiatrist I know). When I don’t take those the nights are awful, worse than ever. When I do, I get some sleep but hardly a full night. I wake early and ruminate. 

Friends sometimes come and sleep over (or I go to theirs) to take care of me so I can preserve energy. Other than it’s a lonely road and I feel ever lower energy-wise. Lethargic. 

Unsure if it’s the pills, the depression or lack of sleep. Combination?

Some hope: I do feel less anxious and panicky and have started to check some news headlines and movie news, which I didn’t (couldn’t?) a few weeks back due to feeling triggered by them. Not sure I ‘enjoy’ it but I can ‘handle’ it now. Anhedonia is a term I don’t want to throw around too loosely but I don’t derive pleasure from anything and don’t cry at all. I’m scared and desperate though. Looking back I wonder if I ever enjoyed my hobbies or job. 

I’m unsure if I should switch meds. The escitalopram was supposed to help my anxiety. It is doing so somewhat but now the ‘depression’ (no sleep, no joy) has worsened (through time or through the meds, I wonder), which is why I got bumped to 15 mg this week.

 I need the meds to lift me up somewhat as in my current state therapy seems undoable. Heck, most things seem undoable. But I’m worried they’re not helping or going to help. They’re doing *something*, which is why my doctor wants to keep trying. 

That’s where I am now. Any views and especially recognition or relatable similarities, with some hope, would be welcome.

Anyways cut to the endish of March and we were due to play an out of town gig, today had been pretty hard as my grandad only had days left and I was having to seriously consider dropping out of college, not only were we late to the gig because of traffic but our drummers parents werent the easiest to be with the journey constantly bickering at each other and making us fret. To cut a long story short only ten people showed to the gig way less than we were used to, (which admittedly this does sound ungrateful but I guess I was looking for something to put my negative emotions upon), really bad techinal issues from the sound and my guitar, and just everything else I ended up proper breaking down on stage, full on hyperventilating panic attack so I had to run off mid set. I apologised to the band and the promoters that night, hell even the audience but most of them were perfectly understanding and some were even like ""nah man it was chill proper rockstar"". Cut to a few days later, Grandad had finally passed and as bad as it sounds I felt a little better as finally like that had all been cleared up and I could move on from worrying about him, I'd finally decided to leave college as I knew I just wasn't ready for it at the moment and wanted to devote 24/7 to my band, however I get a message that very same day...
""I'm sorry [my name] but what you did was unacceptable and unprofessional and we can't have this kinda behavior in this business, you're our"".
This was the straw that finally broke me, for the past two years I'd put my heart, my soul, my very life into this band, it wasn't just a hobby of mine it was very being, I was even the one who founded the thing and it was at the time the only thing I felt I had left. I had a full on melt down, and admittedly I said stuff I shouldn't have and proper lost it at them, which god oh god do I regret to this day, what if I said something different, what if I had just been more level headed, what if I had slept the night before, what if I wasn't a day into some pretty strong new meds, these thoughts to this day constantly plaguing my mind of everything I could have done to not ruin this for me. 
It turned out that was final and I've never been the same from that point on, my anxiety and depression have blown into full extreme often meaning I can't leave the house, I've had several suicide attempts and my physical health is the worse it's ever been, socializing just is so impossible rn as ive become so paranoid to trust people that I don't even want to risk talking to them, motivation, cleanliness, sleep, eating, even trying to sit still are completely as low as they could possibly be right now. Yet whenever my old band appears I see them being so successful, playing bigger and more gigs, getting more and more fans, further and further climbing that ladder of success and I hate them for it, they've made me such a bitter and evil and untrusting person and I hate them for it, but more importantly I hate myself for letting me hate them for it, I hate myself for letting my negative traits and personality win, I hate myself so fucking much and with it those feelings worsen every day. I feel so trapped, so alone, so empty and on edge and at the end of the day, it's all my fault.

TL;DR: got kicked out of my band for a mental health crisis, turned me into pure bitterness and hate sabotaging my own life with no way out 

Ik it may seem silly because it's all about a band so if you want more detail on why it meant so much to me then please just ask below",06Jul2018,70,
42,"Hi! 
You may know me as the annoying person who didn't understand how to let people know about her work without sounding like an advertisement. Don't worry, lesson learned! I'm advertising nothing I swear... Just didn't understand why I shouldn't share links to my stuff, I often don't realise that stuff! 

In saying that, I decided to start something that is really big for me, I used to have a Patreon but I am shutting it down in 2 weeks because I have instead started something for free that I think is much better and fits my goal, which is to contribute to the autistic and mental health communities how I can. 

A bit of background quickly, I am autistic, have bipolar, narcolepsy, OCD, panic disorder and a spinal injury that gives me chronic pain.  Needless to say, working has been an issue. I've been fired for falling asleep on a cash register, in a daycare, for being manic, for my social issues and taking days off for pain. One day my specialist basically called me a fool for making myself ill out of stubbornness, because I just couldn't let go of working. I'm a highly motivated and passionate person, I'm a single mum, and I felt like working was a part of my identity and self worth. However I was quickly running out of money and had to go on a disability pension. 

I was distraught, I felt shaken, but after 6 months of intense depression started making moves to work from home. I used all of my marketable skills, I had a book published, became a full-time songwriter and even once worked with Warner Music Group. I transcribed government meetings, I studied how to make perfume &amp; cosmetics, how to graphic design, paint, draw... But I was too unwell to do it and every time I had to go into recovery I lost my clients/shops.

Over the years though, with intensive treatment, giving up shampoo to afford doctors, I have gained an incredible amount of well-being and health, a higher amount than I've ever experienced. 

In one month I open my all natural cosmetics store that I've been building for 12 months, but this post is not about that. You see, a while ago while unwell I went searching for comedy that was relatable to me. I was miserable and wanted to smile. I found nothing and it made me take action. I started my comic series August the Autist, a dark humour comic about autism and mental health, slowly to this brand I added a podcast discussion relevant issues, a blog and animations. I started a Patreon because I can't afford to dedicate the needed time to keep it all going, but I think now I went about it the wrong way. A pay-wall isn't very inclusive.

Now in just 3 weeks I'm opening a new website, on it will be all of my comics, animations, podcasts and blog for free! But there will also be a store where I will sell my comic books, clothing, posters and homewares all with either August the Autist designs, or designs by me about autism &amp; mental health that are funny. This way, this who can afford it can buy something, and those who can't don't have to! 

The suggestions I would LOVE from you guys is, would you like something like this? If so, what content would you like in the podcasts and blog? How would you like to be involved and how can I facilitate that? I'd love to read your thoughts! Thank you for reading! ",06Jul2018,2,

I am hoping for a little advice this morning. My husband has been suffering on and off with depression for many years, and has been experiencing it again recently. I'm working to find someone he can speak to, but I don't know what I can do for him at home. I try to take his mind off of it, and just genuinely be there for him, but I know that's not enough. He's made some comments about not understanding why he's down (""I have a good life. A loving wife, incredible friends and family, and a good job. Why do I feel like everything would just be easier if I wasn't alive?). We also have a registered, unloaded gun hidden in our home, as we live in a city and I would rather be safe then sorry, and he has asked me to move it from it's current spot and hid it from him. I'm starting to get nervous that one day I'll come home and find him dead, and I don't know what I can do to help him. ",06Jul2018,5,

 I feel guilty because, for one, today I should be working a one-on-one shift with a kid who gets pretty upset when I have to cancel. He understands and isn't angry, but he gets sad. His parents even know why I have to call in on these days, so they've probably helped him understand. 
I also needed the hours. We had the 4th off but unpaid. Thing is I think the fireworks may be part of what's been getting to me. I'll have to try to work extra next week to make up the hours. If I fall short on my paycheck its my boyfriend who has to bail be out. He makes 2 or 3 times what I do but I still feel really bad when I can't handle my half of the bills.

I want to change, but I never succeeded in making myself interact with others. This makes me really aggravated, for not being able to do something we as a species are normally good at.

I also noticed that I'm extremely introvertial. I never liked being in large groups. Recently, I've visited the psychiatrist a couple of times, and what I've deducted from my visits was that I need to push myself out of my comfort zone. Problem is, I never learned how.

I've had these since I understood what death was and gore was, but it got worse when I was in third grade. I can vividly remember some of these, they ranged from murder to rooms filled with gore(intestines and blood all over the walls and stuff like that). With me being older now, its gotten much less of a problem, happening less often. The thoughts of this stuff isn't what the problem is though, sometimes I get incredibly angry for no particular reason. Getting angry over quiet literally nothing. I don't wish to seek medical help, since I don't want to get labeled a loony for it, since it's not to much of a problem, but I also don't want to live the rest of my life not knowing what might be wrong with me and possibly hurting someone in the future.

Any advice?",06Jul2018,1,
50,"Going to be quite a bit of waffle I imagine but(and I am not quite sure where to post this sort of story -this is a fb post, which I very rarely do, so excuse some of the personable language...quite a few know I started training on the job to be a teacher back in September. I plodded along and things were going ok, but my progress was limited. It was all very much routine. Come January I went to my 2nd placement who decided to offer me a job interview in which I was successful. Pretty good right? To be honest, it sucked. My development was sluggish and I made some giant errors during my first formal external visit which major concerns were bought up. Snow happened which meant there were a lot of distractions and eventually I fell down the stairs, fortunately without any major injuries.

Easter happens. 2 weeks, no school! But my own mental challenges sunk in and I had started falling into a very dark state, wildly anxious and was on the verge to quitting. I did not think I was good enough for the job and the kids. I went in first Monday to my training day, spoke to the wellbeing officer (one of the best ladies you would have the pleasure of knowing) and I broke down into tears with the line ""I want to quit"". Instead of just letting me fall and collapse, the SCITT and the people involved were the most supportive people I have ever met or known in my life I had a berating from a ragey tiny sister and some much needed encouragement by other close people.

Next thing you know, my progress and development as a teacher switched up a gear and I went from a 3 in one external observation to a 1 for my summative ( most important one of the year almost). But I still had to make it through my final. Had the celebrations last night, prematurely for me. I woke up at 4:30am. I taught every hour at school today and my final assessment was right at the end. Broke the news. I've been successful. I've passed.

It is shocking thinking back over my last year. Started terribly coming off a crappy end to my summer, but since then have worked so hard to bring new people into my life and inspire and give the opportunity of our next generation to succeed in life in some way. I needed that dip, that massive low before I could rise up to who I am today. I have had so many crazy stories, good, funny and sad. But today has made it all worth it and now I can finally look forward into my career as a secondary Computer Science teacher.

For those suffering with mental health issues at all. Find those people who will support you. Try to work out what is holding you back, break it down and plan how you can overcome them. I am, for the first time ever, trying to actively get it fixed and am seeing the people I need to see to fix my head. But, this is a massive stepping stone. Good luck all and hopefully I inspire one person out there to seek help or see through to the end one thing they are pursuing

55,"I have a longstanding problem with depression. I've tried counseling with more than a half-dozen clinical psychologists (one at a time), cumulatively amounting to several years of once-a-week 50-minute therapy sessions. 

Every one of these guys was completely worthless, or worse. Two of them just sat there, taking notes and never said anything to me. 

Two others were psychotic and delusional. One of them actually suggested that I go out and marry a stranger, anybody, just to see how it worked. 

Several other were religious - conservative Christian (Baptist, Presbyterian), or in various Christian cults (e.g., Jehovah's Witnesses). Even though I was referred by a secular source (personal physician, Employee Assistance Program) and they initially assured me that they ""never"" tried to persuade clients to adopt their religious beliefs, after a few months, they explicitly told me that their ""solution"" for my every problem was to swallow their religious beliefs, undigested. Then they gave me stacks of evangelistic literature for their religious organization and told me to read it. I was paying $100 an hour to be witnessed to!!

I have a B.S. in Psychology from a major state university, so I know what is a reasonable expectation and what is un-professional and even unethical conduct from a clinical psychologist. In every one of the above cases, these guys violated very clear standards of care. I should sue them or report them to the state licensing bureau, but I'm too depressed to do so and besides, it's my word against theirs. 

I still want to get some counseling. I've tried getting the names of therapists from my primary care doctor, Employee Assistance Program, and friends/relatives, with the above results. 

I live in Alabama. Is every psychologist/therapist down here a hyper-Christian zealot, and/or just a complete nutjob? If not, **how do I find someone who actually knows what they are doing?**

57,"Once upon a time there lived a boy who had the unfornte problem of being stalked by an invisible monster. Nothing the boy could do would get rid of it. No amount of running or begging or pleading with it would make it leave. The worst part of all this boy was blamed for all this monster did and when he tried to tell them about the monster and how it wasn't him they would tell him he was just making excuses and how he needed to take responsibility for his actions if he was ever going to change and get better. The boy wanted to give that too them and he would try hard but no matter how hard he did the monster would come again and lay rubble where ever the good was that he started to build and again the boy would have to endure the looks of judgement and feel the pain of rejection. All because the boy was stalked by the invisible monster. He knew as long this monster stayed he would never have love or truly be accepted. So began his quest to find help.

      Fortunate for the boy he live in land of many monster hunters. In fact some of the best hunters on the planet lived by him. So he went to pay them a visit but qickly he lost hope as one by one each one they either threw him out because of the monster or just ignored him or told him he didn't have enough to cover their fees. He was left devastated. Tears running down his face hopelessness began to set in. As he felt damned to live in a world where he would always be blamed and judge for the things his monster did. He felt so hopelessness he became determine to end it. 

     At one point he stood at the edge of very high cliff just as he was about to jump there came a voice inside that told him this was not the answer. That voice was enough to make him back from the edge and after that he decided that he would again reach out in hopes of finding at least one hunter or person who would help him break free.

     He would occianally would find a person who was willing to endure the wrath of the beast but it was usally only for awhile before they left and he was again left to face it alone again. 

     So how does the story of the boy and his monster end. Well if you are expecting a fairy tail ending with happily ever after at the end then you will be sadly disappointed. Because the boy at some point becomes a man and as man he left to live only knowing hate and rejection as the monster continues to do it distruction and he continues to be blamed. He becomes completely isolated living on the streets and has to watch the world as if it where a movie played all out before him as as people around him have someone to laugh with shoulders to cry on and friends to spend time with. Things that he never truly got to have because that is life as boy with an invisible monster. So we end this tail here sorry this is not the ending you may be hoping for but this is what life is like for many of us living with mental illness. We are often sidelined forgotten and treated as if the things we are doing r our fault because of our invisible monsters. Those who are suppose to be there to help us fight back aganist our personal beast often can't be found or among those who are judging us for the actions of our monsters. So a lot of us suffer the same fate as the boy in this story.

58,"3 hours ago I started writing a long document of what I would say to a health professional if I were to see one.

5 hours ago I drank caffeine and took a modafinil to try and get myself to focus.

7 hours ago I realized I fell asleep, tried to get up and study for a stressful phone interview in T-minus 2 hours.

4 hours ago I realized I was making negative progress - doing everything but what I intended, I can't even remember but it was just wasting time on the internet instead of looking up things I needed to know even though I'd just been doing it. Started crying because I realized I couldn't focus on the clear priority no matter what.

This is only a snapshot but this isn't the first time this has happened. This, however, was the first time I cried in frustration of something I realized I was unable to do.

I haven't seen a professional before, but I am wondering, how does this appear to people of this subreddit? Is this abnormal behavior indicative of some condition?

I know I left a lot out, but there's just way too much to go into background about myself.  But when I start explaining I can't seem to stop writing, so I am trying to keep it short. I also don't want my past to color the picture differently, but it may help. So to elaborate, I've also experienced uncharacteristic behavior such as immediate short term memory loss, I'll forget something said 5 seconds ago. I have developed recently (in the past year or so) anxiety attacks, racing heart, gasping for breath etc, when triggered by stressful events. I have a successful job and can pay the bills but often I feel like I'm not. Looking at others' resumes in similar fields causes me to engage in certain coping mechanisms. On the outside looking in many may not be able to tell that I have an issue due to my ability to appear normal. I have a history of anger and frustration, which I believe is due to undiagnosed dysthymia that started at age 8. Since then, I never stopped asking, ""what is the point of this?"" I am now soon to turn 24. My natural state is apathy; I am now uninterested in building serious relationships though I have had many friends in the past. I've led a ""healthy"" lifestyle, exercise, friends, food, etc. It hasn't changed my mental state. I am typically a very serious and analytical person. I hesitate to say strong, but I've been through life without a support system in a very demanding environment.

60,"My dad is 61 years old and is a super dad, a hero of mine. But damn has he been through a lot, he's a strong cookie and i'm sure has put up with more than most - He is based in the UK.

My dad needs psychiatry help from someone who can unravel complex issues brought on by chronic fatigue illness, tendencies for Cluster A personality disorders, and an unsettled past of family, relationship, death, and financial issues (financial brought on by chronic fatigue and being unable to work, with the stress of being pressured to work and disability allowances taken away). He has struggled with chronic fatigue for 25+ years.

He is a smart man and in his prime, had an easier time dealing with these problems. As he gets older and less mobile, I worry deeply about his future and the effect on myself, my sister and his sister.

Now I know he would give an arm and a leg to help someone else but struggles to help himself, which makes this harder.  So I want to try my best to give him the best chance of getting through this before it's too late.

He has paid for a private psychiatry session which was £150 per half hour, which was very useful... but very expensive. He did this because initially the classic NHS system did not (and still do not) get him the help he needs. Following that private session, it was suggested he has CAT therapy but the system is also struggling to get him this treatment.

I personally think the issue is more complex than this and needs more than a one-off treatment... but a supportive treatment that slowly backs away as time goes on and improvements are seen.

\- funded help from mental health charity?

\- 'affordable' psychiatry sessions?

\- other options in the NHS?

65,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I'm not sure how to start this post off - basically I just want to feel / live a normal life. This may not be the most organized post you have read but I will try to keep it divided up into different sections for each issue that I am having.

About me. I'm a 31 year old male who doesn't drink or do any drugs. I drank heavily when I was 25-27, but only in social settings. I used to partake in heavy consumption of MJ when I was 18-21. Asides from that I have steered clear of hard drugs.

1) I am convinced that people are trying to ""get"" me in one way or another. For example, when I first met my wife 4.5 years ago and would stay at her place I would always have a water bottle on the night stand. After I fell asleep I would be unable to drink from that bottle again because I was convinced she put something in it to get rid of me. It's not just with her (it doesn't happen with her anymore if you're wondering, but still happens with everyone else I run across) that that problem would / still does happen. I have an extremely hard time eating food prepared by anyone but myself due to the fact it may be tainted by someone who is still out for me. If we are out somewhere and I take my eyes off my drink (just water) for a split second I have to get a new one due to the fact someone could have put something in it.

2) I am unable to be in around other people without a close confidant due to the fact I am always paranoid that something ""bad"" may have happened. When around other people my mind begins to wander around doing awful things to them to the point that I get extremely worried something may have happened and have to check the newspaper / news channels for days after to see if that specific location shows up for something happening. 

3) I have anxiety and am unable to travel more than an hour(ish) from my home. I have had anxiety my entire life but it seems as if it just continues to get worse. If I take a xanax the anxiety will get better but I don't want to be dependent on a pill to help. I do not take xanax even when I should due to that fact.

4) Depression seems to be an issue as well. I no longer care about my personal hygiene (even something as mundane as brushing my teeth) or anything else for that matter. I have tried an anti depressant or two before with no results to improving depression other than it made me no longer able to get erect. I do not take any depression medication.

5) Hypochondriac. I am constantly worried about something being wrong with me. If it's not a brain tumor, it's colon cancer. If it's not colon cancer, it's a failing heart. So on and so forth. 24/7 I have these thoughts running through my brain.

6) Sometimes I hear a baseball game being played and announced over the radio when I'm laying in bed. I also hear music, sometimes old sometimes newer from time to time. I don't have a radio so I know it's just me hearing it. My wife doesn't hear it. I have heard old ""saloon"" music before when no one else did - until I recorded it with witnesses there on a voice recorder and they could hear the music through the recorder but not when it was happening in real time.

7) I legitimately do not care about others, asides from my very close family and 1 true friend. I do not care about their well being, I do not care if I offend them, I do not care if I anger them. If they got ran over by a train in front of me, it wouldn't affect my day one way or another. Why? I thought this was normal until my wife explained to me it was not.

The anxiety, depression, and hypochondria are things that I know about and just accept it for what it is. I do not understand why I am unable to be around other people without instantly thinking of bringing harm. I do not have insurance nor do I have the money to go to a therapist. If there is more information needed from me please ask and I will answer.

Any advice? Thoughts?",06Jul2018,1,
66,"**PHAT ED EMET TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

super tl:dr i think i have a combination of merycism, lactose intolerance, arfid and bulimia/anorexia? 

tl:dr effortless regurgitation of stomach contents, worse with lactose products (ice cream, coffee particularly), very little food intake, recent intentional purging and feeling like i’m obese when i’m underweight

if it changes anything, i’m 15 years old, 6’0”/183cm, 51kg/112.5lbs/8 stone, afrikaans (half boer, half xhosa) and irish, white.

i’m aware that this probably isn’t the right place but idk where else to post this. i can’t go to a gp or whatever because my family is extremely stressed about my health and seeing how terrified and paranoid they get when it gets worse effects my mental health beyond believe. 

*almost* every time i eat anything, my stomach quickly becomes upset and from 1 minute after to an hour after, i begin to effortlessly, and without intention, bring up undigested stomach contents that are foul-smelling and -tasting but do not continue acid and bile and thus doesn’t cause me pain or heartburn. merycism is a motility order that 75%~ fits what i described. on the wikipedia page, it says that merycism patients purge every single time and what comes up has no smell or unusual taste, which is present in what i have.

this does not cause pain but greatly deteriorates my dental health and quality of life. this, for a very long time, was more than sufficient to make me limit my food intake.

recently moreso, i’ve noticed that i got bad stomach pains from eating icecream. as that progressed and got worse, i noticed the same with icecream. icecream doesn’t cause stomach pain but does cause unusually bad purging. i don’t consume enough of another dairy products to know if it applies to them too, so this is tentative. 

i drink coffee several times a day and with almost every meal (which is usually 30-75% of one average sized dinner a day) and its unique effects on my dental health, the purging and the stomach pain have lead to the pretty severe restriction of my diet from: a bowl of breakfast with sugar, usually seconds. a few (2-5) glasses of juice. a few sandwiches, crisps and biscuits throughout the day. a large dinner with seconds, to: several cups of coffee, and a small to medium sized portion of what i’m given for dinner. that’s it. 

the merycism-esque purging has always been effortless and without intention but recently i’ve started intentionally purging using a pen and i’ve noticed increasingly common instrusive thoughts where i feel weak and far when in actuality i am very thin. this has half the characteristics of bulimia with an overlap to anorexia so ???? what the fuck like what do i call this?

merycism is said to be caused by shock or trauma, like for example a death in the family. my brother committed suicide 6 years ago and i noticed it started around there, although it could have been before.

thank you very much for any advice and help in advance, it is greatly appreciated.",06Jul2018,1,
67,"hi all, i need some help on how i would go about finding mental help for myself. some background: teen student from united states under care of parents. 

my issue is that it's difficult to talk to my parents about my problems (although they are aware that i do have them) since they don't fully understand what i'm going through and i honestly don't trust them to find me the proper medical care. it's been an issue for a few years: me talking to my parents- them not understanding- them calling the wrong professionals or brushing it off. therefore, i'd like to be able to be in control of seeking my own help. i'm pretty hazy about insurance details and the such but i'm fairly confident my parents will pay-- it's just a matter of finding the right people. so money/insurance shouldn't be an issue.

the roadblocks i've come across are: school is currently not in session so school counselors are not an option (and even if they were, i take huge pride in my education and i'm not sure if i want them having records of me seeking mental health help), i currently do not have a family doctor (my last one just retired-- still haven't found a replacement) and i'm a very anxious person who has difficulty doing things out of my comfort zone (calling all those numbers or going into a clinic). 

if there are any questions about my situation i can clarify in the comments. thanks so much!",06Jul2018,2,

69,"Hi, I really need some help. 

I’m going to try and make this short but, it’s been a ride for the past seven months. My brother is 28 years old  and has been on a manic episode since December 2017. He broke up with his long term girlfriend which was definitely a stressor for him. In 2015 he had a manic episode where he thought he was in a video game and was running all around our city. He ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar. He was suppose to go to therapy and take medication but, he never did. But, nothing occurred until this past December. For the past few months my brother has had extreme delusions such as; thinking he was in the military and walking up and down our street peeking into neighbors houses. Thinking people were shape shifters. Thinking he was in WWII, and so many more. He’s been known to walk into traffic and this past weekend was mugged at gun point. He has had five hospitals stays since April 2018. He is also currently in a crisis center waiting for a bed. All the hospitals seem to do it put him on the same medication then let him out into the world and after two weeks he is back in. He does have moments of clarity where he cries because he is so upset this is happening to him. He also has complained about pains in his head, his head feeling hot, and feeling water inside his head. Seeing him in those psychiatric wards has been the saddest thing I have ever seen in my life. And I just don’t think it’s bipolar, I think it is something else. I really just posted this to vent and see if I can get any help because me and my family are so lost and are convinced he will be homeless or he will be dead within the summer. ",06Jul2018,4,
70,"Here goes my life story


My parents divorced before i learned to speak, then my mom remarried a guy who I called dad for 8 years. His job required us to move to south america where i was nearly kidnapped. My bodyguard shot the guy in front of me and saved my life. After that incident we moved back to America. I was 7. Then one day when i was 10 I came home from school to play my computer games only to find a sea of gay porn on the screen. I was mortified. Turns out my stepdad was bi. Last i heard from my step dad was that he drank himself to death 3 years ago. On top of all this im an only child, that alone is hard. I moved schools constantly. Everytime i finally made friends i was torn away from them. It got so bad that i sat by myself at school lunch tables. I got bullied. I ran away from home Got accepted into a gang and I did every drug known to man. I was selling drugs and  burglarising cars at night. My mom found the house i was hanging out at and she kicked the door in, grabbed me by the ear and brought me home. She said i either go back on the streets or go live with my father in the middle east. I moved to the middle east to get close with my real dad. I learned that hes an alcoholic whos been divorced 3 times and drinking a liter of vodka a night.I then became acquainted with my step brother, who was also an only child. Finally, a brother i have always wanted. We cut our hands and became blood brothers. We roamed the streets causing chaos, drinking, doing drugs, fighting. We were unstoppable, untill we ended up in jail in the middle east busted for selling hash. They told us we would be locked up for 6 years but we somehow got out in 4 days. I came back to the states. I became suicidal at 25 and bought a street bike. I didnt care if i died. I was speeding everywhere. I have made alot of bad choices. Im still suffering depression, social anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I tried to go to a wedding the other day but ended up hiding in the bathroom stall for an hour. I guess it could be much worse, but FML. I have been quite a failure. I can barley hold my job together, im constantly making bad decisions in just little day to day things. No idea what to do.

71,"I’m 19F and live in the U.K.

I’m a student and whenever I have free time, like a week or two off (it’s summer now so I have a couple months off) my mental health gets so bad. I get super depressed, like I feel right now. I instantly feel hopeless and lost and get anxious about everything. I am happy when I’m busy and have a structured week - my mind goes to shit as soon as I have some empty days ahead of me. 

I know the simple answer is ‘make some plans’ but socialising for a few hours doesn’t fix it. When I’m like this, my motivation to make plans and get things done goes away too, my energy to do things goes down and my sadness goes up.

I messed up and we had a pretty heated conversation to the point that I made her very upset to the point that she was getting sick.  She disappeared for a couple hours and then messaged me and told me to never contact her again and blocked me on everything that I could possibly contact her on.  

I know this is all my fault, and I did this to myself.  But I am not in a good situation at all with no one to talk to and my mental health is not good.  I can not make new friends and have relied totally on her for that emotional support.  I got the message when I was in my car and pretty much blacked out and got in a car accident.

74,"So I was diagnosed with atypical depression and I have been on lexapro for about 2 months now. I got this diagnosis because an overreaction to rejection that led to self harm. But I have this one thing that is hard to deal with that has not gone away. Whenever I have really intense emotions, especially of the obsessive or jealous type, I get a physical tightness in my stomach, and an extremely strong urge to something. If I'm not jealous, I usually just pace around and listen to music, which seems to calm whatever this reaction is. But if it's jealousy my emotions just take over and... yeah.

So is there a solution to this? Is there even a word for this type of reaction? I'll mention it to my therapist next time I see her and definitely my psychologist. It's just so strange since it also affects me when I am presented with something/someone that I am obsessed with like a TV show or hobby. It especially happens when I'm reading up on the subject.",06Jul2018,1,

I had taken a couple adderall I got from a friend the day before so I failed it.  I knew I was going to fail, I should have said something but I was so surprised and embarrassed after having to carry the cup right through the middle of the waiting room in front of 5 or 6 people.  So I just handed it over, got my prescriptions and bailed.

I was running low so I made an appointment for today.  Yesterday, the owner or something called me and told me I was terminated and that she wouldn't refill anything anymore.  I could understand if I was asking for a controlled substance like a benzo or adderall, but I just want my antidepressants.  I didn't think a 30 day supply while I'm looking for a new doctor would be refused.

I guess I'm fucked.  I have enough Prozac to make it 5 days but only 3 25mg Lamictal left, so I'm cutting my dose in half to last until Monday.  I don't know what to do.

77,"Hey all, so im 16 years old, and I know I'm too young, but what's done is done, I just want help. Last time ive done LSD was on the 23rd of June, my last time, and Ive done LSD 4 times, and smoked weed daily until the 23rd of June as well, i stopped cold turkey, and im never gonna do LSD again because of whats going on, even typing this, it made me feel like i was back in the 1st trip i had, thats the problem ive been having is that i feel like im living in a fake reality, and that one day, ill just wake up and go into the 1st trip again, and im scared. ive told my mother about it, but not in full detail, as i dont want to worry her too bad. I feel like everything will blur out and ill wake up in the bad trip. I recently learned that my biological father had schizoaffective disorder, which is why im no longer taking psychedelics, but im worried it may or may not be too late, whenever i think of the bad trip, it just puts me in the feeling that im there, that its still happening, and that i retreated into my mind for this world, which i know isnt true, but thats how i feel, and i wish it would stop

TL;DR- Took LSD 4 times, had 3 bad trips that all felt connected, in 2 i thought i killed my dogs(dont know why, i absolutely love animals, especially my dogs) now im having severe deja vu, what i believe are delusions (feeling like im still in the bad trip, as if i never woke up from it) and depression and DPDR type stuff

the details: (long read)

I tried LSD for the 1st time around April, my friend had picked up some voidrealms (105-110ug each tab) and i had took 2 because i thought that because of a prior 1g mushroom trip that i would be able to handle it

i was incorrect

We dosed in an RV my friend had on his property, as well as smoked a little bit of weed, it was him, his girlfriend, and i. This was his girlfriends first time trying LSD as well, and she had also taken 2 tabs, and my friend had taken 3, he was pretty experienced with LSD. As were waiting for the trip to start, his dad opens the door (he wasn't supposed to have his girlfriend over, ) but he was cool with the whole situation and brought us inside so we had a better environment, anyways, when we got into his RV, the trip began, and it was glorious, colors were intense, there were fractals on the characters on TV, drifting on paintings, it was beautiful. The trip was going good for about an hour or so, and my friends dad starts to get more and more aggravated and aggressive, i had kept on checking my phone and saying the time like, every 5 or so minutes to which he said ""Nobody asked what fucking time it was."" (Keep in mind, his dad was experienced with LSD as well, he should've known how to handle the situation) he had, at one point, thought he lost his phone, which prompted him to start throwing shit around looking for it. He had an art easle set up and he took it, and threw it on the ground, now i wasn't really worried about this, but i think it did make for some negative vibes, he then later found his phone in the seat he was sitting in, it fell out of his pocket... 

Anyway, we were watching some movie (some John Cusack movie) and his dad came out of the bedroom with a worried sounding voice, and, i swear to god, i thought i heard him say ""Somebody tipped them off."" which, is usually associated with the police, so i had thought police were coming to arrest us, (Keep in mind, i had no idea what he actually said, but im pretty sure he did say that) this is where the trip went south, and it went south fast, i stood up and started to pace kind of in place saying ""Oh man, oh no."" i heard my friends girlfriend say ""Is he ok?"" and other stuff like that, which only made me worry more, because i thought, ok, something wrong with me, and my friend asked me ""hey, are you good, do you like, need to get up and be a person tomorrow?"" (asked if i had to do shit the next day) and this was when the thought loop started.

Every 5 or so minutes was a repeat of my friend asking me if i had to be a person, to which i would look away confused, and then things started to become hazy, this repeated like, 3 or 4 times before i went into a blackout like state.

What happened next is kind of hazy, this is what i remember seeing.

its almost like it was a lucid dream, I looked at the window next to the door, and i could see the red and blue police lights, and after a moment of fear, i thought i heard someone knock on the rv door, to which my friends dad opened, and the cop that's usually at our school walked in, i thought i could see his badge and everything, the glasses on his forehead, the way he walked into the RV, everything, it was so vivid, then at one point after this (i had tried to go to their bathroom) i was standing in the bathroom, and had accidentally pissed myself out of fear, i had imagined that the cop opened the door and saw me, standing in the bathroom, with piss down my pants, and everyone was just staring at me, and i was staring back, it was awful, they had led me out and sat me down on the steps to the bathroom, there was also a female voice that i thought was the female cop from school as well, they had shown a flashlight in my eyes and were asking me ""Do you know where you are?"" ""How do you feel right now?"" ""What do you see?"" stuff like that, and thats when i had like, another blackout, and i had woken up. 

I was sitting in my friends recliner, all the lights in the RV were off as my friends dad was trying to sleep, at this point i was much more sober than i was 2 hours ago (was 2-3am when all this was happening, was now 5-6am) i had let my friends know that i was awake, and i had realized that i pissed myself, so they had told me to get my clothes off and get in the shower, which was a bad time, i had gone fetal position on the floor of the shower (which was moldy, i was in a terrible set and setting) after the ""shower"" i got out, and my friend gave me some shorts to put on and a blanket to put over myself, he then guided me back to the recliner, and was trying to talk me through the experience, the whole time he did this, i had thought that i was in a dream world, where him and his girlfriend were 2 of the ""acid gods"" telling me the truth about what the trip was (i forgot entirely what he told me that night though), i had tried to get my mom to come pick me up (she knew i was gonna try LSD, she was ok with it, but a little apprehensive because it was man made drugs) i had totally forgotten she was already at work so i just tried to stay there, i was outside just walking around with my friend and before i called her i asked him ""so, should i call her with this phone, or the real phone?"" (still thought i was in the dream world) so he led me back inside, where i just sat on the recliner, and stared out the window at the trees and some bluejays, i had managed to sleep for like, an hour, and when i woke up, i felt the good afterglow that acid has, i just felt good, so i waited for my mom to get off of work, and i went home (i had doused my clothes in Febreeze and cologne so she wouldnt smell piss) 

After this trip, i felt pretty good, wasnt having any negative side affects, and i shouldve called off tripping then and there, but, i decided to revisit it a few times, with different friends, and in a different environment, one i trusted. the only LSD ive ever done was voidrealms, so i know its good and potent LSD, except for the 2nd time i tried it, it was LSD but less potent, and on a different blotter.

the 3rd time i tried LSD was at home, i took it at like, 9:40pm, and sat back, relaxed, and waited, it was going good at first, but after about an hour, it started to go negative, i had repeating my actions, just felt really confused for some reason, i tried to take a shower to make myself feel better, and that kind of worked, but i was still feeling bad afterwards, so i went to my other friends house, this friend i trusted completely, and his house, i felt comfortable in (he had a separate building than the actual house) i went over, told him what was going on, and we just chilled out on his boat for a few hours, and i started to calm down, and i felt better, then he offered me a dab of some wax, to which, i stupidly agreed to, it was a harsh ass dab as well, i couldnt breathe for a solid 2 minutes, after i was able to breathe, my vision began to tunnel, and i heard this buzzing noise in my head, and as i tunneled further out, i could hear the buzzing slow down, and deepen in tone, i shook my head to snap out of it, and it felt crazy, the visuals i was having were so surreal and vivid, he had a work light behind him and it turned into like, 2x4 pixels, 2 high, 4 long, it was so weird, so we decided to go back inside, i was sitting on the edge of his bed, leaning against the wall, and i was looking at stuff in his room turn into black swirls, like, an a/c unit he had, just turned into this swirling circle, his ceiling fan did the same as well, this is where, i remembered something, something i had forgotten that i saw during my first trip, i had seen this before, and i had thought the cops were about to come, in what i ""saw"" before, a few cops came up and my mom was with them because she didnt know where i had gone or where i was, but it was only 2:30am, she doesnt wake up till 3:15am for work, i had asked my friend to check for cops multiple times, and each time, they werent there, so i decided it was a good idea to go home before i trip out any worse, plus my phone was dying and i lost my charger, so i took my moms, lmao.

I decided to run home, and it was just an incredible feeling, i started to hear Nirvana - Breed play in my head, i had gone inside, found my charger, returned my mothers, and tried to go to sleep. I had a dream that, my parents barged into my room, and saw me laying with my dogs body in my lap, as if i had killed her during some psychotic break, it was so scary, i woke up at like, 8am, and i went and checked on her immediately, and, well, she was fine. It was just a dream after all. After this trip, i had a slight feeling of deja vu, it was noticeable, but able to be pushed off, i was able to ignore it.

My last trip was on Saturday, June 23rd, about a week and a half ago, i went over to my friend house (same friend from the 3rd trip, i no longer hang out with the 1st friend) cuz he called me and told me to come over, i didnt know why, but i went anyway to see what it was, i went over there and he offered me a sliver of a tab of voidrealm, around 35-40ug id estimate, so i took it, and then we went inside and took a few good sized bong rips, after this we had to drop a friend off, about an hour in, and i started to feel its effects, and, they werent positive. I had felt like i was in the bathroom of the 1st trip again, i even thought i could hear the bathroom door open. I tried my best to shrug this off, but it was persisant. We got home and played some Speedrunner on the PS4 with my friends brother. As we were playing, whenever he'd get me out, he'd say something in victory such as ""Booyah!"" or ""Take that, bitch!"" or something else, and, every time he won, whatever it was he said, would be repeated, it would cycle through the things he said, and i started to feel like i was playing against LSD, as if he was LSD and i was me, fighting for my ego or something, every time i'd get ahead of him, he'd start talking normal, and symptathetically almost, idk, just more friendly, and whenever i'd lose, he'd say the same victory things, same pitch, tone, everything, this started to worry me a bit so decided i needed to go home, and go to sleep, it was like, 2:15am when i got back, so i went into my room, and tried to sleep, but i couldnt, i was wide awake, i was tossing and turning, and just moving a bunch in the bed, at like, 3:15am, my laptop screen turned on, when i rolled over to look at it, it immediately turned back off, which made me feel like, there was another reality, one in which my mom came to check on me, and after seeing me sleeping, she turned the light off (i asked her, and she never did) a few minutes later, i was just staring into my dark room, and i saw my bike leaning against the wall, and i could make out the outline of my other dog, Zues, on top of it, like, the bike morphed into him kind of, but he was all, dirty or something, i shrugged it off, and tried to sleep, but then, my laptop screen came back on, and stayed on, which made me thing, ok, somethings happening, i thought my parents walked into my room, and, saw me with my dog zues, bloody and dead, next to me, as if i had another psychotic break and killed another dog after it startled me by jumping on the bed, i was able to discern that from reality though as i knew it wasnt real, i could still see my laptop, no one was in my room, and my main light wasnt on, i had my door blocked off so my dog couldnt have gotten in anyway, i got up, shut my laptop, and tried to lay back down, to no avail, so i went back on it and went to tripsit.me, which helped a bit, and when day broke, i was basically sober, but still not feeling myself.

Ever since that day, ive been having Deja Vu, and it almost as if i can recall what people are saying to me, like ive already lived it, i just feel empty, and depressed, im questioning whether or not i woke up from my 1st trip, or like, i went psychotic after it, and killed my dogs in a different reality, i know its not real, because LSD cant cause a a person to live in a separate reality in such detail, right? It feels like, my brain created this reality as a safe place, where i didnt do any of that, but i know thats not the case, but, i still question it. When my friends dad said ""Someone tipped them off"" did the cops actually come? Did i just, retreat from that reality and come to this one? i know that cant be the case, so, why does it still feel like that?

I also saw an image of myself being thrown into a mental hospital for life

tomorrow will mark 2 weeks since my last and final trip, and im definitely feeling better than i did last week, but now i just feel, empty, hopeless, and depressed, plus i have some pretty bad deja vu, constantly, like, every fucking day, which makes me think of the bad trip, which makes me think its still happening, does anyone know whats going on? I'd see a professional, but i cant afford it, and the insurance my mom has is crap, what can i do to try to make sense of what happened? how can i reground myself? how do i just go back to the way i used to be? thanks in advance, and thanks for reading, im no longer using psychedelics and im taking a long break from weed",06Jul2018,6,

79,"On September 1st 2017 my cat, Ini Geo Foster. I was playing some Rust with my friends on my new PC, and then at 14:43 I heard loud knocking on my door. I told my friends, BRB and opened the door and my neighbour had informed me that my 2 year old cat had been hit by a car next to a local cafe. She told me he was at the vets, I slammed the door in her face and walked in to bathroom and cried on the floor for a hour thinking “You fucking retard! You knew you shouldn’t had sent your cat out. You might as well kill yourself.” I had walked to my PC and had disconnected myself from discord and had 30 DM from my mate. I tried to make myself happy by looking at memes, that did nothing. Then I heard Viva la Vida by Coldplay on the radio and had turned it off. And here came the big news, I had my phone number on my cats collar and then been told to come down to vet. And there was my cat dead on the vets table blood on his face bleeding out. He was dead alright, I stormed out the building and drove home thinking about him and what I could had done. Not talking to anyone thinking that’s a waste of the time.

80,"  I met a guy online about 5 or 6 years ago. I've lived with him almost 3 years now. Lately, I've been very concerned that I'm dating someone that is dangerous/crazy. I am not saying this to be hateful or mean. 
  He is very obsessed with video games. I first noticed something was off when he would get very angry if I even suggested doing something besides playing a video game. If I suggest we go out to dinner, or even play a board game instead, immediately he will raise his voice and start accusing me of trying to manipulate and control him. I am not exaggerating, he will play games from the moment he wakes up, until the moment he goes to bed at night, and I had better not get in the way. 
  Lately, his obsession has been Pokemon Go. He spends the entire day driving around hitting stops and such. He looks at his phone the whole time he's driving, and has to get every single Pokemon or will get very upset. (I swear this is not a joke). If we are on a dinner date, walking through the park, or even crossing the street, 100% of his attention is on his phone. And, again, if I say anything about it he will scream at me in public, calling me every name in the book and will even scream things about how my body looks etc. (I guess to embarrass me). Things that I would consider cruel. And yes, he will become violent. Everyone looks, most people laugh when they hear someone saying ""YOU NEVER LET ME PLAY POKEMON!"", I used to laugh about it but now I feel like something is wrong.  
  The newest trend in his obsession, is driving to the city an hour from here, to drive and play Pokemon, but while he's parked by a gym or whatever, he will drink bottles of liquor. He will repeat this about 20 times and then somehow make it home. He will literally get home and fall out of his car sometimes just from how drunk he is. He has wrecked at least 5 times now from this behavior. Luckily no injuries so far, but I am so afraid he is going to wreck and kill himself or someone else. 
  I really don't know how to help him. I am starting to feel like I am dating a psycho...

81,"This isn't a quick fix.  I can't remember how long it took to really work, but I would say keep going 1-2 months to see a real effect.  A little backstory: I have been battling depression since high school and still am.  I woke up every morning and thought about killing myself. Almost every single morning.  About 6 years ago I ""tried"" to commit suicide.  I think I was just looking for help.  And I got it.  At least in one way.  The psychiatrist or psychologist I saw recommend a technique that I kinda thought was bull, but tried it any way.  She told me that any time I had a suicidal thought, I should just tell myself no.  Stop thinking that.  Just stop. And force myself to think about something else.  She referenced something about cyclical thinking and that doing this would break the habit. It f*cking worked!  I don't think about suicide at all anymore.  I'm still battling depression in my own way, but I don't think about suicide at all anymore.  Seriously.  It changed my life.  ",06Jul2018,60,
82,"Is it reasonable for it to upset me if I have a friend that ignores me when she feels like it? Like, if we have plans or if we kind of made plans and I ask to verify or solidify the plans, or even just saying “hey! Are we still meeting up later?” if it stresses her out too much she’ll read it and not reply or purposely not open the message and just wait it out and leave me hanging. Some background, we both have had traumatic childhoods and she has some social anxiety. And I have OCD and PTSD. For some reason it gives me so much anxiety to just sit around and not know and it makes me pretty upset to be ignored. Whenever I try to confront them they always say that I’m being unreasonable and I should consider her mental health. I feel like I do though, I’m the person who is always there to help them do tough things such as call school about financial aid and I even urged them to seek therapy early this year. 

I even hooked her up with a job at my family’s restaurant when she needed one and she’s taken our generosity for granted, and lately has even considered quitting because she wants to be paid even more, only a couple weeks after being talked to for calling in sick every single week and sitting down while everyone is working. Again, I understand she gets stressed but where do I cross the line?? 

I guess I just don’t know when I should just drop her because I feel like it’s affecting MY mental health. I’m the type of person that outwardly, people don’t realize I have issues but I’m really suffering on the inside. I’m the friend that everyone runs to for help. I go out of my way for everyone I love, something my therapist thinks I do a way too much of. 

Am I unreasonable for being upset???? I just don’t know what to do. ",06Jul2018,2,

I'll have a gental surgeory in 4 days and i wont be able to do anything for 2 weeks . I can louse 5 kgs of muscle just in 10 days . I worked in London for 10 days and i was 70 kg when I went there and 65 when I came back . 70 kg is a huge acomplishment for me becouse I started from 54 kgs and when I got to 65 there was no growth for half a year and receantly I got to 70 kgs.

There was a girl(girl1) I realy liked and i was too scared to tell her. We were realy close friends tho we only met once and talked on Facebook after . I met her when I was 12 . I loved her for 4 years she had 2 boyfiends in that 4 years. We got into an argument about another girl that kind of just took advantage of me(girl2) or just played me. I was so angry and sas becouse of that girl . I was realy happy when we got together (I didn't met her personally but it ment a lot for me) that there is someone that cares for me and likes me for who am I
 But it was a slap in the face when I found out that that girl2 and her friend (who intreduced me to her) just did it as a joke , as a prank. I was so hearth broken and angry I msgd her parents about what she's done and how sad and disapointad am I. So girl1 got realy upset about this (girl1 and girl2 didn't know eatch other) becouse she tought I should not bring her parents into this. 
Since that point on we didn't realy talk, or if so it wasnt the same . I met her after that she told she was in the city where I lived at (it was around 10 o clock (PM) and i was in the shower) I got out , got dressed and literally run to where she was) I was waiting there for a bit and there she was walking right towards me I was so happy I finally got to see her again She was with a few friend and they were talking. She walked right beside me . She did not recignoze me. I waled up to her and we talked for a bit. She had to go so I got home.
And our interactions stayed the same. And when I went to 9th grade I started working out becouse I tought that must have been the reason why the girls didn't took me siriusly (there were other cases but they are pointless to explain) I started training 5 times a weak I started eating untill I got sick just to put on weight. It was like that for a year. I have gained 11kgm of muscle (I have a realy low boody fat around 8% so its almost all muscle ) and than I got to a point when I wasn't ashamed of my boody and i was kind of happy with it. At the summer I went to a party I got drunk , like realy drunk (1st and last Time I was drunk) and couldnt eat for the day after. I lost 5kgs so i was át the 60 mark . (Most of it was due to dehidration )I felt so low, defeated, all of that work gone becouse of a stupid might. 
Now I managed to get to the 70 mark (im 66 now becouse I just got home from london after working there 12 h a day) I have a girlfriend who realy loves me but I cant say the same nőt becouse of her becouse of all the shit I got from other girls I feel like im numb. I dont even care for my family that mutch (for some fiends I realy do tho) I dont think ill be able to love like I used to for a while its been 4 years (since I dont talk to gilr1) and there is still a big scar that it lett behind . Sometimes I check her profile how she is doing , if she is okay. Today I even started following her on Instagram. I saw her having fun with her fiends . While I was watching a series. Black mirror season 2 episode 4 . And it realy shocked me. Seeing exacly how I feel about her on a tv show. I feel like she just pushed the block button on me. I can talk to her but she just anserws She does not start a convesation. Now that I realyzed I wont be able to work out for 2 weeks I fear of depressiom becouse the look I can achive by working out is the bubble thats protecting me from all of this (I like working out but I like seeing the resoults even more) and a lot of other thing and I dont want to drown.

Hey I was wondering if I was to take steroids for the 2 weeks could I keep my gains? Its realy important for me . I know of the side effects, and the risks. But I just realy dont want to louse any of my gains in that 2 week period. I was thinking of testosteron. And when I could go to the gym I would go and train and get of the stuff in the next week like injecking smaller and smaller doses of it becouse as far as I know its not good just to cut it out.

84,"I am feeling so much now. The last time my dad made jokes about rape in front of me I sat him down a few days later and he apologised over and over and promised he wouldn't ever do it again. Less than two weeks later he's back making rape jokes. 
I was in an abusive relationship and I'm currently struggling massively with the effects of it. I suffer from PTSD. My dad is 100% aware of this. He sees the self harm etc, yet he still makes these jokes. 
The excuse is ""I slipped"" well yes but you repeated your joke 4 times so how do you slip that much. Surely after one time you stop when your daughter is right in front of you giving you the look of hell. Right? ""It wasn't aimed at you"" yes but you are making a joke out of rape. Which is what happened to me. I feel like he is completely invalidating what happened to me and my emotions and my mental health issues. My friends keep on insisting this is not how I should be thinking. I can't help but feel this way and I can't change it.

Do I have a right to feel this way. Please someone tell me I either need to be hit with reality or be given reassurance so I know that standing up to him is not the wrong thing to do. 
Part of me tells me I'm just too sensitive and part tells me I have every right to feel this way. 
How am I meant to heal if every time I look at him I see the man that raped me. Because that is what is happening. He is a constant reminder.  
I am 19. Moving out is not an option. 

Sorry for the rant. Thank you in advance.",06Jul2018,4,
