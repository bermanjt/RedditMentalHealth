0,"A constant haze has loomed over over me the last few years of my life and I feel that it has consumed me. I never truly feel happy anymore, only temporarily distracted from the thoughts in my head. I think that I am not a real person but rather just someone dragging their feet through a meaningless existence. I remember so fondly the days where I could just exist and be happy about it, but now I’m constantly looking at my life under a microscope and feeling as though I’ve done nothing. My eyes never feel fully open and I’m constantly just waiting for the next thing to present itself with no real direction in my life. I don’t have the energy to put myself out there and I don’t see myself changing anytime soon",16Oct2018,1

2,"I hadn't even been at work for 30 minutes yet and I ended up in the bathroom unable to breathe and just...lost. I've been off of any type of medication for close to 2 years now and I had been doing so well. I went through a divorce and had some inpatient treatment, but haven't had any major issues in a very long time. I'd had trouble sleeping last night and came into work really anxious. Some things snowballed after I clocked in, and it just overwhelmed me. I feel ashamed and embarrassed. My coworker came into the bathroom after I didn't come back out for awhile and tried to help me as best as she could, but it just had to run its course. I'm worried they'll come back more frequently now afternoon that terrifies me.

3,"I've known for most of my life that I struggle due to childhood abuse (physical/emotional, not sexual). I've gone through depression, out of which I lifted myself temporarily but am now settling back into due to anhedonia.

Recently I discovered I also experience dissociation, probably due to the CPTSD caused by the abuse which went on for about 20 years.

Add to that I'm completely anxious-avoidant, again due to the abuse, and what I once thought was a strong committment to ""never be fucking fooled by anyone again"", which simply put means I cannot fucking trust anyone.

Including a therapist.

Okay. Now that I'm in a place to start working on this again (because it's not possible when I feel raw from having to admit all of this in the first place), and therapy is simply not an option--if I have to spend even a month trying to explain all of this to anyone, I will scream, and quit. I do not wish to take the chance of being bullshitted **again**.

I can explain it all to myself because I know *myself*.

If you were me. Which side of the whole thing would you tackle first?

Has anyone seen any group sessions for people who are just hopelessly fucked? I think I can deal with just being around other people and talking about everything in bits and pieces. But if it's me in a room with a therapist, I will get confrontational, it will not be helpful because I just cannot trust *at all*.

I'm doing some suggested reading on the side but I'm also very isolated. I need a way out.",16Oct2018,1
4,"So I’ve been having a hard time these last couple of months, and trust me I’m no expert in the field so I came here. I have these times where I get really paranoid like “something is literally going to kill me if I go in this room alone” or “if I turn off the lights”. Also any foreign noise can trigger this, and it seems so silly when I look back on it. Mind you these bouts are usually short lived, and only occur when I’m relatively alone. I’ve seen movement in the corner of my eye where there should be nothing, and this can also trigger it. Another thing I’ve experienced that has just developed recently, is the feeling of detachment. It feels like I’m not in MY body but a foreign shell of that makes sense, and my vision can slightly blur during this. I’ve been feeling less drive recently too, just not wanting to go to work, or go out. I’ve looked into psychosis? That seems very extreme though and not like what I’m experiencing.

9,"I really should make a throwaway for this post but I don’t care right now. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I keep driving people away? I’m (24M) married to a wonderful wife (24F) and have been with her for 7 years, married for 3. We love each other to the end of the earth, and both foresee that never changing.

We moved across country for my work shortly after getting married, and have always been introverts. Finding new friends wasn’t our top priority. Lately we both started feeling too shut in and wanted to branch out and meet friends. The wife got a job at a local grocery store and is already talking to a few new acquaintances. And I have started to open up to people at work. I just transferred and it’s a whole new set of people, so I felt it was a good opportunity to make new first impressions.

I’m good with first impressions, but when I find someone that expresses interest in reciprocating a friendship, I open up too much. I’ve had three friends in a row start off great. Chatting all the time. Both sides instigating conversations. Stuff that makes me feel less lonely. But then I say too much.

I’m not going to say my life is horrible and I’ve been through the worst events, but it’s not been easy. There was a custody battle when I was 6, which made mom disappear until I was 12. My loving stepmother whom I regarded as my emotional mother, died suddenly when I was 16. My aunt and cousin were murdered when I was 18. I joined the military when I was 19. My paternal grandfather passed away while I was still in training. Last year my very close work associate passed away extremely suddenly after work one day from a heart attack. The following day my wife’s childhood dog died in a car accident, and I couldn’t be there for her. Then the next week my maternal grandfather died. That was about a year ago.

I guess I come with emotional weight? I’m not sure how else to put it, and I’m not sure what to do. Maybe I’m just writing all this to put it out there. I don’t know. I just don’t know what to do.

Sorry if there’s any typos. I don’t feel like going back and proofreading this.",16Oct2018,1

I hate seeing people dislike me more and more and that is what i saw today. First day they were always quite ecstatic to see me bht for the last two weeks of school they just dont like me respond blankly.

They just, act different and i know its because i was obnoxious in class. I mean big surprise, i hate myself and so they would probably have eventually hated me anyway. 

Honestly i feel like im meaningless? I mean as a student, i really havent accomplished anything. I have no close friends which is why i ahve to go on here. I have no one who texts or talks to me after school beyond hw chat groups. I can tell people i hate myself, i want to kill myself, but i know for a fact kids at my school would either take it as the common joke or find me annoying.

I tried for a month. I really did try to just not show the negative parts of me! Bottle it up until home. It didnt work.

12,"Hi,
I am 30F from the US and I think about dying in one way or another all the time and cannot turn it off. Either I imagine myself dying in an accident (least common), getting tortured and/or murdered, or killing myself (most common). This will come up several times a day, really any time I am idle and thinking. I could be feeling super happy and these thoughts are still right there alongside the happy thoughts.

Sometimes I watch it happening in my head like a movie. Sometimes it is just my thoughts with no pictures. Sometimes I will say aloud to myself ""kill yourself"" just out of the blue, not even thinking about anything which is probably the most upsetting of all the ways these thoughts come to me since what if someone hears me? I can't just say ""oh sorry I was just talking to myself!""

I almost never think of any harm coming to anyone else, only if they are no shows/very late to something I will start worrying that they were hurt or got in an accident.

Even if it is a constant thought I have never tried to kill myself and I don't really consider myself an immediate danger to myself. Maybe more of an abstract danger. I don't think this is normal thinking?

I am going to see a psychiatrist soon when I find one with my insurance (currently emailing for some leads), and I see a therapist every other week. I am not taking any medications right now but I have tried four different ones in the past couple years for depression/anxiety (did not notice a difference) and hope to eventually find one that works for me.

Sometimes I get a questionnaire or they ask if I have had any suicidal thoughts recently but I always say no. But I think I should be saying yes since I think about it almost all the time. Should I say yes when asked, or bring it up myself? What could happen if I say I have these thoughts? What should I expect to happen? What kind of help can I get? Do you have any experience with this?

Thank you for reading!

13,"Back when I was about 15 years old I went through an extremely bad bout of depression. During that period I started to get intense urges of just wanting to hurt people. I wanted nothing more than to assault one of my closest friends and just beat her until she was a bloody mess. I would think every day about shooting up my school. I would dream of raping and beating small defenseless women. And this would be constant every day. I would obsess over various girls in my school and dream about just beating them to death. I even went through a period when i stalked a 13 year old girl over the internet and would coax her into sending pictures of herself (nothing illegal although morally questionable). Now i'm 19 and it's only gotten worse. Almost every time I see a girl all I can think about is raping and killing her. And I've gone back to stalking that same girl (although shes 16-17 now) and slowly losing my mind over it.

I'm not a bad person. I always do my best to be nice to everybody. I've done charity, I hold doors for people, I'm always friendly, and I don't even have any criminal record. I've never hurt anybody before and I don't know why there's this evil inside of me that feels the need to get out. I'm worried that I eventually won't be able to control it anymore and I'll do something awful. I'm also worried about going to therapy because I don't want to be sent to the police or put away to a mental institution because then I could lose my job.

19,"I noticed this earlier in the year (back in the spring) when a family member passed away, I just felt very.... empty. I was expecting to obviously feel upset and what not but I just felt kind of numb and empty.

&amp;#x200B;

During the summer I didn't really have that feeling anymore. Maybe it's because I was back home and working, but anyways, fast forward to September (back in college, away from home), and that feeling of emptiness/emotionlessness has really hit me hard. I noticed it on the first few days of classes - usually if I don't know anyone in the class I'll introduce myself to whoever I'm sitting beside just so I at least know a person in the class. For whatever reason, I just didn't do it this year. At the time I just told myself that I was tired or whatever, but now that I look back on it, I just kind of.... didn't care? It's tough to describe. I think the best way I could sum up my feelings this last month or so would be to say that a lot of the time I feel empty, less emotional (I don't really feel emotions as strongly as I think I should be), and at times I feel like I just don't care about anything. It's worth mentioning that these feelings come and go, but for the most part they're present. I've also noticed that I feel mentally sluggish when I need to be alert, like when I'm in class or studying. I've found it pretty difficult to pay attention in a lot of my classes (I told myself earlier that I was just tired but I don't think that's the case), and when I'm studying I find myself zoning out/drifting off a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking some stuff up online and was wondering if I fit the bill for apathy. It might also be worth mentioning that I get pretty stressed out by school and (sometimes) just being away from home in general. Also read that smoking weed (which I do) might play a role?

31,"Hello.
I hope everyone is having a good day so far.
I tried to post this in LoseIt and no one seemed to comment on it...I hope I get some people big into fitness to give feedback.
I'm gonna try my best to keep this post short since I tend to overexplain and ramble..
So I have been officially powerlifting for 7months now.
I got diagnosed with bipolar 2 right after I officially started prepping and now I am finally accepting it and still learning about. Even before the diagnosis though, it was still a problem.
Anyway, this diagnosis came in the middle of a bunch of new/not so good things happening with my life, and when I got over the depressive symptoms for that small part of this year...it was like some other things happen that would make me sad-not depressed that I am still going through.
I didn't wanna go to the gym even though I knew it would make me feel better, and I was still making progress and I knew that I wanted to see myself lift more. And when I did go, It felt like SO much work! Getting out of bed seemed like so much work. But for the short sessions I did lift, I would think that...this is not the heaviest weight i had to carry lately. And given i would not go regularly, I beat myself up, compared myself to my coaches other clients like...they wouldnt miss their workouts.
I just lately had to write down why I wanted to workout regularly and what my goals were in life and in lifting which has helped, along with remind myself not to compare myself to others. 
ALSO when in depressive episodes I tend to overeat, and it seems like I lose touch with hunger signals easily. I follow an intuitive eating approach.
Anyway, I would really like pointers in training or competing with mental illness, as well as caring for nutrition when life hits you, when you are going through a depressive episode and your energy is depleted and everything feels like a huge step. 
I don't HAVE to do keep lifting, but I want to and this is my my way of moving forward so my mental illness can suck it. It helps everything else in my life feel lighter, so I feel pretty helpless when i've lost motivation for it.

33,"Hi. I have kind of a weird problem.

Sometimes when I am just casually going through my day, my face splits into this huge and kind of creepy grin. It can come out of nowhere when I’m doing literally just about anything, like taking out the trash, or listening to someone (whether they’re talking about something serious or not), or walking down the street. Sometimes it is accompanied by really funny thoughts and I have to keep myself from bursting out laughing at them, but most of the time it’s just my lips curling back and showing my teeth, making this expression that really does look like a smile. I usually end up having to force it into kind of an equally strange grimace or just straight up awkwardly find a way to hide my face, because I think it weirds people out. It has gotten to the point where people actually have made comments, saying things like “you have a huge smile on your face right now” or asked “why are you smiling?”

It’s bizarre because I feel like I have barely any control over it and have an extremely hard time stopping myself from doing it. It is especially uncomfortable when it happens during a serious moment. It feels like even when I know what’s going on around me and like I should be serious, my brain is on this completely different emotional wavelength and I become detached, no matter how much I want to stay present.

One theory I have is that maybe it’s a weird adaptation my brain developed. Maybe whenever I get too sad or stressed or something in my environment subconsciously triggers a memory, my brain tries to be a clown and cheer me up by being as funny as it possibly can and completely distracting me from my surroundings..... but I don’t know. Maybe that’s not it. I have no idea.

34,"I’m 16. Last year my mom had a psychotic breakdown, and ended up in the hospital for about 3 weeks. She is bipolar but I had never seen a mood swing like that before. She first told me she thought my father was “fucking with her” like telling his friends to turn the power in the house off and move shit around. My dad did not do any of this at all, he simply wanted what was best for her throughout heir whole marriage. As the days went on my mom would tell me completely unrealistic stuff like she thought the church was after her and there were parties at our house and people were stealing her stuff. The worst of those days was when I was woken up by her digging through my trashcan and bedstand drawer looking for painkillers that she didn’t want me to abuse. I have never popped a pill or stolen anything from my parents. She also took my phone in that morning and denied digging thru my trash when I asked her about it. She just smiled at me and said no. I left to stay at my boys house and she left for the hospital for 3 weeks after I told my dad what had happened (he had left the night before for the cape bc she screamed at him to leave). When my mom came back she was still acting strange but almost normal. I felt pretty fucked up about the shit that went on during those weeks cause I’d never know if the woman who I was talking to was her mental illness or my mom. Sixth months later my mom has another breakdown. She tells me my dad and my sister that she loves us no matter what happens and that she was going on a run. She didn’t come back for 5 hours so we called the police and they came to our house. The police found her sleeping in the garage on the floor. She was very confused and anxious and told the police she was hiding her medication from the party that was going on in my house (there was no party, it was me my sister, brother, and dad) my mom told the police that she wanted to go to her room and not see any of us or our dad. She went up to her room but was screaming at my dad on the way there(idk what she was saying I was in the basement watching TV). Later that night while I was playing video games, I heard something shatter upstairs and lots of yelling. My mom was taking the beer bottles out of the fridge and smashing them. She told my dad that she fucked another guy, a family friend who had stayed at our summer house with us many times. My dad started yelling for her to stop breaking shit so me and my brother came to restrain her. She screamed in my face “I fucking hate you” I went off on her and screamed that she was selfish and always made things about her. I know she’s sick but I was just so angry. Anyways I left to go to my boys house and the police came after I left. They almost tased my brother bc he didn’t like the way they were treating my mom. She went to the hospital again for 2 weeks and came back distant and non apologetic. I barely talked to her for around 3 weeks. Months later now, she always wants to come in my room and talk to me and all this shit and I wish both of my parents would just leave me alone. I’m shit scared that I’m gonna end up like her, she and her father both have mental illnesses w those psychotic breakdowns. I can’t trust anyone anymore I think my best friend is telling everyone including the girl I really like to act nice to me and get involved w me by texting me and wanting to hang out because he thinks I’m going to kill myself or something. Does that sound realistic to u or is it genuine interest? And I can’t stop smoking weed everynight, I just bought a dab pen and I can’t stop hitting it. My friend just texted me saying “I know you are always joking about everything but are you actually alright?” I broke down in tears but I texted back saying I’m good. I’m sorry for saying so much but I don’t have anybody I really really trust to give me advice so it’d be better if I ask strangers.",16Oct2018,1

Now, I work as a paralegal (immigration law) and i feel so overwhlemed and stressed. I feel physically ill multiple times a week. I feel deeply inadequate and stupid, and I'm certain my coworkers agree of this assessment because I freak out and ask stupid questions all the time. I constantly feel out of control, helpless, and panicky..like I don't know what I'm doing. It doesnt help that i hold people's lives in my hands... 

And my brain! Never sharp, always foggy. I feel so stupid. I cant think clearly because I'm always panicking and i doubt literally everything I do. My mind moves too fast. It becomes confusing. I feel trapped. I have suicidal ideation, although I would never act on it.

At the same time, I can never find people with stories like mine. Depression and anxiety never manifest in others the way it does for me... So i feel isolated even more.

And my clients - how can I possibly complain when my clients' stories are full of abuse and murder and cruelty? And my life has been relatively sheltered? I know I shouldn't compare...but sometimes I can't sleep because i worry about them. They have so much more at stake..

I guess I'm super overwhelmed, and i feel so, so alone. I can't describe the despair I feel on a daily basis... I feel imprisoned.

I used to see a therapist, but she moved away. I miss her immensely, as if I am grieving in a way, but I havent managed to find another therapist. 

I'm just really sick, I think, and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm in hell.

I was able to live in my childhood house until I finished HS and since I have my father pushed for the sale of the house a month after my graduation. It sold at the end of August and I have about 3 weeks until we move out. I’m currently home now trying to pack, not going well, and trying to say goodbye. I’m having a lot of angry thoughts in my head directed at my dad and the people moving in. 

Tried to talk to my therapist and didn’t help. Does anyone have any tips or anything that will help get over this rough time in my life? I’ve been dreading this since I was 10.

38,"  

Last Wednesday was Mental Health Awareness Day. Frankly, for the first 18 years of my life I could care less about what this day meant. However, this year was a different story, and I wanted to take some time to reflect about my experiences and maybe even help someone. A friend of mine recently wrote an article about his struggles with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I thought to myself “This kid has a set of balls.” Mental illnesses suck, there’s no getting around it. It also takes a lot to open up to others about them, and in the end I gained a ton of respect for my friend for doing so.

So here goes…

Before I entered my freshman year of college, I thought that the world was a unicorn shitting out rainbows. This quickly changed when the stress of college, a number of failed relationships, and legal troubles (something I’m not ever open or proud of) burst into my life.

Addiction, hopelessness, anxiety and depression quickly flooded my brain like a tsunami. Not going to lie, it can make life fucking hard. Plain and simple. I never pictured myself as a person that had behind the scenes struggles and quickly thought…why me? What have I become? And the never-ending cycle of these mental illnesses continued to churn and worsen, quickly replaced by guilt. I grew up in such a good family, go to a good school, and have a concrete foundation…what could have gone wrong, and why am I thinking these thoughts?

Do I care what people think of me? Unfortunately, yes. Do I want attention or for people to feel sorry for me? Fuck no. In spite of everything that went on, being a driven person with a solid work ethic is the only thing that kept myself and my friendships sane. If all else fails, working towards your goals along with helping others is the best way (in my opinion) to combat these illnesses. It can be hard. Really damn hard. At times, it’s still tough to get out of bed in the morning without feeling unworthy and empty inside. Focusing on personal growth and taking small steps to improve one’s self can go a long way to a healthier brain and lifestyle.

**IN THE END** I didn’t choose to have anxiety or depression, and neither do the large population of the world that also suffers from them. But if I’ve learned one thing, it’s to take responsibility for the circumstances life has to offer. I believe a famous super hero once said: “With great power comes great responsibility”, which may be true, but the real way to live life is “**With great responsibility, comes great power.”** With life has actions, and with these actions comes consequences. I still suffer from anxiety and depression. It’s currently 2:44 A.M. and I’m still awake anxiously thinking about what people are going to think of me after posting this. Mental Illnesses are extremely tough to combat, but when we are able to own up to our circumstances and say “Yeah, my life has setbacks. But who fucking cares. Today, I’m going to try to be the best \_\_\_\_ I can be, and no one is going to stop me” is the day we can take one step closer to a more positive and carefree life.

Hopefully people that have had similar experiences as myself can find this helpful! ",16Oct2018,1
39,"I wish the title was overly dramatic, but it's not. The only reason I'm alive is my old dog who dies a year ago and ever since I've been going downhill. I can't go to school so I'm now home schooled and can't bring myself to do any work. I just can't do anything I can't go outside I can't go anywhere. The only thing I can do is be with my girlfriend she's just been there for me for 2 years and she helps me a lot. I'm 16 so I know it's probably not permanent and I'm okay with that. My dog was seriously the only reason I'm still alive. This is all over the place I'm just loss, I can't bring myself to do anything and it's tearing my parents apart. Nothing has helped and all my therapists I've seen don't know what to do. It just gets worse and worse and since I can't do school work I'm not going to get anywhere in life, I want to be successful and I know this isn't how to, but I can't make myself. My mind is so far gone and all I can do is be on my computer and just wait for myself to snap. I've considered so many things such as carrying out a shooting or just killing myself. I don't want to do either of those things, but they're constantly on my mind. I don't know what's wrong with me, no one does.

It was a very hat day and i was not used to it but as stupid as it sound i didnt drink anything so when i drove home from school with my bike after i dropped of the train. But as so as i drove some meters my mouth just went that dry that licking my tongue across the inside of my mouth just felt like being stabbed with a knife thousands of times in a second. I guess i the ride home took about 15 minutes but i dont exactly know cause the longer it took i went more and more dire for some thing to drink i just went fucking insane i knew i needed something do drink or my mind would break entirely. After 15 minutes i got home went inside and took some juice out of the refrigerator and it was a fucking relief as i chugged down the whole 1 liter bottle in one sip but then my dad went down the stair ways to prepare something to eat for me and that was the point where i completely lost it. Every thing felt like is was moving lightning fast and like i could dodge a bullet cause i would be faster than it atleast thats what i thought. I felt electrified and i couldn bear it my dad tryid his best to help me but he couldn't stand the presure of his son breaking down so he just colapsed for a few seconds i was worried that he had an heart attack so i called an Ambulance. But he quickly went back on his feet talked to the nice man on the other side and explained everything to him. My dad send me to bed where i was just laying down trying to calm down which i eventually managed. But my mind was still completely fucked I was just thinking about random words which made no sense but in my mind i understood them. I had to think alot with these thoughts till i had my first clear thought. I was fucking worried that i would never get back to my old self and always be fucking insane i thought my parents would send my to a clossed health center for the rest of my life but after 16 hours of sleep i went back to normal i fell the after effects but it's nothing to server i'll just get some help from a therapist to cope with it.

In the end i want everyone to know that everything is mostly fine now. And everyone who experienced something similar to what i did i hope you fell better now and might want to tell me what you went through. And to everyone else experiencing mental health issues i hope that you got someone to help you and that you are feeling better soon, im a person that you can turn to ill try my best to be a good listener and to help you.",16Oct2018,1

We have now had over 951 people take part in our research - that's over £951 donated to mental health charities! A lot of our responses have come from Reddit so thank you!

In case this is the first time you're reading this post... We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment.

We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

The questionnaires will only take about 5-10 minutes to complete online. For your participation, we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink).

42,"I’m finally making the leap to go to therapy.. I had a rather tough childhood with a ton of emotional abuse, nothing physical though. I don’t want to give a ton of details but one of the things I had to go through was living with an older half-sibling (like, a 20 year age-gap) who was a drug addict and alcoholic. In order to help him quit those tendencies, my mom would do things like lock the house doors so that we would need a key to go outside (which I had a key, he didn’t). Point is, I had to see a lot of crap related to drug addiction because he lived with us and my mother never understood that his addiction affected me and my sister. Now I’m all sorts of messed up due to this and a lot of other stuff from my childhood but I love my mom and don’t want to get her in any type of legal trouble. I know that if I were underage and went to a therapist with these problems, they would be required to share them with child services.

I just have bonding with my sister and my ex- friends with benefit. I have zero bonding with my parents. I feel sick when my parents are around me. They are abusive and have always been neglectful towards my emotional needs. I don't feel like taking any efforts in maintaining friendships or starting any relationship.

56,"Narcissists never stop being responsible for and should be held accountable for any abuse or harm we cause and acknowledge that. We also only really have a place in society if we are struggling everyday against it. That being said there are some unfair things that get said about Narcissists.

There is a stigma that we are 100% unempathetic, can never be healed or improve and therapy will only make it worse because it will make the Narcissist more cunning.

 In some cases this is true. There is a good way to know the difference. Why did they start therapy? Will they admit it to themselves and others? If a narcissist has been court ordered to see a therapist, the odds are they just feel threatened and feel like they shouldn't be there. They will lie a lot of the time because they can't face themselves and accept that there narcissistic. If however the narcissist is aware enough to seek therapy own and sincerely wants to be a better person healing is possible. 

You can think about it almost like addiction. I will always be a narcissist but we can be recovering narcissists and keep our symptoms at bay for long periods of time. We also will likely have relapses. I have a system now. I tell everyone that I'm a Narcissist as soon as I know them. Then I ask them if they'll do me a favor and everytime they feel like I'm being Narcissistic (I can't always tell), to tell me. As soon as they say that word, I stop talking and ALWAYS trust them over me. I then apologise and  have started practicing active listening and striving to make the empathetic choice at every turn. I try to give more than I take and be respectful of others' boundaries. A healthy and decent self is attainable for everyone if they work towards it.

A lot of us are really sincere about our healing. Al ot of us want to be better. A lot of us want what's best for other people as well as ourselves.

63,"I don't get it. I really don't. I like school. I mean it when I say that. I like my teachers, and while my classmates may be assholes sometimes, well, newsflash, so am I. I have nice grades, I participate in class. I'm breaking away from a toxic friendship with the help of my teachers and getting new friends. I'm going to a music school, something I've always wanted. Hell, today I'm gonna meet my teacher.


Everything's fine, great actually, so I don't understand why I just start crying out of nowhere once a small thing goes wrong, or why sometimes I feel so nervous all of a sudden, or so angry. Whenever I have a day where I'm alone before getting to school, I just feel overwhelmed, and start crying when I fail to do something.


I get this weird emotional feedback loop, and I get angry at myself, because I should be able to do what everyone else does, I should be able to go to school like a normal person, I should be able to do this fucking shit, but I can't. And I just break down.


I've thought about it for a while now, and I think it might have something to do with the following.


* My older sister, her boyfriend and her daughter are crashing at our place for a month. They're moving because they want to quit drugs and get their life together and they need a place to stay in the meantime. I don't get as much ""me time"" as I'd like to, and the situation is stressing me out a bit.


* I technically don't have friends at school, just friendly acquaintances. I don't feel lonely, but sometimes I really wish I had someone there for me, who I could laugh with to make the world seem less shit.
I don't really pay attention to trends, and my tastes are usually obscure, so I don't bond  easily with other people.

I also have problems speaking my country's language, and I stutter a bit and use weird words because I think in English. This has caused me some issues, mainly me completely butchering grammar from time to time. I have trouble properly expressing ideas, which causes misunderstandings.

I'm also a bit childish for my age, and I have no brain-mouth filter.


* My middle sister is also into drugs. While my older sister has quit the hard stuff, middle sis is slowly gravitating away from weed and into hard stuff like cocaine. She's also been selling drugs. Annnnd she's in some shit with a gipsy or something. And she only comes home every full moon. Everyone's worried about her. Dad wants to kick her out, but if we did that, something terrible would happen. Stressful for everyone.


* My father is a truck driver. He's only home three days a month. I miss him a lot. We're usually on the same boat about a lot of stuff and... I just wish he was here for me, damnit. He might seem like a bad guy, but he means well, and I love him, and I treat him badly and I don't know why, but I love him, I really do.


* My aunt has died. Her death didn't affect me very much, we were never very close in the first place and I made peace with the fact that she was going to die, but my mom still isn't quite over it. I feel helpless because I can't help her.


I said everything's fine in the beggining but after typing all that out... well.
Most of these are things I can't change, anyway, and it's my attitude and how I deal with them that matter. I can't make the storm go away, but I sure can walk up to it and tell it to go fuck itself.

I think what's causing this is repressed emotions or something. I don't know.

I need advice, because the people I've reached out to won't let me speak and just shut me down. And I can't keep missing school. It's test season already. I need to get hold of this fast.


Thanks for reading, hypothetical reader.

69,"Hello! 
So
I’m from the UK and I’ve been having a really mixed bag of problems mentally for years. I was diagnosed with depression at 15 and put on citalopram, over the years I was changed to fluoxetine and at 28 I was then moved onto sertraline. 

Everytime I visit my GP with changes/growing concerns about my health they seem to change/up the dose &amp; I don’t feel I’m being taken seriously. At the minute I’m on 150mg of Sertraline - I was told I was depressed, then I have a anxiety disorder. I wonder if anyone can shed some light and maybe give me some ideas of areas to read up.

I would consider my “normal” self to be quite reclusive, anti social, don’t keep friends or make plans ect. Always have a calm head and always willing to help others. 

Since I have been on sertraline I’ve felt like two completely different people, the highs are really high like unbelievable. I feel on top of the world, like I can do anything, don’t need to sleep or rest I just want to keep busy. Stay up until 4 am get up for work at 7 and be fine. People at work have said to me ‘what ever your on I want’ and I’ve never taken that seriously just sort of off the cuff.  My sex drive also goes off the rails, lusting and being overly pervy/desperate but a lot of the time being unable to finish. Can’t stick to tasks at work, distracted super easy, forget what I was doing. 

Other times I feel like I’ve hit a new low, no motivation, can’t get enough sleep, not enjoying anything what so ever. Everything feels hopeless &amp; I become really pessimistic, pushing away everyone around me starting fights for drama no interest in work &amp; people have said to me ‘your mood completely affects the people around you, if your in a bad mood/quiet it feels like there’s a storm cloud around us’.

I told my GP last week and they upped my medication again and said give it a month to kick in and come back. Also it is worth noting that I have always answered the question of self harm/suicide as a resounding no and was told if I said yes I would get help sooner. 

The best way it can describe it is like a pendulum- I can wake up feel on top of the world and swing so hard and so fast either way at any point. 

Sorry for rambling on so much, I just feel so lost right now and can’t contain my own thoughts, feels like I’m going to have to do something stupid to be taken seriously.  I just want to be in my grey area in the middle, content &amp; invisible. ",16Oct2018,1

71,"What qualifies as having suicidal thoughts? Is just having the thought pop into your head when you’re depressed and then dismissing it considered to be dangerous level of suicidal thought. Or does there have to be some level of considering it as a possible option for your problems before it becomes something to be concerned about. 

I have struggled with low moments off and on for years. I have never looked for professional help so I have never been diagnosed with anything and have never been put on any treatments or medication of any kind. But I’m in a particular low spot at the moment and these thoughts have popped back in my head. I have never seriously considered acting on them and they don’t tend to linger. But the fact remains that when every something goes wrong in life, they pop up. 

I’m not scared by them really, I just don’t know how normal this is, if it’s a sign of depression, or if I need to start talking to someone because it’s a very serious sign of trouble. No one talks about the type of mental health issues. It’s so taboo.

I suffer from anxiety-related intrusive thoughts (undiagnosed OCD) and (undiagnosed) mild depression with poor motivation, energy, etc.

My friends have expressed suicidal ideation in the past, and once I panicked that my friend killed himself because his message was:

&gt; I feel really depressed and need someone to talk to...

Then I couldn’t find him not get ahold of him.

I’ve noticed other off-the-wall comments from *another* depressed friend who says abused shit like:

&gt; Well, X didn’t have the balls to kill himself...

I said:

&gt; Dude are you kidding me? That’s a poor taste in humor at best. That’s not funny...

I feel really lonely and outcasted just because I know /everyone/ in university has friends and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s so embarrassing having to make up things or just say I don’t remember what I did on the weekends because I only really spend it with my roommate.

76,"Ever since I arrived, my mental health has been slowly detiorating.

I've been spending longer nights and getting shorter sleep because I feel afraid (not intensely, but it is there) when I wake up that I'll lose my memories. I drive myself to exhaustion before I go to sleep, which doesn't help anything.

Out of my one and only friend group here, I already know 3/4 of them have some type of mental issue going on. However, all of them have them under some degree of control. One has been regularly seeing a therapist, the other taking antidepressants, and the last one simply moving on.

The worst part is that I can't really say anything about my current mental stability. I've tried to seem as if I'm completely fine. It's something I've learned to hide living in my house with the constant ""suck it up"" treatment.

A week ago, a behavior I haven't seen since middle school and early high school cropped up again. I had an anxiety attack the day before and I was overthinking the reason why one of us were now always wearing jackets. I ended up severely scratching myself to the point of bleeding and/or leavong a mark lasting the next day. It was either that or punching a nearby structure.

It's been a downwards spiral. I realize that my friends got it down much more to pat, but I'm slowly getting worse and worse.

I want to go to the school counseling services, but a real thing needs an appointment and also someone with an actual mental illness (screened online ahead of time). The walk-ins are group things as to where I want it to be private.

Everything I tried to build up in senior year and summer was destroyed by now conflicting issues. The last post I made and how that friend now a state away has now opened how lonely he feels (breaking down during a call). And now, I'm just trudging on, being overly protective of my friends while being self-destructive to myself.

79,"I am feeling so anxious right now that my hubby begged me to take one of my Clonidine to calm my ass down. I am stressing over going to this therapy appointment tomorrow. I know what they will say. My hubby knows about the MDD, GAD, history of Alcoholism, history of Self-Harm, history of Anorexia Nervosa...he doesn't know anything about my recent...""hobby"", though I had tried to tell him in the car just a little bit ago. I couldn't do it, but now he knows there is definitely something up with me...something is bothering me. He was very understanding, listened to me, and showed a lot of caring. I am in tears thinking about this because this is the man I married. He helped to bring my anxiety down a LOT, and probably the medicine is kicking in too now. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make it worse, I had a full-on panic attack right before he had gotten home because our electric got shut off, and I had to scramble to get it back on (within minutes of making the payment). I didn't know what to do at first. I have no cell service (that is turned off too), and the house phones don't work without power, so I had to use the neighbor's phone to call the electric company. Humiliating, but at least we get along as neighbors and she is a really really nice lady. I mean I had been crying, screaming fuck over and over, I punched 2 walls (didn't hurt anything but my knuckles), crying, hyperventilating--the whole shebang. It was scary. That was the 3rd one in so many days. I told my hubby I think my mental health is going to shit again. He was very comforting and made me feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel much calmer now. The medication is working. I had lost my urges (you know what I am talking about my fellow redditors) because I was stressed, which isn't unusual to happen. The disorder got pushed out of the way for a minute while my mind tried to figure out something that was more pressing right then. I feel them full-force again.   


Jesus, this is real isn't it? If I were faking this...then they wouldn't have come back...  


Would they?  


I can feel it in my heart that the urges...the DISORDER...are there. I am scared now. Starting to panic a little bit again, but I will be OK. The medicine is helping keep the panic to a minimum.  


Now for a good thing that happened today:  


My hubby asked me to go to the supermarket (YES, the same one I go to all the time when I am walking) with him to get me out of the house for a bit, so we went and got our stuff and went to the self-checkout. You wouldn't believe what I saw.  


FOUR CITY FIREFIGHTERS checking out their own foods!!!!  


I have to admit, I went full ""fangirl"" and my hubby just rolled his eyes (sarcastically) at me lol. He knows how much I LOVE firefighters. He knows how much I LOVE going to fires. How he is not putting 2 and 2 together is anyone's guess. Anyhow, I totally was fascinated by these 4 guys, one of who had the firefighter pants and suspender thing on. They had their radios (I have a scanner too...anyone surprised by that?) and gear. OMG I was totally fangirl-ing all over the place lol.  


Needless to say, that made my day. I was still anxious as hell but it got my mind off it for a bit. Then I saw their firetruck parked outside and it thrilled me to no end. I kinda felt a twang of guilt too, knowing that yesterday, I had almost torched 2 buildings without even thinking about it. Thankfully, my common sense kicked in and took over and I was able to walk away those two times. Nobody said this was easy.   


Still wrapping my head around the fact that the urges did come back stronger than ever just after I saw the firefighters...so I can't deny anymore. :(  


This is long enough dammit. I gotta learn to shut up. Heh.   


Thanks for reading. I wrote more poetry today, but I think I will keep it to myself, as nobody wants to hear my rambling thoughts again. Cheers my fellow mentalhealth redditors.

Her mother wont allow her to have therapy (plus the nearest therapist is ages away from where she lives and is expensive). Im just wondering what this could be?

After I started medication, my brain felt like it had gone dead. I couldn’t critically think or speak without a pause every second to think of the words I needed to express myself. I began to defy logic and felt myself becoming stupider every single day. Paying attention in community college classes is hard and I can’t comprehend anything that the professor is saying so I have to either go over it 2 thousand times at home or just guess.

I don’t know how to fix my situation at all, my therapist’s suggestions don’t seem to work because my brain keeps resorting to ending myself as the only solution to all this.

Like many, I have suffered many years of extreme depression and anxiety. I've had more drugs and alcohol fueled nights than you've had hot dinners. Prior to my falling into despair at 16 (now 27), I was a straight A student, religious, extremely kind and loving. I became deeply nihilistic, cynical and bitter between 16 and 24, after which I turned my life around for the most part. I took ownership of my cold and isolating behaviour towards my family who I now enjoy a much cheerier relationship with. I have sat down with people and apologized for mean, negative things I did and said. All but one relationship has been repaired, although I was a victim in that case (more on that later).  


Despite the rosiness of my childhood, I always had deep problems with the fact that I was a boy in a culture with a masculine bent. I have always been much smaller and weaker than everyone else, and on countless occasions, I was overpowered, mistreated, tackled, pinned down, chased, just made to feel small, smaller, and small again. There were many humiliations, jeers with implications of inferiority and weakness, my journal was read by a particularly nasty individual who used to be a friend. He told everyone its contents to embarrass me as best he could, and sent me horrible messages about how weak I am for my mental health struggles. I was extremely dysfunctional for years and suicide has always lurked in the background for me.  


I went from aspirations of becoming an educator like my dad to rejecting everything. I still struggle with confidence issues but it has gotten better. Having overcome my drug and alcohol problems, I moved to Canada 4 years ago and started at the bottom working crap jobs, ones I could tolerate because they minimised my having to deal with aggressive people to whom I may or may not be able to stand up against and fight depending on that day's mental status. After 2 years, I decided to go back to school and study and am now chasing a career. I also met a girl here and we live together. I love her and care deeply for her.  


I have a reputation for being a caring and approachable individual. I can be very funny, goofy, entertaining, and just a good person to socialize with. People trust me. They confide their deepest fears in me and I help as best I can. I stopped a suicide attempt as one example. My report card from when I was a child said I stood up for people when they had been wronged and I'm still known for this. Most have no idea about my mental health problems.  


People who abuse have been abused themselves and I am a great example of that. Feelings of incompetence or any kind of belittling send me in a spiral that the source has no idea about. I can go from feeling relatively confident about what I'm doing to considering packing my bags in one hour. In the summer of 2017, I started my first real job and was struggling in ways. I got into trouble and fell apart many times, although I ultimately persevered and am still in this job. At the time, it was evidence that I will never fit into this world and am completely hopeless. My girlfriend also has issues and would take out her frustrations on me (she is working on this and we now openly talk and mitigate the issue). At that time, the combo triggered deeply rooted rage and resentment from a life of being bullied.

I snapped back at my boss and nearly lost my job. My girlfriend would mistreat me and I would shut down for days, not speaking to her. But worst of all, one of her two cats, who is skittish and wasn't happy about this new guy who moved in, also triggered this feeling via aggressive behaviour.  


Something inside snapped when she got like this. The feelings of weakness turned into the steely confidence I had on some occasions when I was abused, just like one time when I was followed and harrassed in school for crying and I turned around and ran right at the perpetrator screaming and throwing fists. When this steely numbness comes over me, the usual knots in the stomach dissipate. The body and mind feel one dimensional and self assured and all connection to my principles and value are lost, it is like I am possessed. And in this state, I abused the cat.  


On different occasions, I hit her with my shoe repeatedly, smacked her, put her in a box to trap her, picked her up with oven gloves and shook her, chased her with the hoover. These episodes obviously took place when my girlfriend was not home and lasted roughly 10 - 30 minutes. It happened approximately 12-15 times over three months. In the midst of this horror, some kind of trigger would snap me out of it. The worst it ever got was when she had some blood from the nose after a strike with the shoe. This, along with other occurrences such as her lying out of breath on the ground, exhausted from the chase, would cause me to snap out of it. I never left any permanent physical damage but she remains traumatized psychologically. I managed to play off what was happening as the cat being crazy to my girlfriend - she was the runt of her litter and became defensive and aggressive, making her hard to approach for strangers etc, but this is none of her fault.  


In the wake of an episode, I would immediately fall apart. Guilt and extreme shame came flooding. I would nurse her back to health, I showered with her on many occasions when she soiled herself from fear. I would spend hours with her in deep despair over what I had done, yet again. Eventually, I got lasting control over myself. Never again would I abuse her or any other creature, I swore. To atone for it, I promised myself not only that, but to create as best as possible, a loving environment she feels safe in. I feed her twice a day and make sure to spend time relaxing with her. I regained her trust and she comes up to me seeking pets and love every day now. There are no more fights or even indications thereof. I hug and kiss her every day and she lives in peace and happiness.  


I started psychotherapy a couple of months ago and moved onto the topic finally with my therapist. It is painful to relive the memories and after a session it is very hard to live out the day in peace. I am tormented by the guilt of this and a part of me wants to reveal my actions to my girlfriend so that I can be ousted by her and all my friends, rendering me alone, kicked out of the country and left to either die or start completely fresh if I can muster the ability. What stops me is the real possibility I could end my life, the hurt I would cause her in revealing it, and enormous destruction I will have to live with should I not commit suicide. I know that if I get a hold of all of this and build a strong and stable life, I can deliver a net positive amount of love to outweigh the horrors of my past actions, but it is so hard to find the will to do this with such overbearing guilt.  


My therapist is the prime person to listen to but I wanted to say this here because I know there are others like me, and I hope this will encourage them to get a hold of it and seek help. I would also like constructive perspectives from people. All questions welcome and thank you for reading.",16Oct2018,1
88,"Hello everyone! I am a 22F who has recently being experiencing quite a few mental health problems. I have been pretty separated from my dad for about 4 years now, so I luckily don’t have to deal with too much of his bullshit anymore. 

However, since I’ve started dealing with my own mental health, I really started diving deep into my own psyche. Especially back when I was younger in high school (and though I am now mostly able to control myself, I still have issues from time to time), I exhibited some behavior that seemed incredibly similar to Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). However, the more I looked into it, the more it seemed like something just wasn’t right. I don’t have abandonment issues, nor was the fear of being abandoned ever my main “motivation” behind my behavior. Yet, I still exhibited the majority of those same symptoms.

My fiancé reminded me that NPD is not only thought to be linked genetically, but also that living in close proximity to a person with a PD of any kind can cause it to rub off on you. I acknowledged he was correct about the possibilities, and as much as I hate how my dad is, I decided to put that aside and take a look at the symptoms through an unbiased lense.

And holy shit. My jaw almost hit the floor. NPD, this horrible thing I’ve been trying to get away from, is at least partially inside me. My father and I have a lot of very similar symptoms, but we present them very differently, so I never saw any parallels in our behavior. Now, I don’t have any idea of whether or not I would actually qualify for a diagnosis of NPD, and whether or not I do, I’m not terribly worried about it considering I have minimal problems admitting when I’m wrong and I do genuinely care about other people’s feelings (I have asked my friends and family before if this is true about me because I never wanted to be like my dad, and they all say yes), but I do plan to talk to a therapist about it once I find one, as I am still on the journey to finding a therapist for all of my other mental health issues as well.

My depression is also a strange case, as it came on suddenly and severely, and has thus far been treatment-resistant, even to the ketamine clinical trials. I read that people with NPD have a more difficult time coming out of depressions, and so I’d really like some insight as to whether or not this is the case. I really want to address the symptoms, find places in my life where it’s potentially causing harm to myself or those around me, and move on from there. I never want to make another person feel the same way as my dad made my whole family feel. I’ve always resented him for that, and I am having a hard time not resenting him more, realizing that not only did I have to suffer because of him, but people had to suffer because of me, too.

Has anyone else ever had this same horrifying realization? Does any one else feel like they may have had the same thing happen to them?

TL;DR - I recently tried to assess my own behaviors and found out that I have symptoms of NPD, but just present them differently than my dad, so I had no idea there were parallels. I plan to talk to a therapist about it and assess whether or not these symptoms are harming myself or others. Has anyone else realized they may have developed NPD as a result of having a narcissist parent?",16Oct2018,1
89,I am a college student very close to graduating and the demands of the semester are just piling up. I also work part time and they are giving me tons of hours despite my requests to schedule me less. I also have ptsd and depression and have been struggling a lot lately. This has in turn made my health issues much worse. I have pain in nearly my entire body and have to go to the doctors a lot for tests and appointments to try to figure it out. I just don’t know where to go from here because I need to graduate and need to work to pay for bills.

90,"Hi, I just need a second to vent. I'm Bipolar and have PTSD's. People tell me it's pretty obvious in how I carry myself. This week I've had two separate people intentionally escalate situations to try to make me throw the first punch. My room mate (the more pressing concern) has almost definitely stolen from me in the past and I confronted him about it and he kept gaslighting me, saying he stole more than I suspect he did. A few days ago, hee told my neighbor that he is trying to start a fight with me on my birthday this weekend.  He kept yelling at me from his room so I came to his door, then he started screaming to get out of his room, so I left and he came out and kept standing in my face, but clearly not using his hands. At one point he just kept interrupting me without saying words and making sounds like he was (sorry) retarted.  


I can't report him because he's only stolen weed. He knows I'm only here for a semester and his actions feel like he's trying to ruin me before I graduate. I'm extremely angry and have been going outside all day to try to walk it off. Anyway thanks I'm sorry this is such a mess",16Oct2018,1

I had an attempted suicide in May, so I can only imagine how they will react, with anger that I'm not only going backwards, but asking for their help again and support. They are supportive but can lash out any minute which will make me realize I'm a burden on them, and will be a burden when living with them again.

95,"25 f. I know I have bad anxiety and have delt with depression throughout my life. I'm getting so anxious at work now that I'm stress sweating and its affecting my performance. I wanna just live a normal life and be able to go to bed without my mind racing for hours. I wanna be able to handle things on without my anger-anxiety taking over making me feel like breaking something or screaming at someone. 

So my question is what do I do now. I know I have a problem and I know I need help but do I just tell my doctor, should I try seeing some sort of therapist? I'm all for being medicated, I've tried xanax but it makes me dizzy and tired. 

What if I bring up my anxiety that presents as anger and my doctor calls CPS because I have a 2 year old. I have learned to control my yelling and we dont hit or spank him ever but I'm so scared. 

I've never been suicidal but I guess I have thought about it. My son keeps me from going to that place. I guess my brain likes to play with that idea.

100,"Well, it took me a couple of weeks (or even months) to convince myself to write somewhere so here it goes...

I am a college student in my mid 20s and this is my last semester. I have only one class left so I can work 4 days a week. I have great parents and sisters, and I love my work (I am a programmer), I have everything I could ask for, so I don't really have anything in my life that I hate or really dislike. 

But still, something is wrong. I dwell on the past.. a lot, and I don't understand why. I still really miss the couple of people I met in high school and don't speak anymore even though it's been five years. I get nostalgic really easily and I guess it wouldn't be a bad thing but while most people smile when think of the 'old' times I always feel like I could cry and I would do anything I can to go back in time. I can sit in front of my computer or lie in the bad at night and think about the past and the people. And it would all be fine, but when I am thinking about these things I get incredibly sad. Thankfully it almost always happens at home and at night, but it happened at work and I just stared at the monitor for a couple of minutes until I pulled myself together and got back to work. 

And the worst thing is that I can get nostalgic by anything. I just heard Otherside by Red Hot Chili Peppers 2 days ago for the first time and I know I should stop listening to it, but I know I won't. (music I used to listen to or generally sad music can easily make me sad. And sometimes this is the reason I start to listen to it, I don't know why)

This whole 'process' happens randomly. It may not come up for months, but it can come up every single day for weeks (like now). I thought it has something to do with my free time but it doesn't because in the last two months I either work, study, sleep, or write my thesis, so I don't really have free time and it still gets me. 

My only idea is that while I was in high school I always had someone I really cared about, someone who really cared about me, or just a friend. And now I don't have anyone. The only person I talk to (besides my family) is my coworker, but it's mostly programming related stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned above this is something that happens mostly at night. When I wake up in the morning usually everything is fine, so I guess I can live with it (so far it's been 4 years) but it would great not to feel like sh\*t this often. Or somehow forget the past.",16Oct2018,1

'I love everything about you' ' I love how kind you are, i've needed someone like you for a long time'' 'No, I love how long our messages are, it just shows how much we love talking'. These are some of the sweet things he said to me. We were obsessed and inseparable.  He got depressed because of uni and stopped communicating. I'm not a high maintenance girl but he wouldn't' reply for 24 hours and he would say it was because he was sleeping because he was so depressed. (I do know for a fact his depression is real because he was late to work and slept in all the time and was failing his exams, cheating did not happen) I tried to communicate with him and asked  if it was me to which he replied 'no, I love that you're here, i'm so glad i met you' Then I notice that he has emotional capacity for everyone else apart from me but did not want to stress him out too much, but i decided to ask him the next time we met. Fast forward a few weeks, i was going to sit him down and talk with him, before I leave  my mums husband died right infront of me and theres was nothing i could do. I was really  shook and struck. I went to meet him because I just needed a bit of support to which He said it wasn't a big deal and that i'm too sensitive. Later that day (yes that day) he broke up with me. All very very sudden. (the whole decline went down very very quickly and I could tell it was his depression he was almost projecting on to everything. He then said it was his depression and I was very sympathetic. I was taking things well and then he says 'yeah it's your personality as well' 'You're too kind and a yes man' Shocked i asked why and he said ''you pretended to know who that actor was just to agree with me.' I was VERY confused, seemed very minor and petty. A few days before that he mentioned an actor, i said i didn't know and then i realized who it was and /i had mixed him up with someone else. 'That's not how I see it though' 'he said. This confused me as it was a really simple conversational utterance that he managed to twist in to that. ' j'Your messages are too long' he also said, when i already asked him weeks previously if our messages were okay (because they were quite long).I reminded him that I asked him and he said ' I don't remember that' How convenient. He never once communicated to me any issues  when I asked him. He twisted everything about me and told me I was too kind, when I called him out on it he said 'It's a mixture of everything though. There's too much going on with my friends. I always put them first before any relationship.' (His friend was going through a rough patch but she was doing okay). This made me feel like shit. 'I'm finding it hard to balance everything, I'm really numb and depressed' I empathise and then say that THAT does not give him an excuse to twist my character. He then accused me of nitpicking, even though he was over exaggerating very VERY minor things about me in to something I didn't even recognize. He then comes out with ' You never decide where to eat, you just go along with me' When in actual fact I said that i'm a girl who will eat anything and that I don't mind. I always let him choose because he was abused and bossed about by his EX and I was just gentle with him until he got used to me 'Well that's not how I see it and I'm sorry you don't see yourself that way''......... In other words he was right and I apparently don't see myself correctly. He knows I have depression and anxiety too and sometimes I got worried about him and maybe things might've looked one way. This convo went on for 20 mins and the he just fucked off and went a drink with his friends... Later that night I found out he had been liking pictures of other girls on his tumblr. I called him out on this and he gave more excuses and then he said to me 'it's right person wrong time, message me'. he would also say things like 'You just need to get over this' 'what do you even want from me' I also called him out because literally 3 days before we broke up he was still kissing and touching me. For weeks we did not talk and his sister started giving me abuse and I just don't know whats happening anymore. I'm very depressed. He turned on me so quickly and not I hate myself for being a nice person. He also said that he jumps at the first sign of happiness and that is why... but he said weeks previously that I made him happy. whenevr I called him out on his lack of respect he would always use his depression and that he's trying to be selfish. He then said I was putting him on a pedestal but I was just trying to cheer him up .I was nothing but patient with him and he just turned black and white on me.",16Oct2018,1
