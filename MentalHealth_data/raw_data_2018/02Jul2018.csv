1,"He was bakeracted about 5 months ago.  3 days ago he was taken to the hospital for drinking way too much and acting suicidal.  He's LEO, so he knew what to say to the cops to not be taken for being suicidal, even though they could tell he was, so they took him for being excessively intoxicated.

Right now, he's all over the place emotionally and saying he feels like nothing, nobody, and that he's trapped in a whole he can't get out of.  Whenever we talk, things just seem to get worse.  I'm not good at emotional discussions and he's taking absolutely everything out of proportion.  For example, he was hysterically crying and telling me of things that fucked him up growing up.  I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything.  He ended up saying ""you didn't call to hear that"" and I replied ""no, you're fine"" and he said ""no, I know you don't care, so I'm hanging up"" and idk what to do so I just said ""uhh okay then"" and he mocked me then hung up.  He later spoke to his GF and said I called him to say what a horrible person he is and he can do nothing right.  He's acting insane and idk what to do.  Not only that, but I'm concerned for him and the dogs.

He says he's going to meet with AA soon and concilors his work will offer him.  Is that all he can really do?  Also, what the hell can I do?  I feel like I make things worse by trying to talk to him, but if I chose not to talk to him, he'd feel all alone.  Thoughts?",02Jul2018,1,
2,"Ok so Im a veteran with TBI and PTSD which creates issues with me doing normal stuff that shouldn't be a problem for an adult. Some of the issues are planning my day, taking care of tasks or even creating tasks. I know it sounds like normal problems but for me it's like I need someone to keep me accountable and cheer me on or even help me stick to a long term plan. I know there's life coaches but I'm more thinking of someone that calls me and emails me every day. Does this service exist?",02Jul2018,2,
3,"For a little background--I'm a recent college grad and will be heading to graduate school this fall. I've never dealt with mental health issues before until this last year. During my first semester of my senior year, I was busy taking a course load which I hadn't anticipated being as heavy as it was. In addition, I took on four small jobs that I didn't think would take up too much time (three through campus, one outside of campus) but ended up being awfully too much for me to handle (looking back I can't believe I even did this). Needless to say, I was running on about 3 hours of sleep a night while working these jobs and trying to stay afloat in my classes. I was also dealing with having to apply to graduate schools, take the GRE, etc. Ultimately, I reached a point where I would sit on my bathroom floor and sob, shake, and quite frankly, lose my shit, for about an hour a night because I was overwhelmed. To this day, I don't know if these were panic attacks or not because everything was a blur at this point. Knowing I had too much going on, I quit my job outside of school (which was a morning shift 4am-12) and the semester progressed as usual. 

Fast forward to second semester and graduation... Everything was going fine, I had the best semester of my life, enjoyed the time I had left with friends, picked where I'd be going to graduate school, etc. I got a job for the summer working in a lab and decided to have a relaxing summer before things picked up again in the fall. However, things aren't feeling right. It's hard for me to explain exactly how I feel as I've never really addressed these things before and have always been a relaxed, rational person, so bear with me. This whole summer has been filled with this dread that is looming over me that can't really pin down. I've had a list of things take care of this summer but have done few of them because every time I want to make progress on the list, I think of everything else I need to do and get too freaked out. After visiting home for some time, being around my parents made me feel really on-edge and unsettled. Now that I'm back working my job, I want nothing more than to go home to my parents. Some nights I can't help but to ""lose my shit"" like I did during the school year. One morning after a night of casual drinking, I woke up feeling like something really wasn't right. I had felt the same feeling before, but couldn't place it at first. Eventually I realized it was the same feeling I had felt the handful of times I tried marijuana. I had an out-of-body experience during the high, followed by a few days of not feeling like anything was real/everything had changed in some subtle way I couldn't pick up (really freaked me out but it eventually went away). 

When I'm distracted, things are fine. As soon as I'm alone or in the lab, I just get really in my head (I'm always kind of like this, but it has never been uncomfortable like it is now). Some days are fine, others I feel like there's something wrong with me. I want to deal with this now before I go to grad school to make sure I can succeed without any of this possibly getting in the way.

I've never told anyone the extent of any of this because I don't know where I'd even start. I have been thinking of seeing a psychiatrist, but I'm scared of what to say/how to explain what I'm dealing with. I've never been good at putting anything, let alone my feelings, into words and doing so feels like a daunting task. I'm sure this doesn't seem like anything incredibly profound or significant, but I've never dealt with anything like this before and I want to better understand what it is I'm dealing with. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this and that has any advice or insight!",02Jul2018,1,

Eat generally healthy and no serious medical issues. But my brain tells me that something is wrong. I’m having a stroke or a heart attack or a blood clot that is going to travel to my lungs or brain or heart. It’s always something.

6,"NSFW maybe? Just in case?

I made a throwaway account for this, I hope this subreddit can help me out. I have Bipolar I Disorder and some anxiety issues, probably depression induced. Its pretty well managed, I take Lamictal and Prozac, and I have fairly frequent depressive episodes (not extremely severe anymore, but it varies), and I haven't had a true manic episode in probably 2.5 years. I've been hypomanic since then, but probably not in the last year or so, as I tend to swing more depressive than manic.

I have been smoking weed pretty regularly for a while, with no negative effects, at least that I can tell. I could possibly have an opportunity to take LSD or Shrooms in the future (in a few months, and it would be a one time thing) and I wanted to do research on if there were any risks with Bipolar and psychadelics.

My question is: are there any major risks that come with having bipolar and taking psychadelics, or could it interact with any of my medication? I just don't want anything permanently bad to happen to affect the rest of my life if I decide to take psychadelics once.

Sorry about the long post, thank you.

7,"Context - I live in North Carolina, I live in a house of 5, and I am 14. I often hurt myself under extreme emotional stress (punching myself, clawing at my own eyes, hitting my head with a trumpet case or the wall, etc.). I don’t cut but I do frequently hide in my closet with nothing but a knife in my hand against my wrist thinking I should. I don’t know if I have any mental health issues, my parents never got me checked or anything along those lines. I often ask myself degrading questions, like what if I had waited longer, then would she have actually called me? What if I was more athletic, would I have more friends? Am I unattractive? I feel so distressed about telling people about the way I feel, because I think people will say things like “it’s because you do this” or “you choose to be that way” or “your too young to understand your feelings.” I feel this way about regular social places and I think there’s something wrong with me. “What if they don’t accept me?”, “What if they don’t like me because I am mixed?”, “What if I were never born?” I know I’m going to screw myself over by being like this but I don’t know how to stop. I often go into crying fits where I curl up on the floor in my room or in my bathroom just trying to stop crying and thinking ill of myself which fuels the crying more.

8,"I'm looking for some advice to deal with work related anxiety. 

For a couple years now I've dealt with mild depression, but ever since moving and starting my first real post-grad job I have had very little symptoms of this and have been generally happy and active! However in the past month or two I have been having pretty severe anxiety about my job. I work outside hiking for hours through the woods by myself in a mountinous area, so my job is very physically and mentally demanding. My whole body is always sore. The other difficult aspect is that I am working on a new project, and they are trying to see how much work is possible to get done within our time frame. This puts a lot of pressure on me to work quickly.  I work very hard and push myself every single day, and I'm just starting to get warn out. I definitely don't think that we will reach the ultimate goal. I have talked to my boss about this and he is very understanding and has told me that it's okay if we don't get it all done - just as much as possible. However I still get anxiety almost every day and never feel like I am doing enough. I have come close to having panic attacks in the field twice now, and have cried in the field half of the days in the last two weeks. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with this or decrease my anxiety, or even just hear from people who experience the same thing. I stretch every day before and after work to help with the muscle soreness, but that's about all I do. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this :)

I used to be a great student that was depressed from having no friends. Went to middle school and developed a sense of humor and laziness. Middle school just ended and now I am stuck home for the summer with barely anyone to contact. It started about then. From then on my cleverness left. I was a slow thinker, with my dad always yelling at me for doing nothing. My old depression and cleverness is now a different part of me. The other side (I call""The Clever One"") is always thinking through me. I have to monitor my own thoughts to make sure they are not his.

But alone with myself and the silence, I feel like this: if I had a pill that could kill me painlessly, I would take it. Life is pointless and not worth all the anxiety and stress it takes. 

I read online that this is a disorder--existential depression. Is it really? Or is it just awareness and melancholy and the real state of the world we're living in?",02Jul2018,6,
13,"I have this friend I've been having trouble with for a few years. Well, it's not really him, but more so me. This was all online by the way, I don't know him in real life.

I've had issues with anxiety for a long time, but for reason meeting this person took it to a whole nother level. Admittedly I think I'm kind of asshole, because it all started when I realized I probably had a crush on him (He's gay and I'm a girl, so that would never go anywhere anyway). I started getting jealous that he would hang out with his other friends more than me and that he didn't talk to me a lot, but I'm being a hypocrite because I don't have much to say anymore either. I also felt absolutely terrible that I had a crush on him even though he's gay. I ALSO felt terrible being jealous of his other friends being his best friends and that I wasn't. It's like I have a problem I'm aware of but I still feel angry at him even though it's not his fault.

This anger at him combined with the guilt and regret I feel caused me to get panic attacks whenever I saw his username. I decided I would unfriend him, at first for being angry with him, then every other time was because of how guilty I felt and that being friends him cause me physical pain just from seeing him. I unfriended him and refriended him like a million times, over and over and over again because I was so indecisive of what to do. I wanted to stay being friends with him, but at the same time I didn't. I keep getting in a conflict with myself over whether it's his fault, or my fault, or both of us. Even though personally I think it's my fault.

Every time I see him, my personality starts centering around him, and I feel like I need to be perfect or something and not show who I really am because I'm afraid he won't like me. I don't know why this happens to me.

He often makes me feel upset, but that's my fault, not his. Whenever I apologized or explain the situation and be honest, he just says,""It's fine."" I don't know this response bothers me so much. Everything he says is just kind of emotionless and vague and I never really feel like he wants to be friends with me, but at this point, it's understandable since I'm an annoying, clingy piece of shit. I asked him today and he said,""I don't mind if we're still friends.""

Today, I finally decided to talk to him again, saying,""Sorry for all the drama a while ago."" and he said,""oh, wow, hi"" which I was offended by...I thought,""Wow, havn't seen me for so long and you say,'wow,hi'""?

This is the only person I'm like this with. With anyone else, I'm like whatever, I'm not as insecure with my other friends, but around this specific person, I get all angry,irritated and possessive. I don't know why.

I felt a lot better when I stopped being friends with him, but then as soon as I started trying to be friends with him again, I felt depressed, my heart started pounding, I felt weak, and started getting a terrible headache. That headache is still going on right now as I type this.

I talked to another friend with anxiety and they said he was kind of mean to them when they got anxious. So there's that I guess.

I don't know what to do and I don't know what's wrong with me. Why am I like with only one person and no one else? Do I try to be friends with him again, or do I stop trying and just accept that it's too painful for me because of all the guilt?

When I'm writing I'll mess up the words and spell them wrong, and when I'm reading I can't remember what I just read and nothing is sticking in my head.

19,"Long story short, my girlfriend claims to have four brothers that I'm almost 99% sure do not exist. Two of them she hardly mentions anymore and there is zero proof they ever existed. The other two are the ones that concern me a great deal.

1) her brother that is supposedly a year above her. I've checked his social media, there is pretty much zero chance they are related. They are not in contact. 

2) her twin, whom she supposedly talks to all the time. Not on social media. No evidence he really exists other than a couple of camp photos.

As far as I can tell, these are two people she went to camp with years and years ago who she was close friends with. She has BPD and began experiencing bad breaks with reality around the time she would have stopped going to camp. I wouldn't really worry if this was something she mentioned once early in the relationship, but she brings them up all the time. I'm really sick of hearing stories that I'm positive are false, and if she is talking to them (which so far I've found no proof of) I'd like to know the nature of their conversations seeing as how they're obviously not related. No, I dont think shes cheating on me. Thats not the angle I'm taking this with.Theres zero evidence of that. However, i am worried that she is genuinely convinced these people are her siblings when all evidence is to the contrary.

 It's only come up once and I had to back away from the issue because she almost had a breakdown. I need to show her what I see but I'm afraid that confronting her with the evidence will cause her to snap, and she has been doing very well aside from this one thing. She either lied to make herself more interesting early in the relationship and felt she needed to keep the lie going, or she genuinely believes this false reality. Either way, I dont know how to bring it up. I've told her i want to meet them, all that. I've tried subtleties. I need this shit to stop though, and as her boyfriend I deserve some closure. Help!

21,"Sorry for formatting, I'm on my mobile 

I have bpd and show the typical symptoms of this and I have learnt to live with what I have, however I've just recently started noticing something I'm actually becoming worried about? I'm not sure if it's just my bpd and I should just try to ignore my head or if this is seriously bad and I need help lol

[Backstory] So in 2016 after my final school year exams, I had court for a family member beating my mum &amp; threatening to kidnap/hurt/kill me, our family dog who was a 1.5 years old had a heart attack and died on my partners birthday the same month all this drama has happened, we had to take her to the vet to organize a cremation and the whole bunch of scenarios were so traumatic.
We straight away rescued a dog to move forward quicker and this dog has grown really attached to me more than any pet I've ever had before. 
Problem is, I find myself waking up multiple times in the middle of the night to check if shes breathing, If the house is quiet i go find her to see if shes alive, I cant hear or see hurt/dead animals on the road or on TV/facebook anymore, I've even completely thrown away my whole lifes work to become a veterinarian nurse because of my constant fear of animals dying (I was never effected by animal death previously to what happened)
And it's not just animals, if my partner finishes work by a certain time and doesnt message me when hes usually home I will go into a fit of anxiety that hes had a car accident/got stabbed, if my mother doesnt message or call the usual times she does, I will worry endlessly until she contacts me.
I've been suicidal and self destructive in the past and currently but never gone to get help for it however these constant thoughts of people around me dying is too hard to deal with now and I'm actually considering getting help for it.
Theres literally nothing on Google of anyone going through anything like this, God I'm so confused on what's normal

Tldr; traumatic experiences including watching a family pet die has suddenly given me massive anxiety 2 years later to the point where I cannot deal with living like this any longer.",02Jul2018,1,

26,"So I'm just word vomiting right now because my hand just doesn't have the stamina for a long journal entry.

Within the last 24-48 hours, I've reverted back. The ugliness knocked me over these past 24 hours and that's all I can think about. The thoughts of hurting my cat, who I had to keep outside my bedroom today for the first time in months because I was on the verge of blowing a gasket, have returned. The monster staring back at me in the form of a reflection has returned. The little humanity I had gained these few months has dwindled to almost nothing. I'm now more anxious and afraid to be leave my house; angrier at people. Before meds, my mind was also chock-full of conspiracies; my family members are my enemies, my teachers were out to destroy my future, my non-existent social life is the fault of others and they are responsible for all the unfortunate events I've lived through. I'm so physically repulsive that I'm ashamed people have to see me and angry at my parents for conceiving such an abomination. My unmanageable anger became concerning. I won't go into detail but I was ruminating over things that, if acted on, would have either left someone hospitalized, put me in jail or left my cat dead. The heavy load of sadness where I'm unable to see the world in color.

I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, Major Depressive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder this past April. I went untreated for TEN YEARS (I'm 28); never uttered a word about it. I thought it would go away with age. I thought life changes would 'cure' me. Getting a cat, getting a job, moving. Mental illness is blind; it doesn't see your life nor care about what's changing. It just exists like a cancerous tumor, growing larger with every subsequent year. Then I fell into the darkest pit in April and saw a psychiatrist in a state of emergency. It was a roller coaster of a session 
and the right thing to do but I still doubted whether I made the right choice because as tortured as I lived, it's all I ever knew.
Not only was I mentally deteriorating, but I was truly afraid of how much worse it can get. Depression is a damn shape-shifter. 

I had no insurance at the time so just imagine how much I was paying (!!!). My insurance went into effect July 1st
and have scheduled to see a doctor today July 2nd. My antidepressants have ran out, after lowering the dosage from 20mg to 10mg to last me until my insurance became effective. The difference is startling. Slowly but surely,the monster that
had been just recently contained, has struggled its way out of the straitjacket, broken through the cage, and now has me in its grip. The effects of antidepressants are undisputed but this can only be realized when the meds run out. Or change meds. *That's* when you know how bad it gets and how much you want it to go away. 

I have no power right now. This is Hell. 12 hours until my appointment at 3PM and a few days until I can put this monster back in its cage. Not sure how long it would take the meds to kick in again but I'm hoping damn soon. I'm also on a stimulant, which raises all the feel good hormones, but of course it's not enough on its own and treats an entirely different problem. I need my antidepressants. The combo has changed my life but without the antidepressants, the stimulant works in conjunction with depression. It makes me focus on all the wrong things and all day.

I'm taking a summer course and have already fallen behind. I have 3 assignments due in the next 3 days and I can't seem to summon the energy to get started. I've spent the last 2 days crying, a little more every few hours, laid up in bed. Goodness, let me just get through tomorrow. C'mon 3PM.

31,"I'm 21, 22 in a few months and I've never been professionally diagnosed but I've been feeling like this since I was about 15~. At this point in my life I feel like that's all I've ever known because I tend to distance myself from memories of my younger self because I dont like who I was growing up and I feel like I've come along way and those memories don't represent who I am today. 

I don't feel a lot of emotions, never really have. I find it difficult to speak to people in general, even family. When I do feel *something* it's generally loneliness, self-pity / that I'm never good enough for my own standards. Sometimes I'll feel neutral for a week, not particularly happy or sad, sort of like I really couldn't care about anything. Then the feelings just described can stay for months at a time. When I begin to feel like this I ghost my social media, ghost friends, ghost family and sit in my room on my computer and only leave for food, toilet breaks and work. I find comfort in feeling like this and never push for anything better, probably because I find it easy to live like this since I've been doing it for so long but it doesn't help at all and I've been stuck in this loop for too long.

My question is, how do you stop yourself from finding comfort in these unhealthy feelings and push yourself to begin on your path to a healthier psyche?

32,"My last month has been undoubtedly that. I have been to the brink of sanity and could easily go there again.

I have had severe episodes of depersonalization which I can only describe as absolute chaos of the mind. I could barely think for a time, and verbal thoughts still send me back into depersonalization. 

I feel like another person, or like an identity-less entity much of the time now, which is better than the chaotic, racing, uncontrollable mind I was faced with before and which occasionally reemerges. I am not delusional, though. I know precisely what is going on.

It's at times like these that I remember my favorite poem, Invictus:

Out of the night that covers me

Black as the pit from poll to poll

I thank whatever Gods may be

For my unconquerable soul


In the fell clutch of circumstance 

I have not winced nor cried aloud

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody but unbowed


Out of this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the horror of the shade

And yet the menace of the years 

Finds and shall find me, unafraid


It matters not how strait the gate

How charged with punishments the scroll

I am the master of my fate

I am the captain of my soul

As the title says, I feel like basically everyone hates me. It's not like I don't have friends, I do, but I feel like they've only been putting up with me these past few years just to be nice to me. I see all of the things that point to the conclusion that they do actually care about me and that I'm just being ridiculous and I believe that I'm just being ridiculous but I also have the part of me that sees and hears every single little action or tone that could possibly be twisted around to look like that person hates me and I twist it and I believe that it is the case that they hate me as much as I believe that I'm being ridiculous. Part of what's making it feel worse now probably has something to do with us all going off to college and none of them are going to the same one as I am. We also have a group chat on Instagram with all of us in it and I feel like I'm ignored most of the time, I told them that they'd be invited to my birthday party when I decide what I'm doing for it and no one said anything about it.

34,"Hello,
I am writing because I guess i want to post as sort of a journal and to get this off my mind.
I have been depressed for a very long time, last year I went to see a psychologist to help me sort out my depression, she recently gave me a questionnaire for ADHD because of the things I have been saying.
It reminded me that when i was younger (15) mum has taken me to a psychiatrist for ADHD, I thought back then she took me because she wanted me to just be medicated to be normal so she could have the normal daughter she felt she deserved.
But she took me once, thought the psychiatrist was weird and never took me again.
So i went back to him this year, he still had my notes from 23 years ago, he suggested I do a IQ test, because of my chronic depression some symptoms overlap with ADHD.
So i went and booked that and took it, I just got the results back today.
He told me he wrote a report to my GP to say that I have Dysthmia and symptoms of ADHD, and the psychologist who administered the IQ test who's specialty is Autism suggested i might have mild autism symptoms. The psychiatrist said when he first saw me 23 years ago he thought I might have that.
Now i just feel like crying and i feel scared and upset and angry.
After the appointment, I went to a bar and i just sat and drank, i did not feel like going home.
I am at home now and i just feel so lost. 
On one hand it explains why people have been so shitty to me my entire life, on the other hand i feel angry because i was treated like shit and i actually needed help.

36,"Background story about me: 

My entire life is built around with lies. Quite a confession considering most people who have known me in real life would never thought I make up a lie at all but unfortunately this was the only truth in my life. When I say I lied about my life, I meant EVERYTHING. Experiences in my CV (never worked in my entire life), past relationships, parent history, my degree grades, life experiences, illness (I overdosed on paracetamol and pulled an all-nighter just so my counsellor can diagnose me with depression to be exempt from exams)  etc. Surprisingly, nobody has ever questioned my lies considering how elaborate and detailed they are. I am one of those people who everyone would trust due to my confidence/friendly personality. People might say that my friends might know about my lies and are just waiting for me to come clean but that's far from true. The reason is that the way I lie: I can distinguish between lies that people won't believe and what they will believe. 

I would never tell people a lie that people won't believe and rather tell a lie that I can cover very well. Example: I lied that I am currently working in a firm this summer and to make people convince that I am: I made a fake email account similar to the firm's email and sent myself a letter of offer for the role and induction. I even researched up what the role entails and exact knowledge you need to succeed in the role so when people ask me what I do, I can clearly answer them. Browsing through reddit made me realise that I am not even sure if I am similar to other liars. If I was caught in a lie (happened very little), I would calmly assess the situation and think of another believable lie instead of lashing out in extremities and saying 'you caught me'. But its also different in a way where I would also tell the truth to people on anything that doesn't involve myself personally. 

I must say I have built a quite an excellent persona/mask of myself infront of people although I always fear this mask might be destroyed one day. I always followed this rule to myself: Never get way too close to anyone. Its ok if you learn a lot about other people but never reveal a truth about yourself. I find lying quite amusing/fun (plus personal benefits) but besides that I don't know why I lie. I have never thought of harming people maliciously but I don't what I will do if my lie gets exposed. I also move around constantly and rarely keep in contact with a large group of people for a long period of time. I don't even want to prevent myself from lying cause I rather live with this mask than being a failure.

But one thing I always wanted for someone else to be next to me. I am not even sure if I ever fell in love (I was always had crushes/infatuated and would go slightly creepy to get them but still have dated a few people) but I don't know why I want this: To find someone who accepts me or an asset for my mask. Due to my lying and policy, I can never find someone to date long-term. I know for a fact I can never find an S/O but I do find it lonely having no-one.

So my question to fellow liars and others: how do you deal with dating someone who lies and why do you want to date them?

TLDR: I am liar who is unsure about dating and want fellow redditors their experiences on this. Also I m not sure if this is the right subreddit",02Jul2018,1,

\- oversensitivity

\- deep sense of insecurity, lack of self-confidence

\- feeling of emptiness and boredom (as if I have figured it all out, and life is meaningless, and now I am forced to finish it off)

I’ve also started having a few nightmares every now and then but it’s not too much of a problem (I’ve also experienced sleep paralysis once this year and I had never before that- but I thought that was due to calming down after an mdma trip where I kept hallucinating - about 3 months ago, and that was my first and last ever use). The thing that scares me the most however is that if im laying down in the same position for a long time, I start zoning out into a kind of state where I can just hear white background noise. Everything seems to slowly move away from me and starts to seem extremely out of proportion. For example, it happened just before writing this post and I started panicking because even though I was touching my body and knew that I was in one of those states , it felt extremely big and extremely small in different places.

Hello everyone! I'd like to invite you to take part in this short (less than fifteen minutes) online study.

The objective is to understand whether/how social status affects low mood (and possibly anxiety). My aim is to further understanding of how a person's social environment can mediate negative affect.

**I do warn that some of the questions involve assessing your levels of anxiety and low mood and a lot of questions refer to perception of social status and some people may find these distressing. Please make sure you only participate if you feel it will not affect you negatively to be asked such questions.**

People in all countries are welcome but If you're in the UK or are able to use UK Amazon vouchers from your country you have the chance to enter a draw for one out of fifteen £20 Amazon vouchers at the end of the survey.

The exact theory being tested is explained at the end of the survey to avoid biasing people's responses and I will happily share the results once I've got them. The data you provide is completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you.

54,"I’m not holding a joint while I type this, I swear, but here me out. I’ve recently been on a bit of a ‘spiritual’ journey trying to figure out what my thoughts are basically about life as a materialist person. This might be sound rather bleak or troubled, but I’m pretty sure my mental health is fine. I went to a therapist and I scored way too low on anxiety or depression to really warrant paying 

Let me first say I’m a pretty young guy so this might explain the rest I’m going to say. 

I have always had a huge tendency to overthink things I’ve been told, but I’ve always seen it as trying to dig into a rabbit of thoughts for truth or clarity about it. Due to some recent stuff in my life, I’ve been trying to understand everyone’s place in the world, especially in the grand scheme of things like death.

I’ll try and illustrate my confusions with literal thoughts I’ve had:

“These people are having such a good time. I mean, their living is casting and playing video games. It seems so simple. Yet life can be so cruel. What if they don’t make it to an old age? What if their parents die soon? How are they able to accept the fact that one day they will die and there life could quite possibly end miserably and in constant pain? Do they not think about it? They will one day be tossed by fate to a state where they are doomed to die - to enter an eternal cease of consciousness never to know a single thing again or to ever know a thing again. Everything they’ll ever do would be irrelevant to them at that point.”

Stuff like that. It’s not really depressive ramblings, as my happiness levels are oddly still pretty good despite having thoughts like this, since I think it’s a lack of knowledge thing. I don’t truly believe these things, but I don’t how to rule them out. 

I feel some of the answers here will rightly be “stop thinking and live your life, it’s pretty good if you don’t get in your own way too much” but I’ve never felt at ease by “not thinking”. It seems like an escapism - realizing that life is too unbearable to think too hard about and it’s best to commit philosophical suicide and shut that part of your brain off.

Basically I’m looking for two things:

1. How to answer the thought I’ve thought to myself. Living the good, simple life despite knowing the death that mortality promises us that is in store for us. 

2. How to justify NOT obsessing over this - why it isn’t escapism like I’ve described. And why my thoughts are painting too dark a picture. At least I hope it is.

This has led her to be very strict with me when i was growing up and i lived with her having OCD, which was only diagnosed about a year ago. I blame her for my anxiety, and we do have a strained relationship due to what i was like as a teenager but I love her very much, after all she is my mum and she is the only blood family I have left apart from my grandma.

Moving back to my problem, I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half and lived together just over a year. Since moving in together I have struggled with my boyfriend going out with friends or on his own. It doesnt happen often as he doesnt really enjoy going out and socialising, but sometimes an occasion does arrive. When he does want to go out, it makes my anxiety go into overdrive, i panic, sweat loads and get so scared i can break into tears almost immediatley. I completly trust him, i just hate the idea of being left on my own. I moved into a rented place with him that put him closer to his family and further away from people I know, so that he could stay closer to work and family. He works long hours each week, when i just do 9-5 and most of the time working from home. It doesnt help that i get alot of free time to myself anyway, so when he wants to be alone it makes it harder as ive already been alone for a while. Would really like someone to confirm that I am not totally crazy and if there is anyway to combat this situation? He is very loving and understanding and we talk about this often and he is very supportive, I just dont want to push him too far, as I love him and want the best for the both of us.

P.s I only really have one friend that I can go out to see, and she is very busy herself. All the hobbies I have, i do with my bf as he has the same ones! My social group is pretty much non existant.

I just wanted te tell my story here, and maybe you guys have some tips or advice, Now. since it is extremely painful for me to write down, as I already did this in my native language. I decided to copy that letter and run in through a translator, I edited a bit, but there could still be some misspelling or weird sentences in there.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My name is----, born 1992. And here I try to explain how I have lived in recent years. I myself was diagnosed at a young age with ADHD, My younger brother with Autism, and my older brother with Autism and an intellectual disability. Both my father and mother were ill. I am now trying to summarize my story, as far as possible.  
 

Childhood &gt; age 17  
I can not remember much of this time. But it was sometimes hard for me to deal with my brothers. My father could sometimes hit us, this later stopped(age 14). From about the age of 13 I started to get pretty rebellious and bring my own opinion and everything forward. From this moment on, my parents had a fight more often and I noticed that they were both abusing alchohol. I sometimes had difficulty concentrating at school and would rather be with friends or in my bedroom. We were allowed to go our own way a little bit at home, Maybe a little too much, this was also because my brother was falsely accused of a crime and came into a closed establishment, Child Protection and Youth Care came in handy, and my brother came in the first place, I had to become a little more mature, be at home, take care of my brother and household and everything, intense period with a lot of instances that looked after us and tried to get things back on track. This freedom did make it to a temporary game addiction, isolation, started smoking and not having a good relationship with my parents. the situation at home was weird.  
from the age of 15 I started going out, drinking and enjoying life a bit. I had not the best youth, but now was my time I thought. I enjoyed life.  
My brother came back, and was allowed to live accompanied, this was also better for him.  
I turned 16, and my parents got sick, There were more fights between my parents now, My mother could not put a brake on the drinking, my father tried to keep this in line, making those fights between them, I saw it differently, My father was just a pissed off man and did not have to do that, I did not see what he was trying to achieve until he passed away 6days before my 20th birthday. We had to go to the hospital regularly at this time. Nevertheless, I easily obtained my high school Diploma in the direction of Administration, but because of the home situation I knew that I wanted to do Social pedagogy now.  


Age 17:  
I started with the Social pedagogy Level 4 course at the MBO, Deltion College. I had a job at a hardware store. I studied for 5 days, and worked on the Saturday and Thursday evening for some extra money. Because my parents were ill, the bound was bad between me and them, I had my mind with my brothers, and had to go to the hospital more and more for my parents,I could not fully concentrate on school, and had to work more to pay off my parents debts that had been made, and to pay the rent. I quit school, and eventually start working more  


Age 18 and 19:  
I immediately started driving lessons, it was more convenient to have a car since my father had to go to the hospital regularly, or was spontaneously picked up with an ambulance and I had to come to the hospital from wherever I was.  
Because every time, could be the last time.  
I got my driving license and bought a cheap car.  
From now on, I was in the hospital for a few days every week. It started getting worse with my father, we got home care. My little brother did not get full attention anymore and this made he was not supported enough. My father was under heavy medication this time and was therefore no longer himself. I started to avoid home. Made my own debts, because the money went to my parents to support.  
From now on my life was no longer my life. I switched to a Full-time job. this went on for 2 years.  


Age 20/21  


From now on I was almost every day in the hospital, or at work, or in my bedroom, I could not go out with friends anymore. My father finally passed away on February 19, 2013.  
I had to arrange everything, because my mother could not handle this. those were hard and rough days and I did not know what to do or how to deal with this, I saw my brother and brother collapse at that time.  
Since my parents had debts and were underinsured it was hard to get the cremation around, with help from an uncle we got everything around.  
We also immediately looked at what the debts were going on.  
We found a box in the wardrobe of my parents full of unopened letters. Result: an overview of all debts, total 26,000 euros. My parents turned their heads away for the financial problems all those years. I started paying off the debts that remained. My mother was completely derailed after the cremation, was barely at home,  only drank alchohol whole day, spended her allowance/support money (too sick to work), My money therefore had to go to these debts and the rent.

My days looked like this in the coming years: Work, take care of my brother, take care of my brother on assisted living, make all payment arrangements, keep financial picture in order as far as possible, talk to agencies (These came around this time there to help us pick up life again), do not sleep at night because my mother was drunk and was struggling, or was playing hard music. the home situation was tense and I had no rest or good food at all, I sometimes worked at night because I could not sleep at home, so I had more time in the day to take care of my brothers.  
Eventually I did not take this anymore, I came to work too late, after a while i did not even show up sometimes, I was sick regularly, changed my behavior, and even started to have suicidal tendencies, and even planned this sometimes. my brother did not go to school anymore, so also arranged everything with his school, so he could still get a diploma. I put him out of the house, urgently with my niece, because he looked very bad (did not eat in the house or whatever, and he did not sleep at all anymore). At that time I also had to look for a shelter for him. Solved I thought. but then my brother started to make weird choices, and he also needed all my attention. I myself ended up with a psychologist, was broken, looked bad and did not want to live anymore. I started on drugs (speed and weed) to keep myself going, it was a distraction from the world around me.  


age 22/23  
I did not speak to my little brother anymore, he was angry with me, I was not the happiest anymore to deal with, and I was the one who had put him away from home. My mother was now getting sicker and had to go to the hospital more often, sometimes even for weeks. We knew that her death was coming, but not when. I hated her at the moment, but it was my mother.  
I was still in the situation that I did not have a day for myself.  
My mother got a boyfriend, and she suddenly went to live together, just after I managed to get her into Financial support from the goverment. Which did not go smoothly since my mother did not cooperate.  
I met a girl, Stopped with the drugs, Had to find an home without money and without stuff, but with debt.  
I saw 1 option, a credit card of 2000 euro credit to get home contents.  
So said, done that way. and stopped appointments with the psychologist, because everything was over. and rent an appartment

24 years:  
I lived on myself and thought I had peace. My brother was now well again, and had been low-minded, my brother had a good spot. and I could handle everything. But one morning I was called on my way to work that my mother had a cardiac arrest and I had to come to the hospital urgently. I picked up my brothers on the way, that day I had to make the choice to let her become a greenhouse plant that only suffered pain, or to pull the plug out. I discussed with the doctor, and she told me, her heart beats, but there is no brain activity so to speak, she never wakes up again. I chose to pull the plug out. All problems started again.  
I had sought financial help for myself on the advice of my girlfriend, because I did not have time and did not want to be busy with my finances. I arranged for a notary not to inherit the debts, and arranged the death, with much opposition from my brothers' financial aid workers.  
My world was broken now, I did not want anymore and could not, My girlfriend was the only thing that kept me going. I did not see any light at the end of the tunnel, I had debts, problems, and I did not know how to live an normal life. my brother was derailed again and his help switched quite a bit at the moment, which caused a non-constant care. and I had to intervene a lot.  


25/26 years:  
I switched jobs, my old employer was happy with me, but because of everything that happened at home and was taken to work, the bound was damaged. I started to eat well and healthy again, I made a pattern in my household. I wanted a new and clean start with everything and again healthy, I could finally, nevertheless still with some problems, live normal life, but did not know how. I noticed that I did not dare to go to places where other people are, I was afraid of a social conversation, and did not even dare to go to a supermarket as I was isolated those whole years.   
Eventually I got sleep problems, hospitalization, doctor, GP, medication .. but it helped little, Docters result: We indeed see disturbed sleep (I slept for an average of 2 hours the night, and did not come in Rem or deep sleep). probably had to do with everything that had happened.  
Since then I had agreements with the GP and practice assistant to tell my story.  
And that makes us on the day where we are now, 2/7/2018, Today at Pro Juventus(Very professional life support) for an intake. And now hope that the future will be better.

My debts are getting less, and can finally spend some time myself.  
My girlfriend and I have plans to live together since those debts are not to much anymore and simple to handle, and am currently talking to my employer to get back into education and still get my diploma (in Engineering)  
I still suffer from everything, I am often confronted with myself or the past, and it has changed me, sometimes I have bad days, full of sadness and hatred, sometimes it goes well, I just feel like I have to live, I want me to do my own thing, and everything that is normal, work, getting through the day, feels like a must ... This is one of the things I seek help for, get fun again in life, I do have this, but also not . I no longer have suicidal tendencies. And see that life can also be fun again. yet I live every day a heavy backpack, which I take everywhere with me. for the outside world a reasonably cheerful and normal person, for me I am someone who wants to hide it all, and wants people to see me normal and happy too. As part of society.  
Still, I want to lose that backpack, and that is why I have sought help.",02Jul2018,1,

64,"So, I've read that apparently 25&amp;#37; of people who have borderline personality disorder also have narcissistic personality disorder. Can someone, ideally someone with personal experience, explain to me how this is possible? The two seem like completely diametrical disorders. Someone with BPD has an unstable identity, someone with NPD has a very rigid (if entirely false) identity (right?). People with BPD frequently feel inferior, people with NPD feel superior.

How can they coexist within one person?",02Jul2018,1,
65,"I don’t even really know where to start with this. I am an 18 year old female who graduated a year early, at 17, and I have been out of school for a year or so now. I was in a relationship for three years where physical and psychological abuse was involved. About two months ago, I met up with an internet friend, who we will call K (20), who I ended up adoring for that first night we spent together. I ended up breaking down to him and talking about the abuse I had gone through for years and I got the courage to leave my abusive ex, we will call him R (nearly 21), who I was excruciatingly dependent on. Well... Here we are, about two months into this relationship, K broke it off with me, but says he still wants the best for me but says I have a lot to work on until I can become a better person/partner and that he still loves me. I agree... but I am struggling. I have a really hard time communicating, so much so that it’s hard to adequately explain the issue, itself. K isn’t anything like R and really tries to understand how I’m feeling and cares deeply about empathizing for me. I found myself getting extremely defensive and wildly protective of myself when an argument/disagreement came into play with K and I always took it to another level. It is instinctual and it hurts me. I found myself uncontrollably interrupting him and breaking down each thing he said as if I found what I said to be more important... but in hindsight, or even in the moment I think, I don’t... I do legitimately care about what he has to say but I entered this sort of flight or fight option and running away was never the option. It scares me. 

I have also had multiple people in my life say I am manipulative but I... I don’t find it to be an... intentional thing. It disturbs me. Do I have unconscious motives unknown to myself that I try to get at? Am I genuinely that fucked up?

I’m going to give background into my life now. A lot of my issues started at 6 when I was sexually abused daily for at least months by a neighbor who was approximately 6 years older than me. I developed nymphomania and can clearly remember the fantasies that I would play in my head for hours. My family was very religious... I thought I had a demon living inside me. I was then touched by a girl the same age as I when I was about 10 years old. I began sexting when I was 11 and it put strain on my entire family but I literally could not keep myself from pursuing sex. Around this age, I started to notice myself being outcast from the other kids around me and was subjected to bullying. I also found myself with an obsessive crush on a guy in my grade who really wasn’t interested in me. I developed depression and anxiety around this time. I attempted to kill myself in 8th grade, the first of my suicide attempts and the first time I was sent to impatient. High school was hell. I struggled with awful social anxiety, to the point where if I didn’t wear the same clothes I usually wore (jeans, a t-shirt, a flannel or hoodie), I would have an inevitable panic attack because I thought everyone was staring at me. I lost my virginity in a 3-some with two guys cheating on their girlfriends when I was a sophomore. I attempted suicide 3 times during highschool and was put in impatient 3 times. When I graduated, I moved to a different state to live with R, despite the history of his emotional abuse and our other relationship issues. I warned him that I would not be able to function normally right out of high school and that me being able to hold a job was unlikely. He told me he would leave me if I didn’t come down immediately... so I did. As I predicted, my mental health went to shit. I couldn’t get myself out of bed and would regularly sleep for 18 hours a day. I became obligated to smoke marijuana with him because I couldn’t stand the social pressure and he wanted me to smoke anyway, despite the anxiety smoking gave me. I became very delusional during this time. I thought I could control the clouds and the weather. I thought aliens were sending and recieving information through my brain and would use robotic bugs to do it. I thought I was a goddess of the earth. It was distressing. R became perpetually physically abuse after an argument broke out and he ended up choking me until I physically couldn't struggle anymore. He hit me a few times. The last thing to happen before I left the state on a Greyhound bus was he had attempted to drown me after making me slice my arm open because he caught me cutting. During this time, I was telling R’s mother all that had happened with the physical abuse... she told me it was because I, quote, stressed him out too much... It was my fault I was physically abused. She was... uhm... crazy, though. She believed R was some sort of prophet or some shit like that despite R not being religious. She thought she saw him glowing when he was baptized? After I came back, I stayed with him and our relationship became constant emotional abuse towards me. He would block me when I was having depression and would never let me talk about my problems despite “caring about me and loving me.” He would yell at me and then use the fact that I deal with age regression and veiwed him as a caregiver to coo me back into being calm instead of acknowledging that he was literally just calling me names and cussing me out. This went on for a while. For a few months before the end of the relationship, I feel this time was... psychological torture. He told me abour how he wanted to fuck another woman, knowing how insecure I was with myself and that particular idea, and threatened to leave me if I didn’t retrieve the nudes of a girl, let’s call her J, he had previously told me he was in love with. J really liked me and was sexually interested in me so getting her nudes was... easy. It felt awful. Horrible.

I also haven’t mentioned that my father was never around, he was a hardcore alcoholic. My sister (a year younger than I) would go over to his house, at five and six mind you, and spend hours ans hours alone while he would drink and passout in his car. We stopped going over there when we told our mom about his drinking, as we were kind of just coming to light with the subject of intoxication, which was around age 11. My mom and I have had a rocky relationship. The last year I was living here, before I moved to be with R, she had a bad drinking problem and would get drunk and yell at me over anything she could think of. She did this thing where she would pin me down? I don’t get it to this day. And I would tell her to get off me over and over and she would refuse as I would melt into having a full on panic attack. This happened many many times. Once I had enough, I began kicking her off of me (as I find to be reasonable), and she would talk about how I hurt her and how she would have me taken away.

66,"for starters, i’ve always been pretty open with mental health. i’m educating myself constantly and still have a lot to learn, but i’ve always wanted to give a “ted talk” esque presentation (in front of my high school) i’ve had my deal with mental illnesses and i’ve struggled with suicidal ideation since i was 11. i’ve grown up in a household affected with mental illnesses and cultural taboo surrounding it so it was all hushed up and swept under the rug. my main goal is to open up the talk about suicide and the importance of communication surrounding mental health, especially in ethnic cultures. i wanted to focus on this side of mental health because it really hit me after my suicide attempt how little awareness some cultures have about suicide and mental health because of how the topic has been and is treated today. 

here are some of my notes for the presentation that i’ve prepared so far (i’m limited to around 20-30 minutes):

goal: shine a light on the dark side of mental health in a new (and improved) perspective. encourage others to participate, regardless of mental health status. keep topic relevant and circulating to support quiet sufferers. 

issues covering: “shamed” suicide, harmful media portrayal of mental health, stigma behind glamorization &amp; demonization, ethnic strugglers, cultural taboo, support systems, communications, underfunded 

kickstarter: image of mental health is still portrayed as “inconvenient” which is damaging and reducing chances of people receiving adequate help

establishing ethos: authority
- be direct, honest, compassionate
- speaking from experience
establishing pathos: connection 
- be passionate, descriptive, engaging
- emotional emphasis during speech
establishing logos: credibility 
- be reasonable, rational, empathetic
- using statistics and targeted facts 

call to action: listen to yourself and listen to others suffering from a mental illness. open up this conversation despite the heavy stigma. build communications and support systems with the people around you, it may save a life

any comments or questions would be appreciated, if there’s any topic that you think is important to talk about (especially to a younger more influenced audience) feel free to share! also any good tips for presenting (i get very anxious and i stutter my words a lot as well as blank out no matter how many times i practice) and any advice on the structural component of my presentation and what i can add to make it the best it can be given my time constraint. thank you all x

70,"Hello I need assistance here I was assigned as a social worker for an individual with paranoid schizophrenia, but he’s indenial about his mental illness he needs medical intervention, he’s convinced that the psychiatrists are trying to poison him with antipsychotic drugs.

The back story he’s a 32 Canadian coming from a domestic abuse household his mother and farther both diagnosed with schizophrenia he was sexually abused as a child which had a psychosocial aspect on his development of schizophrenia father and mother both abused alcohol and drugs.

Unfortunately he’s on ssdi psychiatric disability and hasn’t been able to hold down a job since his diagnosis he’s on government assistance which is eaten into his self esteem. I tell him that if he got the right medication he would be able to work.

A massive part in his detoriation of schizophrenia, is that he has no friends, and spends the majority of it on reddit, I try to call him up to go local psychotherapic support groups, but he’s too paranoid to leave the house and believe that the people in the group are going to kill him.

He also hasn’t had a girlfriend in 10 years he told me and he says that his self esteem is non existent.

My concerns with the paitent is that he has a history of heart issues cardiomydial infarction and is on 
Angiotensin Medication, which could be problematic in the interference of antipsychotic drugs.

**Quote from DrakusColt Same. Primarily genetics. I'm not morbidly obese nor do I use hard drugs, and had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) less than a year ago.
I fucking survived the widow maker. %17 of people survive it.
Same. I had an 80% blockage of my LAD.
Getting a second stent this fall..
Still on my first. Hope it's the last.
I had my heart attack less than a year ago, at the ripe old age of 31**


He’s also addicted to benzodiazepines

I’ve tried to taper him off benzodiazepines but he’s too dependent on them they reduce his anxiety and paranoia he says.

His username is u/DrakusColt

Would you guys welcome here and support him?

Side note: he’s already been hospitalized 6 times for (schizophrenia/depression/suicidality) I don’t really want to he to readmitt him into hopstial.

But his mother says he will be safe their in the hospital they’ve hid all the knives in his house because hes tried to stab himself multiple times.

(If he’s a danger to others and himself, I might have to hospitalize him)

71,"I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I haven’t been professionally diagnosed with general anxiety, but I show symptoms of it. Before I started taking my medication, I occasionally got urges to self harm, but I never actually did it. Now I’m on Prozac and it was working super well for a short amount of time, but now it feels like it’s doing practically nothing. I just recently had my dosage increased from 10 mg to 15 mg because I thought it would help, but nothing’s happened so far. Everyday, I’ve been obsessing over cutting myself. I’ve never done it, but I keep playing with my box cutter as if I’m going to do it. I’m scared. I don’t wanna hurt myself, but when I get in a bad mood, I feel like I deserve it. I feel like I deserve to die, but I can’t go that far, so I just wanna hurt myself. The main thing that’s stopping me is that I’m scared of pain and blood, but that fear gets weaker with each day. It gets easier and easier to do it. I’ve been seeing graphic images in my head of me hurting myself and I don’t like it. I don’t wanna leave my room because being around people makes me feel angry, but if I don’t leave my room, I’ll probably end up hurting myself somehow.

It’s been a week since the semester ended, and I just feel like I need to sleep all the time. I realized that I might’ve been stressed out or full of adrenaline when trying to complete my projects on-time, and now that it’s over I’m resting up all the hours I lost to sleeping.

I’m just worried that this may become a bad habit, and make me depressed cause the days are shorter for me, and my sleeping pattern is all off. I have a tendency to wake up multiple times, or my body reacts to stress by coughing every couple of seconds, preventing me from falling asleep quickly. I also go to sleep either late on the evening, day 11pm, or early in the morning at 5am.

74,"So for the last two years of middle school I was depressed and didn’t have any friends. Freshman year of high school I was a lot more social and actually make 4 really good friends. My depression went away.

I kinda lost 2 of them because we had no classes together and don’t hang out after school. 

Now that it’s summer my 2 friends have pretty much ignored me and haven’t texted me. I’m always the first to text them but I stopped because I feel so needy. I feel like I put so much effort into friendships but it’s never reciprocated. 

I complement my friends when they put extra effort towards their appearance. Always comprise for them. But I feel like it’s never enough. I always feel like someone’s second choice.
During our good times, they make me really happy and fulfilled. I just feel so happy and content when we get along and joke.

All summer I’ve been home all day doing nothing but thinking about what I might have done wrong. I have a job which distracts me. 

I’m starting to show my usual signs of depression coming on. But why as soon as I feel lonely I get depressed? It’s like if I don’t have friends I immediately become depressed. I’m not sure why. How can I find happiness without someone else?",02Jul2018,2,

She has better things to do than listen to me whine about my problems and 2. I've brought this up several times and she just tells me I have to toughen up, and I don't want to keep bringing up my feelings and making her feel miserable for me. She probably wonders where she went wrong.

Thing is, I'm not sad all the time. It's just now and again I get upset and cry uncontrollably and then my mum asks what's wrong and I tell her that I feel pathetic and worthless and that I feel like everyone hates me, and she's just like ""don't be ridiculous, you're great!"" I can't see a therapist because I don't have time and also, I don't feel like this all the time. It's just every time something stressful or upsetting happens, I become overwhelmed by self loathing and pity. It's happening right now, I've been stressed about my mocks and now I can't stop crying. I'm scared she's going to see and it'll upset her and annoy my dad. I'm always letting them down by being sad and self pitying when I have no right to be. 

So I can't see a therapist because you have to get appointments, so if I'm having one of my sad moods then it's unlikely that it'll line up with the appointment.

76,"Hi, this is the first time I've sought any help or way to communicate the things I keep inside or what's been going on in my life, for starters I'm 19, I'm the only one in my family that's obtained a high school diploma, I tried going to college and failed miserably twice, I can't hold a job so I feel like a waste of space and a waste of food and water, I've always struggled with anxiety however I haven't delt with it for a while since I started using medical marijuana, but since this is day 4 of quitting using it on a daily basis it hasn't come back so that's a good thing I guess, however I've been stressed but then again not able to feel much at the same time, my mother's health is declining all the while her husband is abusing her physically and is constantly on meth, I've been with her these past few days to be a buffer not being able to get her out of here makes me feel guilty aside from moral support but that won't keep her from eventually fading away, she's only 37 so it's very depressing to see someone who should have so much life left be a total train wreck, some days the only thing that makes me feel life is worth living is my belief in God however most of the world is set on shattering that, a lot of times I spend most of my days cramped up in a small bedroom contemplating the fact that if I didn't have hope for something more I would blow my brains out or try to starve myself cause I hate the way I look even tho most say I look fairly decent, I feel stuck, any advice?",02Jul2018,1,
77,"It was an ordinary dream. The woman offered me candles that were not needed by another person, they also did not really need me, I decided to just help her sell them (because they looked very nice)

At the same time, my smartphone was buggy, it was unmanageable, it made strange sounds, launched various programs / videos. In general, it was a virus. And while I was repairing the smartphone.

 The woman suddenly began to wonder what was on my back. She began to rub her palm in the area of ​​my right shoulder blade and tried to show me what was there. And there was a line that crossed diagonally across the back. In the form of a tattoo pattern.

 Was very surprised, because I do not have tattoos. While she was washing this pattern, She said that because of this drawing, I might be sick. I also saw a photo of the person who did it. He is not familiar to me. But I tried to destroy him.

78,"I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and signs of depression for around 2 or 3 years now but I’ve never been diagnosed been to a professional. Recently I found my mind wondering towards cutting, burning and bruising myself as well as others. I’m constantly sleepy (probably from my allergy pills), have constant dull headaches, am strongly irritated by noise or light and am unreasonably infuriated by minor inconveniences. 
I want to scream and punch things but all I have energy for is silently crying and sleeping.  I hate feeling this way but I know that something inside me wants me to feel this, it’s telling me that I deserve it. 

Or have I just convinced myself that I have these symptoms? Am I just making all this up and telling myself that I’m mentally ill just to have an excuse to feel like shit, so that I can say that it’s out of my control and wallow in my self pity.?
Ever since I could remember I was a pathological liar, I’ve gotten better recently but I still sometimes catch myself out. I feel like it is very possible that I could even lie to myself.

TLDR: Am I mentally ill or just telling myself that I am? If I am lying does that make me mentally ill?",02Jul2018,1,
79,"Bear with me, I haven't thought through what I am about to write beforehand....

For starters, I will describe myself as succinctly as possible. Mid twenties male, recently got a bachelor degree, still live at home. Relationships: have a few friends, or rather, people I see once in a while and hang out with in some capacity. Some of these people live relatively far away so that is why I see them infrequently. Never had a girlfriend, or proper relationship. 

Life upto ages 15 or so was good. I am a fairly intelligent person, things came fairly easily for me up until age 15. In many ways. I think I am defintely an introvert, and fairly introspective, tend to think a lot, sometimes too much, but it can also help me figure stuff out and sort the chaos out in my head. Anyway, up until age 15 I had friends, I also had friendly interactions with girls, I think they probably found me cute and non threatening or something. But I had a small group of fairly good friends who spend quite a lot of time with.  
From age 16 onwards I have never quite regained that balance. Puberty hit (late) and I became destabilized. I became a very anxious, moody teen, suddenly socially concious and very aware and afraid of the whole idea of social hierarchy, and needing to fit in and wanting validation of some sort from others. I started ignoring my friends who I felt were in a sort of ""nerd/uncool"" category, and by associating myself with them it would reflect badly on me. This type of thinking came to the forefront and controlled some of my actions. I befriended someone who was a complete asshole, almost borderline sociopathic, and ended up getting teased a lot and this resulted in me closing off and withdrawing. Luckily I still had 1 or 2 people in the years following but I had damaged the relationship with one of my original friends, or rather I simply ignored it and acted like an idiot. So I wonder if he hates me now sometimes, I have 0 bad feelings towards him at this point, actually I never had any bad feelings only towards myself. Anyway, I became really socially anxious and withdrew from most situations. I avoided meeting new people. I had a borderline panic attack trying to speak to my crush. I met one other girl in a part time job who I liked, but was to scared / inexperienced to make anything happen. That was the last time I met a girl I remotely cared about.

Then I went to college. It was an engineering college (live in europe), and this matters because I feel that there is generally a rather narrow spectrum of ""type"" of person that attends such a college. I have not met anyone I really like in all this time. There are very few girls I am even attracted to just appearance wise, not taking personality into account. I have done extra curricular stuff like joining clubs etc. and doing that thing but I never liked it. I first majored in something more technical but I lacked the will to see it through, I did not really research it well going into it, and I felt jaded by the fact that there are 0 girls I care about, there is a sea of guys like me who can't get any girls, people seem to spend all their time there, they talk about nothing else, there interests are mostly predictable and boring, list goes on and on.  
I have one passion which is music. One person in music made me feel less insane, his name is Trent Reznor. He is a god to me. I owe my sanity to him and his music. I feel like we have a lot in common. I don't fucking fit in here. Or anywhere. I like cute girls, the types the hot guys like, but I am just a (moderately) skinny nerd, and on top of that, I am not very hard working or passionate about some academic or career pursuit. But I don't even think that matters so much, if I could actually for once meet a girl I remotely like, I am never where they are ever. And it is really not the case that I am just sitting at home all day. I have hobbies, I do extracurricular things, but there are 0 girls. My part time job - 0 girls. Try online dating, Tinder, get 0 matches. So then what? Well just become addicted to camgirls. But that shit sucks so you try to better yourself, but change never comes. I know what's coming to me, it is never going to arrive. 

At least I have consistently been running and I feel better because of that although it doesn't help my moderate skinnyness lol. 

I feel like I have tried in some ways. But it is not working. My biggest frustration is not having any option, any pathway, towards meeting a girl I am actually interested in. Like if the option existed, it would feel 100000x better. Don't have to seal the deal, just that if it felt like that possibility even remotely existed it would help. But I know I am difficult and not compatible with most people. My best friends were weird and so am I. But I don't give a fuck. I feel good enough about myself to know that I can get a girl. It is a logistical problem.

Bottom line: I need to find out what the hell I want to do with my life, and what I want to spend time on. I don't play video games. When I do , at least certain ones, I get heavily addicted. Haven't played since age 18 or so. But I have never filled that void if you will. I need something that I am enthused about that I can turn into a career. I am slightly ADHD and quickly get bored, maybe slighlty depressive too (well considering my love for Trent make that definite lol). I like hedonistic pleasures and like sex a lot and have a very high sex drive. But I need to do something productive and grow up LOL. 

Really bottom line: How can I found out how I truly feel about something, whether I truly like something or not, so I can make a clear headed good judgement on what it is I want to pursue, this time for the right reasons? I need to get it right but this MUST NOT come from a place of pressure / or be forced, because that sends me straight into depression.

80,"I’ve noticed that since I was young, each time I worked/studied with the same people or same set of things for too long, I become really sad and nervous and want to run away from it. 

Examples:
1. After spending 3 years in one elementary school, I couldn’t see myself going to middle school in the same area. I felt I would eventually fail to maintain my performance 
2. In college, when I worked on a research project for 1 semester (although I did really well according to professor) I became extremely nervous about working on it for another quarter. “Pushing it further” really stressed me out and I quit.
3. Since I started working, I’ve ran into this imposter issue at the 6 month - 1 year mark. Although all my reviews have been performing above average, I have this extreme anxiety taking on my next project, more so the longer I stayed at the team or company. I can’t stand people’s expectations and just want to run away from it all. And this isn’t a annoyance, I get physical symptoms like stuffy throat feeling through tough the day. None of my jobs have been longer than 2 years due to this.

But this thing has been happening, almost every night for a few weeks.

I will say goodnight to him, he’s sitting on the couch watching tv, and I’ll go upstairs to him sleeping in his room, seconds later. Takes me maybe a minute to get upstairs. There is no possible way for him to have gotten up that quickly, no shortcut. And it isn’t a dream or a nightmare, I’ve been fully conscious as far as I know.

83,"""Exercise!"" 

""Put yourself out there.""

""Keep busy.""

""Get therapy.""

I mean, I just exercised for an hour on Sunday and for an hour a couple days before that and it's just miserable. I don't get any kind of high after, and still I find myself unable to cope and hating myself. I've been in and out of exercise my whole life it seems. I always try to get into it, and at times I have even maintained it for months. But after a while I realise I am still miserable and it doesn't help so I stop. I have tried various modes and intensities of exercise too. 

I find working out just makes me feel gross because of how I sweat, and if I do it at a gym it sets off my body images issues/perfectionism. Plus with my OCD I worry very much about the exact way in which I'm exercising. I remember many times coming out of the gym just feeling really anxious and then cutting myself or something. Yet people obnoxiously tell you to exercise all the time, and say of course you feel miserable if you just sit around yadda yadda. Some psychiatrists and psychologists literally act like they have no capacity to understand nuance, the way they keep telling me to exercise. I explain the psychological spanners in the work it creates for me and how it doesn't help anyway; and all they say is I can't expect to get better if I don't try or they say studies show exercise helps - completely ignoring what I said to them.

And I have been to plenty of mental health support groups and such, and tried working, and I feel that just makes me feel worse because I compare myself to other people there and get very depressed when I inevitably feel like I don't fit in. I did like 24 weeks with Mind last year and it didn't help, despite their good intentions. Tonnes of people drop out of those courses/support groups too so I know it's not just me. Yet still people scornfully accuse you of not helping yourself if you don't just persist in going to these things. 

There are instances where I've put myself out there and I have felt worse as a direct consequence, and it is clear to me exactly why I feel worse and that I would not have experienced those feelings if I just continued to isolate myself. And I explain this to my mental health team and it's as if I am talking to someone who is literally thick between the ears. There is no consideration of what I said. Instead I am just told it's ""my choice"" to continue to isolate myself as if they are just too dumb to comprehend that their stock advice is not amenable to everyone. 

I have tried therapy also, and it has never helped. According to the received wisdom, I must not have found the Right Therapist For Me - as if people just \*know\* such a person exists. If anything therapy makes me feel worse because at the end of it I feel so demoralised for not having been helped by the designated treatment. It seems like therapy just amounts to asking me to reframe/reconsider my thoughts in ways I have already tried and simply not been able to.  Yet according to the received wisdom, therapy ""works"". And I need to keep trying for years and years. 

I could go on with examples, but do you guys get what I'm saying? I really feel like maybe it's best for me - and maybe some others - to give up on ""recovering"" and maybe just make the best of the life I have. Just accept that my brain is too broken to ever work or have a normal social life and just do what I can to stay healthy and get some form of meaning from life, even if that doesn't mean any kind of job or even any kind of aspiration for a job. I am just so exhausted trying again and again to get into some kind of ""normal"" routine and then having it collapse in on me. Maybe just wrap myself up in some kind of hobby/hobbies with all my free time - and do what I can to advocate for people with mental health issues. 

Plus, I have found that the longer I give up on ""recovering"", the more I get used to the aspects of life that simply cannot be for me and start to accept  them. Kinda rambly. Do you guys get me at all?",02Jul2018,2,
84,"This may sound crazy..but with my mom's side of family, grandma and aunts have ""mild undiagnosed"" depression (mental illnesses have social stigma in my country so ppl often do not seek medical help) and all my cousins have either depression/hikikomori behavior(self social isolation)/behavioral issues such as extremely rebellious behavior in children. My mom used to be ok but I'm pretty sure she has depression/or at least some kind mood issue but she refuses to get treated...

And for my dad's side, my grandpa had anger issues and would throw his child to the floor when he was angry, my uncle has anxiety and can't drive and his son has ADHD, my dad has anger issues/undiagnosed depression/anxiety and can't drive, and my sister has bipolar. Apparently some distant cousine in dad's family has schizophrenia and is locked up in a mental hospital.

How common is it to have almost all of your family/extended family to have mental illnesses like mine? 

So somehow I am the most normal one in the family... but honestly I am just one person and I don't know how to help out my immediate family and I'm also kinda scared that maybe I will get a mental illness too someday given the family history.

86,"So I was in the 3rd grade. When I was 3 years old my brother (who is one year younger than me) was diagnosed with autism. 

My school counsellor (who was new that year) pulled me out of my class to talk to me. I didn't find it weird because she did it to everyone to get to know them.

Off-handedly in our conversation I mentioned my brother and how I hoped he would talk. I think she had good intentions, but she said, ""The thing is... most people with your brother's condition can never learn to talk.""

That broke me. After that, I lost all hope. But recently I looked up all these stories and saw children like my brother starting to talk at ages such as nine, and I wonder that if I didn't lose hope, would he be talking today?

89,"TW: Self harm 


So I think I’ve been dissociating for about 4 months now. I feel sort of numb. Nothing really feels real, I don’t have a desire to do the things I love anymore; I feel as though I’m on a conveyor belt just going along, can’t do anything. Nothing really matters. If something bad happens I’m not too shocked like I normally would be. Stuff like that. Sorta feels like tunnel vision, or like I’m looking through someone else’s eyes. They’re also a tiny bit blurry. I feel extremely disconnected and even had a thought of self harming to see if I could feel it. Does this sound like dissociation? Or is it a combination of things?

Now over the last few years I have learnt I'm a very angry guy and I dont seem to be getting any better. I am angry for a multitude of reasons the top of those reasons is my mum, how she behaves towards me, towards my younger brother and how she treats herself. 

She hasnt had a job for many years ( now living off her boyfriend) im the only one ine the house with a job of any kind. 

Her partner has a lot of money that was left to him and she is constantly twisting him to get him to give her money or spend on her. I dont agree with that at all, they argue all the time and it has gotten so bad that they've scared my little brother and kept him off school because of their arguements and then lied to the school about why they did that. Yet every evening without fail as if like clock work there they are drinking and smoking away, i come in from work in the evening to find them like this and my brother upstairs, still awake and I get him into bed.

My mother and her partner are moving away at the end of this month and are taking my little brother with them, (This worries me a great deal) 

All the above is constantly floating around my head and has been for many years. Which when other things pile on top of them it becomes too much and I snap. It could be something at work or something my girlfriend says. 

I dont want my anger to dictate my relationship and paint a picture of a person I am not. However 98% burried in these thoughts on the daily as i have to be, I feel like i need to disconnect from my mother at the same time that would mean from my brother too. 

This all blew up today because after not coming home for 4 days ( no call or text from a worried mother during that time) i recieved a message from her saying i need to box up my things and have up until the 25th to find a place to live and if things are still there on that date they will be thrown. I have no moral, financial support from my parents for any kind.

My girlfriend says i am letting my life ruin our relationship and though i try very hard to not let it, i cant be uneffected by my life.

92,"I'm 16, completely clean no drugs or anything, I have been paranoid for months now and having hallucinations. 
Most of them are vague and I can tell I'm hallucinating, however sometimes they are very real where I sit there blink a few times to see if it's still there and then I'll rub my eyes and look back up and it will still be standing there, but I know it's not real only because it's too weird and horrifying to be real. (I've seen 3 members of the kkk, A face two feet in diameter wink at me and a scarecrow that evidently wasn't there). 
Sometimes I hear mumbling like many people are talking but I don't understand most of it. I heard claws running across my ceiling but I don't know if it was real or not and I heard someone shout my name even though it was 3:00 and no one was awake. 

For the most part I'm extremely paranoid and think I see things out of the corner of my eye and I'm constantly scared out of my mind at night. (The majority of my hallucinations happen at night)

I'm not sure what I should do. I'm hoping this will just go away or I'm hoping that maybe I'm not seeing things and I'm basically in denial about whether I need help or not.

93,"As of late I've found myself wondering if I ever really wanted friends. I've never been good at making them and growing up that really pained me because I desperately wanted close friends. But I've come to realize that I find friends annoying. Whenever they text me, I just don't really care and when they invite me out I find it to be a nuisance. I really don't know what it means and it kind of scares me because I feel kind of heartless. I feel that maybe I became this way because of my social anxiety but I'm not sure. Does anyone else feel this way?",02Jul2018,1,
94,"I'm a seventeen-year-old college student. I had depression for about four years (from the ages of about twelve to sixteen), and it was about as bad as could be. I wanted to kill myself, and I think the only reasons I didn't were a) I was afraid of the physical pain/discomfort that would come with it, and b) I had a tiny glimmer of hope that told me not to. Anyways, my point with this opening paragraph is that I've been there, done that, bought the T-shirt, yada yada yada.

So, it would make sense that, if I knew someone with depression, I would know if they had it and I would also know what to say to them, right? Right. It's true, I can pretty much always tell. They'll say something alarming, and I'll ask if they're okay. And I'm the *only* one who asks if they're okay. I don't care what anyone says; if people are gonna drop hints about their depression, then of course they're gonna want people to ask about it and acknowledge them. I know I did, because I wanted *help*. It has nothing to do with ""narcissism"" or the like. I understand that some people are just attention-seekers, pure and simple, but it still pisses me off when I have to go through a conversation like this:

Friend: \*makes a joke about their depression\*

Me: Are you okay?

Friend: I'm fiiiine.

All I do is ask if they're okay at first; nothing else until they give me permission, but I get shot down regardless and I don't understand it. I don't find depression jokes funny because - call me crazy - I don't think it's in very good taste to take the piss out of something that kills people. Yes, I understand that many people do like to make light of negative situations, but you should only do that if aforementioned situation is out of your control. Otherwise, you're just distracting yourself from actually dealing with the problem.

Also - and this one might be a tad controversial - THERE IS ALWAYS A CAUSE FOR DEPRESSION. I'm sorry, but if you come up to me and tell me you're depressed for no reason, then there's nothing I can do. I cannot help you to eliminate something from your life if there's nothing *to* eliminate. It doesn't have to be a tangible object or event (e.g. death of a loved one, trauma, etc); it can be a thought process (e.g. nihilism, spacephobia, etc), and that doesn't make it any less valid. You might not know what the cause is yet. Again, that doesn't make it any less valid. If you're just going to write it off as something that's ""just there"", then I'm sorry, but there's nothing I or anyone else can do to help you.

The thing is - and I know that, so far, I've probably come across as very bitter and perhaps a little cynical - I do care. I really, truly care, because I suffered for a long time and many people I know are, too. My issue is that they won't let me help them.

In conclusion, my advice to you all would be this: don't bottle anything up, stay honest/true to yourself, stand up for what you believe in and be a little selfish. I felt the need to say this because of my four closest friends, three are depressed and two are suicidal and I feel like there's nothing I can do to help them because they're never truly honest with me. It pains me to witness people making fun of something as horrible as this because it's only ever going to make people suffer more. This ignorant attitude is turning depression into a fashion statement which is why some people fake it.

I'm sorry for how long (and probably boring and maybe even a little infuriating) this was to read. I know this probably won't gain a lot of views/approval, but I had to say it so I could share my perspective and hopefully find some people who are on the same page as me about this.",02Jul2018,2,
