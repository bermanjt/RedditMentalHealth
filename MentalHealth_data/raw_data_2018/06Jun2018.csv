1,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I'm not really sure where else to go.

On April 17th, the bottom of my world fell out. The girl of my dreams left me because she just didn't feel the same way anymore. The following week, I lost my job and then 2 days later my closest friend moved to a different country.
About a month after me and her split up, I drunk messaged her telling her I miss her and I wanted to try again, just to see if there was anything left to rekindle inside her.
Today she told me she wasn't in the right head space for anything right now and may want to just leave it all again. This hurts more than the initial breakup. 
I've got myself stuck in a flat rental that me and her picked, I can no longer afford it and I don't want to be there even if I could, that was our place, not mine. I can't back out of the rental and there's no one here to support me except my cat, who we also got together and now I can no longer afford to feed her, she now eats better than I do.
Ive sold everything I have just to try and support myself, I've been for countless job interviews that have come up with nothing as no one wants to hire someone who looks like they've got nothing left to live for.

I know I'd never do anything stupid, it's a permanent solution to a very fixable problem, but I don't think I have the strength to put up a fight anymore, I've got nothing. I can't take my mind off of things because I have nothing to take my mind off of things with. I sold my skateboard, the one thing that gave me even a slight bit of freedom, just so I could replace the kitty litter and have something to eat for a few days.

My dad has offered to buy food for me but I don't want to be a burden on anyone, he's coming over tomorrow with food so food isn't an issue. The issue is I'm just a pain and I don't know what to do.

I just want to talk to someone who's been here, someone to tell me it gets better. I know it'll eventually stop hurting but I need to hear it from anyone who understands

Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this. I don't know where else to go ",06Jun2018,3
2,"Okay, To start off my names Carson and i‚Äôm 16, I‚Äôm worried i may have Anxiety and/or Depression. But i think it may have developed when i left my hometown and moved across Canada, Which was 2 1/2 years ago. Here‚Äôs my storyü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI had never suffered from (possibly) anxiety, I had lived there all my life and i was still hanging out with the friends i made in grade one all the way till grade 8, So they were like family to me, i didn‚Äôt care how i looked at all! i‚Äôm talkin sweatpants and baggy sweaters messy hair at school kinda stuff, but let‚Äôs skip that. Once i moved to Ontario, I was faced with the challenge of making totally new friends and being-You guessed it. Alone. For almost a whole year i sat in my basement and played ps4 with my old friends, I would often find my self sad and thought that i‚Äôd never meet new friends and ultimately i was angry i had to move, But at school and in public i was afraid to be seen, i know it sounds weird but i was constantly worrying about who was watching me or not to go near certain people because i knew they‚Äôd try to talk to me. I was also very self conscious and would wear sweaters in the summer,because i was afraid of my personal image, but i lost some weight so that‚Äôs not there anymore (thank god because that was one of my main issues that gave me severe anxiety).  i also would sweat ALLOT. like ALLOT.  Especially when i would have to talk to people or interact with them, i would get hot flashes and i would become intensely nervous. Now that i‚Äôm pretty familiar with people at my high school i‚Äôm doing better on that too, but i still find myself worrying about what people think of me 24/7, and as a post i saw below said, worrying about things such as crossing the road and worrying about if the people in the cars are judging me and that kinda stuff etc.   I also have a hard time with my anger and find my self lashing out when i get angry, kicking stuff,throwing stuff,breaking stuff etc but that‚Äôs only when i‚Äôm alone, in public it‚Äôs very hard to control and often i go silent. Like not a single word will come out of my mouth until i‚Äôm calm, or in school sometimes i find myself angerily breaking my pen or going into the bathroom and (literally) punching the utility‚Äôs off the wall. along with lashing out i sometimes become very sad and cry, Having hundreds of thoughts fill my mind, But it all subsides within 15 minutes at the most which i heard are all symptoms of BPD. I also have a very hard time at school with concentration and understanding subjects, And reading which is weird because as a kid i was supposed to be tested for being gifted, But never did and slowly as i went on in life by the time i reached grade 5 my grades were dropping drastically. im also lacking having motivation to even do the work, Or anything really in general. I often can barely get out of my bed in the morning for school, All i want to do is sleep and be with my girlfriend, which also puts a heavy toll on me because i often feel guilty for spending so much time with my girlfriend than my family. I also think i have some form of ADD because of that, And the fact i cannot sit still, i‚Äôm always fidgeting or bopping my leg, and i tend to go on for ages when it comes to talking. I know this was a very long post and i‚Äôm so very sorry, But i hope it was a good read and i can get some info as to what i may have, also i forgot to mention but i am deathly afraid of telling my parents this, I cannot talk about my feelings at all, i get very emotional and idk it‚Äôs just very hard i find. Thank you again ",06Jun2018,1

5,"Okay so whenever I‚Äôm out in public I always think people are probably thinking I look gross and ugly. I hate going out so I choose to stay in my room a lot. Despite people saying I‚Äôm a good person with good looks I feel like they lie. None of my family tell me this but I feel like the biggest asshole to them. I feel inferior because I grew out to be more sensitive and different. I‚Äôm 16 now, and these thoughts push me into episodes of deep thinking and suicidal thoughts. I have so many people that love me but I‚Äôd rather be dead much rather, but I can‚Äôt stand hurting people. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to live because I think outside the box way too much, and these thoughts usually come in periods of like 1-2 months and go away eventually but these feelings are much harsher now. Yet, when I‚Äôm with my best friend which is pretty much every day I‚Äôm immediately better. I know I have minor anxiety issues but one big problem is me thinking what if life was just a simulation? There are no good qualities I like about myself. I want to CS but I‚Äôm too afraid.",06Jun2018,1
6,"I really don't know how to put what im trying to express into words, but i need help and i humbly ask anyone who has been in a familiar experience to please help me. I was born as a result of drunk sex, with a alcoholic father and a bipolar mother.

 They broke up when i were 3 weeks old as my father drank excessive amounts of achohol and never came home. I grew up with alone with my mother, and i cant even describe how it was to not understand why my mother acted the way she did. One minute being praised and the next being told i was a accident that ruined her life.
Every time my mom scolded me i would be told these thing, how i should not be alive, that she is going to send me to my father and that she will put me up for adoption.

 I rememer experiences from my early youth where my mom would pick up the phone, acting as if she was talking to my father, telling how she would be ordering a plane ticket within the next few days. I can't even describe the fear and depression i this left me feeling, it was as if i had nothing. Someone who accidentally a survived birth control pill, ruining the life of another.
I lived in with her untill i turned 17.

i decited to move away for my 3rd year of secoundary school as i had a few friends in the city my Father lived in. 
i dont even know how to continue this post because im about to lose it and i just need help,  but ever since ive just been wanting to get lost, sedated and happy. ive eneded up in a spiral where im using all my money on drugs for a temporary feeling of well-being. I smoke excessive amounts of pot, i snort ritalin on a almost daily basis, i always drink until i cant take care of myself anymore, ive experimented with so much fucking shit and i dont know what else i can do.

 I have no feeling of self worth, i despise myself with every bone in my body, no matter how much i get told otherwise. i moved here and ive become populair, loved and people look at me as a great friends. 
But i just feel like its all a facade, i cant even relate to myself anymore. I feel like im nothing more than the shadow of someone greater. 
I dont even know what trying to to say here, so i apologize for my inability to explain what im struggling with. 

I just need help, i dont know what i want to hear, nor need to hear. But if there is anyone out there, even a single person who can slightly relate i just need some advice.

8,"Fortunately I'm no longer suicidal and I'm actually doing okay mentally. But in wake of Kate Spade's suicide, I'm noticing a lot of people sharing the suicide prevention hotline. Has anyone ever actually been helped by the hotline? 

Years back, I called because I was suicidal. They asked me, on a scale from 1-10, how likely it is that I'll kill myself. I said 6, and they told me to call back when I was an 8. I never called again after that.

11,"I am in my 30's, but and for as long as I can recall I haven't been able to connect with others. It is as though the brain will not strengthen the connections that should form between recognition and emotional response.

This lack of connection extended to my own family, friends, as well as my pets. I don't mean to say I am indifferent to them, but there is no emotional depth to what I feel. If I were to describe how I would feel towards them it would be ""familiar"". If I were to never see them again it would require an adjustment since the space in which they fit would now be vacant, but I wouldn't be torn up emotionally.

Case in point would be my friends. I stopped being interested in them in my 20's, and at this point in my life I have had nothing to do with them for several years. I'm not on social media or anything like that, so I literally have no friends. Yet it doesn't bother me in the least. I don't feel lonely, and I don't feel the need to go out and try to make friends.

It is the same with romantic relationships. I have never even gone on a single date, though not due to lack of opportunity. There were perhaps half a dozen times when I was asked out by one person or another, but I never took them up on the offer. I never felt the desire for that degree of closeness.

There has only ever been one exception to all of this, and that was when I was around 10 years old. It was a friend I had for a couple years before they moved away. The two of us had a real genuine connection, so I know that my brain *must* be capable of it, but it just won't do it for anyone or anything else.

As mentioned earlier, I don't feel lonely in my isolation, nor am I depressed (was seen by a psychiatrist recently to check it out). However I do have really strong dissociation (depersonalization/derealization). I'm thinking maybe one is causing the other - like either a lack of connections because nothing feels real, or the reverse where nothing feels real because of a lack of connections. Basically the world would lack any kind of emotional value, and therefore feels flat and unalive.

What do you think?

*Disclosure: I underwent several major surgeries in infancy and childhood, so maybe something happened during them to knock out that part of the brain? There is also a history of CSA by multiple individuals going back to my earliest memories. So I don't know if I could connect to people prior to either of those potential causes.*",06Jun2018,1
12,Old interests don't excite me anymore. I am scared to talk to old close friends and even family. I feel like I have nothing to say anymore and like I don't have my personality anymore. Help. I feel like I can't really feel emotions. ,06Jun2018,13

I mean the behavior is extremely common to how I react when in this hoarding home. I left for a few weeks and most of the symptoms vanished instantly. 

In fact if I go outside and then go back inside, it is like a night/day reaction. Going to a therapist is pointless because I forget the gravity of the situation (I am free! I have escaped!) and all happy on the dopamine rush.

Today my little sister(18 Y.O) forgot her notebook and I had to bring it to her. While waiting for her I decided to look through her notes because, well, why not? To my surprise, there were many unsettling drawings and doodles. I don't know if this is some normal thing, but I have never witnessed anything this extreme when it comes to doodling NOR do I know to confront her about it or not. Last week she was brought to the hospital after threatening suicide but her drawings make me think she has something more than depression? Am i in the wrong in believing this and who should i talk to?

17,"For the longest time I have felt empty, unmotivated, and just had a lack of feelings toward everything. That includes my family and friends. Don't get me wrong, I still like my friends, but I feel like if anything were to happen to them that I wouldn't be all that upset about it.

Not just that, but my emotions are weird to. Not much makes me happy anymore. I'm usually just emotionless or ""empty"". I do get an intense sad feeling randomly sometimes though out of nowhere. I was driving home a few months ago and out of nowhere wanted to cry. 

As I said i have a lack of motivation, I like to write and make videos/edit for YouTube, but I can't get myself to do it anymore because of how I have been feeling for the past few years. I can't play a game for more that 30 minutes without getting bored. The only thing that does keep me entertained is YouTube, but that's basically because that's all I do all day right now.

I am constantly paranoid of people. I have actually quit my last two jobs because I felt like my boss was out to get me. My first job I didn't really have any evidence to back up my claim, but my second one I did have a little bit of evidence, but I hadn't done anything for him to fire me, so I didn't need to quit, but me feeling paranoid like I am made me.

18,"To start from the beginning, around 3 months ago my wisdom teeth started coming in. My dentist just said to watch them and they might come in correctly. Then after they came in there was some pain so I went back. He said nothing was immediately necessary, but if I wanted they could be taken out as a precaution. Since I was about to go into the workforce I thought it would be a good time to get them out. I thought that it was required to have wisdom teeth removed. I decided to get a second opinion from an oral surgeon who recommended removal. A few days prior to them being removed I started reading about the amount of unnecessary wisdom tooth removals and decided to call my oral surgeon. He said they needed to come out since they were going to come down on top of other teeth. I was still anxious and wasn't going to get it done, but I was pressured by everyone around me that I was just overthinking it. Three days later I get them taken out and have a full blown panic attack after. My oral surgeon said immediately following the surgery. Well its good you got it done now, because you won't be back when you are 40. This was contradictory to what my understanding on the phone was. Now I am panicking that I made an awful choice. You see, I am missing two upper lateral incisors, and when I was a kid my orthodontist recommended pulling the canines forward to take the place rather than getting implants. I have a very pointy looking smile due to that. After getting my wisdom teeth removed I have noticed a bunch of space between my canines and the molar behind. This area I am afraid could have been closed to make room for my wisdom teeth. Then I would have a full 14 upper teeth like a normal person. I am now afraid that if I get a retainer to close the gap I will have too much space in the back of my mouth. It already feels like I have too much space back there now. I know this was probably unnecessarily long, but I think the amount of turning back points I had is important to note for how I feel right now. It is now three months later, and I have one or two panic attacks a week about making the wrong decision with my wisdom teeth. I have always had anxiety issues, and this is magnifying them. How can I stop feeling so horribly. Thanks for reading this atrociously written and unnecessarily long question.

TL:DR I got my wisdom teeth removed due to the recommendations of everyone else, and I know am panicking that I made a bad choice. I am already missing two upper teeth and I do not think it was a necessary surgery. Even though there is not anything I can do I have weekly panic attacks and feel intense regret.",06Jun2018,2

20,"Does anybody else get this???

I don't know why this keeps happening to me but even after getting my main depression treated successfully I get mini-relapses whenever I ejaculate. Preventing ejaculation with the 'squeeze' technique lessens the issue but that technique is tough and is no solution. 

Basically I get symptoms of emotional blunting, finding less pleasure in things, immense tiredness following ejaculation. And this lasts a while too sometimes days.

Its seriously a huge issue for me and I'm very very pissed off that I'm getting biologically triggered into this and that whenever I get these symptoms its very scary and anxiety producing and I am always concerned about how long they will last.

21,"I'm not really sure where this will go or what answers can really be given but I just feel so unreasonably lost I though it couldn't scream into the void a little. For the better part this will probably be incoherent rambles so I best of luck!

For reference, Im a 19 year old dude struggling with Depression, Generalized, and Social Anxiety. For the past few years I've started to break out of my shell, and regrettably I've been a bit look obsessed. Ive started to gain this admiration for fashion, and since have had the strange idea that I want to be a model (though whether that is an actual want or more so an internalized desire to be some sort of sex symbol is undetermined) This desire isnt that deep, but I'm sure it contributes to the issue. For the better part my problem stems from my personal idealism. For all of my education up till college I was focused on art, and was almost committed to going to either RISD or MICA (two big art schools in the US). Though in the end I chose a different path (right choice? maybe?) I still have this intrinsic obsession with beauty that in part was why I loved art. This ideal of beauty, however, is something that has started to corrupt my self image.

I stare at myself in the mirror with hatred most days, nit picking my skin, my clothes, my fitness. Its not that I am unattractive, or lacking in any of these things, but I just don't feel it. Regardless of the compliments I get (when I submit to RateMe in hopes of validation) I'm told I look good, 8/10 or some bullshit, but it still feels empty. Maybe because I don't receive the same (or any) praise in real life, maybe because I chalk it up to weird tastes. Whatever it is I just rarely feel right.  

I browse online clothing outlets, skincare advice columns, try to read health and fitness articles, watch countless videos on how to look better just to consume and try to feel better, but can never pull the trigger on any purchase cause I already feel to incompetent in my past to feel like any change I want to make is the right direction. Its stifling. I want to understand style, I want to feel like I could look good in that jacket but at its core I already despise my looks too much to feel like I can pull anything off. I try to keep a skincare and workout routine that given me a bit of confidence but the slow results and feeling of incontinence baked within me make it hard to keep at most days without feeling like I must be doing something wrong.

I know this is all very insignificant. That I should just work to recognize that I already have what I want, or at least am making strides toward it (so long as I push forward and keep up routines or commit to purchases) but all this negativity, fear, and anger has been swirling in my head so long that I don't even know how to start to make sense of it. I want so desperately to feel beautiful, but I lack the self efficacy to know hows to pursue , or see that in myself.",06Jun2018,1

24,"I always thought I could go to my parents for help. We used to get on quite well, that is until around 10 months ago when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 
My parents would make jokes about me, call me fat etc and I had to confront them with my disorders and how they were affecting me, which I got shut down for because I was ‚Äúdoing it for attention‚Äù

Months down the line I was put on anti depressants and referred to therapy because my parents saw me as an issue that could simply be fixed by someone else. They shoved me in counselling because they didn‚Äôt want to deal with me, I was the ill daughter who they didn‚Äôt want to talk about. I never went out with them, I stayed at home and Mum would post on Facebook about their days together causing me to feel extremely lonely.

I tuned to self harm first, as it was something I had done in the past. I‚Äôm not proud of it but still it‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do when I‚Äôm angry or upset. My boyfriend and counsellor know about my self harm so I can talk to them about but not my parents. My mum saw it one time and grabbed my cuts making them bleed even more and screamed at me that i was attention seeking. 

I recently finished my counselling sessions and the first thing my mum said when I got into the car was ‚Äúso I won‚Äôt hear any complaints from you? You‚Äôre all fixed?‚Äù This was the most heartbreaking thing she had ever said. 8 sessions and she things my problems are fixed. This is the type of person she is, she‚Äôs so nasty.

Earlier this year I tried to kill my self 3 times. I tried to overdose on my anti depressants but my boyfriend phoned me as I was doing it. We have a little code where if I‚Äôm upset I send him a certain emoji and he will drop whatever he‚Äôs doing. He saved my life for the first time. 

The second and third time were both with my boyfriend. I tried to jump infront of two trains. I remember running to the ledge with my boyfriend screaming behind me, pulling me back not knowing why I was doing it. Looking back now it is the most selfish thing I have ever done. He is the most supportive person in my life and I love him with all my heart.

Last night I told my step dad that I didn‚Äôt like him because of the way he treats me (that is a story for a different day) and he got defensive and started telling me he hates me etc. I couldn‚Äôt keep it in anymore and told them that I‚Äôve tried to kill myself because of them as I say there streaming with tears. I thought they would comfort me and tell me I would be okay but no. They laughed in my face and told me ‚Äúhere we go again, you‚Äôve said it all before‚Äù. They proceeded to tell me I belong in a mental asylum locked away so I‚Äôm not w danger to them/anyone else. At one point they were talking about kicking me out the house.

It‚Äôs the next morning and I‚Äôm physically broken. They‚Äôre all ignoring me and pretending that I don‚Äôt exist. I had to vent about this all and maybe even let people know that if your parents are dicks like mine, you‚Äôre not alone

26,"Hi. I posted something similar in the relationship sub but sort of feel like it's more of a mental health issue.
There was a big competition for the highest grade in a very tough final year class that lasted the past year and my boyfriend (27y) got in the final three out of about 250 and I think there's a good chance he won it. I can honestly say that I am happy for him with all of my heart, he works so hard and he completely deserves it.
Some background - we've been dating for three years, we're very solid, we're moving in together next month, wanted to earlier but wasn't financially possible. We're in the same class of a super competitive graduate programme, 3 out of 4 years. 
My feelings - I don't think I'm jealous. However, I'm so disappointed in myself for not doing as well. I feel like he should be with someone smarter, better, prettier, the whole fucking deal. We never usually discuss grades and school and I've done fairly okay until this year where my GPA and everything took a massive hit. It was a tough year, most people went down from Honouring to Passing. It got to the point that when I did poorly in an exam I ended up cutting myself, which was dumb and stupid, I get that. Clearly I have issues with failure/underachieving.
At this point I've lost my sense of self worth and I don't understand why he's with me. The idea of breaking up with him breaks my heart, he's the most wonderful person I've ever dated and we definitely have a future together but I feel like for his sake I should so he can be with someone better.
Talking to him about this is not an option, as this problem is not about him, it's about me. I can understand why it would be a suggestion - openness etc. but all he would do is tell me I'm being ridiculous, list a bunch of things he loves about me, which I really don't want to hear because he doesn't know the half of how shit I actually am and I don't want him to see me as someone to pity.
While I wish therapy was an option, it's not. It's too expensive privately and the waiting list at school is 10 months. I'm not dropping out of the programme either, we're nearly at the end now, a lot of people are in a similar mental state. 
I feel like I'm holding him back, I feel like he should be with someone better in every way. I've made every effort to be super positive about his amazing achievement and I've been so supportive so he has no idea about all of my other thoughts, because I don't want to take away from his thing in any way with any sort of negativity. 
Because I don't want to hold him back and I know I have shit to deal with myself, should I consider breaking up with him to spare him? He doesn't need this.

27,"Hello.
Ever since I was about 10 years old, I started noticing a small, but slowly advancing feeling of pure emptiness and lack of enjoyment out of, well, everything. Nothing traumatic ever really happened during my childhood, so I don‚Äôt know how it started. When I was about the age of 11, my parents started falling out and arguing constantly, which definitely didn‚Äôt help things. I used to have extremely strong emotions around that time, worried that my parents would start getting into psysical fights. My mother always had a drinking problem, and my father used to cheat on my mother a lot as well. This happened for about 3 or so more years, before I just became utterly desensitized to it. I also used to play video games with friends and greatly enjoyed it, but I noticed slowly I was enjoying it less and less, not that I was getting bored, but just a general feeling of numbness and indifference was starting to form in place of joy. This also affected normal activities, recreational or not. I started faking my enjoyment whenever meeting up with friends in real life, and with my parents so they thought I was happy. I didn‚Äôt want them to worry. Now I am 17. I‚Äôm not sad. I don‚Äôt feel suicidal. It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt feel, well, anything. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. I don‚Äôt feel happiness or sadness from anything. I‚Äôm not shocked from gore or anything that would shock normal people. I have zero sex drive. I have no empathy anymore, for anyone. It used to be that I could still feel small amounts of emotion, even just on rare occasions, but now it‚Äôs just nothing. My mind feels like static. Everyday life feels like hell, it‚Äôs just constant suffering knowing that everything has no meaning to me anymore. I don‚Äôt want to end my own life, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can deal with this empty feeling. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep up this mask of normal life I put on to make my friends and family not worry. I would go to the doctor to get this checked, but my family is ridiculously religious and i know if I bring this up they‚Äôll just think it‚Äôs the devil or some fucking bullshit and won‚Äôt allow me to. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I feel like I want to just cry but I can‚Äôt.

TL;DR I feel no emotion, no empathy, and every day it‚Äôs a constant suffering that I can‚Äôt escape.",06Jun2018,1
28,"I'm still awake, apparently forever, so I may as well talk at the Internet. Maybe I'll learn something. That used to be fun. And my girlfriend has been decent to me for the most part, so maybe I owe it to her to try to unfuck my brain, even if I don't see the value.

We had an argument. She thought it went on too long (I take breaks to keep a level head, and I also can remain upset with someone without considering the argument active the entire time), said she was ""putting her foot down,"" and from now on either things got resolved immediately or they didn't get resolved at all. I said, okay, if we're throwing away all the progress we've made towards more effective communication instead of just devolving into shouting, well, we've had a good run, and it's unfortunate that it's come to this point.

I don't know if I meant that. Think that would require me to feel something, in order to remember the feeling from a few hours ago. But I've got nothing. Lying here, I'll run through people who should probably provoke something--my mom, old teachers and professors, the rude manager at my shitty service job where I pretend to care about all kinds of trivial things, a friend I've deeply admired for years--and I'm hollow. Minor sense of duty to a handful of people who've cared about and for me. No ill will really, but not anything else.

I probably sound pretty cold, if not full-on bitch. Normally that would hurt or bother me, and I'd worry about if it was permanent, but my lack of humanity isn't very interesting either.

Maybe I've had to suppress too many things and my brain's like, fuck it, begone with all of it. Maybe I've been trying/pretending to care about too many things. Maybe dealing with a chronically depressed person who has gradually desensitized me to the possibility of a breakup fucked me up. Every falling out, every ridiculous small-minded person who demands exactly seven ketchup packets, I slip deeper and more easily into apathy, and this time I don't mind.

I probably owe it to some of those people to have a soul and not merely fake it, and if I regain it somehow, I'll probably want to not have spent very long without it. I'm still way too awake for midnight, but I suppose I'll quit here. I might never come back to this post, which I have a tendency to do, which means I'm probably back to normal. In the meantime, this is my weird-ass contribution to the wonders of the internet. Throw some useful ideas at me or don't, as you see fit. May your endeavors go well.

I wish I never existed. I don‚Äôt know who I am. I‚Äôm lost in a world of fake smiles and love. Something I‚Äôm beginning to think I‚Äôm incapable of feeling. It scares me I don‚Äôt understand it.

30,"Hey reddit this is my first post on this site.. so hi there! I would just like to start by saying I'm terrible with words so please bear that in mind when reading this. Also this is very personal to me

I am currently 27 years old and engaged to a lovely fiance. I also have a temporary job to bring in some income.

Anyways i came to reddit because i hope someone somewhere will read this and offer some insight or advice.

Bit of background: I am adopted first and foremost. My mother was 14 when she concieved me and my father was 17(i think)  at the time. My mother did not want a kid at that age which is totally understandable so i was put up for adoption.
That same week i believe, my now parents addopted me into their lives.
Well they devorced when i was about 5 years old and i was stuck in between that process. My father would constantly manipulate me by calling my phone(i was 10 at this time) and telling me over the phone that i'm a cunt and that my mom was a cunt ect. 
My mom did not treat me with reapect either. She would constantly throughout my whole life(yes even now that i have moved out) belittle me and make me feel like shit. Nothing was ever good enough, it was always about money and she would always bring up her financial status to me while i was still a little kid growing up.

When i was 13 i was a bit lost emotionally. I ran away from home twice that year and i remember leaving a note on the counter before i left that night saying stuff like""im going away to try and make money"" something along those lines.(its been a while please excuse if im not specifi  about the dates and whatnot. Im terrible at constructing cohesive sentances).
It was also at this age when i started to pick up smoking and have been a smoker since. Terrible life choice.
Now throughout highschool my parents would always find some way to fuck with me or make me feel bad. Like in a narcissistic way. Belittleing me and whatnot.
Got my nose broken by a guy when i was 16. He believed i hit his girlfriend and that same day he was driven off in a police van because this girl of his only ""dreamed that i did it"". So that was fun getting beat the fuck up for absolutely no reason.

Skip ahead to when im 21ish. I met my now fiance and things where going good then. Had a couple of friends that i liked. I noticed sometging about myself that year, almost like an introspective moment and i realised that i need help mentally as i was one depressed SOB.
I went to the hospital and they put me on ritalin at first. Now this seemed to work at first but quickly faded. My doctors werent helpful and just refered me to a mental hospital for diagnosis. I got diagnosed with depression, add and anxiety.

I took the meds and again i felt as if my life was going to get better. Only lasted fot a year. Now being 27, i am on
100mg sertralie
2.5mg ativan
10mg rivotril and
40 mg ritalin oh
And 25mg phenagrin.

These last two years have been hell for me. I cant focus, i cant commit to doing something, i get impulsive desisions then back out of it when im 20% in. I feel like shit. I have constant thaughts of killing myself to make the anxiety go away. All i have is my fiance.
I have no friends
No family(anymore)
All that brings me joy in this life is my wife and playing games on my pc/ps4.

But even now that is being taken away from me with my fucking anxiety and add. I cant enjoy games anymore. I cant enjoy life anymore. I want to relax and just play like and rpg but i play for like 5 mins then i feel i need to restart and create a new character. It has ruined so many games for me so now im worried that all i cherish will slowly go away and i will die alone.

Can someone give me some tips here? Feel free to ask me anyting that you are not sure of in my post. And if you made it this far, thanks. You are my fucking hero.

Sean.

31,"When I was very young, maybe 7 or 8, I would sometimes have these extremely strange, repetitive dreams. I would fall asleep, and then something really simple would play like a loop over and over again.

I have a clear memory of when this happened ‚Äì I was sleeping in a hotel and I was half asleep (or had just fell asleep), and then I dreamt of like two kids running around a swing or something. And they would keep on running, and the dream would be playing like a loop (like a 5 second video playing on repeat). I woke up crying and screaming and even after I woke up, I still would have the image of the loop playing in my head.

I don't know what to think of it because it's so strange, and might be related to OCD but I don't know (definitely not an expert on mental health).

I'm asking about this because I've noticed that similar things happen even now when I'm 17. Sometimes really gruesome, vivid thoughts come into my head and start playing on a loop. The other day, I thought about veins (which are off-putting for me), and imagined a bunch of veins being ripped, and the loop kept on repeating (I was awake in the car). Even typing this makes me cringe because I hate thinking about that sort of thing.

I feel betrayed. I feel a similar sensation to the feeling of being cheated on. I feel SO upset and it‚Äôs not normal and it‚Äôs unfair on him for me to get upset cuz it means he feels reluctant to do things he NEEDS to do (ie sort life stuff) 

we‚Äôve always had a bit of a problem that we get in some kind of argument before he goes places without me (like going to see his friends) or even when I‚Äôm going too. I don‚Äôt even realise I‚Äôm doing i but the pattern appears to be some kind of way to try to stop him/us going even though I wouldn‚Äôt do that and even though I do feel like I don‚Äôt want him to go I also don‚Äôt want to stop him.

34,"I have a feeling I should leave this place, this country. I feel paralysed by others opinions of me and am scared to run into someone I know on the street. This paralysis extends to the entirety of my life. I practically don't leave the house, as soon as there's something that needs to be done (i work from home as a web dev), I start getting tiny stings of panic and a feeling I'm not good enough and that there's no point to even starting to work since I'm going to fuck it all up anyway. So I spend most of my time getting toked up and playing games. 'Cause I can't fuck that up, it makes me feel ""ok"" and it takes my worries away. I completely understand that's not a sustainable way of living and I want to be able to provide for myself instead of relying on my parents for help. I've repeatedly tried to make a schedule and force myself to stick to it. Yet I don't. And it makes me feel like an even bigger incompetent piece of shit.

I don't want a label on my forhead, I don't want to think I'm even more ""less than"" than I already feel, I couldn't bear getting a fucking diagnosis directly telling me I'm incompetent and even weirder than I already feel.

35,"And what is wrong with me?

I woke up in morning. ( It was in March this year. ) When I went to kitchen I said hello to my father. He replied. I could see that he is in bad mood. When I went again to kitchen he told me that I stole his money. I tried to prove it, but he didn't want to believe. I went to my room. I felt humiliated, angry, sad, and i felt lack of justice. Later I went to kitchen. I told my mother that he told me that I stole his money. Then I took his arms too put him outside of house one, of two hours just too see how I feel. But my mother was thinking that I want to beat him, and she tried to stop me. He felt on floor. I put my hand around his neck to scare him. Then he stared to scream: help me this thief will kill me. He told that i am thief and murderer in one sentence. I was so angry and humiliated that I totally lost control. I spat on him and kicked him in stomach. I left kitchen. Then I went again to find his wallet, or box where he hides his money. I was trowing stuff everywhere, but I could not wind it.

Sometimes i think that I maybe did it, because he was beatin me whan I was kid. he was beating me, my sister and me when I was 4, and it all stopped when I was 14, 15. I kicked him when I was 14 or 15. I do not feel guilty for that.

 I am 30 and he is 60 now.

But I feel guilty almost everyday because i kicked him and spat on him. It was in March. My life totally changed. before that i was learning some foreign language, something about science for job, ( i do not want to say what language and what science ). I was playing and learning guitar, making music, almost finished albums i wanted to release, but now I feel guilty and dirty every day. I am not learning anything anymore, and i am not playing guitar and making music, i am not looking for job and girlfriend because i feel that i do not deserve it. When I start to do I enjoyed before I start to feel guilty. Before that I was working on my self, I wanted to become successful, but now I am doing nothing to punish my self.

I told him that i am sorry, but he do not want to talk with me. Even if he talks with me, i would feel same, guilty and dirty.

I wish if i didn't lose control this day. Life would be much better. But now my life sucks and i know that i deserve it.

Some people say that I should visit psychiatrist. They would report me to police, and it will make things more complicated, because i will be unable to find job. No job = no money. Without money i can not help my parents.

I wish if there is time machine to undo what I did. I would also try to help people who died in accidents.

37,"Hi  all,

I wanted to be entirely transparent and ask your opinion about whether you feel this is something that could help you. I'm a Doctor that has a mental health youtube channel and i'm trying to work out whether an idea I have is something people want to watch. 

Essentially the channel has been set up as I'm entirely aware that accessing a doctor in many MANY countries other than mine (in the UK, although even still then) can be tough. Hence I wanted to try and bridge that gap as mental health is an area of interest of mine.

I've noticed so far that many of the people who watch my channel are young and typically in school which is very saddening. Many of whom have been too scared to tell their friends or family for fear of what response they may get which is all too common and understandable. 

The video would be on 5 steps on how to tell your friends and family about your mental health as, in my experience, there are certain things that would be worth doing to make sure you have the best chance for a smooth chat and a positive outcome. 

I'm not here to name the channel and solicit subscribers, I'll be honest and say that I still haven't worked out exactly how to market my channel properly which is a little frustrating as I would like to think they can help a number of people \- although its not my opinion that counts, its yours. Hence this post.

If you could please let me know down below I would be very grateful. You would be helping me a lot. If you have suggestions about which subreddit is better for me to post this then that would be greatly received too. Many thanks!",06Jun2018,0

Using the NHS (UK health service) [website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bipolar-disorder/symptoms/), I'll post all the symptoms of depression and mania I   

DEPRESSION:

* feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time
* lacking energy
* difficulty concentrating &amp; remembering
* loss of interest in **everything**
* feeling worthless
* extreme pessimism 
* self\-doubt
* difficulty sleeping
* suicidal thoughts

MANIA:

* can feel particularly happy at times \- which makes the depressive periods harder
* talking very quickly that I either lose my train of thought, merge my words or jumble my words
* can be particularly perky (energetic)
* can get sudden, unexplained inspiration for new poems that I write
* easily distracted
* I put off sleeping

When I do feel happy, I can jump into a depressive state whenever, it could be a short time or long time and vice\-versa. Therefore, if I do have Bipolar, it would be rapid cycling, right?

41,"Some people with Bipolar ""Depression"" will never understand their own illness.  The profession of psychiatry is partly to blame for the fact that most people are miseducated about serious 'mental'  illness.  The terminology ""depression"" and their characterization of ""mood disorder"" are roots of the problem.  The media does their job to spread misunderstanding, often referring to someone having ""battled demons"" or struggling with ""mental health issues"".

This article is written by an expert on the topic of Bipolar suicide:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/take-charge-bipolar-disorder/201705/chris-cornell-when-suicide-doesn-t-make-sense

This was a superbly written article, but even so, it is possible that many people will still not understand.  We are conditioned to think that suicide is caused by extreme sadness and despair brought about by difficult life circumstances.  It is extremely difficult to break out of that mode of thinking to try and process some other conceptual explanation.  Many people who begin experiencing symptoms of Bipolar ""depression"" will try to make sense of it by attributing the dysphoric feelings to some acute stressor in their life.  This is where widespread misunderstanding of the disorder is so very dangerous...because people just do not know what they are dealing with and won't seek treatment.  Also, because of the deep-seated problems and ideological infighting in the world of psychiatry, some diagnosed people still do not understand their own illness.  
One note about the article:  The writer may or may not realize that someone who temporarily lacks insight (anosognosia...a neurological condition) due to acute psychosis will not be able to carry out a plan to save themselves.  Even psychosis is not what most people think it is.  Psychosis is not psychological detachment from reality...it is a neurological detachment.
Some advocates are calling for what are called psychotic disorders to be reclassified out of the mental health system because they are not psychological/emotional/behavioral disorders (although they certainly affect emotional expression and behavior).  Bipolar, Schizophrenia, and other brain disorders that can cause psychosis are really neurological disorders that involve abnormal neural/electro-chemical abnormality in the brain and should be treated and insurance reimbursed under the mainstream medical health system.  Reclassification would not only help the general public to make progress in understanding these neurological disorders, it would lead to better access and reimbursement to treatment.

46,"Where do I start? 
I‚Äôm a really fucked up Canadian person (F 21), I was abused sexually and emotionally when I was a child and developed severe depression and anxiety when I was around 12. It was hard to shake and I still struggle with it (21 now). My mum had an affair and moved cities without telling me when I was 13 and left me with my depressed dad. Then my dad found a woman who doesn‚Äôt like me, he has been with her since then. She has her own children who she obviously likes better. I was in therapy for four years and then my therapist stopped seeing me because of insurance and when I reached out about a year and a half ago she didn‚Äôt respond. I reached out to another therapist in August 2017 because I was in one of the darkest places of my life with wanting to kill myself. The other therapist never responded after I emailed and left voicemail. 
I have never had many friends. People don‚Äôt like me. I used to self harm on a daily basis in high school and through early university. Now last night I self harmed again for the first time in almost 2 years. That‚Äôs where the story of ‚Äúhelp, what the fuck do I do?‚Äù comes in. 

My boyfriend and I met when we were in grade 9. We had crushes on each other but it never really went anywhere until the summer after grade 10. We are still together now. He is the one person who knows everything about me and still loved me and looked at me like I‚Äôm not a fucked up and broken person. 
We‚Äôve been together for 6 years. Until now. 
A couple of years ago he fell out of love with me and had emotional affairs (and kissed this one woman a few times, but no sex) over the course of a summer while he was out of town. He broke my heart. But we both united and decided to fix things and after that things got to be better than they were before about 8 months later. 
Then a few months ago now we started talking about having an open relationship because we are each other‚Äôs only partners thus far. We have long discussions during which I have sex with one woman once and another woman twice over this time of a couple months. He was jealous but worked through it. I also was flirting with another man over text messages and my boyfriend found out and saw the messages that I proposed potentially having sex with the other man. He was angry because we hadn‚Äôt officially agreed yet that I could have sex with another man. We had only discussed the possibility. After the ensuing fight I cut off contact with the other man and haven‚Äôt talked to him since. 
My boyfriend wasn‚Äôt actively looking for someone, though I encouraged him to get Tinder and find someone. He didn‚Äôt want to get Tinder, which I understand. 
Then he was going out of town for two weeks for school and we agreed that we would be allowed to sleep with other people. I had sex with a man while he was gone and told him. It broke his heart. He was so upset. I fucked up so bad. But it gets worse. I told him after the first time that I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with him again and then I did have sex with him on two other occasions that week. My boyfriend has asked me many questions about the sex and how it was. The absolute truth is that it wasn‚Äôt that great. But the dude was really kind to me and we got along well.
I tried to hide it because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him but he got the truth out of me eventually, I think this is called a ‚Äútrickle truth‚Äù as it came out bit by bit. 
I deleted all of the text messages with the other guy so my boyfriend couldn‚Äôt read them and find out about the third time. I cut off all contact with the other man a few weeks ago and blocked his number and wanted to move on. My boyfriend was really angry that I deleted the messages. Things have been fucked up since then. He has been trying to forgive me and I have been working extra hard to be forgiven. He has been getting me to ‚Äúrepent‚Äù in a way by giving him a lot of oral sex for the past two weeks (we have had a D/s dynamic for many years). He will get me to suck him off after he talks to me angrily and I‚Äôm crying. He calls me a little whore and stuff (part of the role play). Then he usually will not feel better after and I feel even worse about things. 

Yesterday everything came to a head. We woke up at 5 AM and he confronted me and asked me if there was a third time we had sex (I had told him about the second time at this point). I told him everything. About how I met up with the other man with the intention of breaking things off. I told him about how during that meeting that we couldn‚Äôt see each other anymore and then we had a few drinks and slept together. My boyfriend asked the dates and read the messages back to me that I had sent him about how I wouldn‚Äôt see this guy again and how I was so sorry. 
He doesn‚Äôt believe me now that I‚Äôm sorry. I am though. I don‚Äôt know how to explain the self hatred I feel right now towards myself for hurting him. I fucking hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I wish I could take it back. He says I feel bad just because of the consequences of a potential breakup but that‚Äôs not true at all. I‚Äôm still deeply in love with my boyfriend and don‚Äôt want to lose him. I don‚Äôt even fucking know why I would jeopardize our relationship. I‚Äôve always been scared he would leave me and I put myself in a position that basically ensured that he would want to. 
Yesterday we went back to our house where we live together and our pet had died and I wept for her and for the way everything else is tits up right now. We buried her in the garden and went back inside. We started talking about our relationship stuff. Then I sucked him off for a long time. Then he said I should leave and go stay with my dad for a while. (I don‚Äôt want to stay with my dad, but I‚Äôm here now. I‚Äôm not very wanted in this house, as usual. I don‚Äôt get treated very well). 
Then last night I went to a movie with my dad and sister and I got out of the movie to a text message about how I have been very toxic to him for a long time, throwing the cheating of a couple summers ago in his face (I don‚Äôt think I have, I have been upset about it here and there and brought it up), unilaterally manipulating him into nonmonogamy, ultimately cheating on him in a way worse way than what happened a couple summers ago, and how I showed no remorse except for the consequences. How he‚Äôs not sure that he can stay in an abusive relationship like that anymore. 
I am fucking crushed. I had no idea that I was abusing him. He said that I have been cruel and manipulative for a while now. He might be right and I just don‚Äôt have any idea. He says he hasn‚Äôt broken up with me officially. I am waiting for it to come. 
I cut myself last night in the bathroom a lot, cut up my leg and cut my forehead. I was so distraught. I sobbed for hours. 
How does one show remorse? I am remorseful he just doesn‚Äôt believe me. 
I love this man so much. We have gotten each other through some dismal times. What the fuck do I do? 
How do you come back from being such a shitty fucking person? 
I just want to kill myself and leave everything. I‚Äôm supposed to finish university next year and do something with my life and my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer a couple of months ago. Help me. I don‚Äôt know what to fucking do. I‚Äôm dying inside. I feel like I‚Äôm losing everything I have worked hard for, including the only person who treats me like family. I thought we were going to start our own family together and get married eventually. I fucked everything up. I‚Äôm so sorry. I hate myself so much.

I can't jump rope, throw an accurate punch, and my kicks look like they're being thrown by Michael J. Fox. Obviously, I am going to be bad at this since I am a newbie, and I shouldn't expect myself to be even remotely as proficient as the members who have been training for years and years.

HOWEVER, my ego refuses to let me accept my lack of skills, and I end up getting really frustrated, embarrassed, and angry with myself. All of this compounds and I perform even worse than I was before, making me even angrier.

48,"I can't speak for Kate Spade, but I can tell you my experience as a creative with bi-polar depressive. The support out there is slim and the process of getting it is like trying to run through sludge while carrying a boulder. Mental healthcare in this country is a joke!

I've seen all sides of mental health from growing up with brother with a traumatic brain injury, losing him last year to suicide after he was bullied by his own support staff, and from being committed only a month ago from not being able to cope. 

I've called countless psychiatrists and can't be seen because they either don't return my calls, aren't accepting new patients, or don't accept my insurance. It's bull shit. Even after being committed, I can't get help. I had a psychiatrist who never really saw me, prescribe me a bull shit pill (Abilify) that he was paid to hand out like it was candy and not a psychoactive drug. And then, after a month on it, he wouldn't even authorize it to be refilled. So, I had to quit and I'm currently in the thick of terrible withdrawals and the worst part of my depression.

50,"I'm in my mid twenties. I've been experiencing very unstable moods and intrusive thoughts for what is probably the last 6 to 7 years. 

Being real, I've had a lot of issues since long before this time period, but I'd say the last 6\-7 years are when I began thinking something was actually going on.

I feel like my cognitive abilities are slipping (Memory/ability to focus) and I'm becoming more unstable and disorganized. 

I have good health insurance, and I've been trying to find a psychiatrist/therapist using PsychologyToday but...I don't know, I'm having a lot of difficulty. 

I can't decide if I'd be more comfortable speaking to a woman or a man, so that will have to be trial and error I guess.

 Beyond that, every option seems to be a much older person, in their late 50's to 60's. I see these peoples profiles, and honestly can't help but feel that they will be judgmental and not at all someone that ""clicks"" with me.

52,"During the day on 6 June 2018, I felt really alone, useless and worthless. I wanted to have a girlfriend ‚Äî and it should be a pretty one too. I know I am really greedy and thick-skinned ‚Äî ok, I am sorry. I have mental illnesses and I don't even have a job, so how can I even think about having a pretty girl as my girlfriend?

That's when I tell myself that I want to find a job, do the job well, and get paid ‚Äî it doesn't have to be a lot; a few hundred Singapore dollars would be enough. When I have the money, I can go and lose weight. Hopefully when I lost the weight, I can become thin and slightly more better-looking. Hehe, will I be able to attract pretty girls??? (@_@)‚Äù

There is an exercise programme today (empowerment programme by OcTAVE Outpatient Rehabilitation Centre). I drove to Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Singapore in my father's car ‚Äî I couldn't take public transport... When I drive, I am really sensitive. I keep thinking that other drivers already noticed me and reacted to me, like pressing the horn at me; overtake me at the front; leave the current lane when my car approaches from the back, directing high-intensity driving lights at me from the back. I am really struggling ‚Äî these thoughts almost consumed me. I hoped these thoughts could go away on their own and left me forever ‚Äî I am really tired of having these inner struggles/demons consuming me.

I reached IMH. I was a bit late ‚Äî I should had gone out from my house earlier. Everyone was waiting at the office of OcTAVE (there was air-con). Luckily, the programme had not started.

For the exercise programme, we would exercise in the gym beside OcTAVE. I took off my dark glasses and earphones and I started to become suspicious that others are trying to bully me. I felt very alone and helpless too. I felt like I was fighting my psychological battle on my own. I was sensitive too. I kept wondering if the staff managing this exercise programme knew about my condition or not.

Should I challenge myself and try joining new empowerment programmes? I am so envious that people can talk freely without fearing others will bully them.

I made a friend there. I decided to join the same empowerment programmes as him. He taught me how to register for an empowerment programme in the office of OcTAVE. The exercise class (empowerment programme) is full next week (Wednesday). I am only left with Monday's and Thursday's empowerment programmes. Damn it!

I also made another friend through this new friend. I am happy that I made some friends, but the fear that others will try to bully me is still there. I left these two friends ‚Äî I told them that I drive so I can't take public transport with them. I need some time alone to recover. My kind side arose and my violent urges to hurt other people started to lessen.

I returned home. A few hours, my younger sister and her boyfriend came to our home. My sister had been staying out in her boyfriend's house because of me ‚Äî I had been having relapses these few days so she was really afraid of me and didn't dare to stay at home -_-‚Äù

It got really bad last night where I woke up screaming, and while falling asleep I heard music playing while still being in my room and noises and my mother was there but when I opened my eyes she was gone and that's just the beginning of a long night for me.

55,"In the past, for many years, I would hear something close to a muffled array of many voices like people in a small crowd calling for me. It's always intelligible speech so I'm never able to pick out any words. When I was younger, these voices were louder and more chaotic and I would be unable to sleep\- sometimes sitting up in my bed and rocking back and forth uncontrollably and chanting unintelligible things until my mom came in to stop me. Those stopped when I was about 12 (thank god). Then I have instances that I'll feel as though someone is watching me even when I'm alone in a room or my house.

Only recently, last week, did I hear a single voice that was so distinct that it sounded nearby and it's speech was as clear as day. 

It was about 2 am. Everyone in my house was asleep except me. I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I suddenly heard someone say in a half\-whisper ""Go to bed."" My bathroom is connected to my room and the voice sounded as though it was by my bedroom door. I thought it was one of my parents but as I paused there and assessed what I'd heard, it sounded nothing like either of them. 

I walked out of my bathroom and towards my closed bedroom door. Midway there, I heard a light thud on the door from behind it along with the sound of someone brushing against it. I then locked my door after that because I became paranoid that there was someone in the house. Even if there wasn't, it made me feel safe. Even so, our house is securely locked and burglaries are unheard of in my neighborhood. 

Anyway, I ask my mom the next morning if that was her at my door, since she tends to wake up in the middle of the night, and she told me it wasn't. I called my dad and asked him the same thing and he told me he didn't wake up until 4 hours later at 6 am. They were both surprised by my story and dismissed it as my hearing things.

The thing is, the voice was too clear\- it sounded too real that I almost answered back to it aloud. The thud afterward was something new as well since I usually don't hear sounds besides those of voices.

Do other people get this? Is it just my mind pulling tricks on me? It's just weird to think that I could imagine something like this and be so startled that I lock up my room and my heart starts to race.",06Jun2018,2

57,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for about 2 years. When we moved in together, he left the suburbs to come with me in the city. Although the suburbs are super easy access and not very far from us, he doesn't really often go there to see his friends, and they rarely come to the city, except to go out. They aren't really the kind of guys that just comes to your place to hang out, they are gamers who prefer loafing at home. When my boyfriend was in the suburbs tho, he used to see them at least 2-3 times a week to play videogames or to go outside and play hockey or skate together.

It's been about a year since my boyfriend started feeling empty, bored, angry, and tired all the time. Although he doesnt really show any other symptoms than this, I'm wondering if that could be depression. His self esteem seemed to have lowered, but you really wouldnt notice it if you didnt know him very well, so maybe its always been like this and it was just harder for me to notice it at first (cus he seems like a pretty confident guy).

He's had the same work schedule since about a bit less than 2 years, without taking any vacations. We do have one planned for September though. 

He often goes to bed late, because he is gaming until late at night, and has to wake up at 11 to go to bed. On his days off, he could sleep for 12 hours +++.

My boyfriend stated in the past that his father was an army guy, and that he would slap him or tell him he's gay if he would express any emotions or cry, which makes him really uneager to share any of his thoughts and prefers keeping everything for himself. 

But recently it looks like it got worse, especially during winter. He cries from time to time and tell me that he doesn't understand what he is feeling and why he always feels empty. He doesn't understand his emotions and what he is going through. 

He's not really looking to go see a therapist but I would love him to. I really wish to help him get better but I cannot help, except by supporting him, if I dont know what is going on. 

He aknowledge that he is very sad, with a really short temper, always grumpy and extremely tired all the time. Our sex life is basically dead, because he is always tired. He gets mad pretty often for nothing and it is starting to have an impact on our relationship. He often has those moments when we're not really doing anything but he just becomes really aggressive, like he wants to punch something, but tries to keep it in, and lets me know like ""i dont know why, but im feeling very angry right now, so just dont talk to me until it goes away"".

58,"I have trouble with worrying too much and becoming paranoid.

School is a big problem for me because I strive to do the best, so when I get one bad grade, it's like the end of the world. I become depressed for days, crying uncontrollably on the first day and being unmotivated. I start to jump to conclusions about terrible things that could happen and how I'll never be successful\- how I'm stupid and I'm a failure and I don't try hard enough. I then end up thinking ""What's the point?"" and want to kill myself. I only get so far in that I just think of ways that I would do it. I have never attempted.

The other day, my laptop gave me the BSOD and I went ballistic. I had a small panic attack and was crying for hours trying to figure out how to fix it. The suicidal thoughts started to come on even then as I felt hopeless. I ended up fixing the problem and feeling so dumb for overreacting. It sounds pathetic and embarrassing just talking about it. Even when I told it to my mom, she couldn't even take me seriously and scoffed at my telling her about it.

Why do I do this? I feel like it's dangerous because I legitimately feel like there is nothing to live for in those moments. But when I look back at the situations, they always end either on a high note or not as bad as I expected them to. I have thought about slitting my wrist or taking a bunch of pain pills to kill myself but never could because something in me stops me and I start being scared. So I'm stuck in this irritating feeling of wanting to die but scared of the act of killing myself. But I know that if there was an option\- like flicking a switch and I would die\- I would take it when I feel suicidal.",06Jun2018,1
59,"First of all sorry for bad english, I am not native

Please help me figure out what is wrong with me. I am 17 and whenever I get really sad/angry/frustrated its like I'm a different person. I completely change, I get so sensitive and weird, i get almost autistic or schizophrenic tendencies. I can stare at a wall for 20 minuets and just cry (I can cry for hours), have no control my thoughts are everywhere and nothing feels real and I'm so numb but sad at the same time. I'll change personaility too, I go from can't stop crying and screaming to acting psycothic, smilig and 'being childlike', like I'll talk in a childish voice or do typical childish stuff and talk to myself in voices. Other times its just like I'm floating, like I have no control. I can just stand against a wall or lay in my bed and my body will start making weird facial expressions or body motions and nothing feels 'real'. 

If someone were to get mad at me, things get even worse. Today is my birthday, I have no friends therefore no one said happy birthday to me. My brother died a month ago and my parents are always tense. I was trying to talk to my mom (while being weird and emotional) and my dad suddenly freaked out and started yelling at me. He was all up in my face and I couldnt feel my heart and my mind started spinning. He was so loud and so angry at me for acting like this. Which I get now, but I literally can't even begin to explain to them how I feel. Everytime he gets mad at me the same though goes through my head 'I'm gonna commit suicide for real. I'm gonna commit suicide for real. I'm gonna commit suicide for real. I'm gonna commit suicide for real.' I easily get suicidal in these situations. ¬®

This doesnt even explain half of the emotions I feel when I'm really in distress, it is so bad and I hate it so much. I want to be normal and I know this is not.

62,"I am really struggling to process the loss and emotions. Our relationship has been derailing for about 4 or 5 months now, but between the stresses of work and my dad being in the hospital CCU for the month of January I was too blind to see it.

About a month ago My wife of 10 months left me. After being in a relationship for almost 6 years with each other. Before the wedding we did premarital counseling and I thought our marriage was on track to be an amazing thing.

Our relationship has been through a lot over the years, including her sexting other guys online and sending them nude pictures, which I forgave her of while dating and while married. It has been through me briefly entertaining the idea of being with another woman that I was flirting with. It has been through me looking at porn.  She forgave and forgave me, and wanted me to get help which I refused to do.

Our arguments had been getting worse and worse prior to her leaving me. She says she is done with being hurt emotionally and wants a divorce. I have overwhelming evidence that she is and was actively cheating on me, and definitely having an emotional affair if not a physical one. She denies this and claims that they were not dating until after we were separated.


About 2 1/2 months ago she started spending time with another guy, with a cover story that she was spending time with her sister and her sisters ex-husband. (Sister is back together with ex) It turns out this was a completely different guy she was spending time with, going on camping trips, day trips, overnight trips. They were using my truck to basically go on dates and adventures. About a month and a half ago they crashed my truck into a ditch and not wanting to deal with repairs as it was previously damaged I agreed to sell it to this guy thinking he was basically her brother in law. When he was not. This contributed to some of our arguments.

About 4 weeks ago she left me to go on a road trip with a female friend and a week later I found out she was leaving me for good. From all the evidence and observations I have made it seems that she is either couch surfing, living with this guy in his truck (different truck), or living in an RV. 

I want to repair things with my wife as we are both at fault, and she is the love of my life, but she says she is done, that she has been hurt emotionally too much., and she refuses to to go to counseling. Citing that I didn't want to when she wanted to. I am completely blindsided by this as she has always talked about how she never wants a divorce, and anytime I brought up the possibility of breaking up or divorcing she was extremely resistant to the idea.  

I don't understand how this new guy seems appealing as on paper he is way less stable then me. He has a criminal record.  I have been the primary breadwinner and the only driver. My wife has a Mild intellectual disability making it hard for her to find employment or get a drivers license. Basically her only responsibilities were cooking and housecleaning, and one of her reasons for leaving is that she didn't like feeling like my personal maid.

That might have been a long back story, but I am looking for advice on dealing with my emotions and this loss. I have no diagnosed mental illness. Overall I would say that historically, I have been pretty mentally healthy myself, aside from becoming increasingly more frustrated and irritated with my wife over the past 3-4 months. I am willing to own up to my mistakes and get counseling with her. I feel myself becoming obsessive about their relationship, and hoping it will end, i feel like she is rebounding and it isn't a valid relationship, I feel hurt and discouraged. I feel at fault, even though looking at things logically I know that the fault is shared. I feel like I could be slipping into depression. I have been trying to use every skill that I know to regulate my emotions.


I am also really worried about my wife and her mental and physical health as it seems she has been making a lot of impulsive choices. She has a mild intellectual disability, but I think there is more going on that hasn't been diagnosed. She was always super clingy in the beginning of our relationship. She would say things like if I left her she would kill herself, or if I died she would get lots of cats and name them after me. I also was told by a friend of her new boyfriend that she is really clingy. 

Is there anything I could do to help my wife?
I wish we could reconcile, and wonder if that would be reasonable if she at some point did a complete 180 and cut ties with her affair partner and if we both were willing to get the help we need dealing with this... but in the meantime I think I need to focus on dealing with the loss.

66,"Hi guys,  
So here's a little bit background on the topic I'm about to discuss. I've had depression, anxiety and maladaptive daydreaming disorder( Mdd) for several years. I've been meditating regularly (more or less), doing some microdosing and trying to turn my life around for the past few months. My depression and anxiety are now mostly under control but I'm still having trouble dealing with staying in present every once in a while, although my focus has improved drastically over the last few months.

On a good day, when I feel refreshed, I'm motivated to do as many things as possible and end up getting a lot of shit done.  
Now, here's the main thing. On days that I'm extremely tired, having little sleep or none, I end up losing most of the control I've gained over my mind. I become depressed, completely lose interest in talking to anyone and start dreaming around to distract myself. 

I cannot even begin to look at my work because I have zero motivation at that point. As such, depression takes over and I just wanna curl up into a ball and forget about life. 

Now, since I can't just keep on taking off days because it greatly affects the change that I'm trying to make, is there a way to counteract this situation so that I can at least get some stuff done on days like these, because everyone ends up having days when they are tired as shit but still need to get work done?

I get up, I do some chores, get ready for work, do some of the contract work, go to my dayjob, get home do more household chores, do some contract work, wrap up for bed. My living space looks like a crack addict lives there between periodic cleaning sprees when I can afford to stop for it, can't seem to justify the time. Sat/Sun I do 8 hours of contract work each. The contract job can't pay my bills or offer insurance. I just can't juggle anymore. My efficiency with my time has gone down the shitter.

I'm starting to realize I don't want anything out of life. I just want to sleep forever. I'm tired of dreaming, I'll take dreamless sleep. Then there's no painful reintegration with reality in the mornings.

Now here's the fun part: I'm wasting a shitload of time and can't seem to control myself and it's impacting my contract job. Several hours per day. I can't afford to waste that. The real problem is it's not efficient. Reddit, shows, dicking around on the internet, sometimes reading, rarely painting. I'm becoming increasingly late, unreliable, etc.

If you gave me a solid day off 100% to myself... I literally don't know what to do with it other than ""wow I could really use that time for my other job"". Then I'd proceed to dick around and get nothing done other than get pissed at myself and feel less rested than when I started. Then the cognitive bias kicks in and I'll bitch about not having enough time for anything or myself. See it? It's in this post even.

Why can't I make good time of free time anymore? What's wrong with me? Shouldn't I jump into things I ""really want to do"" with passion and feel great for it? Why am I not? Why don't I have passion for anything anymore and just bitch about not having time while squandering whole hours per day? Why can't I be 100% efficient with my time all the time? Why can't I bounce between two jobs even even if most weeks I'm not hitting 60 hours? Why can't I afford to move out, save for retirement, pay off my loans, eat food, and have anything left for myself when I'm working two jobs?

In the last year I've tried: St Johns Wort, Passion Flower, GABA, 5-HTP, NAC + choline + racetams, multivitamins &amp; B-vitamin complex w/ magnesium, CBD, and even microdosing both with weed and later with shrooms. Not all at once, I gave these all a 1-2 month trial. You know what works? Drinking. But I don't have time to get drunk. St Johns Wort kind of works but really fucks with my blood pressure even avoiding all my favorite foods you can't have on it.

69,"I don't know what is going on but I'll try to describe it as well as possible. So basically it happened to me again and its second time this week. I took a nap, and I woke up breathless, couldn't breathe at all, feeling like I have something heavy on my chest. Tried to scream or move but I could barely move, then I forced myself to fell of bed and crawled to the doors. But when I opened it I woke up again, seen my friend walking in to the room, talking something and I couldn't speak nor breath, same like first time. And it happened couple of times until I woke up for real, feeling exhausted and breathing like I just came out of water drowning. Seems like sleep paralysis, it happened to me couple of times when I was 16-18 but for almost ten years I haven't had it, and now it's happening again, but it's different and seems much stronger.

73,"My sister and I have been close. I've always noticed she was accusing others of stealing things. Everyone steals, accordingly to her. 

In 2016 our mom was placed in hospice care. My sister is a nurse. While my mother was on her dying bed, my sister administered a shot to mom. I questioned her about why...her response, I wish I would have thought about it earlier. The next day, our mom passed. 

Fast forward...our dad had renal failure, requiring dialysis. My sister lives about 125 miles away. She would come get our dad, every time he went to her home, he was admitted to the hospital within 24-48 hours.  Her attitude and personality became standoffish. In March 2017, dad died in hospice care while he was visiting my sister. She refused to tell us which hospice center he was in. Once I called every center, I finally found him. He had just passed away. 

6 months later, our oldest brother died while visiting her. He too all of a sudden was in the hospital, then hospice, then he passed. Again, she refused to let us know where he was located. 

I am not accusing anyone of anything but all this feels so wrong. She changed wills, took power of attorney over our dad. Now she has taken everything. I dont care about the things lost. But I do think something is wrong mentally with my sister. 

She always caused conflicts between people. Telling lies on each party to the other. Now that she is not in our lives anymore, we have talked and realized what was happening. 

She always ""saved"" our parents with each medical issue. Is there a mental issue that has been diagnosed with these types of behaviors?

74,"I can't eat others food and drinks including at restaurants for over 15 years. I have to prepare and cook it myself. I started turning down food and drinks from friends since I was about 10, stopped going to restaurants around 15.",06Jun2018,1
75,"I‚Äôve never put this into words before but I am going to try...

To start, I‚Äôm a 31 year old male living in the UK. I have a relatively successful career, a partner of ten years (currently engaged) and a have nice home in a nice area of the country. I have no kids(although I would like them in the future) so my time out of work is my own to use as I please. I am healthy, have had no seriously traumatic events in my life and I have no family/money troubles. Doesn‚Äôt sound too bad right?

The problem is I feel so down, demotivated and seem to be always beating myself up. I always think whatever I‚Äôve done is not good enough, whether it‚Äôs work, arranging a day out or speaking to/spending time with friends. These feelings have made me feel very anxious/insecure to the point where I dread social events, spending time with friends and interacting with others.

It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt feel good in myself, which makes me not want to see people as I will be worried what they will think of me. This in turn makes me feel worse as I worry that people have picked up on my feelings and may start to think I‚Äôm miserable/weird/too difficult. I‚Äôm then always looking needy as I try and seek approval and reassurance everything is OK and that people like me. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and I drop deeper and deeper.

There‚Äôs lots I want to do and achieve in my life but I just keep thinking ‚Äúas soon as I get over this feeling I will do...‚Äù as I don‚Äôt want to do it until I feel good in myself and maximise the experience. Unfortunately that day never comes and now I‚Äôm really worried that my life is slowly passing my by (falling deeper and deeper again). I‚Äôm worried about starting a family or going on holidays etc as I worry about not being in the right state of mind.

I work for an automotive manufacturing company. The job can be very stressful but there days when I really enjoy it and I know people would love to have the job I do and the perks that come with it (good salary, job security, pension, company vehicle etc). I get to the point where my mind cannot rest, thinking about the million things I have to do to the point where my brain becomes scrambled eggs, forgetting simple things and my thoughts feeling foggy and unclear where I cannot focus on anything for longer than a few seconds. My inbox is always full and there‚Äôs always something else to do. There‚Äôs then the work politics with colleagues etc which I just find so tiring and exhaustive but there‚Äôs an expectation to always have that ‚Äògame face‚Äô on.

I then get home feeling absolutely shattered where I just want to either play video games, browse my phone or watch tv to try and switch off.  The problem is, those things I talked about earlier then never get done and I‚Äôm stuck in that cycle. I then quite often log on to work at home and try and do as much work as I can to try and minimise the anxiety about going in the next day. The problem is the work level never seems to go down. I look forward to every weekend as an opportunity to catch up, restart and put a plan together, but I then just feel like crap, try to block it out and then Sunday comes along and nothing has changed and I‚Äôm dreading going into work while hating myself for not being able to achieve what I wanted.

I‚Äôve also recently found myself worrying and becoming hypersensitive about everything else in life, even if i know I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I worry about wars, economy, famine, child cruelty, animal cruelty, global warming, homelessness, even just walking past someone who looks sad. I sometimes find myself thinking about them for hours, days or weeks, and how powerless I am to it and how I feel guilty trying to lead a normal life or feeling like I do when these terrible things are going on around me. It‚Äôs since reached the point like I say earlier about how I worry about bringing a child into this world as I‚Äôd feel guilty for subjecting them to this potential pain and suffering.

I find it difficult to talk to my partner about it for some reason, as if I‚Äôm shy or it just feels really awkward despite loving her and being together for so long. I‚Äôve considered talking to my boss at work about the stresses at work and how I feel but I worry I will be judged, have a ‚Äòblack mark‚Äô next to my name, be considered as weak and have people talk behind my back.

Going back to my first paragraph, I feel like because I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòreal‚Äô reason to feel like this that I won‚Äôt be taken seriously and I even beat myself up about feeling this way because I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have anything to worry about.

I‚Äôve felt like this at times for pretty much all of my adult life. It‚Äôs definitely got worse over the last few months and I worry that I will always feel like this...

I went to my doctors who said I just sound like I need a holiday?!

Does anyone else feel similar or have similar experiences? Is there any advice anyone can give?

Anyway, I‚Äôm sorry to go on. Thank you for anyone that read this as just writing down these feelings feels like a big step forward...",06Jun2018,1

82,"I'm a 16 year old female from the United States. My family has been mentally and emotionally abusive my entire life and I feel as if it's going to paralyze me in the future. 
My parents have always took pride in raising me and my siblings  a ""different way"", but as young adults we are very emotionally dull and socially awkward to a concerning degree.

My father is obsessed with having a Nuclear Family and being the complete leader of our family. All our choices depend on him, even if it seems ridiculous. If we fail a course in school we are yelled at very loudly, usually resulting in me specifically having a panic attack. We are all scared of my father. We grow nervous from the sound of his loud boots hitting the floor, his voice, or his bedroom door opening. One time I got bold and said I how much i hated how he abused us, and he pretended i wasnt real for a whole week and I felt very guilty, so I apologized. His behavior still persists. 
Also, maybe I'm just saying this part out of disgust for him, but I just want to mention that he takes pride in saying ""I'll run this place like a concentration camp"" and ""Fathers whose kids arent afraid of them are irresponsible"". Seriously, I think living in prison is easier than living with him. 

My mother has always been a lax parent, but a complete pushover because of my father. She always takes his side no matter what. She always says how I'm manipulative of her and how I'm a waste of money (she usually says this after I ask to be driven somewhere or if I ask for a snack from the grocery store. I never actually demand for favors, which confuses me a lot on why im ""manipulative""...). She loves embarrassing me on front of friends by calling me a snot nosed brat and occasionally venting to my friend about how much she doesnt want me, then writes it off as a joke later on if I bring it up.

I really, really, really want to know how to NOT let this interfere with my transition into adult life. I cannot get a job because I am scared of employers. I have been scared of asking teachers for help because I'm afraid they'll see me as incompetant or stupid. I'm scared of facing most adults and people above me, really. It's a very disabling anxiety I have, and sometimes I feel as if I'm always going to be this way. 

So.. does anyone know how to break this mold? Please? 

P.S. my parents don't beleive in therapists, psychologists, and pills because they think that if I go to a shrink or take pills they'll look like bad parents.

Yesterday my therapist diagnosed me with severe major depressive disorder and mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder. 

Yesterday and today I feel like I‚Äôm in a much bigger rut than usual, especially after I felt like I had been making progress lately. It seems pretty linked to the diagnoses.

85,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always talked to myself because I found it fun to act like a different personality and have the two personalities converse with one another. Over the years, however, it has turned into a bit of a habit. So much so that I sometimes just can't focus on what I'm doing because of the active conversation I'm having inside my head. 

These days I'm not really conversing with myself with a second personality I just sort of talk to myself. Well, 'think' to myself? I don't say anything out loud I just do it inside my head and also say something back to myself in my head. 

This has gotten to the point where I can't sometimes even think straight because of the nagging thoughts. And sometimes because of this conversation, I find myself not being able to comprehend things as fast because I'm interpreting information in the form of a conversation. Someone would tell me something and then I would start a mental conversation immediately and go back and forth to try and decipher what it means and the whole conversation would be needlessly long with proper sentence structure and everything sometimes (because apparently a proper sentence is more believable as a second personality than just thoughts) when I could have just as easily come to the conclusion myself without there needing to be a whole conversation about the subject! Am I going crazy here? This also causes me to lose focus in a conversation and sometimes keeps me up all night.

89,"I accepted a new job this week working in a dog kennel.  I enjoy dogs and have my own, she is a service dog.   
As you can guess by the existence of said service dog; I have health issues. She is mainly a psychiatric service dog but has learned some minor mobility work I use on an as needed basis.   


I am absolutely dreading going to work again, I've worked at horse barns for the last 6 years ending in September last year.   When I was working those jobs I felt exhausted and worn down constantly. I have a condition where my connective tissue is faulty so I have hyper\-mobile joints, get hurt easily, am slow to heal, suffer chronic fatigue and chronic pain. These are on top of mental health problems; anxiety, depression, ADHD inattentive type. I quit my last job because I was going to college and had to move but I also hated it, I only worked about 12\-15 hours a week and still felt absolutely wiped.  College has not been working out well for me and I haven't had a class there since fall because I had such a hard time getting though the classes. I took medical leave and was set to start classes again this upcoming fall. But my family has been pushing me to find work.   


One of the places where I go for the occasional dog training lesson (service dogs are never done training) asked me for a resume because they were impressed by my work with my dog. They offered the position I accepted (why...?) So here we are again with me dreading a job before it has even begun. I didn't think I was going to get the job, I started planning to try to take some light summer classes from my college and was actually exited for school for the first time in a while (perhaps only exited about the idea who knows)  


The reasons I have issues working and attending school are because I struggle to complete things in a reasonable time if at all, work was physically demanding school was mentally, and I was constantly in pain. And I was miserable, doing the same thing over and over day after day was probably worse than the physical pain it caused.  I cant do repetition, I don't know why but I get worse each time I have to repeat something.    


I'm not even sure I should be doing this kind of work but i'm not qualified for anything else. Its mostly janitorial with some dog training, play and customer service worked in. My doctor doesn't want me doing physical labor jobs again, But a desk job would drive me up the wall, I cant pay attention to something that long and even when I can I have brain fog.  I am also not by any means a morning person...the job starts at 7AM (I was not told this before today)  


I think this ended up more of a rant than anything, but I do feel better having said it. I am really questioning my life decisions here.  


TL;DR: I accepted a job at a dog kennel and am feeling intense regret for doing so. Mental and physical health problems make school and work very hard for me. I am on temp leave from my college and my family has been pushing for me to find work. I have worked the last 6 years at horse barns and was miserable for a lot of that. I feel like these issues are going to come back and that perhaps I shouldn't even be doing this kind of work. ",06Jun2018,3
