0,"For context, I have anxiety and ADHD. I recently began taking antidepressants to treat my anxiety. I have already been taking ADHD meds before I started taking the antidepressants, but they weren’t affecting me because the dosage was too low (which is why its okay for me to take the antidepressants and the ADHD meds at the same time. For those of you who don’t know, ADHD meds and antidepressants have contradicting intended effects). I dont know if the symptoms of these meds include something anger inducing.

Its christmas eve and a discussion began. It slowly turned into an argument and my family seems to always belittles me, interrupt me, put words in my mouth, take my arguments out of context, etcetera. After a a couple minutes of this I was getting very aggravated because of the previously stated things (that my family do to me when in an argument). Therefore I decided to go to my room to calm down and to relax so I wont get uncontrollably angry, but when I stood up and announced it, my parents were quick to demand me to sit down in a fairly aggressive manner (a consequence of my haste to leave the dinner table). I stand there and tell then why I hate arguing with them, but I obviously am demanded to sit down and I eventually must before my parents begin to yell. As im about to sit down my brother begins to pick at me, knowing it will make me angrier. I obviously get angrier. I don’t remember what happened next but all of a sudden im calling out all of my family members and telling them all the things i despise of them. I was speaking to them with such disrespect, it was as if they weren’t even my parents and instead some stranger on the street picking a fight. Then somehow I ended up threatening my father and brother, telling them that ill beat them to pulp (i am taller and stronger than both of them, so at the time my threat seemed fairly genuine). My father then stands up and says hes going to call the police. Out of anger, I obviously encourage him to do it along with telling him that ill beat him “straight to hell” (yea I know its bad). My mother steps in and tells him to stop and so he does meanwhile my brother is standing in front of my parents covering them because he thinks im going to beat the shit out of everyone. I then went to my room to calm down, and I do my thing. I try and talk to myself to comfort myself and I try to take deep breaths, but I usually end up crying. I usually start crying not because of whatever it is that happened, but because of things from my past that haunt me.


(dont know why I wrote this but I just felt the need to) I love my girlfriend. I love her so much. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I cant imagine myself with someone else. She is the fruit of all that is beautiful in any possible way. I love her, I love her so much that I can feel it physically. I can feel this sort of ember in my chest. It feels like something is burning in my chest but it feels good, it feels so good and I only feel it when it comes to her. I just really wish she were there to calm me down because she knows how to do that very well. I love her.

In conclusion I don’t really remember much but I was very very aggressive and antagonistic. I don’t really know why im posting this, I guess this is a form of venting. For whom ever read this far, you’re at the end of this post. Thank you for reading, merry christmas, and I hope you have a good day.",25Dec2018,1

Okay, so lots of things have happened..I don't know why but I feel the need to push my freinds away and play with their feelings, I enjoy this honestly. For example: I was crying one day in need of someone to talk to, I reached out to one of my close freinds who I'm slowly losing contact with, I was crying for a bit and stopped, but I played as if I was still crying. So I typed in the texts with spelling mistakes and took time to type, to show as if I'm shaking and struggling to type, And I told him that I was suicidal, when I wasn't. He said that ""I would kill myself, if you kill your self"", that was so amusing to me. I was like ""tell me everything's gonna be okay"", and he said so, It was funny to me.  
And then the next day I said that I didn't want to be a part of his life. He was so mad and hurt and we argued alot, but then he started to ignore me. I  was so scared that he might leave me, I didn't want him to...I just can't help but play with people, I didn't expect them to react like that. I said that I'd slit my thighs if he doesn't reply...but he just called me ""stupid""

8,"First off: I realize reddit is not a place for proper medical consultation. The title is sort of short-hand for what I'm really asking here. Honestly, I'm almost certain my grandmother would be better off if she actually got an appointment for this, but she's in her 80s and not likely to be convinced of this fact. As such, I'm trying to gain some insight into how me and my family can best support her throughout her remaining years.

My grandfather and her husband of 50+ years nearly died after years of disease. He was in a nursing home for the last 4-5 years, and his health gradually declined. With it, so declined my grandmother's mental health. Not surprisingly, of course, but the problem is she was already ill. Now she's a menace to the few family members still close to her, and they're retreating from her one by one. In a way, she's doing it to herself, but it's still terrible to watch. It makes me think of a wounded animal lashing out at those trying to help it - confused and unable to see the helping hand for what it is.

Additionally, the death of my grandfather has led to conversations where I learned a lot of family history - and how my grandmother's issues seem to stretch further back than anyone living can remember. In the following few paragraphs, I'll go into some detail in the hopes that someone will recognize some pattern that I can't see.

##Hoarding

For as long as I can remember, my grandmother has been very careful not to throw away things. She neatly folded plastic bags and put them in cupboards and drawers. Rotten food was always thrown down a little hill outside the house so as to feed nature - despite our country having pretty extensive systems in place for handling organic trash. So far this isn't extreme, I know. But...

There are bikes in her basement that are about 40 years old. They are rusted and broken, and probably haven't been used for at least 20 years. She often keeps moldy/rotten food in her fridge. I've heard of food articles recently found in her freezer that expired 10 years ago.

Some time ago, she asked for help getting rid of some trash. My father (her son) and mother went to help her load a trailer - but she insisted on keeping almost everything they touched despite it being utterly broken in some way or another. At one point, someone tried to throw away an ancient couch of hers - and while she agreed, she wanted to dismantle it to keep the screws in it. ""You never know when you'll need 'em!""

She has also kept her old car (from the 1970s) around despite the fact that no one has driven it for tens of years. She's even been offered money for it a couple of times but declined. So it just sits there in the garage collecting dust.

Recently, she has been hiding food as well. Her daughter (my aunt) was visiting recently, and had bought and made dinner for them both one evening. When she (my aunt) wanted some leftovers for breakfast the next morning, it was nowhere to be found. She asked her mother about it and she replied angrily with something like ""Oh, don't ask me about that now, you know I'm stressed out [about her husband's death]! I don't know where it is right now!""

I always thought this trait was a remnant of wartime living. Keep what you may need in times of need, right? Now I'm not so sure anymore.

##Demanding

For years, especially through my teens and earliy twenties, she would call all of a sudden saying ""You *have* to come help me with ..."" It was never a question, just ""Come. Now."" If I said something like ""I'm sorry, I'm busy right now but can come in the evening"", she'd go on about how she once lent me some money (which was, between the lines, given as a gift) and how I now had to repaid it and would never get another loan. Later, I would show up when I could and she would act as if we never argued about it. I'd help her out and everything would be forgotten. Which brings me to...

##Ingratitude

I don't think I can remember being thanked a single time for helping my grandmother, despite having helped her with countless small and larger projects throughout my 27 years around or close to her. My mom especially describes the same experience. She expects us to turn up on incredibly short notice when needed (and we mostly do), but she never expresses any gratitude for this service.

She'll even complain about the job we do when we're there, helping! This too is a common occurrence. Not only do we have to adapt to her schedule, but we also have to do whatever it is we're doing exactly by her book - or she'll happily spend an hour telling us what we're doing wrong and how to do it instead. She does this even for mundane tasks where it doesn't really matter whether it's done one way or another.

##Paranoia

I vividly and painfully remember this one episode which neatly illustrates my points so far. This happened something like 5 years ago:

Me and my brother was asked to help her mount some Christmas lightning on one of her balconies. We showed up on short notice as usual, and were happy to assist. She followed us up the stairs and explained how she wanted it. Then she went back inside and we got to work.

20 minutes or so later we were done and happy with our work, so we went inside to fetch her. She inspected our work and was happy with it. As we went back inside, she moved some boxes around and suddenly asked in a playful tone ""Oh, so you helped yourself to a bottle of wine?"" We didn't and told her so. She went on about how she *knew* that a bottle was missing and how it had to be us. Again we insisted, and even showed her our clothes/pockets etc. asking ""Where would we be hiding it then?""

She said that we must have hidden it somewhere else, and never believed us. Still, she had this playful tone about it and never really dropped it before we left. She didn't thank us for the work we did, but may have joked about how the wine would be our payment (I don't remember exactly).

I left in shock. It was really painful seeing how ill she must be to act this way. I had seen parts of it before but that particular time stuck with me. I felt good about helping out relatives during Christmas and was really sad about how it eventually turned out.

---------

All of this seems to have gotten worse during the last, steep decline of my grandfather's health. I haven't been at my grandmother's house much lately (but plan to go tomorrow), but I'm hearing from relatives staying there that she'll argue with them about literally anything.

In conversation with my mother I learned that she (my grandmother) always relied on her husband for groceries and such. He got the food for her - she kept it safe in the house. I fear that when no one's there to get new things as needed, she'll force herself to make do with what she already has. That simply isn't a sustainable way of life.

Most of all I find this so very tragic. She's difficult to deal with, and I can see why those who have to tend to walk away. At the same time, she was recently widowed and probably feels very lonely and isolated. Despite the difficulty it brings, I genuinely believe she deserves help. Ideally - the kind of help that would lift her out of her illness. Only then will it be possible to fully support her during the (probably relatively few) years she has left.

I am not clean for Christmas, but that is okay. There has been a lot of stress in my life the last week or so and it burdened me. Burdened me enough my body started to have issues. Twitches, hearing things, paranoia, anxiety, the whole ka bang.

This week though still does not compare to the month of October when I first came here.

When I first came here I was looking to challenge my mind head on with the help of people here.

It did not go well. I got beat. Bad. I am not yet strong enough to challenge my mind.

Maybe I immersed myself too quickly, too much at once. October I ended up self harming for three weeks in a row, everyday. All because I had been letting the thoughts loose, trying to find the fragments of self, something to mend with in the tornado that surrounded me. But I ended up just getting thrashed around and wounded.

Since I have not done a whole lot to try and strengthen myself. But then again I really do not know how.

I guess it comes down to me being strong and not self harming when I start getting thrashed by the tornado.

16,"Growing up I had very over bearing parents. they would track my phone, my vehicle, they would show up unannounced to friends houses and ruin social gatherings, they would call parents of all involved when I got in trouble. Their involvement in my life made me a social pariah, so I started to lie and cheat my way through life to meet their expectations and avoid their ever increasing involvement. 

I considered suicide a number of times throughout my young life because of the guilt and self hatred I felt for what I did. Because of this I learned to ignore guilt, regret, and remorse. This scares me, because these are emotions I haven’t felt for years, and I only feel hatred, fear, or anger in place. I know I’m capable of doing pretty horrible things as I’ve done some before, and I’m worried that should my mental health deteriorate in the way it has been, I will end up making some very poor decisions for myself and others knowing that it won’t effect me

18,"I'm 18 yrs old.

I come from a family with a long history of mental health issues.

I've self-harmed in some way since I was young, and all throughout my childhood, I was diagnosed with adhd/bipolar/ocd/etc.

Here recently, I've noticed my relationship with myself and others is... abnormal.

I have a harmful inferiority complex, and my outlook on life changes by the minute from ""there's hope"" to ""nothing matters or will get better""

I feel undeserving of happiness constantly

My view of people changes with the slightest misgiving, from ""you're the love of my life"" to ""I hate you"" to ""I don't deserve you, I'm a piece of shit""

The slightest criticism sticks with me, one time I was called ""fat"", so I starved myself 60 pounds lighter.

I'm easily overwhelmed

I'm afraid of being alone, and look at the future with only dread. I do everything in my power to keep people.

I always self-analyze and try to be perfect. If I can't accomplish perfection, I become so depressed I can't find joy in anything or make any attempt to leave my house.

I live off of reassurance and validation, because i can't offer it to myself or be sure of myself.

I can't trust my own motives or decisions, because I feel they're fake.

I neglect my family and people who care in pursuit of people I WANT to care about me. 

Once I recognized these things, i've been in a long, shameful depression.

I always feel anxiety burning in my gut.


I want to change how I am so I can be content to just live and be myself.


I don't want to be a burden on anyone anymore.

I just don't know how to find help.

I live in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma, 2 hours from anything. Finding DBT seems hard.

I'm also a soon-to-be college student. I'm in a panic because while I was lost in my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and dealing with a very ill parent, I have very little time to apply to college itself and THEN apply for scholarships I desperately need. I feel hopeless with my future because I feel I completely ruined it for myself. 

I just need help to manage my depression and anxiety. I want to do something with my life, but I feel so overwhelmed just waking up in the morning.

19,"I'm struggling with a bunch of mental health issues that seem to be interlinked, depression, anxiety, etc. But it's more than that. It affects my cognition and memory too. When I'm depressed, I'm also stupid. When I'm (apparently) anxious, I can't remember anything. Or any combination of those things at once. I'm beginning to wonder if I have some kind of attention disorder too, since it's almost always hard to focus on anything. 

What's more is that most of the time, I can't feel /anything/. Or when I do, it's just a vague hint of what it used to be. I noticed looking in the mirror the other day just how unhappy I looked and figured that must be why people don't seem to like to talking to me.

Occasionally, I have good days where everything makes sense and it's like I don't even have to try, things just click instantly. I'd obviously love if it I were like that all the time, but...how?

I think it might be related to loneliness, as I can easily go a couple of days without talking to anyone. I'd reach out to some friends, but I usually have literally no idea what to say, somehow. I think they've realized that if I'm not ""in a talking mood,"" they're not going to get much out of me. Yet, I'm pretty sure it's slowly killing my mental health.

22,"I would like to start off by saying I’m not looking for a diagnosis of any kind, just a way to get something off my chest and maybe a hint of advice. 

Ever since the beginning of my teenage years, I’ve had multiple specific obsessions with certain parts of my body being clean. It all started, from what I can remember, when I got lice in the 7th grade. While this is something that’s normal for a lot of kids, it triggered something in me. After that, I had to constantly make sure my hair was clean. I would imagine the feeling of tons of bugs running on my scalp. I would wash it multiple times a day, sometimes waking up in the middle of the night panicking because I felt the need to wash my hair. This lead to me developing trichotillomania, something that I dealt with heavily throughout my middle school years and still slightly struggle with. Eventually, I had to cut my hip length hair to a pixie cut because of my balding and constant anxiety. 

After I cut my hair, my anxiety with washing it started to decrease. From there, however, I developed an odd obsession with my breath and teeth. In the beginning of my high school years I was brushing my teeth whenever I could, at home or on the go. The feeling of dirty teeth made my skin crawl, so I carried those tiny no-water-needed toothbrushes with me. When my puberty journey got blessed with braces, this only heightened because of how hard it was to keep braces clean. I soon would not only brush my teeth constantly, but I also began to eat tooth paste and drink unhealthy amounts of mouthwash to try to get rid my mouth of anything foul smelling. 

After this phase died down, it moved onto my skin. Similar to my hair, I had to constantly wash my body. I would feel itchy all over if I didn’t get up and take a shower right then and there. I would itch at my hands and head until they bleed if I felt dirty and couldn’t into a shower, which lead to me scratching my hands whenever I felt anxious in general. I would not be able to sleep because of how dirty and itchy I felt in my own bed. 

Currently, the obsession is with cleaning my ears. However, all of the past obsession have lingered. They aren’t all as intense as they once were, but they are all still there. I feel as if I’m piling them up and collecting these weird obsessions. Some days, it makes me have an anxiety attack that I’m in my own body because I feel that there’s so much I can’t wash off. It’s not as if I’m afraid of germs around me or on things that I touch, rather that there’s something constantly wrong and gross in or on my own body. 

I’m sorry this was a whole ass novel, but this complete timeline is something I have yet to discuss with anyone. If anybody has any comments, I’m all ears because I feel very alien with whatever has been happening. ",25Dec2018,1

I had them describe what they saw and it was exactly what I see. I’m losing it. I don’t know how I can do this. We are normal people with regular jobs that did not grow in the same parts of the country. We all happened to hang and one day we talked about it when no one else was around.

I've had a friend tell me I should get professional help whenever I have an episode but I don't know what to do first. I don't have a family doctor I feel comfortable with or a therapist (I've never been to one). I've been looking on ZocDoc but there is a lot (especially being in NYC) and I don't know whether to trust the app or not. I'm afraid I'll go to someone and get prescribed antidepressants on the spot, or will have a negative experience and never go again. I'm at a point where I know I need help and soon, but I'm very afraid it wont work. 
Please help.

29,"Im not sure where else to post this and i really just need to vent.

For the past several years I've been having these thoughts, these dreams of eveyone I give a Damn about dying. Its not just a thought passing through my head, its over and over and over again weather Im awake or asleep or in the middle of a conversation and it flashes through my mind, I cant make it stop and its driving me insane. I don't want to get close to anyone because of this, I gave up my dog for adoption because I couldn't bare the thought of seeing him die one day. My parents (who I still live with) have had two more kids since this started happening (despite me telling them what's going on) and I tried to stay away from them for the first few months but I eventually I just fell in love with them and as horrible as it sounds and as much as I love them, I keel beating myself up for it and hating myself for loving them so much because I cant stop thinking about these horible things happening to them my head. I don't want to get close to anyone and I'm so afraid theres going to be yet another person I get attached to. I have trouble sleeping. I have no motivation to really do anything with my life and me trying to distance myself from everyone comes off more as me neglecting my little siblings which makes me feel even worse. This whole thing is tearing me apart and I really dont know what to do.

What made me decide to finaly write this was when I broke down crying at the sight of a cat My Mom got my sister for Christmas that I know I'll end up loving. Am I just being a huge dick for being like this, for not just growing up and spending some big bro time with my little siblings or spending time with my family or giving my dog up? I really think I need help but I dont know if I can do it.",25Dec2018,1
30,"I march 2018 I woke up. My father told me that I stole his money. I told him that I didn't steal his money, but he continued to humiliate me. I went to my room. I was angry and sad in same time. I felt like trash.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I went to kitchen again. Both of my parents were there. I told my mom what he told me. I was thinking that he will say something like this: O.K. you didn't steal my money. 

&amp;#x200B;

But he said nothing. I took his arms to put him outside 30-60 minutes. I wanted that he knows how I feel. But my mom stopped me. He fell on floor. I put my hand around his neck to scare him. Then he said: Help me, this thief wants to kill me. In this moment I was so sad and angry that I lost control and I spat on him and kicked him.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that I feel like shit every day. I feel guilty and I regret what I did. I am depressed and suicidal every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think that I have harm OCD.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to visit psychiatrist.

2) Will it be just normal conversation, that will help me next 2 days, and after that I will feel like shit again?",25Dec2018,1
31,"Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy many things about my life. I love my job, I love my family and friends, and I love my dogs. I have a good time. But sometimes I just think about how pointless it all is. I suffer from what I feel is pretty severe anxiety (but I might just be overestimating my problems) and I always think about the things that will inevitably happen. Every one I love will die (my mom and grandparents did a few years ago, which I think triggered all of this.) I am going to grow apart from my friends. My pets will die- and I can’t stand to think about live without them. One day I will become old and I won’t be able to do the things I want. Also, there’s war and slavery and abuse and disease happening all over the world. It seems pointless to actually enjoy things to me, since all of the bad eventually outweighs the good. I just want to know if these feelings are normal. I’m trying to get in with a therapist at my school and hopefully I’ll get up the courage to talk about this if I get accepted into the program.",25Dec2018,1
32,"Several times growing up I heard ""you fuck everything up"" ""you can't do anything right"" ""you fail at everything"", and this hurt me, and I got up the courage to tell my mom and got a ""well you kinda of do do that"" and I know she was trying to be kind about it but all she did was justify telling me how much of a failure I am. And now I feel like total shit again. I struggle in college, I struggle in every aspect of my life and yes it does seem like I can't do anything right. I just feel like shit. She told me not to feel bad about it but how can I not? On top of that so much anxiety today and thoughts of death. I am biking to church tomorrow morning and can't stop worrying about dying on my way. My little brother got a red trike and I can't stop worrying someone will run him over. I hate this. And now the thing I really wanted to talk to her about and gain closure on I just got some of the same crap. She doesn't understand how worthless I feel when she says that. Tonight, she asked why I looked sad at Christmas eve and I lied and said I was fine. She was a little frustrated I think. The truth is even when I'm supposed to be happy I feel sad sometimes. Every happy occasion lately I've felt a bit sad, but I found forcing myself to smile constantly during these events make me more happy, so that's good. I think it's out of a place of deep anxiety that I feel that way. Afterwards I ran upstairs to lay in my bed and watch tv which made me feel better. I've been thinking a lot about time and how fast it goes by and how fast my life is going away. And the tediousness of everyday existence; eating and sleeping seem very tedious sometimes, how often we have to eat and sleep, doing the same thing over and over until we die. And the day just is gone before we even begin it. I've had self harming thoughts, but I don't want to hurt myself, but nonetheless they come and I try to avoid them. And I am terrified of losing my life or being harmed at the same time. 

I wish that my mom understood how much it hurt to hear how I fail at everything. Even if I do, it would have been nice for her to instead try to help me. And I wish I was in therapy much earlier than now, when so much of the damage from traumatic events in my life have already screwed me up for life. I feel trapped sometimes between a rock and a hard place. And I wish my mom would go to therapy. 

I wish they had recognized how much I was suffering throughout my life because I was so confused and didn't know what was wrong with me. My dad almost lost his life in a car accident when I was nine years old, and I saw it happen. I was so messed up after that but how was I supposed to know? Being the middle child, I'm basically left behind and forgotten. They love me, they do. But I just wish I had had someone to take care of me. And I feel like I didn't have that. I feel like it was sort of my responsibility to take care of myself growing up after that point. And though I know my family loves me, and they give me good gifts, they help me when I need it, I just feel very emotionally distant because I can't express myself. I have to sort of say things in a certain way, skirt around certain topics, and basically I feel misunderstood, and burdensome. I feel like this family no longer has a place for me. But that's part of being an adult now I suppose. I just wish I had the resources to move out. And my family does compliment me from time to time. And I don't expect them to always have to say that I'm great or anything like that. Honestly I just wish I could talk to them for a few hours about how I feel. But I don't want to seem like I am seeking attention. I don't know what it is but I feel like I am missing something in my life and I have no clue what that is. I sought to fill that gap with friends, but I became dependent and clingy and ended up making them the center of my life which is wrong. I just sometimes feel lonely, even with friends and family I feel there is a hole in my life. 

I feel like I never sleep well anymore, I have to wake up early for work but it sucks not sleeping well most nights. 

Merry Christmas to everyone.  ",25Dec2018,1
33,"Tonite, I terminated my friendship, with my Nephew. I have blocked him on Facebook and want nothing to do with him ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife, is still a friend a messaged him just now, My husband says, ""He has blocked you on Facebook and will let you back in when you can grow up, treat him with some respect and stop lying to him"".

&amp;#x200B;

He called the cops on me because he thinks he knows everything, has no respect for me because I was misdiagnosed as ""Biplolar""; I have never been ""Bipolar"". The last time I attempted suicide was in 1980. I rarely ever get depressed and I have never experienced mania. The label was given to me by a family doctor who knew nothing about Psychiatry and messed me up badly, by giving me the wrong medication for 10 years. He messed up my life. I'm seeing a Psychiatrist in a few days and they will see if they can fit me in before the New Year. I have written a 4 page letter to my Psychiatrist that I don't have yet, nor do I know his or her name or what time the appointment will be but know where it is and the location and what day. I will call them in the New Year and ask.

&amp;#x200B;

My nephew overreacted to some of my angry comments about my mother (who is currently being investigated by the OPP for murder and you won't believe this, my father is the one she murdered). I am 100% sure he was molested by my mother (his Grandma). I have seen peculiar and perverted behaviour between them, like my nephew at the age of 18, sitting next to his Grandma, putting a blanket over them and then putting his arm around her. Because there were other people in the room my mother said, ""Don't do that, people are watching!"". He removed the blanket. He is the only person in the family that believes I was molested by her. I went to the Police in 2008 about my molestation and my lying, whore mother got out of it, because I was out of money at the time because I had to spend $70,000 on a legal fees for my divorce. I could not afford a lawyer and she had the best lawyer in town. She told everyone I was lying and I was blackmailing her (she's a millionaire and has never given me or my sister a single penny of my father's estate or a single think and on top of that she is holding many items that were willed to us by our paternal grandfather and she has all the wills and she will not let us have these items and I estimate they are worth at least $100,000, they have never been appraised). My sister has autism and lives off $8,000/year. She is too poor to afford Internet or a TV set and has to grow her own food to survive. We do not have food stamps in Canada. She is lucky she has a working vehicle now. Because my nephew is working far up in Canada's north where it is currently -60F and 24 hours of darkness (he is up near Greenland), she has his Jeep and can actually go places, without her vehicle breaking down. She can't afford a drivers license or insurance and valid plates, so for the first time in years, she will not be breaking the law. She also can't afford insurance on her house. She needs a lot of dental work done and is missing most of her front teeth. She wondered if her mother would pay her dental bill to remove two back molors that had gone rotten and had abysses and were painful and making her sick. So she sent a letter to her mother with her bill from the dentist and her mother mailed her back and it said, ""Go to Hell"". 

During the divorce, she was giving money to the other side. Because she tricked me and picked a horrible women for me and I was foolish enough to fall for it. In other words, my marriage was arranged. And my mother knew that and enjoyed that I hated my wife so much. I complained to her privately before the divorce and she replied, ""She is a cold fish isn't she?"" and smiled.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also written on the bottom of the letter in handwriting and signed it, that I am prepared to pay up to US$100,000 to get better treatment and I will borrow more if necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone please tell me where the best place in the world is to get treatment for this; money is not a problem.

35,"My family is home for Christmas. I guess I’m a rare case: the holiday season is really great for us. My nuclear family loves me, and I love them.

But Christ, I just *can’t* let myself enjoy it. Don’t get me wrong—I smile and laugh, and make dumb jokes that nobody really hears but me. But it’s fake. It’s so, so fake. I just want to cut myself all over, from my neck to my ankles, and hang myself in a quiet place. God, I would be doing everyone a huge favor. 

I know my sisters love me because they have to, not because I have a single redeeming quality. I’m unfunny and loud and embarrassing, and I always laugh just a little too long. I want to die, so badly. I don’t want to keep this up. I don’t even want to disappear—I just want to hurt. I deserve it.",25Dec2018,1
36,"For a while, maybe even for as long as I can remember, I’ve felt like I am just a soul or floating above my physical body. I feel really disconnected sometimes and when looking in the mirror kind of feel surprised to see that who I’m looking at is me. This worries me sometimes. I’ve gone through a childhood with alcoholic and pill addicted parents that inflicted a lot of emotional trauma. I’ve also had a physically and emotionally abusive past relationship and a past drug problem.

39,"Getting better is difficult when I'm not doing it for myself. Letting go of self destructive behaviors is difficult when I want nothing more than to end my life. I do want to get better but I'm not mentally well enough to even begin to fix myself. I don't see a way out of this. 

It's like I can't openly attempt suicide with good conscience right now so instead I'm doing things I know will really screw with my body (making self vomit, cutting self) 

And I've talked about this with my therapist and he suggested distractions to stop the harmful behavior but I can't seem to use them because I don't see a reason not to do any of it when I don't want to live.

They tracked it to me and pulled me out of class. I just lied to the teacher till she couldn’t help up blame it on the people sitting next to me. I knew I should have been honest, but I didn’t feel bad about it. I even lied to my family without a second thought. I don’t know if I’m really a Sociopath or I’m just freaking out over nothing.

I am done looking for help where none can be found.

How I can’t learn the simple things (like remembering how cribbage goes after he just taught me it all), and how he thinks I get frustrated when I try to learn something. He even said I might be autistic. This was really painful but it was something I always wondered about myself as well... I always felt abnormally stupid. Like I can’t handle simple instructions, or I just do things really stupidly. People I used to work with would say stuff like “are you sure you aren’t blonde?”...so I know he was clearly stating the truth while arguing with me :( I even think we may be breaking up, and this has been so hard. I always used to think my stupidness just comes from my depression and the lack of desire or interest i had to learn something new, due to the depression.. but now I’m just thinking there’s something truly wrong with me. My brain is obviously unhealthy or something. 
I do have a talent and that is with drawing, but that doesn’t mean anything really.. I have interests in science, and hope to go to college for information technology innovation and design. But I fear I am just too stupid and will fail.

I just feel so much self hate. I feel like an absolute waste of space and that I am truly unbelievable.

“ Your a passively angry individual 
You choose to do these things throw two fingers up to the world and say fuck you then say help me help me and play the victim 
You can go on playing the victim all your life and blaming things
You’ve been doing this for 6 years it’s time to move on you keep blaming this event that happened to you when you were 19 “ (a psychosis due to mdma that stopped me leaving the house and thinking the sun was going to explode I couldn’t sit still I slept on my mums floor for weeks)
“Your blaming medication and other services when really it’s your choice to change your life 
Pysyciatry isn’t some wonder drug it’s not just gonna make you better 
Ssris were designed for people with mild mood disorders which is not what you’ve got they’ve shown little to no evidence for helping with people with anxiety.
A psychiatrist is just another kind of doctor they don’t have a miracle that is just going to change you 
You can keep blaming the past on why your acting the way you are 
If you were overweight I could put you in for excercise therapy for example to help you lose weight but knowing you will go away and eat lots of food then get fat what’s the point in putting you through excercise therapy if your just going away and eating 
There’s two types of people internal people who make choices and change the world around them and external people who blame the world around them for what’s happening to them your the latter”
He sent me home in an angry tone saying “now do you want anti depressants or not!”

The previous year I had been binge drinking to extremes to cope with depression and anxiety. (Definitely not helping myself and I could agree with him on that last year I had issues I struggled to speak about)I would stop drinking for months in between though and hope for a change but to no avail. I came to that appointment that day with a star of mind of clarity I just nearly could’ve died ask for every bit of help you can and commit your life depends on it.
Now , In Scotland to get any kind of talk therapy you must be sober for 4 months to get into the system. So last December I stopped drinking on my own accord after the last hospital admittance and put my foot down. I didn’t crave alcohol and saw a light at the end of the tunnel with talk therapy. I used my prescription of diazepam to get me to a local gym to which I committed to. I ate correctly and exercised. I did at least 5 months of this. My feelings were alleviated but always there. Real darkness began to slip back in. I started to feel the need to drink to escape. So I went to my Community addictions team on recommendation of my doctor. The community addictions team then rejected me on the basis I was now sober for 4 months so they don’t deal with me if I’m not drinking and were also angry at my doctor for sending me to them. 
I was so lost and confused by this point with the mental ping pong and passing of responsibilities of these services 
So I began to binge drink again this summer after my long haul of sobriety. and it came to ahead in August ( with the overdose. I tried the overdose and after 6 hours In A&amp;E I was sent home) I was given an appointment on the Monday morning with my doctor ( who said what I mentioned above whilst I was in a state of absolute desperation and had a willingness to talk about the experiences I was dealing with finally, but before It could he hit me with that chat an Attempt at tough love but it also had its own personal venom to it.I have been alone now and afraid of doctors intentions. I found lumps on my body and there was blood in my stool but I thought “good I might die of something proper.” I became scared of anger at the system and the world. I was afraid I was really losing my mind this time and the light at the end of the tunnel was a train, my thoughts were aggressive and not like me at all. Thoughts of hurting those that had hurt me in the past. Proper Violent retribution. It distressed me this aggression I thought I was becoming psychotic. I was pulling my hair saying no no no out loud. I never did actually move a muscle to go and commit to anything. But it was another thing to worry about that I would hurt somebody not just myself. and I was happy now to lie on the metaphorical tracks and let the train crush me brutally. I played with different ideas of killing myself. Hanging a noose out of a scarf and seeing how it felt choking and if it would hold my weight. Whereas before I was lucky enough to hold my head together in these situations and say NO your not doing that and it would defuse it. I’ve self harmed whilst drunk and ruined a possible career in music by severing my ulnar nerve after playing guitar for 8 years and making it into college which I had to drop out off. Luckily a surgeon saved me in that respect I consider an angel and it’s taken rehabilitation and perseverance to get back to playing. I digress.
 I’m now back in hospital now on Christmas Day eyes watering from a very high dose of diazepam to help withdraw again and stay calm. I have to wait till Thursday to talk to a psychiatrist liaison officer who will put me on another waiting list. and I can’t check myself out or they will call the police to come looking for me. I feel trapped like a Fat Santa in the chimney but this is no joke. 
The nurses remind you why there’s good in the world. However , we must tackle this shit show of a system. I’m sure they’re are so many of us suffering. And I’m sure we wish could all help each other. I’ve tried Samaritans , addaction ( a charity in which you don’t have to be sober to receive talk therapy) however I was thrown off because it wasn’t actually a qualified therapist and I didn’t trust him which I know is important. And I don’t like the idea of him playing with my mind and possibly messing it up even more. I’ve tried online courses. Self help books.

I tell family i am not ok and they dont even acknowledge what i tell them. Told my GF I was feeling overwhelmed and stressed to the limit she tells me I am being selfish. 


So I come here to talk and hopefully have some emotional release. So i am going to sit here and cry again (yes I do cry I am not afriad to allow my emotions to imprison me ) 

Thank you Reddit Family for allowing me this one outlet.......",25Dec2018,1

55,"I didn’t really know where to ask for advice so I decided to ask on here with a throwaway. Ever since I was young I’ve always had really dark thoughts, some of them don’t feel like mine and some of them do. It’s really difficult to explain, like sometimes I will think of something really bad like my mother getting raped but it won’t be my own thought it’s as though it’s somebody else that’s thinking for me..? 

I’m reluctant to put all of this on here but I don’t really know what else it do. I’ve always been power hungry, I would class it as a fetish. The only way I get turned on is by thinking of killing people, but I’m aware it’s wrong to think this way and I would like to stop. I’m a small, young girl and very powerless, my childhood was traumatic and I feel like this is why I connect sex with murder. 

My boyfriend invites these feelings too, he validates them and doesn’t seem to care about the evil nature of them, I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. 

I also wouldn’t class this as having sociopathic thoughts because I want to repress the feelings and I realise they’re not normal. I have really bad social anxiety and can’t really speak to anybody about my issues, I barely go outside so not even that’s an option. I’m also really embarrassed about it.

 Does anybody know if it’s possible to stop myself from having these thoughts, I know I’m not actively hurting anybody but I just don’t feel normal and would like to change. ",25Dec2018,1

73,"Background: 19F, college student, history of self-harm, still medicated and at in therapy for depression/anxiety but mostly depression. Abandoned abruptly by my then-40 year old sister when I was in middle school (people tend to think all of this traces back to that), but still have two loving parents that would do anything for me. 

It’s not just me that doesn’t like me, either. Most of my “friends” at school either judge me intensely for every “mistake” I make or constantly flake on me. Then there are the myriad people I try to become friends with, but I get pushed away when I try to get to know them better. The only person who has been really good to me this semester is my new bf but I don’t want him to realize how shitty everyone else is to me or else he’ll believe they must have a reason and he’ll leave me too. I just don’t trust anyone to be good to me or think of me. If I want a friend I have to put in nearly all of the energy into planning things, reaching out, etc. Rarely am I ever invited to something. As a result, I often don’t tell people anything negative or blue about myself. I don’t want to give people even more excuses to leave. My mother thinks this pushes everyone away. Adults who interact with me and my bf think that I’m a really likable person and easy to get along with, and those that know about my lack of friendships can’t figure out why this is happening to me. My therapist even suggested DBT because he can’t see anything in our one-on-one sessions that would cause this.

74,"Firstly, idk if this belongs here. I just wanted to post somewhere where I knew other people might be feeling similarly and understand, and be gentle, and idk many other subs.

&amp;nbsp;

I live 5 1/2 hours away from all of my family .
Two years ago, I came to accept that I had lost the majority of my friends. I never really made peace with it, but I just stopped trying to make our relationships ""a thing"" again after being ignored, stood up, blown off, and so on. One of my friends completely ignored me until one day he fell in like with my best friend, and suddenly wanted to ""catch up"" so he could talk about her. When she got weirded out and he found a gf, I was as good as nobody again. So I let that go.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like after that phase, I was just being pushy and not being mature by not just letting them go. I always held onto what our friendships once were, but I ruined them all.

&amp;nbsp;


I spent the majority of my life literally in my room, alone, all the time. I didn't even attend school(I was homeschooled the majority of my life). When I made friends when I was 18, I cherished them. But my lack of social skills and stupid, naive mistakes ruined everything, every time, eventually.

&amp;nbsp;


My family was the last thing I had, until recently. I moved away 3 years ago this January. After that, everything drastically changed; my mom finally got married, but immediately started screwing around on her
husband, and telling me about it, my brother started losing touch with reality and became someone I didn't recognize, I learned deep dark secrets and long held lies from my own bf, my niece started hating school due to peer pressure, despite being amazingly talented in maths, my dad started losing some touch with reality and developed radical political views, my other brother is essentially the same, though now I see him being a jerk to his wife at times and that makes me sad because he was so not like that when I left.

&amp;nbsp;


When I moved, I made a post about one of my last close friends, and how I was ready to finally let him go. Everyone chimed in with ""people change, it's best to realize that now than to keep holding on"". I guess just all this change at once is a huge shock to me. Maybe it's more of a shock just since I've been gone, so while everyone has been going through changes gradually, I've missed the transitions, and to me it all seems sudden and extreme.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just sad. No one is who I thought they were, literally no one. 
I have a disability and it's hard for me to make new friends or even meet new people. Besides that, I've always been painfully shy and awkward anyway, so it seems impossible to me. Truthfully, I don't have much to offer anyone besides loyalty. I'm basically a less cute dog. I don't know how to be different, but I'm lonely.

&amp;nbsp;


I make this trip every year, several times a year, to see my family because they're important to me and all I have left. I accepted that I had ruined all my friendships with the knowledge that I at least would always have family. 
&amp;nbsp;

Every time, just about every single person forgets plans we've made well in advance, even if I remind them a week or a few days prior.
Like my mom: I let her know I would see her today. She said she had off work. I find out through her husband that she got drafted to work and for some reason never told me. I contact her to confirm a few days ago, and she says she does but she is taking off, so, I don't change plans.

&amp;nbsp;


Last night I contact her, and she says she is going to see my SIL's family and I can come over for breakfast instead. I made plans because this morning was my time to spend with my bf's family, which I told her at least 3x prior. I had scheduled time for my brother and his kids, my dad, my bf and I to have a night out at an event that ended the same day we went, my bf's family, and my mom. My family is all apart, and no one will collectively meet, so I have a lot of different places to go and the stressful part is that no one sticks to plans.

&amp;nbsp;


My dad and brother did the same thing; forgot and my dad said he didn't think he could make it since he met this girl and has been staying with her and has to go home to do laundry or something and be up early to take her somewhere.
&amp;nbsp;

I told him a month in advance, last week, and the other day and he confirmed plans. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm just tired of not ever being as important to my family as they are to me. I even went over to set up a tree for my mom this year because she couldn't afford one and didnt have time, thought it would cheer her up, but of course it did not.

&amp;nbsp;


To boot, I saw my dad last night and my whole childhood he told me i should be more interested in his family and our culture. A natural interest sparks, I ask, and I feel like he is annoyed and dismissive. He is an immigrant and his whole family speaks little english and doesn't live here, so idk who I could ever ask, or if I could I dont think I'd be comfortable since I've literally never spoken to them.

&amp;nbsp;


Additionally, I gave him a gift and he said ""I don't celebrate Christmas."" I jokingly said ""you do now!"" and immediately regretted it because he was just telling me how ""bossy""(blunt) women annoy him. He left it unwrapped for a few minutes and finally opened it.
&amp;nbsp;


I got my dad a Google Home because, my dad 3 years ago liked technology. I'm almost 28, and my dad has liked technology for as long as I've been alive. He still does, but has become a conspiracy theorist. Worst present ever for someone who believes in that stuff. I didn't even think about that, or realize how serious he was about it.

&amp;nbsp;

He asked if it was the same thing as on his phone and I said yeah(he uses it all the time, and loves watching YouTube videos and stuff like that) and he said ""I don't like that, they listen to you and learn."" I confirm, ""Yeah, they're AI so they will learn."" I told him I could find the receipt if he wants to return it, but he said he might use it.

&amp;nbsp;

He later went to leave and left it in the couch. I asked if he wanted it and he took it, but, I'm just heart broken. 
Everything is so different. I hate that I moved away. I hate what life is now. I'm so lonely and I love my family, just like I loved my friends, but I just don't feel like anyone loves me.

&amp;nbsp;


As I say that, I think about the fact that my other SIL DID remember plans without me even speaking to her more than once a month ago, and my nephew gave me an adorable gift. My niece and nephews have never given me anything before, so that was really special. I feel happy whenever I look at his little bear bracelet, but I'm still sad about the rest of my family, and then I feel guilty for being sad. I feel like ""nobody cares or loves me"" when there are 2 people who acknowledged me, and I feel like a jerk for feeling the way I do, but it just keeps cycling around my head. I guess I just wish my siblings and parents cared, like I have always wished.

&amp;nbsp;

When other people make trips, I feel like their families make it priority to say hi because they're in town, but for my family it doesn't really matter. Obviously I'm sure there are lots of people in my position, but the families I know aren't like that.
I just want to matter.


&amp;nbsp;

This morning, my bf told me he'd wait for me to open gifts but everyone opened them without me. I just feel unimportant, invisible, and sad.
The only family I've heard from today was my dad, who ended up thanking me but said he was re-gifting the Home. I was going to get him a movie and a mug with his favorite type of dog on it, and seriously wish I had just done that.

&amp;nbsp;


I feel like at this point, I'm not making plans anymore. Next year my bf's family is moving an hour away from all my family and I can't do this back and forth stuff then anyway. I'll schedule a time to see my niece and nephews and that's it. I'm so tired of feeling like I put in all this effort but none of my blood relatives can even write down plans on a calendar.
I'm tired of putting in effort. This year I had money for the first time in years and just wanted to show my family I love them but I'm tired of fighting for time.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going back home tomorrow with it in my mind that what I did have left is now just gone. I'm just disappointed and sad. I've been suicidal which was a big push for me to see everyone and give out nice gifts for once. Usually the thought that my family cares and that would hurt them keeps me safe. I will always consider the kids since I've always tried to maintain a close relationship and helped raise them, but the knowledge that what I tell myself during hard times is probably true, that they wouldn't care anyway, really hurts.",25Dec2018,1

Christmas can be a difficult time of year for some people, whether they are alone or even with others, I don't have a partner and suffer loneliness daily but I'm with family and feel blessed but that does not mean I feel fulfilled, I'm obviously grateful for what I've received from others and I'm always happy to give and see how others react to my goodwill.

But no matter how low that I go both physically and mentally, I'm still here just about standing, that may be through strength or sheer stupidity, but I'm here, I've done loads of things over the years that have left me worse off and I've always punished myself for the way that I have carried off or approached situations but I suppose that can be attributed to my mental illness or it could just be down to naivety or plain foolishness but I'm going to not make any resolutions for the new year, I can only try and build something and make things right, I don't know how I can do that but these are the main two things that's on my mind rite now.

80,"Celebrated Christmas Eve or Noche Buena last night with my family. Had a few drinks, tokes, ended the night with a movie. It was a good time, but while I was trying to fall asleep, I got hit with this awful feeling of existential dread. 

This is something I struggle with occasionally. The last time it happened was this year around August/September maybe. When it happened that time, I remember I couldn’t stop thinking about death, about “the void”. It was kinda hard to breathe, I felt empty &amp; this felt like a borderline, if not, actual panic attack. Last night, it wasn’t that bad, but I could slowly feel the dread setting. I could feel myself get worried about the thought of death, about being nothing. I could feel the pit in my stomach widen &amp; in my head I could feel the walls closing in, literally, it was a feeling of slight claustrophobia. So I decided to try to listen to some music. 

Stadium Arcadium by RHCP. The album is full of funky, upbeat tunes &amp; I could feel the music countering my dread, what surprised me was how aware I was of this. It was like the music was slowly washing away the bad feelings &amp; after about 20 - 30 minutes I was able to fall asleep, feeling fine, good even.

I guess my advice to anyone who ever deals with this sort of existential panic or anything that causes anxiety or really dark feelings/thoughts, is to listen to your favorite upbeat tunes. It seems obvious, but I feel like I’ve personally underestimated the power of music in helping deal with shit. I hope this helps someone, somewhere! ",25Dec2018,1
81,"19/F/USA, diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I am having issues that don’t seem to relate to those three things, and I’m wondering if there’s something else going on. 

Since I was a baby I’ve had an issue with hand flapping. It started as a toddler and doctors thought I would grow out of it, but I never did. One of the most necessary parts of my day is locking myself in my room, turning up the music really loud, and letting my arms flap in rhythm. Not much of an issue unless I’m in public and the flapping starts up.  But the real issue I’m having is below. 

***TMI WARNING I AM REALLY SORRY***
For the past few months I’ve had this desperate need to get everything out when I go to the bathroom. I’ll push so hard the gas in my stomach comes up. I’ll reach inside and try to get everything out no matter how much it hurts or what it takes. I do this multiple times a day, and I often throw up because of it. It just feels wrong to leave anything in there, and it’s terribly uncomfortable when I can feel that it’s not all gone. 

Now here’s where it gets serious. 

That last section has been causing me to throw up so much that I’m not really able to keep anything down. I’ve been terribly sick for the past few weeks and people are starting to notice. I’m missing work, canceling plans and getting really pale. I’m scared of becoming bulimic as throwing up is helping me lose weight and it’s getting addicting. I can’t afford medical care, I’m paying off so much medical debt already that I can hardly afford to eat (another reason I can’t keep throwing up everything). I am not going to the doctor for this unless I am literally dying, and even then I don’t know if it’s worth the risk. I need to figure out if this is something I need to get on meds for, or if I gotta figure it out alone, which I am willing to do.

The thing is that I didn't plan on getting into a relationship and finding a good job, but now that I do have these things, I don't wanna go home.

Now I've been in a constant state of depression and guilt for the last three months. The second my boyfriend got into the picture, everyone decided I was too stupid to make my own decisions. Whereas my dad was okay with me leaving home, now he's not. He thinks I'm going to ruin my life if I live with my boyfriend. Everyone (except my sister thankfully) thinks he's with me for papers. That I'm going to be taking care of him. It's like I'm only an independent adult when it fits their narrative. If it doesn't, they need to step in and shit on my agency. 

My family distrusts him and I know my mom dislikes him the most. Even my sister said I could be dating a perfect man, and she'd still find something wrong with him; I agree because that's what I felt she did.

We both understand that I became my mom's biggest emotional supporter after her divorce, but that was a mistake. She shouldn't have made me, a child, her only source of happiness, but it's too late. I'm stuck, and I hate myself. God forgive me, but I my life and my family at the moment. 

I don't literally hate them, but at this moment, this is what I feel. I obviously love them, but they're all being hypocritics. They expected me to be this good Christian girl who would do anything the family asks, and now that I'm going against everything they think I should do, I'm the horrible, awful, terrible person. I cried for hours on Sunday. Again Lord please forgive me, but I thought about dying. 

I wish I had a normal, boring family. I wish my mom could have met someone. I wish I could know if everything is going to be okay. Thanks for hearing me out, Reddit. ",25Dec2018,1

91,"I don't even know who to talk to about this anymore.  I don't even know what to do with myself.  I can't for the life of me hold down a job.  I've been laid off dozens of times at this point.  I don't seem to be capable of anything good.  Nobody seems to like me.  I'm in my mid-40s and I don't see a future for myself.  I've been laid off 3 times in 2018 alone.  I feel like I have some form of PTSD from all these layoffs (it started happening at the beginning of the recession and hasn't stopped).  It seemed I might have had a lucky break with a job I took in 2015, but the people I liked and how managed me all bailed, to be replaced by people who despised me.  I have a hearing disability (since I was 6 due to neglect) and it makes communication a bit challenging, and nobody is very patient.  I work as a product manager in tech in the bay area and it's killing me at this point.  I just don't know what I'm good at, my self-confidence is gone, I can't seem to keep up anymore and I feel like a complete failure.  

I grew up in a pretty abusive household and somehow managed my way out of it, into college to get a degree I never used (environmental engineering).  I didn't do well in college, I didn't like my degree and afterwards took a job that paid well below what I should have expected for myself.  I didn't know how to interview, what to say to people, how to perform.  I've been DYING to find a manager who is empathetic enough that can help me be successful but nobody seems interested.  As a result, I struggle with anxiety and depression disorders really badly in the workplace.  I don't want to end up broke and homeless like I was as a child, I am trying so hard to maintain things, but it's so fucking hard.  

The holiday isn't helping much...my family and I don't really talk anymore, my parents both hate me (I was a mistake by two people who hated each other).  I'm a reminder of that mistake.  Here I am, 40 some odd years later, and I can't stop thinking of just ending this now, except I have a partner and a dog who love me very much.  But this depression and sadness just colors everything, and I have a hard time reciprocating.  I feel completely useless and seeing happy families today everywhere makes me feel worthless as well.  I've done all the therapy and all the drugs and all the meditation schemes and DBT and everything but nothing seems to work.  I'm at my wit's end here.  I hate myself so much.",25Dec2018,1
92,Idk why but I can’t stand saying “thank you” or “I love you” and polite words of that matter. Like when I say it I feel a shiver and I feel like a total fruit saying it and I just hate it and I dread holidays because I know those words are gonna be thrown around like a hacky sack. Does anyone else relate/understand why this might be the case?,25Dec2018,1
93,"Type 1 is kind of your standard person. I feel balanced-emotionally, and remain in relatively good spirits. I am witty and don’t really take much seriously, making jokes about everything I see. I can communicate genuinely and although I’m still a bit awkward, I still make decent attempts to converse with people. 

Type 2’s something else. I see everything very objectively and feel emotionally indifferent to everything. Anything happens, anybody says anything, and my brain is just like “ok”. I’m very silent and don’t talk to anybody unless I’m prompted to. I’m quiet by default but I’d describe type 2 as just anti-social, trying to resolve people attempts at socialization with short direct responses. I notice a small spike in paranoia when I’m in public, thinking everybody’s looking at me, judging my appearance, etc. 

I’m pretty sure type 1 is the “real me” but I don’t know why I switch to type 2 every so often. I don’t know if it’s a true personality shift or if it’s a type of depression that comes and goes. Really wish I could see a psychiatrist and get to the bottom of it all. ",25Dec2018,1
94,I’m looking forward to it now. I can’t stop cleaning myself basically. This hasn’t been a problem for a while it’s started today but I’ve already brushed my teeth 4-5 time and I’ve had the brush for less than a day. I’m anxious now because it got a little dirty from all the brushing and I can’t clean it. I’ve also been concerned lately more with how tidy things are and organized but I haven’t been to worried about cleanliness until today. My therapist some time ago mentioned ocd as a possibility to me but I never feel like I HAVE to do anything it’s just if I don’t it bothers me. Idk what’s happening.

96,"First of all, hey.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to begin. But here goes nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Generally speaking, I live a pretty normal life. I have a job that I adore, I'm a self-published author, martial arts black belt - everything seems great on the surface.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there's something that's driving me insane. And I don't fucking know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel extremely paranoid most of the time, especially when it comes to physical violance. I can't socialize, go out or do anything of that nature without feeling that someone is going to assault me at any given point in time (I want some piercings, but I'm afraid that they would become a target to ""rip out"" if an attack happens, so I heitate to get them).

&amp;#x200B;

I have seemingly random ""crying episodes"". Usually when I see something that relates to depression (like ads on the internet saying that ""you're not alone""; ""have hope"" and so on).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really angry most of the time. The 'dread' angry-type.

&amp;#x200B;

IDK if it's related, but I often have severe headaches, nausea, different unexplainable pains through ought the body.

&amp;#x200B;

What the actual fuck is wrong with me? Thank you in advance.",25Dec2018,1
97,"Hey, this is my first time posting here.

In recent times I have recognized that I tend to go through cycles of what seems to me like hypomanic and depressive phases. I can be happy and productive for period of time and suddenly fall into a period of depression where I feel sad and lonely, lose motivation, and tend to want to sleep for way longer and take naps often. This has been going on for about the last 2 years. I’ve done some research and many of the symptoms I am experiencing align with those of Cyclothymia.

The thing is I don’t really have a reason to be sad. I don’t come from a broken home, I have a loving and caring family and I have a great group of friends that I’ve been close with throughout high school and some even closer to 12 years. I do fine at school and experience the stresses that the typical 18 year old South African male would experience during this time of their life. I don’t have suicidal thoughts and I wouldn’t describe my sadness as being very extreme but it does hinder my ability to get things done and focus. 

A couple of my friends feel comfortable talking to me about their feelings and I gladly listen and advise where I can. But for some reason I can’t really grasp I just don’t really feel comfortable opening up to anyone about how I feel without brushing it off afterward and feeling stupid. A post I saw on here sums it up perfectly - “does anyone here hate talking about their feelings but hate keeping them in too?” That’s my sentiment. I think I would have a different mindset with a professional. 

So I guess my question is: would it be a good idea make an appointment with a psychiatrist even if I wouldn’t describe my “condition” as being very serious?

Thanks and merry Christmas :)",25Dec2018,1
98,"Hi all, I hope to hear from actual parents and/or adult children who experience(d) this on some way.
I have been very anxious for the past month or so about coming home for Christmas. My main worry is how things would be once I got to my mom's to stay the holidays. It never goes well, and this year is no exception. I was this close to not come to the dinner and spend the Eve with my Dad instead. My family is number 1 on my list of reasons why I am so anxious, guarded and self-conscious. 

My mom is really critical of most things me and my two brothers do (we are all 3 adults 25 yo+, gone from home) to the point that any visit back home is 100% bound to create disputes. I came home from Christmas and I get ""You could have fixed the curtains for me, you can see that they don't hang right. But of course I always have to say it first! You never do anything for me, I shouldn't have to ask."" If I do one thing (I replaced all the light bulbs in her house, with LED lights because she always complains of high electricity costs), she barely takes notice. There is always something ELSE that she wanted us to do. And because we can't read her mind, we didn't do it.

She also has this habit to ask us to get her something in the house, but will never actually say exactly where it is. And when we ask more details, we get ""Where do you think it is? You know that it is not going to be in the bathroom, right?!. You keep looking, I am busy here, I won't come and look for you. I can never ask you anything!""

We get in huge arguments because she says we blow up her electricity and water bills with our unconsiderate comsuption, while forgetting that having 3 grown ups full-time (because holidays) instead of just 1 is bound to increase the bills. Pure dishonesty. 

She has always been very strict and very controlling, everyone in the extended family says so as well. 

She is also often self-involved. She is often oblivious (on purpose?) about what usually goes on at Christmas. We ALWAYS have this little charade of hiding Xmas gifts for the kids' sake and distracting them to have time to place them under the tree. But she seems to ignore this every year, and even starts unpacking her presents before everybody is gathered and the gift ""ceremony"" has started. I tell her ""just wait for the kids to start at least"", but she doesn't give a damn. One year she even said to a niece who was thanking everybody for a gift she got ""No it is not thank you everyone, it is thank you Auntie because I offered it to you"". The niece is a kid btw...

I wonder about her mental health, or whether this is just her character... 

Sorry it is a long post but I have so many examples of what I consider angrying/stressful but also worrying behavior. I have tried telling her that I would like Xmas eve and Xmas day to go better than normal, but that went down very poorly. She changed the subject to mention something I failed at and told me about how I never wanted to do chores as a child.

This is unhealthy, I cry at least once a visit. This morning I was close to hitting something with my fist, I was so angry at her attitude. But am I right to want to stay away? I can't help but fear about how hurt she will be. And if this will just deepen her general unhappiness.",25Dec2018,1
99,"Now don’t @ me I’m not saying this is all public figures or even any of them... I’m just saying something feels weird. It feels like specifically youtubers (nothing against youtube, it’s what I spend most of my time doing) are turning depression, anxiety, and other disorders into almost a... trend. I have nothing against it being talked about, dammit, it should be talked about. But the way it’s talked about now feels weird. The sad face thumbnails with the lowercase titles and dramatic elipses feels just... like a cruel marketing ploy... I don’t know. Again, not everyone, just some. For example, I won’t name who obviously but a youtuber that I like a lot posted a picture of themselves shirtless holding a sign talking about people who may feel unsafe on Christmas. The picture, however, seemed more focused on their face and showing off themselves rather than focused on the support. They even had what I think was a fake bruise on their cheek. And it just that seemed so weird. It felt so off I unfollowed them. I don’t know. They’ve been doing stuff like this a lot lately and it felt so weird. Not saying they meant to or they do have bad intentions or this is bad I’m saying something feels off. But then again I’m probably off although it may be nice to hear feedback on this topic.",25Dec2018,1
100,"Ok, so here goes nothing. I am going to try to explain my mental health issue, and then try to get opinions from you guys if possible please. I am 21 years old, and am not sure what my condition is yet, since I have only been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety, but there is more, but I have been told it could be some type of bipolar or schizophrenia by psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners. Ok, so I use to be a Christian by faith, and  my issue started, when one day, I asked myself if it was fair that God was all mighty and powerful, and that we would always be under his ruling. I felt that it was not, so then I surely thought I was going to hell. I felt evil, and I tried really hard to just accept that God just was always going to be all powerful, with authority over everyone, and that no one could ever be as strong as him, and I just felt that this was not right. I could just not accept that in my heart, even though I tried. I tried praying to God and telling ""him"" that if he wanted he could just somehow change my mind and make me believe/understand that such concept was the right thing. I also tried praying and told him to just straight up take my life to end my suffering because I felt evil thinking like that. Reason why I felt evil also, was because according to the bible, the devil became the devil because he tried to be as mighty as God. I actually conceptually and philosophically did see how trying to overthrow someone is wrong, but to try to be as mighty as someone without hurting, was not wrong. So yea, I felt really evil. For obvious reasons, I am no longer religious, plus I always had my doubts about religion. Anyways, then I started thinking about old-time/ancient hierarchies. How kings and queens used to be more powerful than anyone, and had authority over everyone, and also had authority over their grown children. So, in a way I felt trapped because I translated that into how my parents would always in a sense be ""greater"" than me, with authority over me, no matter what I did. Don't get my wrong, I love my parents, but such ideas in my head lead me to just feel like I was in a hell, thinking about how it just felt unfair that just because they are my parents, even if they don't have authority over me per say, they are somehow ""greater"" than me because they created me, and because of that, I would always be under their dominion. So that's what I a currently fighting. I thought about the=is everyday for probably 2 years now, so even though sometimes I might begin to think that my parents do not have that type of dominion over me, I somehow deep down in my head think that they do. I guess I thought about this so much, that it got stuck in my head. It's horrible and to be honest did ruin my life. I had never really had anything like this happen to me. I get anxiety attacks, and went through some, really, really dark times because of this. An opinion I would like from you guys since you guys might be more clear on this topic since you guys haven't had your brains fried by this exact idea is, what is your guy's opinion on that parent-to-adult-child dominion thing. Are parents just always going to be greater beings than heir children because they made their children? I even feel evil for feeling that such is not fair, so I get even more anxious. I know the idea might sound ridiculous to some of you, and I somehow do understand how others could view it that way, but it is very, very serious to me. I just want honest opinions though, please don't lie to me of your opinions just to try to ""help"" me. Thanks, I really would appreciate those opinions. Oh, by the way, I am spending half of my Christmas alone at a coffee shop because I had a bad panic attack and headache earlier when I was with my fam.",25Dec2018,1
101,"It's not like I want to get away from my life although I hate most aspects of my life as well. I'm very annoyed by myself. I always want to be doing something to better myself in some way and it's draining. I'm constantly learning skills and stressing over how I'm not doing enough. I don't feel like my existence is justified. I can't stand the thought that my life only exists to continue till I rot away and die. I feel so old and knowing I can't have kids, knowing I likely won't ever have a satisfying job and it's a toss up for if I find a relationship but I don't like sex so I think I'm going to die single, with very few friends and very few family that I don't even want to be close with. All the media I consume as an escape, to wind down, are mostly songs about how horrible life is. I feel sad listening to anything happier than songs whose lyrics read like a suicide note, they strike me as unrealistically happy. I also don't like most tv shows, the only shows I like are all cartoons and I'm getting sick of that as well.

102,"These past few months I've been thinking that I've been getting better, and maybe overcoming some of my depression and anxiety. But out of all days, on Christmas, I'm realizing I was never getting better. I was just getting better at distracting myself from.. myself. 

Does that make sense? 

Like instead of acknowledging how sad or anxious I am, I shoved my face even deeper into social media. I smoked a little more than usual, I drank a litte more than usual. I blocked everything out around me and blasted music, fantasized about an alternate universe for hours and hours. 

Like the past four days I've gotten only between 2-4 hours of sleep a day, only one meal a day, and been getting drunk every night for a week. I don't really know what made me realize this, but I need to get my *shit* together. ",25Dec2018,1
