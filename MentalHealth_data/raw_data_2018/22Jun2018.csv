1,"So, I don't think this is a matter of developing some skill I like.  I can be plenty friendly or chill at times.  But, a lot of the time, I am simply not in a friendly mood, I maybe feel ""bored""/agitated, and I just don't care about whatever the other person is saying.  This is probably related to a form of depression (I already see a therapist).

Do you all have any advice?  I feel like if it would be possible to socialize with the same group of people 5 days in a row week after week like in elementary school, I would be much better at talking to people and getting to know them better.  Instead, if I join a meetup or rec league or whatever, I typically can only see the group at most once a week, and it's also sort of a hassle to travel to and from the event location.  It feels like I can never gain any ""social momentum"", and every day I have to adapt to a new group while my brain meanwhile forgets about the previous group.  I don't care about being part of 50 groups.  I really just need one for core well-being, and the other ones can come as supplements.",22Jun2018,2,
2,"So I'm fucking angry. I have spent the majority of my life battling illnesses and learned to draw comics to share stories of my disabilities with others, I decided to do it full time and really put my all into helping people in the community. On all social media I don't just post things I try to help in any way I can, I have a mental health podcast and always try my best to be a positive contributor to the community. I have my comic, which is 80% for free, on Patreon because it's a great platform to host a blog, podcast, comic etc. It has everything needed and yes, god forbid, it'd be great for a poverty stricken person like myself to earn something voluntarily off what I do. 

I've got some sour fucking jerk following my posts making snide comments like I'm trying to rip everyone off by sharing the link to my fucking FREE comics and podcast about mental health WITH mental health communities. Whoever they are likes to insinuate that I'm attempting to extort the community with my FREE works. I'm fucking sick of it. Just because someone posts a link doesn't mean they're trying to trick you out of money, maybe they're trying to share a positive message in the best way they know how, maybe it's not the end of civility if that person attempts to make $1 a month off 20% of their work. Maybe it makes you a disgusting piece of crap to follow people around trying to bring their works down. You want to be self righteous asshole? Think of a better solution instead of making incorrect assumptions and patting yourself on the back for your own ignorance. 

To the people who don't think they're amazing for being jerks, it's been great talking to you, I hope I brought something positive to your experience here. To the people who desperately need to feel better than everyone else, sincerely fuck off. You're not clever, you're an idiot.

3,"For the record I have been diagnosed with autism, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychosis. I'm currently on Zoloft, Wellbutrin XL, and Latuda.

Every waking moment I feel like I want to die. I can't stop thinking about it. I've thought of a few ways. My first attempt was when I was 7 years old, in the kitchen, with a meat cleaver against my throat. My brother saw me and told on me to our dad that I was playing with the knives. 

I finally decided to get help last year. My first therapist left the practice. My new therapist believes breathing will solve everything. It doesn't. I am also seeing a psychiatrist. I've been on several different medications. Either they don't work or work for a bit then stop. 

I'm done telling my friends about all this. I don't want to be a burden on them anymore, or anyone for that matter. I don't think my spouse understands. I don't think anyone understands. Everyone believes this is all reactionary to something. Not even my doctors believe it is just there and isn't caused by my relationships, my mom, or anything else. They don't understand I hurt and I don't want to hurt anymore. 

I wish I didn't have anyone in my life so I can just pull that trigger and be done with this pain. 

It's not a matter of if anymore but a matter of when. I'm a lost cause.

4,"As a father of 3 and owner of my own construction biz, I’ve dedicated some on my attention in the last few years to finding ways to build up my resilience to stress/anxiety. I’ve dealt with mild to severe anxiety for much of my life and refuse to believe that I need to throw in the towel and choose a “simpler life” even though that seems like the best option sometimes. Maybe I’m just stubborn but I believe that all humans are here to achieve their full potential (in whatever way they define that) regardless of their personal circumstances. I’ve learned in the last couple of years that I have a very sensitive autonomic nervous system. I stay in fight/flight much more than is healthy for me. I currently do annual blood testing with my naturopath that checks about a hundred different things. I also am on a no gluten, dairy, or sugar diet. The diet and supplements have helped but my nervous systems still gets into very uncomfortable overdrive about once a week. Does anyone have any advice on ways to improve/strengthen my CNS. Long-term Solutions are fine (meditation for example)... not necessarily looking for a quick fix. Any experiences would be helpful.

TLDR - Does anyone have any advice on ways to improve/strengthen my nervous systems so that I can become more resilient to stress/anxiety and not go into fight/flight so easily?

5,"I went up to my local mental health clinic today and got signed up for a doctor. My appointment is not until the end of next month and I'm really upset about it. Every single day is torture, I have BPD and I'm having an extremely hard time maintaining stability. I'm not suicidal so I don't need to go inpatient, plus I really don't have the time for it. I am a stay at home mom and we can't afford for my husband to take off 3+ days. I feel hopeless, like no one understands how serious it is. I need medication now, help now, I do not want to live like this anymore. It feels unbearable to have to wait more than a month. Does anyone have any ideas? I don't know what to do. ",22Jun2018,2,

7,"So I've been diagnosed with depression for awhile now, having it gotten pretty severe the past year or so. I usually have zero motivation to do anything, even getting out of bed is hard for me most days. I just dwell on all the bad things about myself and my life. 

*Except* for the occasional times where that all seems to disappear and I suddenly feel great, like I can do anything, pursue all my goals/dreams and achieve them no problem, all the bad things I was dwelling on don't matter anymore, I just have the need to get up and do all the things I need/want to do and nothing can stop me. Until the depression hits again. Those good moods can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, and I try to cling to them as much as possible because in those moments, I'm finally happy. But like I said, it doesn't last too long. 

I really only have two moods at this point - I don't just get sad, I get beyond depressed; I feel like my life is ruined/pointless and ending everything is my only way out. 
And I don't just get happy in those brief moments I mentioned - I get ecstatic; everything is great, my life is amazing, I'm gonna accomplish *everything* I want to, etc.

So to cut to the point; I'm just wondering if anyone else who deals with depression also has these moments? I'm tired of the back and forth, I just kinda wish I could have a set mood that didn't change randomly for no reason whatsoever. Thanks in advance to anyone who comments. ",22Jun2018,1,
8,"I have always found that I have a tendency to be ""slower"" cognitively than other people and it seems to effect pretty much everything I do. I am slow at math and mind puzzles, in social situations I am boring because I cant think of what to say on the spot (of course I can't flirt with girls because of this), I have tried to teach myself different languages and have always found myself unable to keep up no matter how much I study, I suck at sports, even in video games I find that I always lose to my friends. Every time I have done badly at these things I have thought maybe I just need to practice more, but with all these things piling up I am almost certain there is some cognitive processing issue causing this, and this is something that cannot be changed. But I don't see how I can cope with this. I have nothing to feel good about myself for, so I have no self esteem and am constantly depressed and angry at seeing my brothers and other guys outshine me, especially with girls. And people generally have no sympathy for someone like me, they would just see me as dumb and worthless. I can't live with this.

10,"It's the first time i post in this website, so i'm guessing that i'm in the right place. First pardon my english, it's not my first language , so i'd probably make some mistakes in my text. To my mind, i have a overall good understanding of the english language even though writing and speaking aren't my strengths. 

Yesterday, i went to see my psychiatrist, it was the first time that we meet ,previously i was followed by different psychiatrists since last year even though my main problem started before. I went through 2 months of hospitalization and i'd been administrated to a psychiatrist following my exit around February.  I then  left the country for a period of 3 months and didn't see any psychiatrist during my absence. But i take the medication that was given to me . At my return, i went to see a psychiatrist with whom i had an appointment. I excepted that she will follow but i wasn't the case. She told me that she was just there to make an evolution to see if i was a threat for myself or others to which she said no at the end of the meeting and she then tell me that there is no need to meet again and that i should try to follow her advises (Overall she kind of imposed me  a way of thinking and acting that was totally a huge no for me ). She also didn't take any interest in asking me about my anxieties , she was just trying to see if i was a threat. 

So i'm now left with medications and no one that could help me with my issues. I went to see another service , they fix me an appointment the 29th, but they aren't psychiatrists just social workers if i'm not wrong. 

I hope that this time they will act with more empathy . I just don't know how to handle all this by myself. I don't have anyone who could help me around me. The only person with whom i speak are my mother and my dad, i only have 4 friends but i rarely see them except one because they are busy with works and so on. Since i graduated from high school ,i got myself deeper in isolation. i rarely went outside except to go to appointments and driving around when my dad ask me to deliver things he want.

I’m just wondering is it normal for me (male ,age 14) to not be sympathetic or empathetic to people. Honestly I find it odd that people preoccupy themselves with something so seemingly unimportant as emotional attachment. If I was emotionally attached to my father I’m sure that instead of feeling quite content right now I would be feeling all sorts of terrible things. I just find it pathetic that people will let grief and sadness take up their time. ",22Jun2018,2,
13,"Hey everyone,

I’ve seen a lot of questions and such in this sub about psychosis and what it’s like, and some of you will know all too well, so I thought I’d share the short version of what I went through and experienced during my psychotic break.  Since it’s actually been 3 years to the day now that all of this got started, which is a little bit wild to think about, I’ve had some time with it, told different parts of this story to different people at different points, reflected a lot and gone through treatment, and I’m actually working on writing out the long version too.  At any rate though, for your interest and consideration, here’s what it’s like to completely lose your mind:

To begin with, I couldn’t say I was a completely well young man at the start of all of this.  I was 26 and I think I had been dealing with undiagnosed Bipolar for a solid 6 or 7 years by then, addressing some of the symptoms in a variety of ways, but not with great effect.

I was in a bad lifestyle situation, which included being about 5,000 miles away from my girlfriend of 4 years at the time, and the catalyzing factor was that we broke up but more specifically that we couldn’t do it in the right way.  We had a great relationship, but it was getting to the point where neither of us were sure we were really supposed to be together and the distance wasn’t making sense anymore.  That much was tough, but it wasn’t the end of the world.  We knew we’d remain good friends (and have in fact, keeping in touch and valuing each other very much to this day), that our relationship was just changing, not ending, and so on, but what was really intolerable was that such a major thing was happening to us and when the Skype call ended, that was just it.  We couldn’t work through it in any reasonable way, we couldn’t be there for each other, and we couldn’t properly say goodbye.

This much was anathema to me.  We hadn’t been penpals; we had lived together off and on as visas allowed, been through major life changes and milestones together, and overall had an enormously significant relationship that meant the world to both of us, and that was just it?  “Beep boop” and it’s gone?  And we can’t even touch each other?

Over the next few days I decided I couldn’t stand for that to be our ending, and I got it in my head that I was going to scrape together whatever money I could beg or borrow, get my ass over to Europe, and do this thing the right way.  For both our sakes I wanted for us to be able to give our past and each other our due.

So before long I was on a plane to London, in spite of the fact that for a number of different reasons our communication lines were down.  I made plans to be there for a couple of weeks while we worked out when we’d have the chance to meet up, what with her being all over France, where she lived, at the time and taking a long-planned trip to Japan in the middle of it all.  It was squirrelly, but I figured at least the trip to my favorite city on its own would be good for me.  I knew that the last thing I could do was stay home where I was miserable and just sit in it.

When I arrived I tried to keep myself busy and occupied (going to places I loved, doing new things) while I waited for us to be able to get in touch, and that worked for a few days, but as time went on my condition worsened due to a number of high-stress factors.  I was unable to sleep, I was pingponging around the city every couple of days headed to the next affordable accommodations, I wasn’t eating well, I was hypomanic off and on, I was worried about being paid some money I was owed by a job back in the States because my bank account was running on empty, trying to get over the jet lag, etc. etc. etc.  So I was majorly strung out on the situation, on top of my grief and my anxieties and so on.

I stopped on the street a couple of times throughout these few days to weep uncontrollably, sitting down on some steps or a rock wall here or there, and I’m actually proud to say that on both occasions I was joined by a kind passerby who stopped to help a stranger.  In both cases they were British women in their 30s or 40s with kind voices whose faces I never saw through the tears, and I can only remember them as my angels.  Anything could have happened to me when I was down like that, but they stopped to look after me for a minute and asked, “What’s happened?” and I was able to get enough off my chest to get back on my way again.

So I’m spiraling down, trying to keep my spirits up, and the same time I’m loving everything that I love about the city, having great experiences and seeing incredible things.  I’m having intense experiences around the clock.  Cut to, the girlfriend and I finally get in touch.  She’s beside herself with worry, agrees to meet in Paris, we have a short call where we start setting things up and then we have to wait to figure out the logistics.  So we go silent again and between being unspeakably relieved and overjoyed by the progress, the pain that relief enabled me to get in touch with, the uncertainty of the immediate future, and probably several other factors, I completely lose any idea of what to do with myself and I gradually slip deeper and deeper into an exhausted manic state (without at the time actually recognizing that or understanding what it was or what it meant).  And over the next 24 or 48 hours I start getting more and more loopy.

The timeline gets a little fuzzy here, but there’s one night right in the middle there where I finally went off the deep end.  At somewhere around 10:00 at night or so, I came upon the profound impression that the internet was a sentient being, and that it was talking to me.  I was sitting in front of my computer, scrolling through feeds and news and whatnot, and gradually I began to perceive the presence of this entity or consciousness.  I considered it to be hiding in plain sight, which made the experience all the more bizarre because I perceived the entire internet to be an elaborate experiment created by this entity to smoke out the person who would be able to interact with it (and lucky me, that person was me).  Basically I would look through a page and perceive it as containing messages from both real people and what you might call NPCs, which I perceived to be various manifestations of the entity itself.  Some of the messages I also interpreted as “mine”, in that I perceived them as parallel projections of my own consciousness that had been generated by the system at random and I would be able to talk to “it” by choosing what I wanted to say by “liking” the messages I thought were mine.  I went on to interpret this in still more bizarre ways, but that’s where it started.

This led to a bizarre exchange where I got onto a Twitter page where I was constructing a dialogue in paragraphs by piecing together messages from all over the page, some where it was talking, some where I was talking, and we had an engaging banter.

It was funny and delightful at the time.  It was a kind of game.  I sensed its awareness of me as I went on, and how I was getting more and more of its attention because of the way I was interacting with it.  It was like being able to see a face in the matrix code.  And it had an impish, amusing attitude.  In short, I met the ghost in the machine and it was quite a character.  We even had “inside jokes” about what had taken place in my life over the preceding few days, it knew everything about my situation, and it knew something about what was going to take place the following day.

So that night ended with “it” saying that I should get some sleep because tomorrow was a very big day, and when I woke up this persisted.  I interpreted my “mission” and task from what I believed was cleverly woven into the fabric of what I was reading, and from there even search suggestions about where I was going and what music I wanted to hear had meaning and significance.

From there, for reasons I’ll explain when I write the long version, I set out in search of the Royal Institution, the old headquarters of the Royal Society near Exhibition Row, because I think I’m supposed to have a meeting there, which evolved into my belief that I was going to be inducted and receive some prestigious awards.

I set out with nothing but a water bottle and what accoutrements I carried in my pockets, leaving everything behind, and I didn’t realize until later but I switched my phone over into airplane mode because I wanted to be separated from this entity, which by now I was interpreting as a vast force that permeated the world in which I was living, until I got there.  I got lost a couple of times on the way, the subway system having become increasingly difficult to navigate over the last few days.  I would space out on the train and miss my stop, go to the other platform and catch it going the other direction, overshoot again, rinse, and repeat, all the while being vaguely under the impression that my progress towards my destination was being monitored and tracked by “them” through the security cameras.

Eventually I decided I was getting off the merry-go-round and I was gonna walk from where I was.  I looked at the map, but couldn’t seem to make sense of it, so I asked a station agent for directions, feeling of two minds as to whether she was one of them or just a civilian placed there to help me by them.  I decided I was going to cut across my route diagonally through Hyde Park, enjoying the lovely weather (nice of them to put it on for me), stopping here and there to have blissful, profound experiences of the minutiae of my journey.  A tiny bug, for example, a gnat of some kind, flew into my eye and I felt sure it was a new species that I would present on arrival.

In everything I did and everything I experienced, I was seeing clues and solving puzzles and influencing and participating in these things, and everything my attention fell upon became integrated into what was now a sprawling, epic adventure.  A man in a Swedish national football jersey would pass me for example, and I would think he was an agent for the Nobel people.  I would see “them” here and there, kind of the way that Matt Damon sees agents darting in and out of his world in The Adjustment Bureau.

I passed street performers whose acts I interpreted wildly, I recognized all kinds of endlessly amusing things about the geography of the institutions and businesses as I approached the area with the V&amp;A and the Museum of Natural History.  I stopped to have funny little conversations with people or bum tobacco.  Basically I felt when I woke up that morning that it was the first day of a glorious new age for the world, and I was basking in it on my long, pleasant stroll towards my destiny.

Basically what happened is that I got lost again, unable to find the RI building, and when I ended up where I thought I was supposed to be I was near a map that seemed to point me back to the Museum of Natural History.  In a similarly circuitous way I made my way back and went inside, and I went up to the steps with the statue of Charles Darwin, and I felt that an auspicious meeting was to take place on that spot.  This came to mean I thought I would finally see my girlfriend, and there were signs and symbols leading me to that conclusion all around.

I sat there for a minute, and when she didn’t materialize I was meditating on the moment, watching the people, and a member of the museum’s staff tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Sir, come this way please,” and it didn’t occur to me that they just wanted me off the steps.  I thought I was supposed to follow this person through the galleries, and I ended up at an interactive display about the progression of the museum’s directors throughout the years, along with some of its earliest, most precious specimens.  Naturally I interpreted this to mean I was going to be named the next director of the museum and that something I had was going to be encased in glass alongside these dinosaur bones and ostrich skeletons, and I’d live in this cathedral of science and use it as my base of operations.  That would be my Bruce Wayne/Tony Stark persona and cover, and like a comic book character I would have this other secret mission and purpose to fight the evil in people’s lives.

I found a touchscreen display of a large, leather bound edition of Audubon’s ‘Birds of North America’ (another sign), right next to all of this, and I swear, at exactly the moment when I touched the cover and it opened, I heard “Bong, bong... the museum is now closing...”  I took this to mean that this would have happened whenever that book was “opened” (I had “solved” another puzzle in order to do so, and I imagined as another totem, cleverly disguised as a non-functioning museum display to trick the general public), that it had been waiting there for me, and that meant I had completed that “level” of the game.  I waited as people started filtering out and then I caused a bit of a scene and went wandering through the empty galleries until I was directed into a storage closet by some more of the museum’s staff.

I say a closet, but it was more like a corridor, with a locked door at the opposite end, as well as a staircase going down in the middle, and when I found that I was stuck I began trying to work out what I was supposed to do or learn or find there, prying inside cupboards and high voltage electrical boxes, and I took on the belief that inside some locked cabinets in this unassuming little place were the prototypes for all the different manifestations of life on our planet.  I was frustrated with being cut off from them so I basically trashed this little room, but I did so in a way where each action had symbolic meaning, like an art project.  I thought I was supposed to leave that room in a specific state that would mean something to those who were interpreting my actions.  There was a confrontation with museum security, the police were called.  It ended up taking about six of them to drag me away from what I thought was my new home.

I continued babbling, coherently but nonsensically, interspersed with lucid conversations with the police constables and jailers, somehow still completely full of energy.  Continued like this, talking to myself constantly in solitary confinement, badgering and berating those in charge, being pulled from the room to answer questions from time to time.  Turns out I was waiting on an ambulance to take me to whatever mental hospital would have me, and about 24 hours later I was on my way, still without having slept for any significant duration.

They took me in in the dead of night, so as not to disturb the other patients, and by then there was this whole other subplot where I was acting as though Inception was a documentary and I was getting ready to head for another level of the dreamworld.  To simplify the rest of this story, which is already quite long for Reddit, I got diagnosed with ‘acute polymorphic psychotic disorder with schizophrenic symptoms’got on some meds, and gradually came back to this planet over the following two weeks. My mom came over from the States to help me through it and get me back home, and then it took a few months before I started making it back to “normal”.  By then we were calling it Bipolar I, and the treatment plan that came out of that was successful.

I wish I could tell you about the hundreds and hundreds of little embellishing details, all the weird things that happened to reinforce the delusions and all the things that got warped into my reality.  I remember almost everything, and despite how strange it all must seem I was entirely coherent and lucid the entire time, even if what I was experiencing was so off the map when things were morphing and rearranging themselves in such a bizarre way.  I’m sure I’ll get it all out on paper when I write the long version of this story.

My symptoms have been under control since then, and I’ve been conscientious about my treatment and about getting better.  The recovery is a whole other part of the story, but I’ll stop here for now.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR - ...I don’t know what to tell you.  What’s above are the bullet points.

Oh, and I forgot to mention it, but the title of this post (which I think will be the title of the memoir), comes from a moment where, as the police were trying to talk me down they asked me what my name was, and both the question itself and my own given name meant nothing to me, so I simply replied, “Chaos.”",22Jun2018,2,
14,"**possible t/w:** mention of self harm/suicide.

hey there everyone! i hope i'm posting this in the right place, and i'm really sorry if i'm not. i have a few questions relating to adolescent mental health units in the UK, and i would be really grateful if i could get some help here. i've tried emailing people from CAMHS but unfortunately have yet to hear back.

so, for the sake of context, i feel it's necessary to explain why i'm here in the first place: at the moment i'm currently writing a literary fiction novel which deals with a variety of issues, some of which include the vast gap between different socioeconomic classes (and what this really means for the characters), substance abuse and addiction, as well as mental health. the novel's protagonist is a young man living with depression and the story focuses on how his depression impacts his relationships with those around him over the course of his teenage years.

as part of the novel's plot, he attempts suicide for the second time at seventeen and is hospitalised shortly afterwards. he has a history of suicidal ideations and self harm, and at this point is considered extremely likely to reattempt if he were to be left alone. initially i had never considered the possibility of him being sectioned for his own safety, but it occurred to me recently that in that case there's no other likely outcome.

anyway, as a result of this decision, i've been doing some research into the mental health laws in england; i'm a little unfamiliar with them as i myself am from ireland. i've looked into the mental health act and i understand the reasons needed to section a person and also the duration of time they can be sectioned for, but my question is this: if you were to be sectioned in an adolescent mental health unit such as the PICUs offered by CAMHS, are you entitled to leave these units with permission for a certain period of time? section seventeen of the MHA says that you may be entitled to leave the ward if granted permission by the relevant doctors, but i'm just wondering if this is the case for adolescents also.

if anyone has any information with this kind of an experience then i would be so, so grateful for your feedback and input! i want to create as accurate a portrayal as possible, and so i would really love to hear from someone who's experienced something similar.

thank you in advance!",22Jun2018,1,

18,"I am from America. My dad was diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder and my Mom has a thyroid problem causing a lot of stress and anxiety. I was a pretty normal kid until I turned 16. When I was 16 I was on a political forum discussing Brexit on a sticky. I was updating the forum and someone posted child porn pics. I panicked and left the site and felt horrible.

I eventually forgot about it until I got hit with the thought again and felt like a piece of shit for not doing anything about it. So I talked to my schools police officer about the whole thing. He explained to me about why people post that and I didnt do anything wrong because there isnt much you can do about it.

I felt very relived but for some reason the thoughts wouldnt leave. They would get worse and I kept thinking about how much of a piece of shit I was and how I dont deserve to live. That time in my life was horrible and the thought of just killing myself was common. I would never do it but thinking of it relived some of the feelings, like I have a way out. I eventually went to the doctor when I turned 18 to try to figure out why I feel such anxiety and sickness about it. She belives I might have a minor bout of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Im on the smallest milligram of Citalopram. The feelings have lessened and I feel much better about things. I dont think about suicide anymore. But these thoughts still hang with me and I wonder if there is something wrong with me. Maybe what my mom and dad have is affecting me?

19,"I have always struggled with myself a lot. I'm self-destructive. I have anxiety and a whole lot of anger and a lot of trauma that I carry around. At times, I've abused substances to cope. I spontaneously do reckless things to release all of this tension that builds up under my skin. I've broken my hand from punching something in a rage. I've gotten high and drunk alone more times than I can count. I've been on the edge of ending my own life a few times.

The problem is, I'm very high functioning. Nobody sees any of this darkness. People describe me as friendly, optimistic, responsible, smart, easygoing, etc. I don't know how to outwardly express all of the turmoil that happens on the inside. When I'm around people I am bubbly and kind. I never fail to meet all of my responsibilities. I don't know how to be anything else and so when I tell people I'm not so stable, they don't believe me. 

Therapists and psychiatrists don't even believe me. They tell me I'm being too hard on myself and my emotions are normal.

I don't want to self diagnose anything.

I have a huge lack of self confidence. I suffer from major panic attacks as well as chronic migraines. And now I think I am headed down a road of depression although identifying as a generally positive energetic person my whole life up until now. I recently quit a job I had for the past year thinking it would help and I haven't seen many changes. I feel like I am in a rut and I need to get out of it. Yet I don't have the energy to do it. I wake up and resort to video games as thats where I find happiness in my apartment (as I am on break from school and no job at the moment). I try and do stuff I know i've been passionate about in the past but it seems that negativity just fills me instead. I just don't know what to do. 

A big contributor has been my dating life, talking and meeting girls at my university just seems to reinforce my idea that people suck. I feel like I do a good job hiding all this negativity in person as my friends always tell me I am the nicest and happiest person they know, and then I always get screwed over or treated horribly and I go back to hating people again and wanting to just sleep all day. I usually end up feeling lonely at nights however and I can't sleep, as my mind wanders leading to my panic attacks. Then I wake up with migraines. Its a constant loop. 

Im banking on the idea I was burnt out this past year with school, job, and other activities and that taking a mental break to chill out will let me recharge this summer. 

Anyone gone through this that has advice?

Lately, I've been curious as to how common my way of thinking might be.  I assume I'll die by suicide. I don't do it because I know it would cause upset to my partner and my parents, but I know as well that it's statistically the most common cause of death for men in my age group even before you take into account psychiatric diagnoses.  I'm OK with this being the way I'll go, even that it's probably going to be in the next few years.  I've rapidly made my peace with it over the last year or so.   At least it'll happen on my own terms.

We're all told the usual bullshit like ""go to a hospital"" or ""speak to someone"" or ""call this number"" but I'm also curious how many of us just lie when we're asked about suicide because of the inevitable hassle and mock concern it's just going to result in.  After all, I'm being offered the usual pills and talking now.  Admitting to thoughts of suicide won't get me anything but make it more difficult to get the pills.

Ok, this is long, for whoever is willing to read.

First I'll start with the backstory:

I've posted on Reddit before about having episodes of clinical depression, anxiety, and very serious OCD, which is apparently quite common among many Reddit users. Now I very  rarely post about this.

First off I'll say that my whole family (both sides) shunned me due to my emotional/mental maladies, as they see me as a ""lost cause"" and are embarrassed over the fact that I'm constantly broke and sick. However, it's no secret among many people who know them that they're highly toxic, narcissistic, and self-centred individuals. 

The only assistance comes from my father, in the form of pills, and I cannot contact him since he hangs up the phone on me. His wife hates me to death for some insane reason - she thinks that I'm a ""spiritual monster"" of sorts - she thought that since I was a teenager. And I believed her.

Now, for the life of me I've never ever harmed her or anyone else. She has a history of being very nasty to others, and has done plenty of harm, including neglecting her infant daughter and not recognising her (among other horrible things).

Both sides of my family see all who don't have money as lesser humans, and they're obsessed with wealth. It's disgusting. Since I'm ill and cannot make money, I'm literally worthless (my father said so), and not worthy of any help whatsoever. Why he helps with the medication is beyond me. Also, my full sister and half-brother told me to go **end my life**, calling me a coward for not going through with the plan.

Now, I've barely eaten in three days due to having almost zero funds after mismanaging my money, and no, it was not on drugs and/or alcohol. It was mostly on food, which I tend to vomit after eating, and stupidly enough, cabs to work. Ridiculous, I know.

Anyway, my funk became very serious. I'm a hermit living in squalor with my pet rats (the only happiness in my life), and a neurologist friend of my father decided to give me 15mg of Mirtazapine in addition to 60mg Cymbalta and 2mg Clonazepam. This doctor doesn't charge me a penny, since he's friends with my father.

So, stupid me, I started taking double - 30mg of Mirtazapine every evening because it helps me sleep quickly. I figured that since I didn't have enough funds to eat properly and had to stretch the little funds that I had, I'd drug myself to sleep and just wake up to feed my pets and then go back to sleep again. 

So today I show up at the job and ask my boss about the weekend bonus, which I rightfully earned. He said that it might not show up on the established date. That made me lose it. I went back to my seat, my head was spinning like crazy, and I was so furious that I started seeing red. I got up, walked up to my boss in a blind rage, snapped at him and cannot remember what I said (something about an emergency) anda somehow ended up in the company clinic.

The doctor took my pulse and said that it was fine (I'm hypertense to top it off). She then gave me orange blossom water to calm down the nerves and told me to not get up until she told me to.

I told her everything. She literally saved me from going crazy on my boss, and I'm anything **but** violent.

The doctor releases me and the obsession of the weekend bonus is not leaving me alone. So I go talk to my boss again, this time more calm and he said that the bonus ""might"" show up at the established date. Then I go to my locker, take the Clonazepam, and go back to my desk. Thirty minutes passed and I was completely calm. 

Now I'm back in my living quarters, and have no idea what will happen tomorrow. No rules were broken and I did not go crazy on my boss, but could have appeared menacing or something. 

Hopefully this will all work out, though.

Any advice would be more than welcome. ",22Jun2018,1,

I talk fairly openly about my depression with good friends, but never the Anxiety or Paranoia. And, because of these mental health issues, I have also developed a thing that now, the only people I can trust in a relationship (other than a friendship) are relatives.

33,"I’ve been seeing a therapist since January. Initially it was great because she had Saturdays and was 5 minutes from my house. About a month later, her office moved 30 minutes away, but I only have appointments every other week so I try to make it work. I have Saturdays off. When we need to cancel or reschedule, it’s always over text. So far, since she’s moved, she’s cancelled on me about once a month. I try to be understanding because she’s recently pregnant and I assume she doesn’t feel well.

Two weeks ago I had to reschedule with her for the first time. I gave the required 48 hours notice. It takes her a day to get back and says OK, asks when I’d like to reschedule. I ask “how about next Wednesday ?” No response. Now, it’s been almost TWO weeks and she texts me that she JUST got my text and says that now she no longer had Saturdays available but I may be able to do Wednesday’s from now on. It’s going to be difficult since I work and it’s 30 minutes away.

I really feel like she’s either trying to shake me because I’m not a weekly appointment, or maybe she’s just bad at her job? I’m really frustrated and have been trying to shake the feeling that I don’t feel like a priority to her. Our sessions aren’t terribly productive so I wouldn’t feel bad if I chose to not go anymore, but I HATE starting over with new therapists.

What do you think of this situation? Is this even normal?",22Jun2018,1,
34,"Hello!

I'm writing to you as a part of my psychotherapy assignment. My current focus there is to figure out what could I think about being a person with one eye only, which is pretty difficult because I had been seeing it all from a negative perspective for over 20 years so far. But I guess that before I ask you for help, I'll write the full story (scroll down to the penultimate for the actual request):

So, I'm male, almost in my thirties. I lost my eye as a result of retinoblastoma when I was three years old. My parents were very young when that happened - I was born when they were twenty. Before the surgery, they sought help from alternative medicine, hoping that energy medicine would help me given that science couldn't. Eventually I had my eye removed and... from what I remember, it was kind of like pretending that nothing happened. It wasn't something we talked about, though I can't now say exactly why.

I have vague memories of when my mother gave me a magazine that had one of those ""squint to see this in 3D"" pictures and I sadly told her I couldn't see anything. I don't remember getting any response from her other than her telling me she doesn't understand what it's like and being clearly sad. I didn't know who to talk about it, how to talk about it and as a result, what to think about it. And I defaulted to some nasty thoughts that had been haunting me for too long.

Another memory I have is when we're as a whole family at a zoo - I think I'm seven or something. They offer me some cotton candy and I have this thought that I can eat as much of it as I want because I'll always be inattractive anyway. My father always gave me this message that felt as if I was to be worthless without a girlfriend and I guess I already felt this vibe in a way when I was seven.

Then, after pretty normal kindergarten, primary school happened. And it was a hell. I was really scared of hazing and ended up getting bullied. I was called names - ""cyclops"", ""chameleon"" and so on. I was beaten. I had conflicts with teachers who were complicit in their neglect (they did know). I escaped to playing computer games as much as I could (ultimately leading to me becoming a programmer), experimenting with it and learning English as I went (it's not my mother tongue).

I obviously had conflicts with parents, openly stating that I  do not believe in god (they are what I would call ""opportunistic catholics"", only going to church so rest of family would leave their beliefs alone). I dreaded losing access to my computer as punishments for bad behavior, eventually learning to lie and not trust my parents - which, painfully, is still my default strategy when talking to them. I felt alone and whoever I could confide in stuck around only for a brief period of time and didn't really do much. Between the classes I would hide at an equivalent of ""school psychologist"", but I can't remember how much I said there. Keep in mind that back then I had problems reflecting on my situation and I think I am still unwittingly repressing parts of my memories - there are parts when I know that something bad happened, but I can't tell what exactly.

Things started getting better in high school - while my primary school was local from a neighbourhood (full of kids of alcoholics etc.), high school was an environment I chose and had a tiny bit higher expectations in terms of who can join. I met my first girlfriend, who I fell crazy in love with and who then dumped me for my best (female) friend. I used to torture myself with thoughts of how it all has to be related to my lack of eye. That if I looked normal, I didn't have those problems... then I met another girl, this time it was me who had to tell her after a year of being together that apparently I don't love her and had been lying to both of us.

It was all pretty devastating, but also was the first moment in my life I didn't feel compelled to be with somebody, given that I could already tell what it's like and how much it can cost. After three years of a break, I landed in two more relationships, each seeming healthier from the other (all but the current one with quite nasty breakups, triggering episodes of what looked like depression).

From the hindsight, I think I have now enough experiences to conclude that it wasn't all about just not having an eye, that I have other features and some of them make me unique and valuable. The thing is... I now have to face the task of undoing all of the subconcious conclusions I made, harmful convictions that perhaps were relevant back in the time, but now have to go. Which leads me to my request and a TLDR:

TL;DR + the request: I'm super confused about how to interpret my past as a person with no eye, dealing with long history of seeing myself as completely broken. I'm looking for similar stories to find out what led people to eventually reconcile with such problems. Hopefully I'll find something I could relate to and use as a source of inspirations, things worth considering.

===

PS: It might be non-obvious to those who didn't have to deal with disabilities, but saying something like ""you're privileged, think about how much better your situation is compared to children in Africa"" wouldn't really help. I think I need some empathy and understanding, not a suggestion that I should celebrate having the rest of my libs because I just wouldn't know how. Sometimes I feel that if my disability was something worse than just not being able to see with one eye, perhaps I would attract more sympathy and be treated in a less cruel way? Losing an eye has this tricky aspect that in my case I guess I look just as if I had crossed eyes (or not that much worse, with a proper prosthesis that I have), but it affects my perception enough that I need a bit of special treatment.",22Jun2018,5,

37,"Hello,

Over the past 8 years or so my relationship with my older sister has deteriorated into basically nothing and I don't know what to do. Basically, until she was about 22-24 she was outgoing, very funny, caring, and very social. That has changed and I would describe her now as defensive, secretive, irrational, combative, and not logical. She cannot hold a job for more than a couple weeks and claims that everyone is being ""weird"" or treating her differently, but when I raise the possibility that she may need to look at herself, she lashes out in really cruel ways to the point that I just have to remove myself from the conversation.

At first, a few years ago, I would argue with her in disbelief and try to reason with her. Occasionally she would have this clarity and I would think she would try to help herself. But it would always come back to her just lashing out for no reason or creating rifts/issues seemingly out of no where. More recently, I stopped trying to argue with her because I just feel like she doesn't mean half of what she says. We can be having a normal conversation and then it's almost like something happens with her eyes and she goes into this zone where she shuts off completely from other people and just starts her rants and lashing out. It makes me really sad that I can't help her, but maybe I just don't know how to help her. My whole family still tries to help, and without our help she would probably not be able to sustain herself financially. She has lost every one of her friends but one and she is confused about what happened. When I tell her her behavior has pushed people away she just goes into lash out mode until I eventually get up and leave.

My parents, to be blunt, have botched their attempts to get her to see someone and figure out what is going on. They don't treat her as someone who is sick and needs help, instead they treat her like someone just choosing to behave erratically. I have a lot of thoughts and opinions on what I think is best and what I think is right, but I could just be adding to the problem by trying to help with no gameplan. I don't know, I'm just sad and feel helpless and don't want to keep failing her. She doesn't want any help and she thinks there is a stigma attached to seeing someone or having a mental disorder.

44,"I've been treated with various anti depressants for almost 5 years now, and they've always worked to some degree until recently. last October I was raped, and ever since then I've been dealing with more mental anguish then I've ever experienced. A doctors appointment is going to be made because I have a feeling that I'm suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder, maybe both. However, there is one thing that I've been dealing with that has just been weighing really heavy on my mind. homicidal ideation and seeing and hearing things that aren't there. for example, yesterday I was driving to the store and to me, it appeared as if the driver in the car next to me swung her car door open and smashed it into the side of the car and I was overwhelmed with anxiety, but it didn't actually happen. sometimes I can see and feel bugs underneath my skin and i want to self harm to get them out of my body. these are some of the more mild things. the homicidal thoughts is something that is fairly new. I don't think that I could actually go through with it but gruesome thoughts will roll through my head and I'll even dream about beating people to death or strangulation or disemboweling people that just irritate me. the issue I need help with is telling my doctor. I truly don't want to, but I'm worried I may spiral out of control if I don't. I'm terrified of being put in a psychiatric hospital. I know my parents don't have the money for it and I don't have insurance either. at some times i just don't feel like I'm worth the trouble or the hardships. should I come clean? ",22Jun2018,1,

47,"My daughter's therapist is pressuring me to put her in an in-patient facility for what she says would be a few days in order to get a diagnosis and make a treatment plan. My daughter is 10. She will NOT go voluntarily or easily. I'm completely terrified.

**A little background:** My daughter ""Kate"" is fine 95&amp;#37; of the time. She's very intelligent, creative, loving and mostly a happy kid. However, when asked to do anything she is afraid of or simply doesn't want to do, she becomes completely uncooperative and has ""meltdowns"" that last for hours. Crying, claiming to be ""in pain,"" screaming (usually repeating the same few things over and over like ""no no no no no"" or ""I don't need to"" or ""it won't help"") sometimes even breaking things or hitting, scratching, etc. One of the main things she is afraid of/doesn't want to do is see doctors or take medicine. Usually, if I'm willing to deal with her meltdown for as long as it takes (usually a max of 3 hours, unless she just had one over the same issue within a few days, then it can be a bit shorter), then I can get her to comply and go into the doctor's office or take a pill. But, as you can imagine this is extremely difficult and is a horrible experience for everyone involved. Not to mention the fact that you don't always have the luxury of taking 3 hours to get her to do what you need her to do (like if you are trying to get her to an appointment or she decides she won't go to school 1/2 hour before the bus comes). 

A few months ago I signed her up for therapy sessions to try and figure out what is going on. Of course, she had a meltdown when it was time to go (had to be physically forced into the car, would not get out - instead stayed in the car repeating ""no no no"" or something similar for most of the hour). The therapist came out to the parking lot and tried to talk to her there, but except for a few moments where she calmed down enough to say a couple things, there was no talking to her. This was the first time the therapist brought up committing her. Within a minute of leaving the office parking lot, Kate was back to normal. Session 2 was exactly the same. 

For several sessions after that, we left Kate at home and my husband and I went to see her therapist alone. We used her like a parenting coach, getting lists of things to read, ideas on techniques to deal with Kate, etc., and also talking about maybe committing her for a few days. We had some success with the new approaches to dealing with Kate at home we were discussing in therapy, but it wasn't enough. I tried again getting Kate to go to a session, this time starting 3 hours before the appt so the meltdown had time to run its course, and she was able to finally meet with the therapist and have a very superficial session with all of us. The next week, Kate went back with no problem back to see the therapist and had a real session in her office without us. We thought maybe we had gotten past her fear/refusal, but it didn't last - the week after that she was back to ""no no no"" refusing to get out of the car, and the therapist is back to pushing us towards an inpatient facility. 

I don't know what to do. The thought of committing her is terrifying. She will likely have to be restrained. I can't stand the thought of her being there overnight. I feel like she's going to hate me for it, and it's going to do long term damage to our relationship.  I worry she will be so uncooperative that the doctors won't be able to diagnose her anyway. I worry the trauma of doing this is going to make her worse. I worry that if they prescribe medicine I won't be able to get Kate to take it anyway. But I'm also worried about what will happen if I don't do this now - what is Kate's future going to look like if we let this go unchecked?

If you were ever committed (or committed someone), especially as a child, what was your experience? Do you think it helped?  What did it do to your relationships?

**TL/DR:** Therapist is pressuring us to commit our 10 year old who refuses to attend regular therapy to a facility for a diagnosis/evaluation. We are worried the trauma of doing this will do more harm than good, but don't know if there is any other option. Anyone have experiences with being committed (or committing someone)?  What was the result?",22Jun2018,4,
48,"Hello,
I (F17) have a friend at school F(16) who is very depressed / anxious / self hating all the time. She has one of those spamming instagram accounts where she talks about how much she hates herself, wants to kill herself etc.
I don't know what to do, and my friends do neither. When the year started I sometimes was hanging out with her and talking way more with her, but recently I never get the chance to do so. I only have one class with her and even there she always just talks with her boyfriend, which is a whole other issue. She is always sad around him, at least from what I know. In the breaks they always just hold each other, completely ignoring their friends, and sometimes she cries, which is really hard on him. On her instagram account she always talks about how exhausting her bf feels after hanging out with her, and one time she complained about him not noticing how bad she feels when she didn't say anything to him in a week.
I unfollowed her tho, I couldn't take the helplessness I felt. It's weird, in school she talks to you all cute and smiles and when she gives you her instagram account name you follow her and it's all negativity and self harm on there.
She also quit therapy a few months ago which I don't get, I mean she always said she doesn't like her therapist but then I think she should get a new one.
She's also the one who, when she compliments you and you compliment her back won't take the compliment. No chance. And I know we are all insecure but she's really good looking, not model like but nothing to be that insecure / an asshole about. 
Also whenever you say anything to her about being positive or just asking her what's exactly wrong, she doesn't really respond to it in any way, or gets bitchy about it 'not being easy'. She also posts like 2-3 depression memes a day in her whatsapp status but doesn't want to talk about it when people are concerned.
And, the last thing, she's very hung up on people who were her friends but fucked her over a few years ago and says that they just ghosted her without saying anything and, tbh, I kind of get why they did so, because she simply doesn't let you help her and then complains.

I don't even know what to think anymore. I wanna help but I don't really know how.

54,"I am in the U.S.  I have experience with mental hospitals.  Been in them, under no circumstances would I ever allow that to happen again.

I would like to speak to a psychiatrist or similar.  However, I know they would likely immediately have me locked up, stripped naked, probed, questioned over and over, drugged without consent, tied up, left in an empty room for days, and otherwise harm me.  All of that would be 100% legal in the U.S.  All done based on nothing more than the word of a single doctor.  No LEO, lawyer, judge, or prosecutor will give a single shit about it.  I know this for a fact, been there done that.

55,"This is my first time seeing a therapist for severe depression as well as anxiety. I've been going for the last 5 weeks, and am feeling pretty discouraged.

My therapist is a nice person, remembers details surprisingly well, and respects my wish to seek non-medication options first. However:

1. I don't think the focus is on my biggest issue (depression). I didn't realize until the last session, so I plan on explaining myself better next time. However, when I try to explain why it's so hard for me to do anything (i.e. being too depressed), she assumes it's about being afraid of people. I'm honestly too bad at explaining myself to really get that across.

2. Most of the sessions have involved her re-emphasizing a basic idea for 30 - 45 minutes (i.e., ""we all have to do things we don't like, that's life,"" and ""don't be so critical of yourself if you wouldn't be critical of other people""). I get it, but I don't get anything out of having common sense lessons. It doesn't

3. After the last session (the ""we all have to do things we don't like"" one), I honestly feel worse. More ashamed for my inability to get out of the house, for how poorly I handle stress and responsibilities.

4. I feel ashamed in general talking about my problems. I've never been ashamed of my mental health before, but I've also never had to talk about it. Going into detail about how I don't leave the house because I don't see the point is really humiliating. I also feel like an ass complaining about all of this.

I don't really know how to make sense of this, or whether my complaints are more about me being resistant to any kind of help, or just not seeing the right therapist.",22Jun2018,5,
56,"It’s been almost a year, and with the treatment schedule I put myself on it might be another 1-2.  Not just sex, but anything. I’ve been on one date since my last relationship and it was fine but didn’t go anywhere. After that I decided I should just focus on my health and personal growth for now. 

I’ve never been much of a “stud,” I’ve had a few girlfriends and one time made out with a girl at a party. Never hooked up with anyone, never had a one night stand, never had a fwb, so dry spells are not new to me in the least. 

This time is different, I’m a grown adult working full time, my friends are getting married, everyone around me goes on dates and finds partners like it’s nothing; I had to spend half a year chatting with people online before a single person wanted to go out at all. 

So my question is: how am I supposed to cope with the unending human compulsion to have sex and be close with someone when that clearly isn’t an option? I have no family, few friends, and no casual arrangements in my life. 

It feels like my brain is rotting and my body is falling apart. ",22Jun2018,2,
57,"For YEARS now, whenever anyone tells me that I might have a problem, I might be TOO depressed, I might be showing abusive behavior, etc., I'd run from that person. I'd dump them, freak out on them so they'd dump me, I'd cut off friendships and claim that I could not POSSIBLY be the problem here. I'm kind and smart and had already gone to therapy before... Basically, [my life is this meme](https://imgflip.com/i/2cpmje)...


But I've finally had this epiphany after reading about how some people are just suffering from FLEAS (*When a non-personality-disordered individual (Non-PD) begins imitating or emulating some of the disordered behavior of a loved one or family member with a personality disorder this is sometimes referred to as ""getting fleas""* [From raisedbynarcisists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1p1uag/help_i_think_i_am_a_narcissist/))... I was studying this because my friend and therapist thought my ex boyfriend was a narcissist and that I shouldn't try couples therapy with him. After holding onto this information and being far from him, I had a COMPLETE mental breakdown worrying about narcissism and decided, once again, that I might have anxiety and depression but he's the really fucked up one. Boy was I wrong.


My ex was truly raised by narcissists. His dad is overt and his mom is either covert, or also ""has fleas"". My ex simply hadn't dealt with his ""fleas"" yet, but he is a phenomenal human being. Before I learned anything about fleas, and in my ""infinite wisdom"", I decided he had the issues and freaked out, once again. I studied narcissism. I read articles and went on all the subreddits. And I realized that **a lot of the behaviors of a narcissist was reflected in MY attitudes and reactions**. The ""love-bombing""... the manipulation... And my super sensitivity towards anything that could be interpreted as a criticism. I was shocked. But I also read that if you are able to think you might be a narcissist, you're probably not. They don't have the ability to reflect on that. So what am I? What the fuck is wrong with me? I thought I was simple and just struggled with anxiety and depression. Nope. I read more and more until I stumbled upon the definition of fleas on r/raisedbynarcissists... And realized I have fleas! I know it's not something most people would be happy about, but I cried out of pure relief. I have a troubled past, and so many of the behaviors that I show are linked to those past abuses. Physical, mental, emotional... I've really gone through the ringer. I dealt with the PTSD from the intense physical abuse, but never let go of the manipulation or other things I learned  to use against people for my protection while I was dealing with that. Even my relationship with my mother when I was a child has shaped me. But my mask was so good that it was never dealt with when I went to therapy for other issues.


Now, I finally get it. I finally understand myself a little bit better. I have fucked up so many relationships and friendships by believing that I was never the true offender, and now I'm here, laying in the wreckage of my own life and love life. But I'm actually encouraged by this. Now that I finally know what's wrong, I CAN FIX IT. I can be better and can work hard so that I no longer abuse people the way I have in the past when I felt threatened. I truly haven't felt such a strong will to change and improve before. I thought I was already doing okay, but I only ever focused on my anxiety. What a mistake! I'm going to get through this, be a better person, and stop that abuse cycle right here. Hopefully, someday, I'll be able to go back and apologize to some of the people I've hurt.

**TL;DR I realized I'm not always the victim and have abused friends and significant others over the years while believing they were the problem. Turns out, I have FLEAS, and now that I know, I can fix it!!!**

He understands that he has a problem, But has willingly chose not to help himself until now this breaking point. There is no option for him to take any sort of narcotic To ease the stress because of his mental state he is very prone to becoming addicted. He has never been addicted to any drugs or pills, but his personality easily shows that he could become addicted. He is diagnosed bipolar. He’s a wonderful man when he’s ok, but the slightest thing can trigger a meltdown for him. 


On top of it all because of our financial situation he is stressed as hell. We were considering getting him in committed to the hospital it was possible to work on his mental health but that would also pretty much 100% guaranteed that at least his car will get repossessed.

So on Tuesday I was suffering from debilitating suicidal ideation. I got admitted into my local health center and kept there until a few hours ago today. The staff and everything was very pleasant and it was all in all a nice place to stay while things got sorted. When all was said and done I got diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. I'm currently on  a low dose of lamictal to help with things until I can get a more permanent medication set up through my PCP and therapist. It was nice to just be out of life for a while though. I felt very safe in the center and enjoyed the several rounds of therapy and group therapy a day. I wont lie though. Having shoelaces again is a comforting feeling.

The best title I could physically think of for this post is ""I am confused"".

before reading this I must warn you it's probably going to be long and shift patterns loads as I am really inconsistent in terms of the way I write but please bear with me.

So this all started probably about 1 or 2 months ago I can't really remember as I have a weird perception of time.. I had just come out of an 8 month relationship which I didn't consider to be abusive but it definitely helped me realise that I am not as strong as I thought I was. Everything in my life that has happened kind of feels weird or I get that feeling of how on earth did I get here if that makes sense?

Well up until about 2 years ago I didn't really overthink this at all (I have always over thought things) I left school quite abruptly I have really struggled to keep to anything in my life honestly if you look at my past I have been into... Star wars, harry potter, lord of the rings, spiderman, football, games, trumpet, drums, cricket, cycling, videography,golf and although little bits come back to me each time I have never actually stuck with one thing apart from video games.

School was never really on top of my priorities list, but then again I don't really know what was? the thing which I am confused about now is who I really am and I will get onto why I am really confused later on.

in 2014 I got my first full time job, I started it really motivated connected with quite a few people in the company really well and then started work. for the first 3 months I was doing really well getting constant praise and loving it. Then as I always do I got bored and looked for other things, at the time I was really into counterstrike and so would do the bare minimum at work and then procrastinate as much as I could all day until I could get home and play on my pc!

This was great until I started having meetings with the management team about how I  was underperforming, they would make jokes about how I was different and how my brain works quicker. thinking back to when I did work there it was very clouded I can remember the building really well and certain aspects of the job really well but I can't really remember finishing anything... weird.

I left that company super fast and moved onto my second workplace, this was in sales and it was also in a different city (uk) so I felt like I could reinvent myself a bit and I did initially I was really enjoying working at the new place for the first three months. I was also toying with the idea in the back of my mind to start my own business as I couldn't stand working for people. When I got to the company there was very little training, however I made an effort to learn certain things and impress the managers. Then when I realised they didn't really care I again did the bare minimum and then would either procrastinate about playing games and go on sites to wait until I could go home or I would I would edit my own website as I wanted to start doing my own business activities. 

I moved to three different areas in the company which I am fairly sure is the standard procedure now to fire someone... you can't just fire them you have to see if they like other areas of the business first. 

in my last position it was literally such a straightforward job all I was required to do was filter an inbox and send the relevant info to the correct person and somehow I managed to procrastinate incredibly I actually at the time was trying to start my own business and just thinking about this one scenario makes me breathe really heavy and got a bit hot and sweaty. Basically I was starting a video business and part of it was going to be drone based, I had just financed a drone and so I was looking into a course to do with getting the correct qualification. My line manager who was sitting next to me at the time obviously saw it and asked me for a meeting. Then she mentioned she had seen it, I can vividly remember just freezing up in the moment and thinking to myself why did I do that but I knew I didnt want to be there right in the moment and so it was all just really confusing.

Then came the two week family holiday to america, which hands down was pretty cool or was it.. I don't know because I went to New York and LA and all I could do at the time was feel like pure crap. I couldn't sleep properly and I wanted to go and do different things but I didnt exactly know what or where I just followed my parents and tried to keep interest in different things when we were out there. 

I made the decision that I was going to leave the full time workforce and start my own company as soon as I got home and I did that pretty much, well I got notice that the head of HR was going to come in and I pretty much assumed that she was coming to fire me and I needed to quickly book my ideas up. What I did was tell my line manager that I was going to start my own business - at the time a lot of them were really happy for me and they all wished me luck. I did get a pretty nice feeling from all this but it faded when I realised I had to actually fend for myself in business.

So for the past two years I have been running my own business and there has been an incredible amount of ups and down to be completely honest. What I can't explain is this is probably the best period of my life so far where I genuinely felt as if I should be doing what I was doing... until about 2 months ago this is where I have really spiralled out of control massively.

I have never been able to keep clients like seriously theres only one clients that I have kept and he is a similar sort of age so I think he just sees past my flaws to be honest. But over the past year and 11 months I have never had one person with my constantly employees basically. My most recent one was actually such a nice guy bless him and I just feel as if I messed him around so much luckily I was able to get him  a job in my dads business so he hasn't gone jobless now I have decided to take the business down.

But here is the really really really f***ed up thing, throughout the course of me owning my business I have shifted personalities so many different times I feel, over the phone I can be a massive extrovert but then in person be a massive introvert thinking about all the clients I had fallen out with and then carrying that on would be really bad. Some clients I have even had to refund because I procrastinated there work so much.

I don't want to be the master of self-diagnosis as, to be honest, I am really confused as a whole but I definitely feel as if I have shown narcissistic tendencies. It feels as if I get into things to relate to my friends at the time and I pursue them and put all my energy into learning things but then I don't do it properly if that makes sense? which causes me to question why I am doing it and then get into something else or run away to where I feel safe which is home.

Anyway getting back to the main confusion point, I went on a holiday with my dad about a month ago and admist all the rubbish that was happening, just broke up with my ex and loads of things had happened with losing money etc and a pretty close friend who I thought was close at the time. The holiday I went on just gave me a huge sense of Deja vu, I actually started crying hysterically in front of my dad when we were in a car together. I am not ashamed to talk about the fact that this happens not often but sometimes when I am having a conversation with my dad, I will just go into a hysterical crying fit but I won't be able to actually know why im crying it's like I bottle up all my emotions from everything and then it just comes out in one big thing.

so anyway when we returned home I went straight back to the business, I noticed I was quite tired and not just tired exhausted in fact I struggled to carry out super simple tasks like breakfast - lunch - dinner whatever I had to rely on my mum to make food or my employee to come with me to the shop and get food I legitamately feel as if I have to make a decision based on what other people are getting to clarify what it is I want or feel like at the time. the thing which has really scared me is that I feel as if I have been doing this all my life to be honest, especially with food I have base line foods which I can say I like but I never feel as if im craving a specific food unless someone else does if that makes sense? I also realise that I have been relying on my family massively always in the past to pull me out of bad situations, biggest problems that have hit me in the past two years are running up personal debt from taking out loans, financing things and paying for things at the time I wanted to haven't benefitted me in the long run. I have also noticed I am really badly fidgeting all the time I have bitten my nails all the way down pretty much and my personal hygiene is absolutely terrible if you are squeamish try and forget this next bit... showering I am so temperamental with, it's only when I can really be bothered to shower i will I can't really pin a time around it but genuinely I feel as if sometimes I have gone ages without showers. My teeth hygiene is also really terrible, I have recently had a root canal and 7 fillings, at the time it scared me and I knew obviously I couldn't go about my habits of not cleaning my teeth all the time but even now I know how bad that process was and how much pain it caused I have got better with it but sometimes I will just shrug it off and literally say I will do them tomorrow. I now kind of feel as if that has been my life catch phrase... I will do it tomorrow.

How has my weight been? To be honest I would say I am of average build but I have never been ""in shape"" although I would plunge into certain sports or whatever I have never been super healthy always eating what I want. This probably changed in 2017 as I started doing calorie counting and going to the gym every day with one of my friends but I only managed to stick to that for 6 months or maybe less. I was in pretty decent shape but I've put all the weight back on and even more when I got into a relationship. Now I have never been in a relationship so this for me was proper weird haha, I kept questioning myself like how on earth have you got into a relationship, it lasted 8 months and at the start was amazing I felt as if I was on top of the world. It really helped with personal confidence and everything but then I started getting clingy and in normal situations with friends, I would always feel protective over her if someone made a comment or a joke my friends said I disappeared pretty much and at the time I thought it was just them being jealous but no I really did disappear and put all my effort and time into her. Which was natural at the time but upon reflection, I really cannot understand it as I just made the decision subconsciously.

Whenever we would argue, I would feel terrible. I used to then after a couple of days of not talking offer to do something for example going to lunch or buy her something. With the intention of gaining trsut back. Throughout this relationship though it felt weird as if I was lying to myself that I just wanted companionship. Then I listened to a podcast (steve bartlett) who basically said you cant find someone that relies on you to make them complete otherwise you have no personality etc. That really hit home I thought yhyh my ex is definitely like that I am a really strong person. However the past two months have been absolute hell I have struggled to relate to my friends and something just feels wrong if you know what I mean I feel as if im getting dizzy really easily and its weird I look at all the stuff in my room (messy room) and I have a range of things such as designer stuff, tech and books, to be honest, it's as cluttered as my brain with things from my past that I have liked at the time but now I don't really care that much for. 

For the first time in my life I don't know my next move, I am really aware of the fact that I have problems but when I try to tackle them head on they feel absolutely gargantuan. 

the problem I am really facing at the moment though is my dad, he thinks I am just overreacting to what happened with my ex (so do some of my friends) and he's effectively said I have been spoiled throughout my childhood and he is going to throw me out of the house if I don't get a job in the next month. My worry is that when I am alone I get really scared as funny as it sounds and I don't even feel like I have a personality on my own and i seek affirmation from others to do even the smallest of tasks. If you were to ask me super simple questions I would know the answer no problem but then when it comes to doing things I literally feel so incapable it's very strange.

I think one of the biggest things as well is, I admire how people can do one thing and stick too it because for me it's so hard to grasp how anyone can do that? I suppose what I am looking for is clarity about what mental disorder I may or may not have.

I think I also forgot to mention how much I overeact in certain situations, if I was to get a small cut for example it would definitely hurt me a lot more than others I know how stupid that sounds but please understand where I am coming from..

It's strange because I have been told by so many people I am going to become a failure apart from my group of friends now and my parents but I can't help but think now I am a burden to my dad and he obviously wants to get me out of the house.

I just feel like how on earth can I live on my own as I feel I genuinely lack basic skills in my life that I have overlooked so many times.

I have done what I always do and seeked to the internet about mental health problems and i've seen some im quite scared of in honesty and can't think of anything worse than being on medication for the rest of my life (no offence to people on medication) but I am just genuinely really confused and I don't know what to do.

Most people would probably just say well get a job and just keep your dad happy right? for the first time in my life im sort of thinking yh ok I could do that but how on earth would I turn up for work eveyday motivated I don't want to mess about another company and get another bad reputation its so confusing if I could find a way to make money from my bed then I would.

If you have managed to read up to this point thankyou so much as I can imagine this is probably one of the hardest things to read and make sense of. I have been to see my GP and I mentioned the possibility of ADHD and he said he doesn't think I have that. I also obviously mentioned the sleeping problems and he has prescribed me some normal strength tablets ""nytol"" they haven't been helping massively as I will have some racing thoughts before sleeping. What also doesn't help is that I always go on my phone and just watch endless youtube videos. I am going back next week to the GP to report on how those have helped.

I am also seeing a private counsellor but again I don't really feel like that is helping as I don't feel like I can properly open up with her and get all of my thoughts down when we are talking because my mind is so preoccupied with other things at the time.

I think my biggest worry is being alone to be completely honest, If I had to make decisions for my self it would be very difficult every time I am in a new place I find it very easy to get lost and panic if I didn't have a GPS on my phone god knows how I would get to some places I have in the past few years. I have started to look for places to live if I am kicked out but I would also need a job because at the moment I am doing nothing but the odd bit of freelance work for clients. mostly my time is spent playing fortnite, drinking a lot of coffee, water and endlessly getting lost on the internet in thoughts.

With that said I am going to end the post here and go and play some fortnite but I am really keen to hear from anyone as I am just quite scared and lost at the moment if you have any suggestions please let me know.


TL;DR 

20 year old male with a good upbringing, never been able to keep to one thing but never been forced into anything. Now I realise how serious some things are that I have overlooked in the past I am finding it extremely difficult to understand myself and feel as if I have lost my personality. I am facing eviction out of my parents house in the next month and really need to sort my ideas out.

65,"Hello,

I currently have a friend who is in need of counseling and they want to pursue it. The university we go to offers free counseling, but because of their stances on homosexuality he is at risk for special treatment. Conversion therapy is a possibility, or even risks of getting kicked out all together. Therefore, he feels that he cannot trust counseling at the university.

He is not open with his family which makes the situation worse and means that he cannot discuss this issue with them in order to seek out other options. Essentially, he is on his own to find help.

He doesn't work during the school year so he has no income aside from the money he saves up during the summer.

Does anyone know of any possible therapy solutions that might work for him? Or anything at all that might help?

Thanks!",22Jun2018,1,

69,"I attempted suicide 8 years ago. Back then, I'd had many terrible issues that got a lot better through time. After the surviving the suicide attempt, I thought that the life gave me a second chance of making something good of it. And I tried, to change my perception and overall negativism to something better. I thought that it was the slap right into my face that I'd needed for such  long time.

But now, after years of living that ""second life"", I think it was just a mistake and I should've died those 8 years ago, because I'm just spinning in circles. 

I fight really hard against my depressive episodes and moods and I'm far more grounded in reality than I was back then, but it's still not enough. I don't allow myself to think or feel too deep, because I know how much it can hurt, but anytime, when I let go, I know it hurts just as much as it did those 8 years ago and nothing has really changed for me...

I can't get rid of a feeling that I'm here for just too long and I'm actually over my actual time of being here on this earth. I think that it wasn't a second chance, but a terrible mistake and I just should've died. ",22Jun2018,5,
70,"I already have been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from abuse in childhood. I am on 200mg of Zoloft (sertraline) along with a sleeping pill which I can't remember the name of.
I have constant suicidal thoughts. They come in waves. I get waves of panic and absolute terror. When this happens I feel like I'm not in control of my body. About 40% of the time I feel like I am in a movie and someone else is pulling my strings. I have been on this dosage of sertraline for a good few months now- when I started feeling like this about a month ago or so I assumed it was the medication. I stopped taking my meds 3 days ago and it's only gotten worse. I feel like my personality traits are fading away and I'm just another person on this planet made to live and then die and I have no purpose in life other than to ruin the earth that gives us life. My head is going at 120mph. I starting taking my medication again yesterday and it won't stop. I feel like I am loosing my identity but I am not really sure. I feel so numb too.
This is long and I'm sorry. I just need some help understanding all this.",22Jun2018,3,
71,"People piss me off a lot. A lot. What’s crazy is that people on my political side piss me off way more than people on the other side. Why? Because we want the same things, but I often see people being dumb about it, which hurts our goals. I just got really pissed off publicly about an article that accused all whites of being casual racists. I’m white. I don’t care about defending whites, I don’t practice tribalism. No, I care, because villainizing an entire group, namely the group we activists want to change, is unlikely to create any significant change. If anything, it will change the choir, but not the fence sitters or opposers. I’m getting mad just thinking about it. Of course, because people are the way they are they probably think I’m in defense of whites. 

Sorry, I went on a tangent. The point is I’m regularly pissed off and I have a hard time chilling out and not being aggressive. Help?",22Jun2018,2,
72,"I've had a problem with anger for a long time; since I was a teenager. Now I'm thirty years old and I like to think I've got a fair amount of control over it. I don't normally snap at people. I don't scream at people. I don't hit people. However, because I understand that my anger can be irrational, I tend to dismiss it as being my problem rather than it being legitimate. How can I tell if its OK for me to be angry? How do I know if I'm justified in my outrage or if I'm just being a total dick?

75,"So, I would just like to say I have never had anything out of the ordinary happen to me like this and it’s freaking me out. So, I went to bed last night and had an oddly realistic dream but woke myself up after somehow figuring out it wasn’t real and just repeating that over and over.

So, throughout this whole day, I’ve felt Deja Vu about EVERYTHING. And everytime I do, I remember a dream I had like 3 years ago (at least I think I had that dream). It’s like different snippets of memory come through each time regarding the dream. However, I can’t remember or even stitch together the memories of the dream I had to somehow make out what it was about. I remember it being completely stupid of a dream though as in it had no meaning. 

Besides the rapid deja vu, I’m having a hard time completing thoughts and feel and out of body sensation every now and then. Almost like coming down from an acid trip. My hands and most of my body has lost a lot of the senses (I can’t feel things as easy if that makes any sense) and I feel tense. I’m a 16 year old guy and I’m seriously thinking I’m going insane because of this. Has this happened to anyone else or does anyone know what’s going on?",22Jun2018,4,
