0,"My roommate believes secret gambling rings placed hidden devices inside the walls of his last apartment to spy on and harass him using sonar, ""nano particle dust"" and radio waves. I've listened to him calmly on at least a dozen occasions describe the reasons he believes this to be the case. I've tried pointing out that all of this seems very unlikely but needless to say it has produced no lasting positive change that in his thinking that I can observe. Now, about a month and a half since he moved in with me he is starting to believe something similar is happening to him here. I have tried to gently direct his attention to alternate and simpler explanations as to why he might be experiencing some of the things he describes but I feel ill equipped to provide the kind of support and care he seems to need and he seems resistant to considering as a real possibility the idea that this is in his head or at all not real. He initiates all conversations on this topic and mostly now I listen passively because it seems pointless to keep pointing out to him how absurd it all sounds when he clearly cannot discern it.  Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated. At the moment its not possible for me to move or for him to leave.",27Jan2018,5,
1,"For 2 years in swim classes each year the coach made everyone fail. We went the first year and failed and the second year and failed. Nobody passed either class and it was to teach us a lesson that not everyone wins and that basically our swimming sucked and wasn't fast enough. I was 8-9. Everyone was failed as a lesson. 

Later I had soccer and we got a participation trophy at the end of the year for 2 years. I was 12-13 by then. I got no other participation trophies after that. 

So what kind of lesson is learned if I had these 2 totally opposite experiences? I lost for existing and won for existing. 

For track and field day and other competitions though I didn't get a participation ribbon. If you lost you got nothing. ",27Jan2018,1,

5,"Emotionally, I don't really feel anything most of the time. I've been this way my whole life and never really saw it as a big deal. It's not that I have no feelings and I'm actually pretty good at dealing with the feelings of others. I'm also pretty great at managing my own feelings *when I feel them.* It's just that if you asked me how I'm feeling at most points in the day I'd have no answer. Emotions in my experience are momentary abberations in an otherwise flat day.

I've always been fine with this.

But now I'm being told that you're supposed to be able to feel and to say how you feel *all the time* in terms beyond ""fine"" or ""neutral"" or ""room temperature"" or ""nothing"" all of which are great descriptors for my baseline.

Obviously I am here to seek help as my last resort. My question is what should I generally expect walking into an ER?

11,"Hi, I’m actually interested in seeing if anyone has a similar experience to this. I’ll mention that I don’t think I’m depressed before I begin. I am a 25 year old male if that changes anything. There are days, such as today, where I am moved to tears by many many things. I won’t actually cry because I hold it in, but I can be reading a book and I’ll feel the tears in my eyes, sometimes I can tell the reason because maybe it relates to something that’s happened to me but sometimes I don’t really know why. On days like these, I’ll feel like crying as I read the newspaper, when I think of a movie I like, when I think of friends and family. For example, it happened maybe 10-15 times today.

Not that I tell many people, but those I do tell are surprised because I’m quite neutral, not very expressive face, have been suspected of being on the autism spectrum (though never tested). I’ll also state that I don’t actually cry (tears rolling down) because I always hold it in (haven’t actually cried in over a year). Does this happen to anyone else? Are there scientific reasons for this? Any psychological reasons for this? Should I just let it out and have a good cry about nothing in particular?

15,"About 3 years ago after a cancer scare in my family I fell into a situation where I was unable to attend school or even leave home for the thought I may bump into someone from there and be questioned. This cost me all of my friends that I thought I knew. Out of the abyss I found a girl who talked to me through the day and spent all of her time just keeping my mind ticking over. She was and remains my rock. After 6 months of this issue my time at school was over and things seemed to return to normal. I seemed to get over what had been holding me back. I had always questioned myself as if I'd made all of it up and I felt a mockery for ever thinking I had a mental health problem. As I write this that same niggling doubt is telling me I'm wasting everyone's time and I'm lying to you all. Since then I have seen a distinct decline in my abilities to perform tasks at college. More recently I had been verbally harassed on more than one occasion at my sixth form college. I finally thought enough was enough and stopped going to these lessons. When questioned why I tried to avoid anything saying it was angst. Finally I was pressured into my real reasoning of being bullied by the teacher of these classes. This has lead to my removal from college I am now the failure I always thought I'd end up. The girl who became my rock is someone who I love and admire however, she's found new friends that more closely align with her than I. I've found myself at 19 with almost no qualifications hopeless and terrified. I'm trying to keep moving but everyday I feel like giving up.

16,"*Warning: Long post!

Background: I had to move back in with my parents during the middle of last year due to me divorcing my then abusive, alcoholic husband, which I feel like has also negatively impacted my health. I got laid off at the university I was working at due to lack of grant funding. I am most definitely actively searching for roles and I've been applying to everything I can find, but neuroscience seems to be a hard area to find jobs in. I'm already depressed because I can't find a job, and then I was told by a staffing agency recruiter that I won't be able to get a job outside of my state unless I relocate to the state where I want a position and look for a few months, which I find ridiculous because I am flat out broke. But anyway, yes, I am actively searching and applying for jobs so I can move out of my parents' house. 

My official diagnosis is major depressive disorder but also with psychosis. My psychiatrist took me off of Abilify because I felt like it wasn't helping me anymore, so he put me on 20mg of Latuda to start. I feel like I am now back to where I started before I started any medication whatsoever. As it pertains to psychosis, I am seeing shadows again (I used to see them when I was a teen before starting medication), disconnecting with reality in public places (I go off into my own world and then I come back like a half hour later--luckily this doesn't happen during driving or anything), feeling paranoid, having (embarrassing) delusions, and I am so irritable that I feel like I want to tear my hair out. It's like something's crawling underneath my skin and I can't take it. I also have sensory-processing sensitivity where things like noises and lights seem to be so exaggerated that sometimes I can't see and I can't filter out what's going on around me, which has made me rock back and forth because I feel like it soothes me with the hypersensitivity. My ex actually used to get mad at me for rocking. My psychiatrist is out of the office until Monday, so I had to call the on-call psychiatrist a few days ago and he said to increase Latuda to 40mg, which seems to be working but only a little bit. I have stopped seeing shadows, at least. As my disorder pertains to depression, I have lost most motivation and most of my will to live. My psychosis gets worse when the depression gets worse. I am also a PhD student and I am having trouble with meeting deadlines. Part of me just doesn't care anymore, whereas the part of me who has motivation is still trying his hardest to complete the work. I haven't started my dissertation yet, thank goodness. I used to feel like my medication created a barrier where the depression pokes out sometimes but is usually behind that barrier. Now I just feel like nothing is helping me anymore. I have been on over 25 different medications and antipsychotics are the only medications that seem to help me to the point where I can function. My psychiatrist does want to put me on another antidepressant, though, and has told me in the past that he is treating me for either MDD with psychosis (my official diagnosis) or schizoaffective disorder. 

The issue: My mother is an RN and she really just doesn't seem to understand mental illness. Something sparked me today: seeking her nursing insight randomly, I asked what the biological explanation of rocking is, unaware of what she'd say. I was telling her why I do it (I'm very good at hiding it, but sometimes I can't control it) and she goes, ""Oh, I really hope you didn't do that when you were at work."" I did, though, and I used to hide it very well from my PI because she wasn't there a lot of the time, but when she was there and I couldn't rock I would end up getting very irritable and feeling like there was something that needed to be let out, if that makes sense. So I told her that and after a few comments she said that people shouldn't feel comfortable around people who rock and that if she saw someone rocking she'd feel unsafe. First off, why would you say this to someone who is dealing with mental illness and just told you he rocks? This leads me back to when, a few weeks ago, my mom said ""schizophrenics shouldn't be in relationships,"" and a few days ago I was telling her about that student who runs the non-profit Students With Schizophrenia and she said that ""schizophrenics probably won't have careers."" She also told me that I complain too much and try to blame my mental problems on other people. I probably do complain a lot, honestly, because I'm so depressed that the negativity just comes out. But telling me I'm trying to blame my problems on other people when I'm experiencing psychosis? And why would you say things about people with schizophrenia and the rocking when my experiences are so similar?

Has anyone had similar experiences with their parent(s)? The main point of this post is to just vent because I can't take it. My own mother makes me feel like I'm absolutely insane and I feel like she's making me worse. There are just things you shouldn't say to people.",27Jan2018,1,

She is currently in therapy at a center that does partial care. She does group therapy and DBT and has individual meetings with doctors. I know that it’s a good program because I was in the program for depression and it helped me so much. My sister and I are very different though. 

She joined this program for suicidal thoughts but now they’re keeping her for a little longer because they can’t figure out what’s going on. She keeps making up issues for attention. 

She copies everything around her. She started self harming after watching an anime about someone who self harms. She began to have tics after hanging out with a cousin who has them. We can tell these things are fake because she doesn’t actually do them unless she’s talking about it. 
I can give more examples of these situations, but it would make this post longer than necessary. All the doctors know she’s faking, but because of the things she’s claiming they can’t just ignore her. 

Her newest thing is claiming she hallucinates. Highly doubtful she does because she can’t keep the stories straight between doctors. However, they have to send her for tests. So now she has to get blood work done and go to a neurologist. 

We don’t want to dismiss her problems if they’re real, but everyone knows it’s for attention. She loves attention and she has her whole life. Now it’s not that we don’t give her enough attention. We all try our best but it doesn’t change her behavior. We’ve tried so many things. We’ve tried ignoring bad behaviors and only praising good ones, we take away electronics, we punish. We have completely taken away electronics unless it’s watching TV with the family because she’s proved over and over she can’t be trusted with it. 

She also doesn’t display empathy unless she chooses to. It’s like she can turn it on and off. She has plagiarized poems off the internet to pretend she wrote them to impress us, but when we call her out she has no guilt or remorse. 

We’ve tried scare tactics like: If you’re lying then we’re wasting all this money and someone else who really needs the help could be getting it.

26,"I hope this is the right place to post this. Sorry if this is hard to read at points, I’ll try my best to make it readable, but my grammar was never my strongest side haha.


This feels sort of super weird to talk about. But I guess that I realized this morning that I needed to get it out and I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends about it, only my mother really knows. I guess I feel I just need to write it down and articulate it to somebody else, I apologize for the wall of text beforehand as this is a fairly long story I guess.


I’m a 22 year old guy from Sweden. I was raised by my mom together with my brother after my dad passed away from brain cancer when I was 8. I was always sort of a shy, awkward guy. But I had my interests and I had friends and had a fairly normal upbringing all things considered. Losing my dad however made me a lot more anxious and I became super terrified of becoming ill myself, because I remember how my dads death affected me, my brother and my mother.


However when I was in my last year of gymnasium (swedish high school) I started having stomach issues, I really don’t wanna get to much into it. For a few months I wouldn’t really tell anyone about it because I didn’t really think that much of it to be honest, at this point it was a fairly negligible thing, I could function fairly well despite all of it. It wasn’t really until a month before my graduation in the spring of 2014 that I started being really anxious about it. I went to the doctor, but since I was so young (18 at the time) they basically just took a few blood tests, which turned out to be normal, and then sent me back home. At first this was very calming, and I had a good graduation and a great summer holiday before starting university, to study to become a teacher.


Now during the fall of 2014 is when I moved away from home, to start in university. I had more general anxiety about my health, basically anything would get me worried, and I wouldn’t really dare to go to the doctor about it. I had an intense fear that I would get bad news, and as I said earlier, I was terrified of how my family would be able to handle it. I was never really scared of death but I was scared of not getting to meet my friends and family again and how it would affect them. These fears were all different from what had worried me during the spring and I was being a hypochondriac. This did however severely hamper my social life, I only really did what was necessary to pass my classes and I would eat bad food as a coping mechanism, I didn’t really meet or talk with my friends, beyond those I knew from the internet. Basically this is how it was until the fall of 2015.


During the fall of 2015 my stomach issues became worse, and while it hasn’t really changed much since then, it did bring back my anxiety in full force. However I still didn’t dare to go to the doctor about it as I was still worried about the response. What it led to however is that I would be bloated and feel gross, so I would, even more than ever before, avoid meeting people. Reflecting on it I think my mind made me go into like a “survival mode” without me doing anything to actually get out of it and get better. And because of how terrible and gross I felt I wouldn’t really take care of myself, I kept eating bad food as a coping mechanism, I didn’t care about how I dressed etc. This made me even more unlikely to get out and meet with people and friends, go to parties. My self confidence was at a rock bottom and it wasn’t getting better.


This is basically how it kept going on until this fall, when I felt so depressed that I couldn’t really deal with it anymore. I went to the doctor. I’m at this point still undergoing some investigations, but the results I’ve gotten so far have been calming - I’m most likely going to be fine! I’m still anxious about it, but it’s better than before. Over the last few weeks I’ve stopped using food as a coping mechanism and I’ve been taking better care of myself in general. 


However this is when it really hit me that I’m a 22 year old guy now. I have 1 and a half years left of university until I have to be a high school teacher, and at that point I have to be an adult. How can I be a teacher to kids who are the age that I still feel like I am in my brain? I haven’t really created any deep friendships over this whole time. I haven’t been able to meet a girlfriend or anything like that, partly because I’ve felt gross and been super introverted, but also because I was so scared that I was seriously ill that I didn’t wanna put another person into the same situation as what happened to my family when my dad passed away. I felt that if it was serious I couldn’t really dare to put that sadness and grief on yet another person so I would shield myself away from anything like that. I never really had any relationships like that of note before either due to me always being sort of introverted and shy, even before all of this shit, which makes me feel so inexperienced compared to my peers. 


I feel like a 17 year old stuck in a 22 year olds body, I haven’t really done anything that most my age have and as I’ve become less anxious about my health I’ve instead become more anxious over the fact that my schoolmates and friends are in stable relationships, some are engaged, some have kids, some have stable jobs and have bought houses. I’ve been trying hard to eat healthy, exercise and generally take care of myself to raise my confidence in myself, which is at a terrible level, and has been for years. Despite this it feels like a long journey to get there and I feel like the last 4 years of my life went by at super speed, with me standing completely still, almost stuck in time.

30,"Allow me to lay out a conceptual framework for self-identification. I've been thinking much about it.

There are four general states which we can choose to identify with. 

-

1. Cognitive - We identify with our thoughts, intellectualism, humor, wit, or skill at a cognitively-focused activity, such as chess, academics, problem-solving, etc

2. Emotional - We identify with our emotional patterns. When anxiety arises, we latch on to it, allowing the emotion to birth subsequent thoughts of anxiety. But we are riding the waves of emotional change, so as anxiety falls, our thoughts change to rationalize the emotional perspective. We attach to our highs, getting wrapped up in excitement or joy. We attach to our lows, with self-pity, victimization, and self-destructive tendencies. We identify with these states when we cannot let go of them, walk away of them.

3. Physical - We identify with the state of our bodies - on a basis of daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly change. Like all of these categories, this can manifest in a multitude of forms. Obsession with image, physical fitness, or illness. We identify with the form we take as a physical entity in a physical world.

4. -

---

These three are the primary modes of identification in western cultures. Throughout a given day, an individual will likely cycle through each of these categories, and they will not necessarily occur independent of one another. They are inherently related. Some of us tend towards one form of identification over another. Many of us develop any one of an array of disorders or ailments through our excessive obsession with only one or two of these aspects of identity.

-

Over-identification with cognition can result in fear and mood disorders, a variety of uniquely experienced anxiety and depressive disorders.

Over-identification with emotion can equally result in anxiety disorders, especially trauma-related anxiety disorders. Here is also the basis of a handful of personality disorders. Although depressive disorders are more likely to begin with cognitive-identification, they'll be necessarily exacerbated by emotional identification - this introduces the cyclic nature of mental illness.

Over-identification with the physical may result in disorders of greed or self-obsession, such as narcissism, kleptomania, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, hypochondria, and chronic muscle pains.

-

These three forms of self-identification are secondary. There is a fourth choice, one which is primary, a pluripotent stem cell which allows for the emergence of creation through cognitive, emotional, and physical patterns. It is from this fourth place that true creativity is bred, and it is in identification with this state that all successful people, to varying extents, operate.

-

4. The fourth mode of identification is that of *awareness.* 
---
-

When undergoing an emotionally difficult experience, or a series of negative, unstoppable thoughts, one must ask oneself: who is the ""I"" which experiences these thoughts? Who experiences these emotions? Because, certainly, you have noticed that there is always something more present. You are not only your emotions, and you are not only your thoughts.

-
So who are you?
-
-
Awareness, a state of observation that possesses limitless potential, as its avenues of probabilistic possibility remain unexplored and infinite. This is the inner self that births all creation, all spiritual strength, and all perseverance through suffering. 

Those who identify with their inner awareness, their mindful embodiment off self, are those who, later, may learn to orchestrate the symphony of their mind. Those people who choose non-judgmental awareness as their basis of perception are those who shape their own lives, and who hold the power to shape the lives of others.

---

The people who identify primarily with awareness are those of great success. They are physicists, as Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein; they are poets, as Emerson and Thoreau; they are ancients, as Confucius, Lao Tzu, Socrates, and the spiritual leaders of Christ, Muhammad, and Buddha; they are warriors, as Alexander the Great, and kings as Caesar, and many of the ancient east. They are artists, as Da Vinci and Picasso, and musicians, as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Chopin. They are limitless and inexhaustible in list, for many humans have found this way of being without great fame.

---

I mean not to glorify this state, mind you. I wish only to highlight, as clearly as I can, a method, a strategy of being human that has proven more successful than those which we most commonly use. 

We may choose, in any moment, to identify in one of four ways. Those are identification with thoughts, with emotions, with body, or with awareness.

Consider this fourth option, and consider, with an open heart, that it may be a state of being that you have yet to fully appreciate. It is from this state that we find our greatest potential as individuals within the mosaic of humanity. It is from this place of being human that we can, once again, regain our humanity.

31,So I've been dealing with depression and PTSD for about 4 years now is been getting worse so i went to get help. Ice been seeing a therapist about it and my PTSD is getting better. But all this time my mental health is slowly getting worse. I'm to the point of where I'm scared that what i will have a mental break down some time in the near future and the reason I'm scared is not for my mental health but because with my mental health degrading i find it hard and harder to deal with my anger and i don't know what will happen when i no longer can control that. The reason I'm here tell you all this is because i have no one really to tell people will listen but i don't feel as if they really care. I know none of you will really care either i just wanted someone to hear me and what I'm going through.,27Jan2018,2,

35,"I've been taking welbutrin for like 6 months. At 300mg I was feeling better. I wouldn't call myself ""cured"" of my depression/anxiety, but I was stable and able to progress through therapy and stuff. 

I decided to try 450mg just to see if the effect would be even better, but after two weeks, the side effects became too awful. So I went back to taking 300mg. The side effects subsided, but now I feel absolutely no effect of the medication *at all*. My depression/anxiety is as bad as it would be if I stopped taking my medication all together.

Did I permanently screw up my system by taking a higher dose? Will I never again feel the same results on 300mg? Or does my body simply need to readjust to 300mg? If so, how long until I start feeling the effects again? It's been pretty hellish the last few days.

38,"Last April after I found out my ex had lied to me and some other upsetting things, I had a complete breakdown. The breakdown ended after I took a brand new razor blade across my wrist. I had so much adrenaline. I didn’t feel it at all. But the giant wound and blood projecting from myself shocked me. I stared at it for a second. I think I tried to hold it closed and my ex said something about to not touch it. He pulled me into his bathroom and wrapped a towel around my arm and tied it. I’m still shocked. I think I’m crying and looking at him and telling him I’m going to die. I keep apologizing. He says that I’m not going to die. He says “it’s not like I didn’t know something like this could happen.” We didn’t know what to do so he asks if he could call his mom and I said ok. “Mom.. she slit her wrist and she’s bleeding a lot, what should we do” she asks a few questions, he ends up taking me to the ER on campus. I’m asked all the questions about what happened, my mental health.. so on.. We’re in the ER from around noon to 10 pm. He stays with me the whole time. He apologizes, I apologize. I changed into a hospital gown but my foot is still covered in blood and I’m wearing his sandals. I get seven stitches on my wrist after six hours of waiting by a student. He takes pictures of my open wound. He takes a video as they stitch. He takes a picture after the stitches are done. They want me to stay overnight for something. I have multiple people trying to convince me. I decline. We go back to his house. I realize in the car on the way home my shirt is covered in blood. There’s blood soaked into my black leggings. We get pizza at some point because bad hospital food didn’t work for either of us. He tries to sew up a pair of underwear I had cut up while I sit on the floor with a cloth and paper towels and peroxide trying to get my blood out of the carpet that’s been soaking for 11 hours. I got a speck of blood on the corner of his new white pillow. I tried so hard to get it out. I scrubbed the blood out of my clothes and carpet and the cloth he wrapped around my arm. We get sexual at some point. He takes me to Kroger to buy extra bandages at some point. Two weeks later I go back to the ER and get my stitches removed, and walk back to his house after. He’s having a little get together. I get a green v neck shirt out of my bag and tell him to put it on. He does. He walks in the other room and his friend comments on how he looks like Shaggy. It’s a nice moment. My wrist is still red and gross and shining from the ointment the nurse at the hospital put on it. We all get high and watch anime. He holds my hand and all I can see is the wound. All I can ever see is the wound. The student did a bad job. My skin is uneven and risen now. Things don’t get better. He leaves a few months later. I couldn’t leave because I loved him, despite him breaking me down to suicide. But he leaves. And I see this long, red scar on my wrist every day. I get taken back to his apartment in April every day. I remember the blood so vividly. I remember all of the feelings. I still have the pictures he took. I feel disgusting. I always feel disgusting. This scar will be on me as long as I live. I have a billion little white scars all over me but this one is the worst. It’s so ugly. If I don’t wear long sleeves everyone’s first look at me is that I’m a fucking psycho. I’ve stared at my scar in loneliness for six months. If I outstretch my arm I feel the pressure on my scar. I feel it inside. It always feels bad. ",27Jan2018,1,

My depth perspective went crazy and I realised I don't think I'll ever be happy. Suddenly it felt like my old life was millions of miles away and suddenly everything I loved turned into bad memories. My perspective on everyone around me changed and I feel like I've transported universes. I cried myself to sleep and when i woke up this feeling still hadn't gone away. I drank a bit the next night.

I feel like I've went off the deep end. I smoke weed every day just to feel ok, and used to drink every day but I'm not 21 yet and am in America so haven't had too much alcohol lately. I feel so alone that I'm actually going crazy. I think my personality and mind are irreparable. Messed up with almost every friend I had in this small town but even if I got a fresh start, I'd be even worse off because I can't do anything. I used to be ""smart"" and do amazing on standardized tests but can't focus on schoolwork.

56,"Ive been having very vivid dreams again. This one was very unsettling.

I had lived with a family member in one house most of my life until rather rencently.

I dremt that iwas in the house and there were bodies in there. Literal bodies.

They didn't smell as we had dehumidified the air to keep the moisture away and they were wrapped up very tightly in towels. There was someone in the house who was their caretaker, who had aged terribly because of the dehydration from living there. 


There was one body laid in the bed of the relative that i lived with and another propped on the toilet, which i remember because i remember thinking it was very inconvenient as i needed to use said toilet and couldn't move the body myself.

The weird thing was. Neither of the bodies were people who would have any reason to be in that house. One was said relatives old boyfriend. Someone i have not had contact with in over 10 years.
The other, a co-worker/ manager whom i rarely interact with either.


I was not disturbed by the bodies in the dream, it felt normal to just have mummified corpses hanging around but the more ive thought about it throughout the day... its gotten to me a little.


Death usually signifies change, maybe these two people or ""dead relationships"" are people that might come back into play somehow.

58,"tldr; I think I'm developing delusional parasitosis and I'm afraid to tell anyone. This is me working up to telling my therapist. Advice or shared stories are appreciated.

I remember occasionally being convinced as a kid that there were invisible bugs living on my skin. They went away for awhile, I'd say almost two decades actually, but last year they started coming back and earlier this month with a vengeance. Instead of on my skin, though, they are in my head. In my ears and my sinuses. Behind my eyes and at the back of my throat.

My finances are pretty limited. I can't just go have my head holes examined for critters. I KNOW they are not real, key symptoms are missing and I have a perfectly rational explanation to why the physical symptoms I am experiencing (it's a dry and windy winter, causing dry itchy skin) but I still experience long bouts of ""They're living inside me"" that freak me out. I'm getting panicky just writing about it.

I don't know why exactly I'm afraid to share this with my therapist or loved ones but I am. Hopefully sharing here will help. I thought about waiting it out which I believe I could do but something tells me I really ought to tell her. I hurt my throat trying to forcibly expel one like you would a frog in the throat. I almost did serious damage to myself in one bad episode a couple days ago thinking I could dig a bug out of ear canal with a screwdriver.

62,"Okay, so this is going to take a while to write, but I just have to let it out. The things is, I've been struggling a lot lately with my mental health. That's mainly because I live with my sister who's anorexic, and she's been getting worse and worse since september 2017, and now, she's incredibly ill. And this illness she has, is driving my parents nuts. Therefore, they almost forget to take care of me, and they rarely give me attention. I understand that they got to take care of my sister, but that's all they ever talk about. When I come home from school, they always talk about how ill she really is, or how hard it is for them to cope with it. I love my sister very much, and my parents of course, but it doesn't feel very nice to be almost forgotten by your parents. My parents have admitted that they've given me far to less attention than they should, and that they feel sorry for me. But what does it help for them to say that to my face, when they aren't doing anything about it? I probably sound very selfish, and like I don't understand how serious this whole ""situation"" is for my sister and my parents, but I'm painfully aware of what's going on, and that makes me really sad and angry. I want to help my sister get better, but every time I tell her she's not fat and stuff, she doesn't believe it, because her illness makes her believe the opposite of what's true. My mental health is seriously damaged because of this. There are of course others who struggle more with their things, but everyone deals with the same stuff differently. 

Oh, I almost forgot to mention this, but in December 2017, when it really started to get extremely bad, I started to get very tired and had a lot of anxiety because of the situation (sorry for mentioning this word all the time). My thoughts would get so strong that I could almost hear them, and I would respond to them as if they were actual people talking to me. The thoughts would show up whenever I was stressed out, or had anxiety. The thoughts would be things like ""You suck!"" ""You are an jerk"" ""No one likes you"", and so on. I started to get depressive thoughts, and started to self-harm again. As of today, these ""symptoms"" are still going strong, the thoughts, self-harm and depressive thoughts are very dominant in my everyday life. And I get very easily irritated, and it feels like someone is watching me all the time, like a spy. I get scared when I'm going out for walks, because it feels like someone is behind me. I have nightmares every week, and really intense, realistic nightmares about traumatic experiences from my past. And, chewing sounds, breathing, footsteps from upstairs, sounds from cleaning the kitchen, these sounds really annoys me, they are very loud, much more loud than usual.

Am I going mad or something? Can someone tell my what's going on with my mental health? I have reached out to a therapist, but he can't have that many appointments with me, only two or something. Does anyone of you guys have had any similar experiences?

Background Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning regarding the potential risk of gambling disorder, but large epidemiologic studies are lacking.

Methods We used a large health claims database from the United States and conducted a nested case-control study. Cases were defined as subjects newly diagnosed with gambling disorder or impulse control disorder. For each case, 10 controls were selected and matched to cases by age and follow-up time and calendar time. Adjusted rate ratios were computed with conditional logistic regression.

Results There are 355 cases of gambling disorder and 3550 controls along with 4341 cases of impulse control disorder and 43,410 corresponding controls. After adjusting for confounders, users of aripiprazole demonstrated an increased risk of pathologic gambling (rate ratio [RR], 5.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–15.38) and impulse control disorder (RR, 7.71; 95% CI, 5.81–10.34). The risk was also elevated for pramipexole or ropinirole for both gambling disorder and impulse control disorder (RR, 7.61; 95% CI, 2.75–21.07; RR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.31–4.66, respectively).

Conclusions Our study confirms an association between aripiprazole, pramipexole, or ropinirole and impulse control disorder and gambling disorder.

71,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'd like input from others if the symptoms I'm describing sound similar to someone they know who has bipolar disorder?

My relative has a bunch of personality problems that seem to have gotten worse over time. He's very easily distracted by random things and doesn't have good time management at all. He loves to say ""I don't have time"", but a lot of his time is wasted on things like making 4.5 page long random emails to people. He still hasn't taken care of important stuff like calling the VA to help take care of his father which could save him a lot of time. Also, he gets up extremely early and ends up taking long naps in the afternoon (1-3 hours) despite my insistence that he should be on a strict sleeping schedule

Whenever he talks about his business ideas, he talks like a person who's possessed and won't stop talking about it even after repeating the same points over and over again. Once at a family dinner, everything he said made up around 95% of the entire dinner conversation. Then he'll forget the other big moments that happened at dinner like somebody yelling. 

 He runs a few businesses that are severely in debt and yet he still thinks that he can get bailed out by getting more loans, but he never pays them off. He thinks that everything is going great and keeps having these random ideas and is extremely confident that he can become a multi-millionaire with all of his products. But I've barely seen any traction from them and he's failed at marketing his old products adequately which has led to dry sales. He only thinks about new product ideas and even wants to start a new business instead of managing the cashflow for his other businesses which is abysmal right now. He's also terrible at delegating tasks which leaves the employees aimless or having to do things by themselves. Whenever somebody tries to point out the faults in the way he's thinking, he gets pretty agitated. He even acts two-faced to the employees by telling them everything is great and we'll all be rich when he vents to his close family that he's broke. 

Outside of his business investments, he's known for risky practices like trying to call me when he's driving his van. He even once tried to call me while driving a semi truck. 

But the worst part about him is when he lashes out at his siblings whenever he sends emails to them. His brother is a lot richer and he's demanding $300K from his brother to cover his debts and he sent an email telling him to grow some balls and do it in Gigantic sized letters (at least 50 pt font). Then he tries to guilt trip everybody into helping him by bringing up these incidents that happened decades ago which should have easily been resolved by now. He even sent an email to his sister saying that she should look in a mirror saying everything is her fault. Then he claims everything is great for him and that she's responsible for her marriage failing since she's so negative saying she ignores her husband and can't ""please"" her husband anymore when all his sister did was send an email saying that their deceased Mom told them to look out for his mental well being. 

My family can hardly stand this behavior anymore and his brother floated the idea he could have bipolar disorder. I've checked out some of the symptoms and it definitely sounds like he's going through hypomania a lot of the time and he takes anti-depressants which could make it worse. But I just wanted some opinions from others who have Bipolar disorder or know somebody that has bipolar disorder if what I've described sounds somewhat familiar to you at all? If not, I'd like to hear any other opinions from anybody that read this.  ",27Jan2018,1,

The stream consists usually of my wife and I playing games with friends, drinking beers, and chatting with our community.

I am doing this because the internet has become an incredibly toxic community, especially in the gaming world, and I noticed no one is going at the gamers head on giving them an open place to talk about issues.
