1,"I have been seeing my therapist for over a year and have made very little progress. A handful of times he has gotten upset with me for not being able to share something with him, sometimes he will purposefully make me upset (I think it is his attempt to get me to tell him things). The last session we had he had accidentally hurt my feelings about something and I got so angry and frustrated about it I could only sit there in silence and fury for the rest of the session. For the remaining time he teased me about my anger: telling me that I have to be able to 'control my emotions'. After a few minutes I got very very upset, I stood up told him to go fuck himself and walked out. It has been three days since then and I am freaking out. Should I go to the next session? I have emailed him twice since then and he has not responded. I am so confused and upset I don't know what to do. I am obsessing over it. I don't want this to control my week. 

update: I really appreciate all the things you guys have said, it really helps. I have written a letter to him that I will give to him at the next session. Depending on how he responds in this next session (one more chance), I will either try again with him or get a new therapist. The plan is shaky though, I might just drop him completely. This isn't even the first time he has done something like this. Again, I really appreciate what you guys have been saying. Thank you for helping me feel supported.",19Jan2018,37
2,"Sorry for shitty story. Please help me out


I’m 31 no friends or family of any kind. No good job either. I have been thinking of suicide since at least 22, but I’ve never actually attempted to do it.


* When I was 23, I decided to go to therapist for the first time. My complaints were poor concentration (like, attention deficit) and lack of relationships. I was prescribed Zoloft and something against anxiety...


*...Knowing myself I’ll never gonna finish this PROPERLY, and I don’t know if any people gonna read this anyway. So i’m gonna write right it just off my head, sorry if it’s unreadable. And English is not my native language, too...*


* Whatever. I tried some mental health specialists during all these years. It didn’t work for me. First time I thought she(doctor) is only after my money. Another time I thought she actually despise me. Also she told my then gf I was going to dump her. Or maybe I was paranoid.


Last year I stumbled upon a comment about borderline personality disorder on Reddit, and description, symptoms and stories of people with BPD sound so familiar too me, it clicked with me and at some point it s felt almost like a catharsis: “I finally know what’s going on with me”. I ensured myself that I should check it out with professional. I got to the doctor in the big governmental institution. 


I talked to two doctors and they both independently said that I could probably have Schizotypal Personality Disorder (StPD) and organic Anxiety Disorder, but it needs further investigation.


What bugs me the most in this situation, is that the second doctor kept asking me why do you need diagnosis? Just why? Like it’s a wrong question to ask. 


And it bugs me till this day. I had been on and of meds for 2 years. I had leftovers of 5 different antidepressants at some point (all prescribed, I don’t mess with my health). And I also don’t know what was going on with me. I don’t know if i’m ‘cured’.

**And my question today is**: should I really proceed with this (further diagnosis). My country have free healthcare, but if I decide to proceed there’s still a lot of work to be done. Some paperwork, because i’m homeless. Talking to rude bureaucrats. Saving up money for the time I would spend in hospital and wouldn’t work (no paid leave where I work now). And energy for all of this.


One more important thing: I asked the doctor, “just tell me if i’m not ill”. She answered: “healthy people don’t go to institutions like ours”. Just like that. Isn’t it suspicious? I mean I know there are some people out there who totally make these mental illnesses up. Like your stereotypical 15 year girl who totes “have bipolar, depression and OCD”. What if I’m lying to myself?? But they prescribed me these meds in the past, maybe it means something?..


Thanks in advance!

The way they looked at me felt like they saw me as a lazy piece of crap.
Every time I leave the room I imagine them talking amongst themselves, wondering why I haven't killed myself yet, or don't I see how much of a burden I am?
I'm starting to believe this.

4,"I wrote a post the other day about my last session but, even though it did open my eyes a bit, I still feel as if there is no help for me. We had a hearty discussion after the session had ended, and I appreciate it immensely. Still, my feelings about therapy remains the same. What is the point? There is no help for me anyway...

The option available to me is a group for people with Aspergers. That, and therapy for OCD. It is not unlikely I will that one another shot, but what’s the point meeting a group of people with Aspergers? How is that going to help me? The only reason why I’m even considering it at this point is because she told me it could be a good way for me to maybe make some friends (finally). However, I’m moving away next year and, as I told her, I doubt I’ll ever seek help again; no matter how bad things will get. I have just lost complete faith in therapy. It makes me dread the next period where I feel depressed even more. It used to be I could tell myself that I can see help, but I doubt it’ll even cross my mind. I’ll just be lost and adrift with no hope of getting any help, because I honestly don’t believe there is any help for me to get. 

During that conversation (which, again, was after the session had ended), it was probably the first glimpse my psychologist has had to how I am when I’m by myself. I was just about to completely break down, but I managed to stop myself. It was obvious how I felt, but at least I didn’t completely break down. Just almost. I expect this may be something we’ll talk about next session. At least, I feel like talking more about it. The way I felt when I sat there was: completely hopeless, dreading my future because I know it will be filled with pain, and a depression that will only get worse. 

I just feel like there is no hope for me at this point and I don’t know how to deal with it. ",19Jan2018,1
6,"What sparked this was that I'm trying to unpack from a move.  I'm kinda frozen because stuff and not places to put it is hard.  I had a bunch of stuff from a box on the bed, it's just sunset so end of day but not bedtime.  I'm autistic in the communication aptitude. 

I get hubby into the bedroom to explain to him what I'm trying to accomplish, he just throws things around without explaining his piles, and dismisses my ""I want to tell you my plan"" noises with anger that I'm drunk.  (I didn't get the chance to explain that the pile was the top of the box, and how it looked to be uniforms that should go back in the box because he doesn't wear uniforms anymore.)  ((I'm going to end up washing those and buying more hangers to deal with them... Or I'm going to throw them off the balcony and hopefully remember to set them on fire before someone complains about the littering.))

I made the mistake of calling my hoarding issue ""hoarding"" which made the professionals make ""you have anxiety and if we cure that you won't have hoarding"" noises... instead of if I appropriately called it ""executive function disorder"" they would have said that the test for ADHD came back inconclusive and you're just lazy.

I don't have a place to set up a puzzle, or play with legos, or even play with anything new that I could buy...

7,"Hello, I’ve never thought I had anxiety growing up but I’ve always known I’ve had depression. My sister had severe anxiety and bpd and it put a lot of stress on my family, and compared to her I thought I was mentally healthy. It wasn’t until I moved away to college that I realized I’ve never been happy in my life.

I’ve always been able to distract myself from my troubles as a kid by playing video games and reading, I would just get away from the thoughts by thinking about fiction instead, but it doesn’t work like that anymore. 

It was triggered the worst last year when a friend of mine committed suicide and wrote in his journals that he struggled with a lot of feelings that I struggled with as well. There was a lot of guilt regarding missing the chance to talk to him and tell him he wasn’t alone. 

I’ve always had crying spells where, when I start crying about anything -happy, sad, beautiful- I can’t stop. It becomes overwhelming and sometimes lasts for hours. I thought that was a part of depression.

After my friend passed away, I started therapy and I was prescribed to bupropion, I’m now taking bupropion XL 300mg every day. I’ve noticed the past couple months on it that I’ve been a lot more productive, but I also noticed I find myself getting caught in negative thoughts worse than ever before. I think about things people said to me 5 years ago, small things people have said that makes me think they might hate me, feeling like whenever I talk nobody wants to hear it. I never felt any of that stress before. It was hopelessness before, but now I’m panicked about all these negative thoughts, my chest feels heavy, my stomach feels tight, and I have the prickly feeling behind my eyes a lot. 

Basically what I’m wondering is.. is this anxiety? I’ve read that bupropion can cause anxiety. But I don’t want to stop taking it if possible because it’s my second antidepressant after I tried sertraline which gave me bad physical side effects. Bupropion works for my depression, but the way I feel now is almost worse, but I don’t want to have to deal with talking to my psychiatrist, weening off, and starting a whole new medicine again. 

TLDR: I’ve always had depression and now I’m on antidepressants that might be causing horrible anxiety. Need help identifying anxiety and advice on what to do. ",19Jan2018,3
8,"I know I'm mentally ill and I have been since the beginning of middle school. It has been about 6 years now? I struggled with depression, social anxiety, an eating disorder, etc. I've noticed some seemingly mundane symptoms. I started to have really inconsistent handwriting when I started middle school. I went from having consistently cute bubbly handwriting to really variable handwriting. My teacher has once accused me of having different ppl do my work for me since my handwriting differs a lot. It's dependent on my mood. Sometimes, it's bubbly and then in another class it'll be long and thin and then wide and spread out. And eventually it's no longer easy to read. I don't know what to do? The only time it's ever consistent is when I actively think about how I write, but it never lasts for long. I read online on multiple websites that it's a sign of instability. Does that mean I'm crazy? I know I'm doing better now. Much better than I did before. Mental illness runs in my family specifically on my dad's side. I think my dad and paternal grandmother also have it but idk exactly what it is? I've never been to therapy before, but my friends have been suggesting it all these years, but I'm scared and I don't like opening up so I've never gone before. I also shower infrequently and I feel super gross? I only shower twice a week. Sometimes I don't brush my teeth either, but I try to hide it by not talking to anyone.

10,"Will try to keep this as short as possible, for context I'm a 19F college student. 

I feel unable to sustain any relationship with any depth, romantic or platonic. I am so perpetually afraid of being boring, of getting too comfortable and accidentally exposing my 5000 neuroses, of coming off weird, of being underwhelming, of being annoying, of everything, I am so scared of everything. 

I try so hard all the time. I try all the time to make new friends but they never stick. It's my fault because I can't be open or vulnerable with other people but if I was open they would hate me. Lately I'm just... losing it a little bit. The other day I just got drunk by myself (I drink alone... more often than is socially acceptable) and cried in my room for three hours. Today I almost started crying just walking down the street so I just went home and had a drink and started crying again. I started skipping meals because I hate eating alone. I feel lonely, constantly. This sounds so dramatic but even when I was a kid I felt like this, I always felt like my friends didn't like me as much as I liked them. It's so hard to keep thinking that trying will pay off when I am so desperately lonely every day. I have no friends I feel close to, that I feel like I could talk about how I feel with.

I don't think I come off as super lonely or unhappy externally. I go to a highly-ranked university, get good grades, and am very involved in various clubs, community service, leadership, work, et cetera. I've had people outright tell me ""oh you're so self-assured, I thought you must be older than a sophomore, haha"" in casual conversation, not trying to flirt or suck up or anything. In superficial interactions, I'm passable, even a little funny and likable. I used to be really depressed in high school, but I'm not anymore. I never got help for it, basically clawing out by myself, and I think it fucked me up a lot because I think there's a lot of shit I left broken. I feel like I'm constantly in conflict with myself-- ""they're bored of you""/""no they're not that's crazy"" on repeat all day long. But I don't know what my problem is, if there's anything I can do or if some people just... live like this and don't have real friends.

**tl;dr-** I can't make friends, I feel like they don't like me so I stop actively keeping up with them. Lately my mood has been really low and I've been crying way too much because of how lonely I always am and how fruitless trying is starting to seem. Don't think I'm really clinically depressed though because it used to be way worse and I'm honestly very functional outside of this. I just desperately want to know what is wrong with me already.",19Jan2018,2
11,"Dang this story is long.  OK, so I’m in the middle of withdrawls from my antidepressant Trintillex.  But in order for this to make sense I have to provide a back story.
I have been with my General Practitioner for about a year and a half now.  Due to finances and insurance, seeing a “regular” doctor to treat my depression and anxiety is all that has been in the cards for the last few years.  I am having a couple of problems with her.  She only writes prescriptions for one month at a time, every prescription, doesn’t matter what it’s for.  Which is hard to keep up with when you have depression, anixiety a LIFE, etc.  I have to make sure I have the pharmacy fax the prescriptions for refills in ample time.  Once I was left hanging without my anti-anxiety pills but only for one day, so I made due (only because my husband has PTSD and has his own anti-anxiety pills)
Second problem, I obviously need to be seeing a psychiatrist.  I had discussed with my doctor that I was ready to see a psychiatrist and she said she’d help me find one that was on my insurance.  Great, I thought.  Well she kept trying to get me to go to these inpatient/outpatient clinics.  She even said she faxed one place my information, and I had no clue she was going to do that. 
 I care for my disabled veteran husband full time and 6 hours a day of outpatient just was not going to work for me.  Plus I seriously felt they’d try to throw me into inpatient.  Also, I would still have to have a psychologist once it was all over with anyway.  Soooo…I waited until I could save up the money to see a private psychologist/psychiatrist…whichever it is.  It is taking me a while to get in.  So until then I’m still at the mercy of my general practitioner.
And here’s where the problem arises.  Either the pharmacy messed up and didn’t send in my fax request to refill my antidepressant or the doctor didn’t get it.  I didn’t know this…on the pharmacy website it showed as waiting for doctor approval.  I wait, having enough to make it through the weekend, so I don’t make any phone calls.  Then I realize that the Monday coming up was a holiday and I was screwed.  But not having my meds for one night wasn’t that bad.  Tuesday came and went and no meds.  So I went to the pharmacy and asked for a couple of loaners.  They typically do it for everything but narcotic pain meds and benzos.  He said he couldn’t do it.  But he said he would personally call the doctor immediately and to wait there.  He did so, got on the phone with someone, told them I had been out for a couple of days and really needed them and instead of them filling it, they told him to refax the request.  I figured they’d respond that afternoon before they left the doctors office.  But of course they did not.
At this point I’m starting to feel it a little bit, but it was probably more of the anxiety of knowing I didn’t have it in my system.  Who knows.  I make it through the night and call the doctor the next day.  I got the receptionist and told her I had been without for quite a few days and she was snippy with me saying they just got the fax the day before.  Grrrr.  I let her know that a fax was sent out over a week ago and someone missed it.  Anyway, somehow, someone refilled it.  I got an automated call from the pharmacy at 4pm and I went online to verify that it was indeed the med I had ordered.  Yes it was!
But, it was a 90 day script and I only wanted 30 days.  I speak to someone online at the pharmacy (it's a big chain) and ask him if he can change it to 30 days or if I needed to call the local pharmacy.  He said he could do it and that they would be ready in about an hour.  
Later that night I send my hubby to pick up our daughter and my script.  While he’s gone I double check on it online.  It’s not filled and it’s status looks weird.  I call the pharmacy (it’s late at night but the night managers are usually really good and sweet).  The girl tells me they are out of stock.  I ask her how they can be out of stock when they had it filled at 4pm for 90 pills.  She said there is noting she can do…that they were never filled.  I ask for the manager, she puts another girl on the phone.  I tell her what is happening and ask her if a lower dose pill is in stock and ask if I can have a couple of those until the order comes in…and that had I known they were out of stock at 4, I would have transferred the prescription to another pharmacy.  She said she couldn’t do that…then put me back on the phone with the same girl I had started talking to.  I told her I didn’t want to talk to her I wanted to talk to a manager.  She then told me there was no manager there, how cute considering you just supposedly put me on the phone with a manager.  She told me that they would call/fax the doctor again in the morning and see if the doctor would approve giving me a few of the lower dose pills until the order came in.
Last night was rough.
I call the doctor today.  I let the receptionist know that I’m having major problems with the pharmacy, the confusion and without my meds.  I didn't want any more confusion on my prescription.  And I ask her if there was a request for the lower dosage from the pharmacy and of course there is not!!  I ask her to please, please have the nurse call me.  Literally begging here.  I was going to ask the nurse if she had any samples and send my husband to go get them.  I did my best to not lose it, keep calm, get through the withdrawl symptoms, etc.  And NO phone call from the nurse.
Tonight is even worse.
My meds supposedly come in some time tomorrow.  I’m trying to keep myself sedated.  I really feel that if I go into the hospital that they will put me in inpatient.  But I promise all of you reading this that if it gets to bad, of course I will go.
Thanks for listening to my loooong story.

12,"Well i didn't do it. I could bring myself to commit suicide today. But it doesnt change how messed up my life is. Im in constsnt pain over my ex who left me in 2016. I was mugged abd have panic attacks abd flash backs about it.  And i had to watch an 11 year old girl die after falling off a wall whilst i was a youth worker. I couldn't do anything to help. 

Ive dropoed out of university due to mental health. I couldn't take it after my ex left me. She had been cheating on me and suddenly cut all contact and dissapeared from my life after 8 years.  Then she made false allegations against me that got me arrested until they cleared me of charges. I had to spend 21 hours in complete silence in a cell for no reason. 

I now have nothing. For the last 2 years ive had therapy. Ive tried many medications. Ive attempted many times. Ive tried ti move on and meet new people. But im just lonely with no prospects of a future. No job. No friends. Nothing. Ive lost all interest in life and no matter what i do i constantly think about my ex. About how much i love her. She was abusive for 8 years but i still feel that way. All i want is to go back. 

I don't know how to get better. I wabt a job i love. A partner who isnt abusive. Friends. I want a life. To be happy. But i dont know how. I cabt bring myself to attempt again it seems so please someone help me. How can i get better?",19Jan2018,2

I'm not exactly looking for advice or sympathy, I just wanted to say that everywhere I go I feel violated. I feel I have no control and no dignity at all. I feel like I live and die at the mercy of other people. I feel helpless. I get very angry sometimes, which my therapist has helped me understand is a form of protection. I get angry when I'm alone. Sometimes I get so angry the muscles in my face tense up and I can't speak or think about anything. I just wait for it to clear up.

I feel abused. I feel I've been cheated, like a lot of the wonderful things I was supposed to have experienced in my life were denied to me, or taken from me. There is no one in my life that treats me that way currently, but I spent the majority of my childhood alone. I suffered a lot of exclusion, bullying, emotional abuse from my family. I came to expect that kind of treatment. I came to believe that I was stupid and ugly, both of which I have so much evidence to the contrary but even though I know it I cannot believe it. Everywhere I go, no matter how old I get or whatever I accomplish I still feel like a child. I feel trapped that way forever. I feel like sooner or later people all around me are going to see what I see, and they're going to realize I'm not supposed to be here, and that could be the end of my life.

I feel that way pretty much constantly, and sometimes it's very hard for me to concentrate on anything else.

I am in therapy, I am on 2 anti-depressants, and I have friends I can talk to when things get bad, so I am not alone or without help. But there are things written here that I cannot tell anyone because I feel ashamed of my own pain. I feel ashamed to tell anyone that I feel so sub-human. It makes me feel weak. It makes me feel disgraceful and disgusting. Just thinking about those feelings makes me feel not like a man. It makes me feel like I've been defeated, by the whole world, like I lost decades ago and now I'm just lingering.

I decided to post this here because it is one small way for me to respect myself, and to give myself what I need, and what I think I deserve, which is a voice. These feelings are unfortunately a very big part of who I am, and I don't want to hide from them anymore. I want to own it and accept it, and stop being afraid of letting the world know.

15,"This is the first time I'm sharing this with anyone. I never told a soul while I was going through this. I just want *someone* to hear it now.

I have an *unbelievably* severe specific phobia of catching one specific disease (that's not really what it's of, but it's a good analogy). I would rather die than catch this disease. No question. Yes, it's *that* unbearable and disturbing to me. I am that fucking terrified. My fear is not of dying, it's of experiencing/having the disease *itself*. The funny thing is that I have never been exposed to anything that causes the disease.

I had come up with various scenarios where I would be forcibly infected with this disease while being held in some way (as a captive, slave, etc.) and would not be able to either get treatment or kill myself. So I decided, if I kill myself now (at that time) then I can ensure I will never ever catch this disease and be in that situation. There were multiple ways to ensure I would never experience the object of my phobia, but only one was easily available to me at that time - being dead - and I was going to take it. I didn't actually want to die, I just needed to ensure I'd never get infected, even if that meant death.

Pretty soon, I was having at least hourly thoughts of how I was going to kill myself. This went on for 3-4 years. But I hoped to fix the problem via medical treatments you can get to make sure you don't ever catch the disease, and that's what I did as soon as I could.

The treatment essentially changed my life. It was like flipping a switch. I went from living in a state of absolute, unvarnished terror...to feeling basically normal. I haven't thought about killing myself since then either. I went from having multiple panic attacks a week, to one a *year*. It seems unreal even to me that a treatment could make such a difference, but it did. I'm so far removed now (both time-wise and in terms of my mental state) that I had to look through some old journals to even write this post.

More recently, I was looking around online, and I found that these feelings aren't uncommon among people who have very severe specific phobias. I've seen people express ""I need to make sure I will never experience [object of phobia], or I'm going to kill myself"". But I haven't seen anyone else yet who was actually suicidal for an extended period of time because of a specific phobia. I would be curious if anyone here has a similar experience or can relate to anything I wrote.",19Jan2018,2

I have started to become forgetful in ways that I was not before and frequently forget Ideas or personal belongings, something I would not have done previously. It all feels like depression except I am mot sad in any way.  

I also have been having strange thoughts. Some of them are paranoid feelings that I am being watched, there are cameras, or someone is spying on me through my phone. I feel like  everyone is looking at me sometimes when I walk in public. I often have thoughts that feel foreign. I will have my own thoughts, but my mind will spit out gibberish intermittently. They are thoughts that I don’t think. Sometimes I get violent or suicidal impulsive urges. But I am not suicidal at all and don’t want to be violent.

But I am not sure If I am making all of this up. If this really was happening, would I be concerned that I could have psychosis? I honestly don’t know if I REALLY think I live in a simulation, or if I make myself do this for some reason.

She's completely dedicated her life to channeling books from spiritual beings, and has been convinced several times she was going to disappear into the 5th dimension, even almost got herself stranded on Mt Shasta looking for the entrance to Telos, to name a few things. She looks about 10 years older than she is from poor nutrition and refusing to use any sort of skin care and is currently eating mostly fruit and nuts.

Therapist believes she has ego-syntonic narcissism, and I could see that as a real possibility, but it just doesn't give me much help.

I have been in therapy for a few months but  I blow off visits with my therapist all the time. She is nice as far as someone to just drone on about every day annoyances or surfaces level problems. 

She never gives any feedback as far as any tools or suggestions of how to work through anything. The first visit I told her my main goal is to find healthier coping mechanisms. Not one suggestion. She talks about herself for AT LEAST 50% of the session. And not just an anecdote here or there but like goes into detail about her problems to the point where I'm giving her advice. I mean she's just like another girlfriend or one of my sisters to shoot the shit with and vent which I already have I'm looking for real help with anxiety and depression that consume my life and tp heal from old traumas that cause me suffering. Feeling waves of guilt and shame for no reason to the point where I want to crawl out of my skin.

We NEVER go into my past or any underlying issues where my trauma lies. I told her I was depressed in one visit she just says uh huh, uh huh. Then I miss 3 visits come back and tell her I'm getting cover for all my shifts and barely showering and thinking suicidal thoughts. She says, but you were just laughing and joking around, your voice isn't flat etc, etc, basically tells me I'm not depressed. I said ok well I think I might need meds or something because I feel like I'm gonna lose it. So that was back in early December and somehow I was lucky enough that someone canceled and I got in to see the psychiatrist for tomorrow. 

Should I talk to my psychiatrist about my therapist? Are they going to care about any of my issues or just want to hear my symptoms and medicate me? I want to know if there's anthing I can do to prepare. I like to go in to things like this with notes because I can clam up and forget things, but I don't know where to start. I would feel so much better if I knew what kind of things we are going to or aloud to talk about.",19Jan2018,1
22,"In fall 2016 I started my sophomore year of college. To provide some context, over the summer I was dealing with the reality of my grandma having to start chemo right as I left for school, I was dumped, and my friends didn’t want to see me. A couple weeks into the semester, I was also rejected by every sorority on campus. Needless to say, I wasn’t in a good state of mind when I went back. 

(I should also mention that I also have Asperger’s, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and a slight case of PTSD). This also was NOT a typical depressive episode for me, either. 

For that entire semester, I felt completely unattached to the world around me. Often when I would walk to class, it felt as if I was watching myself, like I was on TV. Think of that one scene in “The Shining” where you see the kid riding his bike through the hotel from behind. It was like that. My college campus, which I became very familiar with, felt foreign to me. It was like I had never been there before, or I felt like I wasn’t supposed to be there. I even felt like I was living some days over again, even if what we were covering in class was completely different or if I had something different to eat. 

As far as I can remember this was the first time where I’ve experienced something like this. While there were periods of time in middle school where a week felt like just a really long and boring day or my time outside of school being a blur, I’ve never had a sort of out of body experience like that. Luckily since I got out of college (it wasn’t for me and the stress made me suicidal) nothing resembling that has happened. The worst that’s happened is maybe a random crying fit. 

I’d like to hear your thoughts on this if it’s not too much to ask. ",19Jan2018,1
24,"When I was a kid, definitely younger than 10 since we lived in the UK at that time, I remember sitting on the kitchen counter top next to the stove..my mom was really irritated I guess, and I asked her whether the stove, the element, was hot, and she said ""why don't you touch it and see"" and I put my hand on it, it was hot, I blacked out, what I remember after that is getting home from the hospital I think, and I had this filmy thing on my hand.  Any chance that event could be the cause of my inability to trust, and obsession with figuring out things?",19Jan2018,1

26,"Hi there. I have no idea what I'm doing here, but here I go.

I know something's wrong. I definitely battle depression and OCD, and my weight is a constant struggle. But there's something more.

I go through these weird mood swings. They're not like normal ones that can be attributed to hormones or PMS or going through everyday life. One moment, I feel amazing and happy and light. The next, I'm planning ways to kill myself. Then, later, maybe I'll want to buy a thousand things or steal a couple, if I don't get caught. These moods only last for a few hours. They never last days, and certainly not weeks.

What's happening to me? I don't know how to get help because the therapists I've seen have no idea what's going on either.",19Jan2018,1
27,"Hey Reddit, it's nice to be here. I often help or give advice to people with relationship problems.. but my problems are really getting out of hand.

I don't mean to bore you, but my life has been really taking a toll on me and I wanted to reach out and ask for help. So showing me some empathy and deep advice will help me feel better. In no manner I am trying to seek attention, just help.

Starting from the age of 6, my parents are very conservative. They used to beat me if I didn't study and made sure I studied. My mother would sometimes bring out the belt or the stick and I was really afraid cause it hurt. It was their way of telling me that if they didn't do that I wouldn't grow up or learn discipline.

At the age of 13 my dad fucked up and got into a huge debt which my mom paid off, he had his drinking problems and shortly fell into depression later on. He was always bitter and wanted me to be perfect at everything I do. My hair, my dressing, my eating habits, like he was going for perfection.

Sometimes my parents wouldn't give me money to take to school, so sometimes when I felt hungry I would have no money and had to just watch the other kids eat. There's definitely violence, physical abuse, financial abuse, emotional abuse etc. I was never allowed to develop a sense of self will, or selfishness growing up. It felt like they gave birth to a child and they wanted me to be perfect in every way.

They wouldn't let me speak to women, they'd always be suspicious about what I was doing and when we almost went broke, I had to wear the same school uniform for 2 years back to back, even the shoes and socks. I felt so insecure to be around other kids, like they had it all but me. It took a huge toll on me and my studies started to dip. 

They used to abuse me saying why won't I study, they compared me to other kids and asked me to eat their shit so that I could get some sense. I felt really bad because I try really hard and I can't wrap my head around it. In short, I never received their love to cross my inner boundaries. No compliments meant anything to me, and I fell into a relationship with a girl who also had divorced parents.

I became a narcissist, started controlling her and her behavior. Kept fighting, abusing.. asking her for her love and time. Was super insecure and my anxiety shot up through the roof sending me into depression once she left me without any closure. This girl gave me so much love and emotional support I started becoming dependent and was afraid to be alone again. The same parents today and I live in existential crisis.

I've failed at everything I've picked up. Failed college, failed engineering, dropped studies.. chose music, became a DJ and I did well. But to take it to the next step I have no money nor do my parents. It's weird because I feel I never left these women who abused me cause I was used to it.. it just felt like manipulation to get what they want. I stayed because I knew my parents are old now and they'll never love me the way I want them to.

I'm 22 now, with depression.. anxiety.. substance abuse.. alcohol problems and anger. My dad and I speak like 3 sentences in a day and my mom and I speak like 12 maybe. It feels like I'm an orphan and my dad doesn't work. He's really messed my self esteem up and was never a good role model to look up to. My mother is the only food bringer to the family and I buy clothes once a year. I am totally devastated that it has become like this and sometimes I ruminate so bad about my exes, missing the love and validation they gave me.

I've been under therapy but it doesn't help. And now I have anxiety. I fear commitment, I love too hard and always ask for love and if they don't give it to me I feel as if it's going to be bad. I fell for a narcissistic girl and she fucked me up in a couple months. I always attract broken people in my life who want to use me.. and I am always sad. Never felt happiness really in a while and sometimes I think about suicide.

My career as a musician is at a standstill, I failed at piano too, I lost interest in almost everything and I smoke up, drink to mask the pain. I fear for my future and I am the only son. To top all this up, I am Indian.

I don't know how to progress with my future with so much failure, low self esteem, low self confidence, no courage or will. I feel like my existence on this planet is a curse and I always day dream about the good days in the future. Everyone is sad around me and I have no friends, I cut all contact with them cause they have better handling options about their lives and I feel like I just don't fit.

Every day I wake up, ruminate, get depressed, lash out.. get high, get drunk and go to sleep with a empty heart. I fear a lot about being successful cause I have enemies who want to bring me down and at this point my question about god being there for me in non existent.

Please help me decide what's best for my future, how to make money and be successful in the music industry. It's my passion and I love music. A very good escape mechanism and it's not harmful. I feel so weak, and broken because I loved my parents and now I resent towards them for bringing me up in such a ill fashioned manner. I keep abusing my mum and keep asking her why why did you all do this to me.

I have no courage to take another step at life or jobs because I am afraid I will fail. Women just wanted to use me and leave me, my teachers have been abusive and my friends aren't healthy for me. I've come to my corner with no hope of getting up again. 

Will anybody help me realise WTF is going on in my life? Sounds like so much bad karma.. and everyone is getting ahead or head and I'm here struggling to go to sleep. It makes me cringe and then anger comes out.

Please try not to be philosophical or tell me to do this and that.. I wanna know how to get back up on my feet and win. Show everyone that I am superior and I can do it. I want my own car, my own friends and a really healthy life. But it's the opposite of that now.. and I'm growing older. I feel I am mentally sick, and good for nothing. Constant failures at every aspect of life.

Help me? This Indian wants to change the world, but the world is really showing me it's ugly sides and it's damaged me from within. Like a fracture on my soul. Sorry, but whoever reads this, thank you. I mean it.",19Jan2018,1
30,"Sorry if this really long or unclear, I'll do my best to clarify if need be.

 After 10 years of being sort of ok, I suddenly started having panic attacks again. So far three since the new year started.

A little background:
When I was 18 I had my first panic attack and went to seek help immediately. Got my self a great therapist, got the attacks under control but started self harming instead. It took me about a year to get that under control. I was ok for a couple of years, two years ago I attempted suicide and began seeing my therapist again. I have an emotionally instable personality disorder with borderline tendencies. After my suicide attempt I started to look at myself and my issues in a more serious and reflected way and I was getting so much better. Also my (ex) bf helped me a lot and I grew into a much better version of myself over the last two years.

But two weeks ago I suddenly had a panic attack out of nowhere. The bf and I went to a bar and I was told there were 60 more people to come. I got a bit claustrophobic, which grew into an attack, so I walked home while talking to my bff on the phone to calm me down. As soon as I opened my door I felt way better. 

A week later I on my way to work (public transport) I started getting very nervous, sweaty and fidgetty which resulted in the next attack. Luckily I was almost there and got off the bus quickly and was able to walk it off. I was alone in the office for a bit and just did some routine things, like turn on the computer, making coffee and calmed down pretty quick. 

Yesterday I had a major attack while at work. I told my supervisor a week prior to that what to do if I ever had an attack at work. I don't like being touched during the attack since I get that weird thing with bacteria and diseases, I think if someone touches me I'll get aids or lice, which just agitates me even more. 
So I sat on my desk and started feeling a little dizzy and thought I might just faint or something, so I layed down and called my supervisor. Another collegue got me a glass of water and they were very nice, we all thought I was just having a circleroundbreakdown. But then it hit me out of nowhere, I was hyperventilating and I was sure that the water was poisened and if anybody touched me I'd die. They left the room so I could calm down, I sat on the floor for like 30 minutes just shaking and thinking about that toxic water. Since I already drank some of it prior to the attack, I was sure I was poisened and toxic.
My supervisor eventually managed to get me in the car after he promised someone would drive me home. He called my mom to let her know what happenend and to make sure she was there when I got home. As soon as I stepped in our apartment I felt better and just went to bed. 

Did anyone ever have a similar experience? Nothing in my life is stressing me out too much, tbh. Sure, my job annoys me sometimes, the bf and I broke up, but on very good terms and we're still fwb (long story, but we're actually better off not being an official couple), uni isn't easy but I manage just fine... so I really can't find a trigger or anything in that sense. I'll talk to my therapist about it next week, but maybe some of you went through something similar and can provide some insight?
Anyway, thanks for reading.

tl;dr: After 10 years of being sort of ok and working on myself I suddenly get panic attacks again.",19Jan2018,1

36,"Hello everyone, this is more of a *""I'm seeing this too much and I'm too intimidated to check if something might be wrong""* post.
I'm a student living in America not from here though. Got here on a scholarship, everything was fine. My course started acting funny and asked me to leave in the last semester and said I need to get a mental health check-up before they can keep me. This was because they said I wasn't progressing fast enough seeing my patients. I was determined to be what I came here to be but all I got was a "" you can't always get what you want"" during my final meeting. Long story short I HAD to transfer as I couldn't stay in the country long enough to actually go to counseling and make a plan ( which I later found out was not legal for then to do from my ombudsman). I couldnt/ can't fight a legal battle there because again I had 2 months in the country on a student budget and the USA is expensive!

It was a tough last 6 months but I'm finally in my last semester. Problem is to that I think I have this PTSD/depression thing going on. I'm constantly doubting myself ( I feel it's because I never knew anything was wrong till the end in the last course) I take like 15 mins to send an email cz I'm looking over and over thinking my words in case they offend anyone and I've started thinking in my head so much that I'm scared its making me dissociative at times. I lose track of sentences ppl are speaking sometimes and tend to forget stuff and information general. This never happened before but it's kinda hampering my relationships and confidence. It comes to a point where I feel like crying for no reason almost like 50% of the time now

I'm a little intimidated about seeking help because of the stigma it might put on me, or what my family and friends might think. This never happened before, and I was always stress free earlier but all I seem to do now is stress. 

Apologies if this doesn't fit here.",19Jan2018,1
38,"I recently had a breakdown of some sort. I violently threw apart everything in my home while screaming. I have never had an anger problem or been in a fight. My father, instead of comforting me- cursed at me more. And took videos of my breakdown to press charges on damaged property. I wanted to be consoled and comforted, but instead I was cursed at and recorded. He recorded me while I was lying down in the middle of all that i had destroyed. He only cared about himself, and this lead me to break more things. I laid down on the floor in the midst of all I broke, crying.

I've always been a gentle and confused person, never have I done this before. Im 17. Also, I may be going to jail for a probation violation due to drug abuse.

40,"Actually I did ask this before but I weren't being honest and too afraid and shy to say this but this time, I will try.

So I have crazy imagination and keep imagine things that I don't want to and it's hard to control. For example, like some random unknown guy passed by, I will suddenly imagine that I do disgusting thing with him..

Sounds normal? Ok but there's more. For example like if there's poop on street, sometimes, my mind suddenly imagine that I eat it or touch it and lick it and that's so disgusting and I can't control it. I mean the thoughts come just like that. 

And sometimes, I unintentionally imagine that I have sex with my own family member or oral sex which is wrong and goddamn disgusting when I'm in same place with one of them. 


And to stop this thoughts, I usually interrupt the imaginations and torture myself. For example like when I imagine I eat disgusting things, I would interrupt the imagination and imagine that I cut my tongue.
But if it's related to a person, I would imagine that I torture or beat the person or kill him/her.

How do I know?",19Jan2018,3
46,"A few things about myself that I feel are important in a discussion like this

*I'm 28

*I'm very desensitized to physical sensations. It can be cold outside, everyone will mention how cold it is, my skin will look orange/pink (I'm white) but the physical sensation of cold is barely registering with my brain. Same thing with hot, I love scolding hot showers. Same thing with pain, I can't recall a physical pain in the last 5 years where my brain was like, ""ouch that hurt."" Same thing with sex, etc...

*It is very hard to keep me mentally stimulated too. Because of this, I generally opt out of social situations because I'm uninterested in like 95% of what goes on, the conversations, etc... I generally keep myself interested by looking for social patterns people specifically have or there is copious amounts of alcohol. I've learned to pick up and fake social ques very well as most of them do not come naturally to me. My girlfriend loves when I for real laugh, smile, and show happiness; it's just unfortunate that I'm only close enough to my girlfriend to show them.

*I pick up concepts extremely quick. It's hard to learn from other people because they generally give too many examples and go on waaay too long, I understand points very quickly and my brain has a tendency to not want to listen if I already understand what is being said. I cope with this by a series of quirks like tapping my feet, pinching my hand, looking around the room, etc... I've gone through 10 years of college without taking notes and learned concepts independently from lectures (using lectures as a fundamental basis and then spending an hour with independent learning).

*I'm not afraid of taking risks. Compared to the average, I love taking risks and experimenting. I'm not afraid to ruin a 2 hour meal if it meant trying something new. 

*I'm like a machine, I'm very distant from my emotions. I feel like I have never learned to cope with my emotions. 99% of the time I am a docile person who generally keeps a distance from people so that I cannot be affected emotionally. However, in those 1% situations, I go from 0 to 100 and can lose control of my actions.

*Very recently I've been unintentionally having conversations with myself. I don't realize this, my girlfriend points it out all the time, I will reenact past conversations and future conversations. I generally whisper very quietly and won't even realize that I'm doing it or what I am saying. If my girlfriend points it out, I can quickly capture the thoughts and describe why I was doing it, otherwise I cannot recollect doing this. I've learned that situations remind me of past or possibly future conversations and it just makes me live the event again unintentionally. For example, I was cleaning out a storage shed (which I live in a condo) and remember when the upstairs neighbor was showing me the door to their storage shed. They were asking if the HOA covers it and a conversation started that way. Just being in the shed, I started whispering through that conversation and I was unaware I was even doing it until my girlfriend saw that I was moving my mouth as if I were talking.

**Now that I think about this point. I used to have a habit much younger in life where I would slightly wake up and have what felt like a minute conversation with no one. I would continue with the conversation until I realized that I wasn't talking with anyone. By this point I would forget what it was even about. Brings up another good point, I have frequent sleep paralysis to the point where I'm no longer terrified of them. I constantly remember my dreams and often in lucid dreaming states. One of my favorite hobbies is dreaming in between snooze alarms and usually being lucid in them. I do this to the extreme, I'll push a 10 minute snooze alarm 15+ times in a row until I can't fall back asleep again.

*I love being in an altered state of mind. However, on a semi-rare occasion my paranoia levels jump through the roof especially in public. I think everyone is looking at me, talking about me, laughing at me... I understand that my brain is constantly looking for laughter (etc...) and irrationally connects them that they are laughing at me. I understand there is a lot of uncertainty and missing information in my brain and in these states of minds, my brain fills in the missing information with false information.

*I have an unnatural ability of breaking down complex topics and being able to structure them appropriately for a target audience.

I'm certain there are other things, do any of you relate to these things?

56,"So my friend who I was really close to for a while stopped talking to me for a while and I was hurt but when I heard back from her today she came over and we smoked and she started to get paranoid and her mood would change and she would be afraid of me. Then not be. Then tell me to back away. Anyways she said she wants to go calm down and ask me to go with her. So I do. Her moods continue to change. I do my best to calm her down. And keep her calm but then she tells me to run cause she hears someone coming out of an apartment building over from us. I run cause I know she’s mentally not fully there. 

Then she runs after me like she’s scared then she sees the guys walking and is like “those are grown men. Let’s invite them to the house” we are 20-22 year old females. She’s like “I wanna do something crazy” and gives me a look that terrifies me so I run up to my house. Lock the door. Catch my breath. I figure she would calm down then we would talk. 

She eventually does. But not before she punches my door. Then I crack the door cause I want to be able to shut it really quick if she freaks me out. I care about her but I care more about my safety. 

So we talk for a bit she then starts to talk to something that isn’t there. And then starts moaning and starts having an orgasm. Or at least that’s what it looked like to me. Shut the door to give her some personal space. Then a few mins later knocking on the door. I open it up she talks about how she needs to be with-the how she needs to be away from her ex (heroin addict that has no interest in helping himself) and that he’s dangerous and then that she only trusts him. 

She tells me she wants to be with me. And for me to be her soulmate forever. I still wanna be her friend but i think she needs to take care of herself. I told her I would help her make an appointment to see a psychiatrist or some sort of mental health doctor. I just want to see her okay. She opened up to me a lot while she was freaking out. And I don’t want her to think because she’s freaking out I don’t care about her. 

Oh and she knows I have a haunted doll (it’s supposedly a good spirit of a little girl) and she keeps asking for it cause it’s a demon (I’ve barely had any action with this doll. Let alone demonic activity. I bought a “haunted doll” on eBay for the novelty) and she said she needs it and that I need to take it to a priest. 

She told me she thinks she’s schizophrenic cause she hears voices and sees things and she’s had a history of abusing animals and  she was abused as a kid. And she said she thinks she needs to see someone for it. I don’t know much about the condition but I was trying to take care of the situation the best I could but I have really bad anxiety and though it’s getting really a lot better things like this situation really freak me out so I’ve locked her out of the house. Which I feel terrible for but I’m so fucking scared and I’m home alone with
Just my old man dog and my cat. 

I don’t know what this is or what I can do. I just wish I had some answers that could explain any of this. 

Thanks. ",19Jan2018,1
57,"I've already completed one semester of my RN-BSN program but I'm finding it almost impossible to do the work this semester. I feel like I just want to drown myself in distractions. I spend ALL of my free time off in a fantasy world, either reading or fantasizing. I've even toyed with the idea of calling in just so I don't have to face reality - not that I would actually call in because of that. 
Basically, I've had problems with depression for years and I've never seen a therapist or really been medicated. I wouldn't call my depression REALLY bad right now because I use suicidal thoughts as my marker, and I haven't had any of those for a good six months. But I am definitely depressed, and I'm questioning everything in my life and I also have some relationship problems I haven't been dealing with. 
So, should I drop the semester now while I can without being charged or should I give myself a good kick in the pants and get on with it?",19Jan2018,2
58,"I have quite a history with mental healthcare by now. The first time I went into therapy I was 13 - that's 10 years ago. Over the past 10 years, I've tried to keep a journal very often. Sometimes because I wanted to myself, sometimes because a therapist asked me to do so. In both cases, I'd usually give up after a week or two because I couldn't motivate myself to take the time and energy, and often I just wanted to forget about my problems, not write them down. Diaries just didn't work for me.

A few days ago I found a free app called [Daylio](https://daylio.webflow.io). It's a diary/mood tracker app that only takes a minute to log, which has worked so well for me. 

The idea is that you pick a mood (the default moods are great, good, meh, bad, awful) and any number of activities (there's a lot of default ones to pick from and you can add your own). You can add text, too, but it's entirely optional. Sometimes I will add a line or two, sometimes I don't feel like it and I don't add anything at all.

It generates statistics as well, so you can see which activities and moods often go together, and graphs of how your mood changes over time.

It's helped me a lot, and I really hope there's someone out there with the same issue who will be helped by this app, as well.

EDIT: just wanted to make sure the community and the mods understand that I'm not sponsored by daylio, I haven't received any money or products, I haven't been asked to recommend daylio. It's simply helped me a lot, and I want to share it with others!",19Jan2018,6
59,"So I have anxiety and depression, which I've been taking medication for for almost two years. It's been helpful, although I've not been doing very well recently.

I would like to go to therapy again, because I think that would be really helpful for me, but there's one big problem (aside from money). I moved to Mexico in September 2017 to be with my husband, but my Spanish is very limited. I have been trying to learn, but honestly, learning languages is something I am not good at. It's taking a really long time, and I often get dispirited with it when I can't understand what people are saying. I don't think there are English speaking therapists here (I live in Chihuahua City), so I'm wondering if there's any alternative to traditional cbt that I could engage in. It's hard not to feel really isolated out here and although I'm sure it will get better when I know the language, that is proving to be very difficult for me. 

Does anyone know of any online treatments or... anything that might be available? Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this.",19Jan2018,3
60,"I'll just keep this as short as possible, but will further the proverbial plot in private. (I would also like to apologize in advance for my ""dry"" style of writing, I wrote a longer, more emotional post before this but decided it was too long to be productive.)

I am about to embark on an incredibly risky and life threatening ""adventure"", and I need someone to keep me from breaking under pressure. I want you to know that my problem is quite unique and therefor probably not one of your run of the mill low self-esteem, social issues that I imagine one would encounter on this sub, so please keep that in mind if you decide to contact me.

Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.",19Jan2018,3
61,"Let me preface this by saying that I am currently seeing a therapist and we have thrown around the soft diagnosis of anxiety with obsessional tendencies or potentially OCD. I am a 24 yr old F. No family history of schizophrenia that I know of, but my maternal grandfather did die by suicide from PTSD. Maternal grandmother also has Manic Depression/SAD.

My primary issue is anxiety - at one point the anxiety was so intense that I was physically ill for an extended period of time. I could not keep anything 'solid' and lost about 30 lbs. This was because of obsessional intrusive thoughts and constant ruminating keeping me in the cycle of anxiety.

I have anxiety about a number of things - my relationship, finances, the future, dying, and currently health issues. My health issues range from thinking I have autoimmune diseases, or catastrophizing symptoms that I have, to more mental issues - ie. thinking I am developing something like schizophrenia.

That's my main issue at the moment. I am terrified and almost convinced that I am displaying signs of developing schizophrenia - or have been for a long time.

My main worries relate to some of my mental health symptoms being misidentified.

- I sometime engage in magical thinking or ideas of reference (not super clear on the distinction between the two). An example will be something like ""I've looked at the clock at 2:22 a lot lately, if I see it again it means X is going to happen"" or I'll be thinking of a song and then hear it later that day and be worried it has some sort of significance. Or fears that whatever number I stop the microwave on might be how many years I have to live or stay with my wonderful partner. These things cause me anxiety for a bit but usually dwindle off. I can't recall every instance this has happened but I can often recall ones that caused me significant anxiety. It's not necessarily that I really believe these thoughts, but they cause me a lot of stress. 

- Sometimes I will make 'predictions' and get really bothered by them. Like guessing something will happen, ""If my boyfriend comes out wearing this shirt it means he's going to break up with me soon"" and then, like in this case, he came out wearing that shirt and I remember being completely filled with anxiety - even if I knew it was irrational? Or thinking things like ""If the stoplight turns yellow before I get there it means I'm doomed in one way or another"". Like I'm making predictive bets with the universe.

- I am vaguely paranoid at times. Wondering if my friends think I'm a bad person, being anxious about having an acquaintance house-sit for us (thinking they might look thru our belongings, do something weird with my toothbrush, and even once worrying they might put a camera in my bedroom), thinking people are looking at things I'm self conscious about (my thin hair), etc. Or thinking I'll be blamed or accused of something I didn't do (but then paranoid worrying what if I _did_ do something wrong).

- I've had a lot of difficultly concentrating lately, people will talk and I'll hear them and nod but often forget afterwards exactly what was said. I remember the point but not specifics. And sometimes mid thought or sentence I'll kind of lose my train of thought momentarily. Or I'll jumble words every once in awhile, when normally I am very articulate. 

- I think I've always had trouble with intrusive thoughts. But when I was younger it was more about being scared (from horror movies). I'd have to create a kind of 'bubble' in my brain and 'line' all the walls to keep scary thoughts of Freddy Krueger or other monsters out of my mind to be able to fall asleep.

The magical thinking and ideas of reference are my main problems. I associate things a lot and am often momentarily worried it's a 'sign'. Or the mental rituals associated to my intrusive thoughts. 

I haven't had auditory or visual hallucinations of any kind - but I'm terrified I'm on the path to.

My worry is that these symptoms have all been pointing towards a descent into psychosis and misidentified as simple anxiety or OCD. Or that my inability to overcome my mental illnesses are leading me to develop it.",19Jan2018,1
63,"six years ago my brother raped me (i’m 15 male) and then killed himself and ever since then my entire life has been shit. i have depression, anxiety and autism and i’m barely a person anymore i regularly talk to one person, my girlfriend, who’s a fucking asshole. she constantly complains about everything that’s wrong with me as if there’s anything i can do about it, from my voice to memory to hair to anxiety, she makes me feel terrible for things that i’m annoyed about, and has made fun of me of being raped, being gender-confused and for telling her an embarrassing piece of personal information.

we broke up in july last year and starting talking again in august. about two weeks befoe i overdosed twice in three days from loneliness and my depression. after that, my anxiety started to get severe. since january last year, i’ve lost most of my friends and have resorted to drugs and self harm to try to stop me killing myself. 

so, my choices are: stay with someone who very quickly swerves from making myself the happiest i’ve ever been to making me cry (no matter how hard i try i cannot cry about anything except when i’m hurt badly or something happens so making me cry is a special fucking achievement) until i finally have a bad enough day and hang myself or i can break up with, lose the last of my friends and die from a cocaine overdose.

what the fuck am i supposed to do anymore?? if i tell her all this without mentioning the possibility of leaving her she’ll leave me on read and when she finally decides to talk to me again she’ll pretend it didn’t happen and if i bring it up agsin after that she’ll leave me on read again and if i do mention leaving her then she’ll leave me. no matter what happens i can’t handle it i’m so lonely and sad and anxious i’m so fucking sick of this it’s been six years for fuvks sake",19Jan2018,1
64,"I've never been so anxious in all my life. Last Wednesday I did a night shift at work till 10pm. I often find I have insomnia when I do such shifts; I slept a little maybe 4-5hours, but I was constantly waking up etc. Still I thought nothing of it and carried on with my day like normal. Come Thursday night; the same thing. 4-5hours with constant interruption. It's now the third night, at 12pm, in exhausted but still unable to sleep and my anxiety is through the roof. All day I think about whether I'll be able to sleep or not. I'm starting to feel slightly delirious now and I'm really feeling upset. Any help, advice etc would be SO SO appreciated. Is this normal? I don't want to take sleep medication or drugs, but I can't keep this up, and in to afraid to talk to my parents about it because I know they'll just say it's a 'phase'.",19Jan2018,1
