0,I get referred from one place to another and then they forget about me and I'm back at square one. Meanwhile I'm attacking friends and hearing shit and being chased by imaginary gypsies. This year has been fucking stupid and it seems like nobody wants to help me. I'm really thinking about making sure I get help by hurting someone. ,27May2018,5
2,"This is going to sound completely insane.

For quite a while now, I've been living under the belief that everyone can hear my thoughts. I can hear other people's thoughts sometimes so some level of this seems normal. However, I seem to be an exception.

I seem to 'tell' my thoughts more often to the point that it irritates other people very much. I irritate people to the point that they are sometimes very aggressive towards me in an effort to make me stop \(totally understandable\). But I can't seem to 'turn it off' at all for some reason.

I would really like to believe I'm just delusional about all of this telepathy stuff but people everywhere I go literally yell at me to stop thinking a certain way or to stop 'telling' my thoughts altogether. It's hard for me to chalk all that up to auditory hallucinations although it very well could be. Any time I ask anyone about it though, they assure me that I'm just insane and no one can hear mine or anyone else's thoughts.

A while ago I did something very unforgivable in my head. To this day, all day and all night, little babies still cry to me about ruining their lives. If this is real, you should know what I'm talking about. Some, if not all of you might know exactly who I am.

I'm afraid this event ruined my life almost irreparably and with my already compromised mental state, it's a bit much to handle. I just need to know how crazy I really am.

I understand this is probably not a yes or no question but any thoughts on the matter would be very much appreciated because I am starting to seriously consider very drastic measures in order to make this all stop.",27May2018,1
3,"I just feel super alone, like everyone around me can make tons and tons of friends and I can't. I'm a 21 year old girl who is pretty normal, except I'm on the serious side of things\- but I can have a laugh! Just. It's so annoying at work hearing about everyones weekend plans, but I have none. I have one best friend, and I love her, but I just WISH I could have more but I don't know how/no one is interested. It's really depressing.",27May2018,3
5,"Does anyone know where a person in the Seattle, WA area can check into a mental hospital for being close to suicidal \(and other things\) if they are on Medicaid \(or whatever the state/Obamacare insurance is called\)? Just showing up to an ER won't do anything other than make you wait because there are no beds, then keep you for a day, tell you you're fine, and kick you to the curb. I want to check myself into a mental hospital for very serious issues, not be held until I ""calm down."" 

Does the state insurance cover any mental hospital stays? ARE THERE any mental hospitals that I can go to? I feel like Washington state has nothing and doesn't give a shit about people like me. I'm at my wits end and am looking for serious help as MY ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT. I'm jobless and homeless in a week, and if I can't figure something out by then it's all over. I'm not suicidal at this moment, but when the timer runs out and there's no options left, it's my trump card. There's nowhere to even be homeless around here because there's too many homeless people! If I go out there homeless I'm going to immediately look for heroin as an out. I wouldn't be able to avoid it anyway! I don't want any of this to happen. Where can I go with my insurance? What can I do? Does anyone have any list of resources I can explore? 

My insurance is the Provider One/Coordinated Care/Apple Heath/whatever the hell else names they give it. I'm unemployed and have the Obamacare insurance. 

Please skip the empty platitudes and the ""don't do it, this will pass, bullshit bullshit bullshit"" nonsense. This is way past the point of ""cheer up, things aren't so bad"" nonsense \(which has never helped anyone in the history of being suicidal ever\). It's patronizing and insulting. I know you mean well and I appreciate the thought behind it, but it's meaningless. Just skip the urge this time, okay? You aren't helping anyone but your ego by giving yourself a pat on the back. Don't bother.

I don't want things to end this way, but I'm running out of time. If I can't get help to get back on track or at least develop some kind of REALISTIC plan, it's over. Nobody gives a shit about me or my situation, so I'm desperately hoping there's something out there that can help me change it.

Besides giving any resources for mental hospitals you know of, can anyone tell me exactly WHAT HAPPENS when you check into an ER in Washington state for being suicidal? It sounds like a humiliating waste of time that would only reinforce a person's desire to kill themselves.

What the hell is wrong with this state anyway? No mental health resources to speak of and a homelessness AND heroin problem that has reached epidemic levels, and nobody is connecting those dots? Seriously?",27May2018,0
6,"I know this probably sounds weird and won't make sense. I want to know if anyone else does this or knows what causes me to do this.  

For as long as I can remember, I squeeze my hands. I remember being little and my mom telling me to cut it out, so I started doing it in secret. I have never stopped.  

I squeeze for particular reasons. I'm really not sure how to explain it. For example, I play the Sims. I squeeze my hands a lot while playing because of how the characters look. I don't know how to explain it. I remember when I was young and played with dolls, I would squeeze my hands based off how the Barbies' hair looked. I had a ton of dolls and would play school and assign them to classes together based off if they looked like they belonged in the teacher's name's class (example Sarah looks like she belongs in Ms Smith's class, she doesn't look like she would be in Mr Grey's class). I would squeeze when deciding all this.  

I know it sounds crazy and weird and I have never heard of anyone else doing this. I've googled it and never found anything. My squeezing isn't up in the air. I keep my hands by my lap. I don't do this in public, so it CAN be stopped when needed, but when I'm alone I feel like I NEED to do it. If I don't have enough alone time for several days or something, I start getting irritable and try going off to the bathroom to do some squeezing.  

It is not in response to stress. It's really hard to explain. It has to do with people, mostly. The way someone's hair moves in their ponytail or the way pants move when people walk.  

I have never told a single soul about this. I really have no idea how to explain it. I seem completely normal to everyone else btw. Like imagine your best friend trying to explain this to you. I'm not a ""quirky"" or anything.  

Does anyone know what the hell I'm talking about or have any guidance for me? I'm posting this here because I imagine it's a mental health thing, but if you know of a better subreddit for me to post this in please let me know. Thanks!",27May2018,1
7,"My youngest brother has witnessed my dad beat my mom into a concussion, and he watched my dad choke his current girlfriend. I think it’s because of these events and how my parents continue to talk to him that he has been acting out.

He’s in first grade and his teacher has reported that he’s unable to pay attention, he walks around the classroom, and he will scream, push things, and throw things when he is upset. A couple weeks ago, his teacher asked him to put away his counting blocks (they’re like legos) and he refused. She asked him again to please put them away and he made a gun with them and pointed it at her, started making shooting noises like he was shooting her. Last week he was suspended for assaulting a classmate.

My mom is convinced that he’s innocent; that “he’s just a kid” and refuses to get counseling for him when multiple staff members have already told her he needs it. She’s afraid he’ll think that “something is mentally wrong with him” and he’ll grow up hating himself. I’ve tried to explain that she should at least take their suggestion and TRY, but he’s getting worse and worse. He’s hit my mom multiple times when he was angry and screams at her in public. A lot of people say he needs to be spanked more but she has been warned not to punish him with spankings as it could effect him negatively since he is already aggressive.

I do my best as an older sister to talk to him about respect for others, but he often hums or sings over me like I’m not even there. I have not been able to have a conversation with him for a long time and I don’t know how to connect with him. He doesn’t follow directions at all, and my mom has pretty much given up trying and gives in to his every demand.

She doesn’t let me help because “she is the parent and I need to bud out of it”.

I’m 20 years old and I feel useless. I go to therapy myself since I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago and I feel like my brother would benefit seeing someone. Is there anyone who can relate or anyone have suggestions as to how I can help?

TL; DR: My brother has experienced traumatic events from an abusive father. He’s showing aggressive behavior at home, in public and at school with his teachers and classmates. He’s already been suspended and my mom won’t get him counseling. I’ve tried to talk to him and my mom but there’s no progreas. As an older sister is there anything more I can do than continue to try and talk to my little brother?",27May2018,34
8,"I feel very stuck, dissatisfied, and downright afraid of how much control I feel live I’ve lost over my own life.

10,"Does anyone that’s currently or previously struggled with psychosis or schizophrenia have problems with nightmares? My nightmares seem to be directed by fucking Satan himself and they absolutely knock me for six. Having a night mare is bad, but my nightmares can get me down and negatively affect for me the next 4/5 days easily. 

One I had tonight. It’s now 4am in the uk. Played right into one of the delusions I was having in hospital and it’s really fucked me up. Really really really really fucked me up.

11,"I've struggled with depression for 7 years (started when I was 12, and I'm 19 now), and I've never sought any professional help for it. In the last 2 years, I've gone through 2 crises that came damn close to ending in suicide attempts, the latter of which occurred only this February. However, at the moment I'm doing fine. The primary cause of so many depressive spirals has been my unemployment these last 2 years, but I recently got a stable job that I enjoy doing. For the first time in a long time, I can honestly describe myself as being happy. All of the things I associate with my depression - the negative thought spirals, the crying myself to sleep, the suicidal ideations - have all been absent for weeks now. It really feels like I'm getting better.

However, I've felt similarly on-top-of-the-world before, and I know how drastically things can change, so I'm considering finally seeking professional help. I'm just not sure if now is the best time to do this. I'm on the up-and-up, and if I went into a session I don't even know what I would talk about. I just know I'm scared of ""relapsing"", as it were, and want to do what I can to prevent that.

So, can anyone offer me some advice? Is seeing a therapist worth the time and money with where I'm at? Or should I wait and see if things stagnate or degrade? If I do end up in session, how would I make the most of that? Any input is appreciated.",27May2018,1
12,"I have this introversion problem that is affecting my social life and health. When I'm in uncomfortable situations I completely shut down socially. Like if I'm in a group of people that I'm not comfortable with or if there is an extrovert controlling the conversation, I don't talk. The longer I don't talk the more extreme it gets to the point I spit out nonsense or something very short when I do talk. Also, I'm in my upper teens and a lot of people find random, kinda autistic like stuff really funny; I don't and sometimes I don't know how to react to this. Also, if I go several days without talking to friends, I get into a kind of introverted slump, so when I do meet with friends, I'm like a lifeless version of myself. And this introversion almost has a snowball effect. The worst for me is long social gatherings where I'm not comfortable, especially when an extrovert I don't really know is controlling the conversation; I hate just sitting there doing nothing. However sometimes, I can be kinda extroverted. If I do something that gives me a lot adrenaline like sports or something exhilarating, I can be more talkative aftwrwards. If I'm around people I'm really comfortable with, I definitely talk a lot more. Also, I sometimes get into exteoverted periods where I talk more in conversation and I'm just more adept socially. In these extroverted periods, I also have a much better sense of humor with other people and even by myself if I'm watching tv or something. It's like a series of good social events will put me on an extroverted period. Right now, I'm in an introverted slump where my conversations are dull, I can't think of anything funny, and I don't find stuff funny. This probably happened since it is summer and I spend a lot more time by myself. Although I enjoy alone time, I also enjoy being good socially and not being a lifeless version of myself. Any advice?

14,"Last August, I went to therapy for about a month, after I finally convinced my parents to let me go. The therapist was nice, but on the first meeting, she told me that if I told her anything I was doing was harmful to myself, she would tell my parents since i'm under 18. I wanted to tell her a lot of my mental health issues, but after that, I really felt like I couldn't tell her anything without her telling my parents. She ended up saying that I was a short term patient and that I didn't need any more sessions after our 4th meeting, and I haven't been since. I think she legally would have to tell my parents by law, but I really want to keep my parents out of this. Any advice on how to confide in my therapist without getting in trouble? ",27May2018,1
15,"I (F23) have struggled with some emotional regulation issues (anxiety? depression?) for years. Any little thing can set me off and suddenly something that is no big deal is a huge problem and I can’t stop thinking about it or let it go. I recently started taking SAMe, skipping my periods via birth control, and tracking my mood each day for the last few months. 

I finally thought I’d found the right combination of things- I’d been melt-down-free for like 3 weeks.  But tonight I just lost it over nothing. My partner didn’t really do anything wrong, just rubbed me the wrong way after a long day, and suddenly I found myself yelling at him absolutely furious for not doing . Even as I was doing it, I hated my own guts for blowing to shreds three weeks of finally feeling normal and being proud of who I am. 
 
I’m just so disappointed in myself for acting like that. I hate that this is who I am, even if it’s occasionally. I just want to be someone I don’t hate.  My partner is so patient but I feel like he deserves so much better than someone who can’t keep a handle on their emotions and blows up randomly. I just don’t know how to be better. ",27May2018,3

20,"Ok Ok so before I discus the situation you need to know the back story so at school I’m in a friend group and it’s an average friend group but one of my closest friends (let’s call him Tony) so Tony has been changing in our group recently he’s been getting upset at everyone and getting into random arguments like he’s on his period. Another friend I have (let’s name him George) so George is the shortest and skinniest person in our group and last week Tony was upset in an argument over community service hours over the summer and George said something like “I do more stuff volunteering than you do” and it triggered Tony and he picked him up and threw him on the floor and kicked his neck at school while we were all walking to the stadium for track. I personally didn’t see him do it but I was walking ahead until one of my friends told me what happened, I was really upset after at Tony because he attacked George only because he knew he could beat him and I told him how stupid he was and he just said he didn’t want to talk to me or he will get more angry. Another one of my friends named lance went to comfort him like he usually does and told him what he wanted to hear and literally ten minutes after he was happy and playing football. That really pissed me off because he didn’t care about what he did to George he was super bloody after and his neck was all scratched up, I was mad at Tony. A couple days later we just didn’t talk about it and Tony apologized and said to George “ don’t make fun of me again when you said that I felt like a failure “ well that is hypocritical because he always makes fun of George for being short and skinny and he can make fun of him but others can’t. Also Tony wants to always be better than everyone like when he talks to me he wants to know everything I’m doing so he can do it better than me and he Dosent want anyone to succeed like when I took academic decathlon he said is useless for colleges  and it’s a waste of time but I wanted to do it and he got pissed for a month. Well ok so today me, Tony, my friend sam, and lance  went to the pool and played at the tennis court nearby and Sam lost a vibration dampener to my tennis racket and we spent 1 hour looking for it sam and I were upset that we lost it and Tony and lance apparently found the dampener before we did and hid it so we would look for it and be upset. Someone at the tennis courts told us he had it and I was mad, we went up to him and told him I know you have it and give it back ( I said calmly) Tony said “why do you have to be so rude about it” i said well you took it from us. He knew he was wrong so he tried to justify himself like he usually does and then he said “maybe I have it then or maybe I don’t” that really pissed me off so I went to sam and asked him if he wanted to leave and he said yes (mainly because of this and that Tony made a lot of Jew jokes to
Him that were really offensive) so I left and said “fine don’t give it to me I’m leaving” so I went out to the pool and lance came up to me and gave the dampener back and max said “why do you have to be such a idiot you are acting stupid” I told him “just think about what you did” and he said “pppft I did nothing wrong” and sam and I left. I told max to not talk to me ever again and texted George and told sam to move spots so we don’t have to talk to him a school again. Where should I go from here? I’ve known Tony for 6 years and this recently year he’s been acting differently and it sucks he used to be my closest friend. ",27May2018,1
21,"(I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, or if I should, so I'm sorry if not)

I first tried counselling just over four years ago. I'd been told to look into it for years but always refused, and it took a slew of panic attacks to get me to change my mind. The first they could get me an initial appointment was several weeks after.

The day of the appointment hit and I really worried. That week had actually been a really good one. The best I'd had in months. I went feeling like I was wasting the time of the counselling service. Apparently not. I did the questionnaire they gave me, talked a bit, and the woman looked horrified. I got assigned to a counsellor a few days later, when I'd been told the waiting list was weeks.

It didn't really help. I'm not really much for talking about my problems and when I did my counsellor was a bit lost, suggested meditation a lot, medication a few times. We ended my sessions after about a month and a half. What did help was finally talking to friends and realising I wasn't alone.

Through that I found a job which I love (and I'm still there), and that helped more. It turned out that given immediate things I had to be doing, and having to be up in front of people constantly just stopped me thinking about anything else. Work became a crutch. Sometimes it didn't work, I've had my times at work of completely breaking down in tears and/or panic out of nowhere. And I dreaded holidays - my first Christmas after I started there and realising I couldn't go to work for two weeks was painful.

Things did seem to get better as time went on. I did go back for more counselling a year later after a particular incident and that didn't help at all, but on the whole things seemed to slowly get slightly easier.

Only I got incredibly drunk last week and after a very long talk with a friend I realised it didn't.

I don't feel the way I did four years ago, I don't have months on end twice a year where I spend most of it crying and shaking and scratching until it bleeds. I don't feel anything most days. I learnt to treasure happiness a long time ago, but now sometimes I envy people who can feel sad.

It didn't really worry me. Most of the time it's really useful, but sometimes it isn't*.

I drink occasionally, I do bar work and I really like to see what other places are doing with cocktails. Usually it isn't a problem, but sometimes (once every few months?) it is. Whenever I have periods where I do start to question the healthiness of not really feeling much at all and then I drink... everything goes badly. I know my limits, but I'll smash straight through them. Because when I'm really drunk at least I'll feel something while inevitably making a tonne of questionable life decisions and probably irreparably damaging my relationships.

It happened last week and for the first time something's stuck for more than the morning after. A mountain of guilt. I'm desperate to not continue doing this, but I don't want to lose feeling. I don't get how to do both.

23,"Ever since spring break, I have been very paranoid. Especially at night. I constantly feel like I am in danger and am constantly scanning my surroundings in case there is someone/thing there. There is no reason for it, I just am. I don't know what information I need to provide to help figure out what is wrong with me so I will just say everything.

I always feel like I am being watched. Some people really make me uncomfortable and my mind starts playing out scenarios where they try to hurt me. Typically it is rape, mugging, trying to sell me drugs, or just straight up assault. I am always anxious to leave my room cause I feel there could be someone out there. I always get extreme anxiety whenever I open a door that I cannot see through cause there could be someone there waiting to attack me. Whenever I do leave my room I am always scanning my house just in case and checking outside. I have bad eyesight so many things that I cannot make out are immediately taken as threatening. For example, I left my house to walk down to a Wendy's and thought a rock was a curled up Coyote at first. I have trouble sleeping most nights cause I feel there is someone lurking in my room or is going to enter my room.

I cannot think of any reason for me to be like this. I have had a very cushy life. No one has ever really hurt me to make me distrust anyone and my house has never been broken into.

27,"(I’m sorry if this needs a flair, I’m on mobile, maybe it would be classed as help?)

Lately when I’m trying to fall asleep or when I just wake up I’ve been having sort of racing thoughts. I’m not sure how to explain them really, they’re sort of lots of thoughts happening at one time and just getting jumbled together. 

I’ve tried counting and regulating my breathing to try and get them under control (like I do with anxious or paranoid thoughts) but this doesn’t work, they’re almost like a background noise. 

It’s started also being like I can differentiate different voices in these thoughts, this morning this was very prevalent. Some of the thoughts were anxious about the day ahead (I called in sick to work and was worried about making the call) but there was one stream of thought that was almost manic. But a caricature of mania almost, she (???) was very high pitched, babbling, shrieking, and I can’t explain what she was doing there. It was almost like having a child running round in my brain, and while I was trying to sort of quiet her (not focus on that thought) she was still in the background so to speak. 

I’m sorry if this is explained really badly, I’ve never had anything like this before and I’m having a hard time with it. I’m not the most eloquent person at the best of times, let alone when I don’t understand something.

In school I was considered a good student but I think it stems from me being calm and well behaved. I performed average academically speaking, I excelled in subjects where you didn’t have to grasp logical concepts. All you had to do was to memorize information. The hardest subject for me was math. I always struggled with understanding mathematical l concepts that required some free thinking of your own. I never saw patterns of any kind and was always lost. 

I also hated the engineering/physics course we had in high school where you had to build your own project. Implementing something from theory to practics is such a hard thing for me. 

Also yesterday I had to unfold a baby stroller and I had NO IDEA how to do that. I was embarrassed.

37,"Hey guys. I was wondering if anyone had any advice or tips for me. I have moderate to severe depression and am finally working with a therapist and doctor. One thing I’ve begun to try and work on is behavioral changes. My therapist wants me to pick one thing and do it every day to establish a routine of it. They believe it will help me to do something I’d usually enjoy and warned I may not enjoy it right in the moment because of how depressed I am...
It all makes perfect sense intellectually...
But I’m finding myself just lying in bed only a few days  into this, unable to comply with my plans.

I choose to walk my dog every morning as my daily routine...but maybe I aimed to high for myself...

Has anyone else done anything like this before?
If so what did you choose as a thing to start doing every day?

38,"I finally found a medication that has helped turn my life around. I have never been so productive, happy, keeping to a regular sleep schedule, etc. and it’s thanks to 40mg of Cymbalta. 
  
Unfortunately, I have been having increasing difficulties with early waking insomnia. Most nights I only get 5 hours of sleep, even adding 75-100mg of trazodone at night and taking cymbalta in the morning. I also have fibromyalgia and I can’t get by on this little sleep. My physical health has been on the decline for weeks, and my mental health is starting to follow. This has happened with the last few meds I’ve tried, except mirtazapine, which made me gain so much weight and lost efficacy quickly.  
  
Has anyone else had this problem for so long on cymbalta (I feel like side effects should have stopped by 6 weeks), and if so, did anything help you stay asleep for 8 hours? I’m desperate to continue this medication but I can’t go on like this much longer.",27May2018,3

40,"I’ve been doing really well the past year, I feel stable and happy, and even when I don’t I can usually get out of it. Due to some troubles recently with insurance and moving, I’m struggling to find a doctor and it’s been pretty stressful. This is fine, I’m managing, but I can’t help but hate needing medication. If I didn’t have to take medication I wouldn’t be having this problem. I could think about traveling and living abroad without worrying about where I’d get a doctor, how much meds I’d need to take with, not worry about running out and fucking up my mental health, if the plane would even let me take months worth. I move a lot, and it sucks because every time my family stresses out about finding a doctor and so do I. I’ve had to pay hundreds of dollars because my new insurance isn’t accepted by my previous doctor so even though I had the prescriptions it wasn’t covered by my new insurance, but I can’t go off my meds.

I know I need to take my medication. The times I’ve gone off of it haven’t gone well and I don’t want to be in a dark place again, I just hate that I need it. I hate how other people are fine taking absolutely nothing and I have to take 3 to function, and even then I have to pair that with using DBT skills when I get into a funk.

41,"I don’t exactly know what to write here, and I’m not sure why I’m so nervous putting all of it out there, but here goes. 

I want to start off by saying I’m not looking for a “diagnosis” from the internet. I just need to be led in the right direction as to how to get the help I may need. 

I’m in my early twenties and have struggled with anxiety and depression since early childhood. As a child, all the “red flags” were there that I needed help, yet my mother refused to get me any. At 18 I finally went on my own to my family doctor and was given antidepressants and anxiety medication, which I stopped taking by the time I was 19. Every once in a while I’ll hit a bad low and realize I really do need the meds, and I’ll start taking them again. Once they start working, I stop. While I know that these medications can not be taken this way, I still continue doing so. I’m not sure why. 

A little information: my mother suffers with depression and anxiety (and probably more undiagnosed issues) herself, while her father dealt with depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder until he ended his life as a result of his mental illness in my late teen years. My father and his father also suffer with depression and addiction. I only feel the need to add this because I feel sure genetics play a role in mental illness. 

I have resented my mother for many years, and I feel certain it is due to the fact that I so desperately cried out for help for the majority of my childhood and was never heard. From telling her at age six that I hated myself, to beating my head against walls and pulling my hair out, to going weeks eating just enough to keep my body functioning, all the signs were there, and she chose to ignore them, even with people on the outside suggesting to her that I may need counseling, therapy, etc. She would always try to pray it away, telling me to “set my mind on  things above and not on things of the world”. Even after my elementary school contacting her about a poem they found in my journal and were concerned about, finding suicidal ideation in my personal journal at home and pulling me out of school because she thought it was a result of hanging around the wrong crowd (in elementary school 🙄), and my preacher telling her I may need grief counseling after losing my grandparents (who I consider my parental figures) at age 13, she ignored it all. 

Even while I resent my mother, we are for the most part on decent terms, seeing each other a few times a month as I have been out of her home since I was 18. 

Most of my friends are “older” but not old, if you know what I mean. 30+. However, my very best friend is quite a bit older than I am, and is very motherly towards me. My relationship with her is what has made me worry that I may be “crazier” than I knew. My best friend is good to me. She makes sure I have food when I’m too broke to eat, always watches out for me, gives me a place to stay if something ever happens and I need it. She’s also the person I’ll call up if I want to go do something or need a shoulder to cry on. So while she is motherly, she is also very much my best friend. She’s the most laid back, easy to get along with person I know. And here’s the thing, I get so irrationally pissed off at her sometimes. Over NOTHING. 

A few examples: 
•she left the state for a week for a work trip. You would think she had just told me she was leaving and never coming back. I got very upset. 
• she’s kind of an introvert and requires a day or two of alone time here or there to “recharge”. When this happens, my brain goes into overdrive and doesn’t understand that she needs time to herself, even though I’m the same way. What my brain understands is “she’s tired of you. She doesn’t want you. You need to leave right now and never look back” 
• she has a friend who I’m convinced doesn’t like me (she swears it’s not true, and it may not be. That may just be my messed up brain telling me shit again). When she tells me she’s going to be with this certain friend, I get pissed off about that. Because in my mind, if her friend hates me, she’ll talk her into hating me as well. 

So here’s something I struggle with. There’s like two sides of my mind. The rational side where I KNOW the things I’m thinking and feeling are completely ridiculous and not true at all, and then there’s the irrational side. The irrational side is the side that makes me say hateful things to my friend (because as much as I hate it, my brain also works things out like “well so and so hurt you, so you need to hurt them back”). The irrational side is convinced that everyone I love is going to leave me. The irrational side is convinced that everything has ulterior motive. And it ALWAYS takes over. It doesn’t matter how much the rational side knows that I’m being crazy, the irrational side always wins. I don’t know how to explain it. And these things don’t happen with all of my friendships, just my very close ones. 

Another thing is anger (which honestly has gotten a bit better over the last few months, but it never really goes away forever). When I get upset like that, I get irrationally angry. At everyone and everything. Sometimes it doesn’t even have to be set off. Sometimes I’m just so angry with myself, with God, or with whatever it may be, that I can literally FEEL it in my chest. You know how when someone dies and it hurts so bad it literally aches in your heart? It’s almost like that, only with anger instead of sadness and longing. I get angry with myself for being the way I am. I get angry with God for taking my grandparents, and I get angry with my other grandfather for ending his life the way he did. It’s just like these things fester up and I’m literally about to explode. I’m much better about handling it now. I don’t beat my head against walls or pull my hair out anymore. I just drive. When I’m angry, upset, or sad, I tend to go for a drive. Until it reaches the point where thoughts like “what if I just didn’t take this curve and just drove into that tree” start crossing my mind. Then I go home, and I go to bed. Because while it isn’t rare for me to have these thoughts, I have never tried (or intend) to act on them. 

My problem is, I’m scared. I’m scared of seeking help. I’m scared of being told I’m not messed up in the head, I’m just a shitty person. (The rational side of me would do anything for anyone and would NEVER want to hurt the ones I love. That’s why I hate myself so much when I get upset/angry/etc.).  And I’m at a loss, because I don’t know where I would even begin to get a diagnosis and treatment if I AM all messed up in my mind. Surely you don’t just walk up in a psychiatrists office and ask to be seen. I feel like that’s definitely not how that works.  I don’t know, guys. I’m not even sure what my purpose was in posting this. I just don’t talk to anyone about it because I’m afraid of being seen as “crazy” or a terrible person. I thought maybe someone here would have some words of support or advice. Sorry this is terribly long. ",27May2018,1
42,"   Ok, so this is going to be long and it will be tiresome to write for me, but I feel like I’ll be in a better mood if I vent. I feel as if I’ve hit rock bottom, and I’m still sinking through the rock.  
   A little background; I’m a 15 year old guy, and I have a deep and almost obsessive passion of physics and mathematics. I really want to become a researcher in those fields. I live in a rural area with a few elementary schools and one high school, where I go to school. I love music, and I mainly listen to classic rock, jazz, and classical.
   I was diagnosed with depression by my doctor when I was maybe 11, and it has been a prominent part of my life since then. I say this just to clarify that none of this is a result of teenage angst.
   My troubles started at the beginning of last school year. A conflict happened. You see, because of my interest in physics and math, I found courses at my school dull and easy, so I took it upon myself to learn the subjects at a higher and more rigorous level through textbooks. I started with algebra 2, then moved on to precalculus, then to calculus, where I am now (I’m about to start linear algebra before I move on to multi variable calculus). This lead to me finding classes MUCH easier. I found school a waste of time. This stressed me out quite a bit! I couldn’t sit easy knowing that I could be out of school further pursuing my passions and being a citizen of the world rather than sitting in school pretending to be at a geometry level. This dislike of school led to me doing my homework too carelessly, thus led to my grades dropping a little. They aren’t terrible, they are still rather good, but they still dropped. 
   I didn’t have time to pursue my passions anymore, with school, homework (busywork) and home responsibilities being in the way. I didn’t have time to enjoy the world’s beauty. I felt like a bird trapped in a small cage. I started resorting to sitting on my phone for hours as an escape, leading to even more time wasted. All of this led to my depression getting bad. Not only was I getting sad, but angry. I became more irritable, and I would lash out at my loved ones. I would sometimes shut myself in my closet, and I would have a panic attack. My abilities on the instruments I played started to slip, and whenever I tried to practice, I got angry about mistakes and put the instrument away. I know, this is all so silly, but it is true, and I can’t think of any better way to explain it.
   Then I learned that my mom had cancer. I was devastated beyond belief. I started not caring about schoolwork at all, leading to many missing assignments. I started wasting even more time on the internet as an escape. Even though my mom’s cancer is in stage II, an early stage, and even though she is doing remarkably well on chemotherapy, I am still on a decline.
   This leads me to now. Even when school is over for the summer, I am not motivated to do anything, and when I try to do anything, I get angry, and isolate myself from everybody. I have been incredibly harsh on myself, and I haven’t been reading at all. 
  So, all in all, there is a big world out there that I can explore and figure out, but I can’t do those things yet because of school. My school’s message is “pursue your passions!” But ironically everyone is telling me to wait. I know it is selfish for me to say this, as everyone has to go through school, but life is short and precious, and I feel like my time is being wasted. I dont know.
   What can I do to make myself better? Sorry for all of the selfishness in this post. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense, because honestly, my mental state doesn’t make sense to me either.

43,"Apologies in advance for the long read, but hear me out.

My mother is a very special case. We (my family) are sure she has a personality disorder, we just can't figure out what. BPD fits her the most, but we aren't sure if it's the best description.

Before I begin, I'd like to say there is no sexual or physical abuse in this case. No substance abuse on anyone's side either.

My mother is a very anxious, emotionally aggressive person. She lives in her own reality, where she denies the reality presented to her in favour of the one that suits her. This manifests most strongly if anyone ever contradicts her, or tells her she's wrong. It is amazing to watch how she reacts to being told she's wrong. She simply refuses to accept it - first she will throw it back in the person's face and tell THEM they're wrong. Then she'll try to change the subject aggressively to something else. If put on the spot, she'll simply stop listening and deny everything. She is willing to destroy her entire family, separate from my dad, sell my childhood home, and tell me to live with him over one argument.

The way she argues is not normal. One minute she loves me and she's extremely close to me, in her head at least. The moment I contradict her it's all over, she tells me she can't live with me anymore, she stops loving me, she screams about being disrespected and victimized, and again, over one argument, threatens to tear our whole family apart, calling us all crazy.

She's a chronically inflexible person who is incapable of putting herself in other peoples' shoes. She can't comprehend someone being different from her, or someone wanting something other than what she wants. When she buys me clothes without my permission (I am 24f), she buys clothes for herself and gives them to me. She has no concept, and never has, of my tastes or what I like, even after all these years.

She is also extremely controlling. She has to micromanage everything. If ever me or my brother do something that goes outside of her 'plan' for us, she wears us down with yelling and fights until we either give up or manage (rarely) to fight her into exhaustion, which only buys us a little more time before the next fight. For example, I had a boyfriend she didn't like, and she spent our entire relationship trying to tear us apart, to the point where he wasn't allowed in the house and every single conversation I had with her turned into a fight about him, because she brought it up. She's done the same with sports I've taken up in the past, jobs I've taken, even volunteering at an old folks home.

Our home is joyless and rigid because of her. When my brother and I used to play together (appropriately, during our free time), she would separate us and keep us from being together. I can't talk with her freely about anything because anything I tell her, she tries to use to control me in some way.

She never apologizes, and whenever she gets angry she dumps all her emotions on her target without a thought for how that person might feel. Then she forgets about it as if it's never happened. She is also emotionally abusive towards me, constantly picking at me and putting me down and criticizing me. I've watched my friend's mothers talk to their daughters, and no one acts the way my mom does. I am aware she's not normal, and so is everyone who knows her.

She often has problems with people. She works as a therapist (!!) and had students working with her at one point - her students couldn't stand her and she was taken off of supervising, a big drama that lasted months. She's had similar problems with her friends, her husband (my dad), her sisters, and anyone who gets close to her. Everyone who really knows her holds her at arm's length, because they don't want to deal with her.

The most dangerous thing about her is the way she denies reality, never admits that she's wrong, and is willing to aggressively dump on anyone to wear them down to get her way. The only way to live with her is to let her have her way all the time and never contradict her. And even then, whatever she's feeling, everyone must be feeling. If she feels tired, the whole house has to shut down. She has incredibly intense emotions, and she never knows when to stop. She also has some really bizarre ideas that she forces on other people because other people can't have a different idea from her. She shows signs of being very paranoid too.

I'm desperate for an answer and I really need help. Can someone tell me what personality disorder she has, and if she's BPD? I will provide more information if asked, I wrote down everything I felt was relevant.

Thank you for reading.

TLDR; My mom is crazy, intense, inflexible, never admits she's wrong, denies reality, and is extremely anxious and controlling. Other people find it difficult to have a stable relationship with her without a lot of distance. What does she have? BPD? Something else?",27May2018,2

She was the one person I could open up to so now I feel particularly alone and with so much to deal with I just don’t know where or who to turn to, I’m scared about talking too much to my family or other friends even though I know they’ll probably be supportive. 

I’ve tried therapy a few times, I’m in the UK, i don’t thibk it’s ever  been intense enough and has never really dealt with the root of my problems, maybe cause it takes me so long to open up about certain things that by I do, it’s too late.

Lately I’ve started getting more overwhelmed by things and have recently started self harming a bit by scratching myself and punching things and that’s a bit scary, it’s all very scary, I’ve cried every day for the last month, I’ve never been this upset.

53,"as much as he hurt me I had to make the choice to leave after it was affecting myself and my child. I tried to get him to get help (we split for 6 months a year and half ago, because of his moods - I thought he had changed but he hasn't)
He has spent the last week locked up in his house with his phone off, I have been getting his friend to check up on him. 

I will give some scenarios: I would love some input. He is 40 years old. Lives with 3 other roommates (because after we had our 6 month break I asked him to leave to try not living with each other to see if it helped) we did have plans to try move back together in a bigger place in the future at some point. 

we had organized to make a roast sunday dinner. we spent an hour preparing. I estimated it would take an hour and half to cook. His oven was playing up a little and half way through I realized it was going to take an extra hour to cook. To me was not a big deal, we were watching a movie anyway. But he just melted down. Would get up to check the oven every ten minutes and then get upset at me if I did it because it was letting out the hot air. Each time he would check he would get more visibly upset. By the time the food was ready he was sulking in a corner, ranting, refusing to eat. was repeating how annoying the whole situation was and it ruined the whole day and he was tired and just wants us to leave and he wants to sleep. I left out the plate for him on the table, at some point he came over and ate a few bites and then threw down his fork and said he couldn't do it because he hates that it took too long as he was just too angry. I just got up and left. He apologized the next day as he normally does and tried to laugh it off as being tired

another situation: we had planned to watch a fav movie of mine, it turned out he doesn't like musicals. it was a musical. he ranted and complained the whole time. half way through got up and sat in his room sulking. got dressed 3 times. paced up and down while we were watching it and each time a song came up he would yell at the screen how much he hated it. by the end of the movie he was in his room with headphones on and didn't talk to us until the next morning

there are hundreds more, I have blocked most of them out. I have some of them written down and I go - oh my gosh - when I read them because weirdly I have locked them out of my mind and then I remember them. I think it became my coping mechanism after 4 years. 

some days I will go see him and he just won't be talking. he would then ask me to leave and tell me he needs to be alone. or he would just not say anything I would sit there for an hour or two before he even talks. He can go from being really nice and ten minutes later very rude to you and short, just saying things like ""I don't know!!!"" ""I can't think right now leave me alone"" he would also cancel plans last minutes with our friend so I would often have to go out alone to meet our couple friends for dinners or birthdays.
he would say ""I know I have something wrong with me, my moods aren't normal, i'm going to get help"" but never would.  

i feel like he has three sides to him: 1. nice happy loving (which is what i fell in love with) 2. ranting, rude, hates the world, complains, not filter, similar to a brat child 3. depressed, sad, similar to a upset toddler, short, won't talk, wants to be left alone

i never knew which side I was getting. i mean my 11 year old child asked me to make a star chart on him and said I should reconsider the relationship when I got to 5. he would reason with my ex sometimes on how childish he was acting. and 11 year old reasoning with a 40 year old! they would often fight like brothers too, like who ate all the peanut butter, etc and I would have to separate them like siblings. 

he also would get into one of the last 2 moods, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes days. and when he gets out of them he thinks everyone has just paused and forgets he was acting like he did and because he is happy again he thinks everyone else is. I explained his actions have consequences but he gets it to a degree (will apologize and try make a light humor on it all) but then just carries on as normal.

he also had been caught a few times for talking to other girls behind my back on social media including organizing to meet up with one though he just never showed up to their meeting. I actually used this as an escape to leave him because I thought if I focused too much on his mental state he might try some self harm. so I split the two reasons. 

I noticed his doesn't understand consequences though. he had a very over loving mother growing up who was a single mom and his brother and him were his world. they could do no wrong. she even brought him a picnic to jail when he was 16 after being caught breaking and entering into a public swimming pool after hours. 

he has told me he finds it hard to be in a relationship because he just wants the good parts and doens't want to put any of the work in. he is terrible at communication and when we argue it has been compared to talking to a wall. he has improved a bit over the years where he will talk after an hour or two. but it is limited. sometimes I feel like his brain is going to pop from holding so much in.  

i started viewing him as my child, because of the way he acted. this is why i felt so bad leaving him (i left him on a floor crying in a ball) because it was like abandoning my child. I just wanted him to get help and it was like i had to leave for him to do it. it ripped my heart out. ",27May2018,0

There are so many people in my life that simply cannot grasp how difficult it is to have a mental illness, especially Bipolar 1, and continue to function in every day life.

56,"I'm new to this, so if i've posted to the wrong thread please point me in the right direction, thank you. 
I lived in an emotionally traumatic household my entire childhood (around 17 years), leaving me with severe depression and anxiety. To keep it short, I had an alcoholic father, a mother who was gone on business most weeks and wouldn't believe me or take action when i told her my father was mistreating me, and a brother who would lie to school counselors to defend my father when I spoke out about it. I struggled all throughout elementary, middle, and high school, having no motivation to do well and had difficulty staying focused. 
The emotional abuse I went through left me very socially awkward and incredibly sensitive. I found ways of coping through social media sites and video games, and made very little friends at school, and am now left with none outside of the internet since moving states. I had no reason to leave the house because I had no friends who would invite me to go out with them, so I never did. 
I am now 20, living with my parents and have had no job experience whatsoever. I've applied to jobs but no one has ever hired me. The one time I was, the job was far too much pressure than I had thought it would be, and I embarrassingly bailed without a word. Most jobs i look into seem like too much pressure, Like i wouldn't be able to do any of them, no matter how simple they may be. 
I am prescribed zoloft (50mg) by my doctor, and it helps with the anxiety (without it I have daily panic attacks at seemingly random) but I still suffer from depressive episodes. Mainly having very little interest in things or being motivated. Most days I'd rather stay in my room rotting away rather than make a life for myself. It's rare that I leave the house more than once a week.
I do want to move out, have a job and make friends, just something relatively normal rather than what I do now, but i feel hopeless, and most of the time i give up on that thought and just accept that I'll be the loser living in his parents basement his whole life. Is there any suggestions to kick start my hopelessness and gain control of my life and work towards being an adult? Do I need to up my prescription, or possibly try something new? I'm very against the idea of therapy but if enough people think I need it I will give it a try. I'm open to just about any suggestion, as I would very much like the help. Thank you.",27May2018,1
57,"My mental health has never been great, between growing up suppressing my sexuality and being bullied since I was small, I developed an eating disorder at 11 because of a need for control but dispite all this I still tried to stay positive and see the good in people, however recently when I look at my friends the only thing I can think is ""bitch can't just have one guy I guess"" or ""I wonder who he's going to try and harass today"" these thoughts just keep coming in to my head and I hate it because even though the people I talk to are flawed I'm no better.

58,"
I used to think that I was the most forgiving and accepting person in the world. If someone hurt me, I almost never got angry and I always forgave them the second they apologized. 

If someone had an eating disorder, disability, addiction, or anything 'weird and different,' I would accept and support them.

I was fucking NICE. The nicest and most apologetic person I'd ever met really. 

Then, I thought that someone I'd known my whole life, ruined my life.

For years, I took revenge. I bullied her for being a lesbian, for being overweight, for being annoying and stupid and worthless. I have been mad at her for years over hurting me and ruining my relationships. I would go as far as saying that I wanted to kill the bitch.

That bitch was me. And I'm not a bitch. I'm a human being who made a few mistakes.

And I am so sorry. I hurt myself, deprived myself of food and sleep, and berate myself for every little thing. I was downright abusive.

If anyone else did these things to me, I would forgive them. It would take time, and an apology, and therapy, and they would need to want to change, but I would forgive them. I would accept that they had flaws. I would believe that they were capable of changing for the better.

So, I think I finally forgive myself. I mean, I'm still mad, but, after ten years... its about time to let go",27May2018,2

From my ultrasound to the confirmation ultrasound  they made me wait 2 weeks, and then another 3 days  to have a d&amp;c. I think that would mess anybody up.

When we fight she gets very emotional and sometimes the smallest things, like a discussion if we should order burgers or pizza for lunch, is enough to make her feel very bad, to a point where she wont speak for the rest of the day.

65,"I should have done this ages ago to be honest, perhaps it would have dodge the issue I'm currently struggling with.





Here's the break down: I was text my wife since she works several hours out of town. She dropped and then detonated perhaps one of the biggest bombs we've ever had in our relationship thus far.
-- She's stressed out and unhappy. She had been since January.
-- She closed off emotionally back in February.
-- She feels neglected and ugly because I haven't been sexually active with her (my medication kills it for me.)
-- She admitted to nearly cheating on me last month, because the attention and the flirting was nice. But she didn't because she couldn't hurt me like that.
--- Due to that, I am scared that she is talking to other women now. (I called her at 1am while she was working and she was receiving texts.)
-- She has been asking me for month after month after month to get help, she offered to go with me and pay for a session. I was scared and I kept saying no. I kept declining and putting it to the bottom of my issues.
-- We had a trip for the West Coast Trail planned for the 6th of June, leaving on the 5th. She refuses to go because she doesn't feel safe nor comfortable with our group (which has now fallen apart.)
-- She gets stressed out whenever she has to come home, and feels like a maid, and a stranger.
--- she also said that she regrets buying the house, and that things have gone to shit since we bought it almost two years ago.
-- She wouldn't open up to me and was pretending things were okay this whole time, hoping things would get better. Instead my mental health got worse.
-- I am now getting help, but she keeps saying she's not sure it's going to help. But she has agreed to several couples sessions with me, so we can finally hash things out and get a better understanding of what is going on. (It sounds like she has given up, but I don't think she has.)
-- She said she doesn't love me (romantically), but rather loves me in a sense of caring for me. (so again, I believe she hasn't given up, and is just clouded with angry and emotion.)






I am scared. I am hurt. I am suffering. She is hurt and angry and numb. She says she isn't sure she can come back over the line that she has crossed and to let go - but I'm looking at the fact that she still hasn't ended it, and she's taking motions to work on things with me. I love her with everything that I am, and I wish she were able to open up to me much sooner, but she was scared because I was so emotional and cried so easily. I have since, in the last few days, been cleaning the house - really cleaning it. Washing the curtains to get the cat hair off. Stripping the covers off the couch, sweeping and washing and sweeping again. Decluttering unnecessary things, selling other things I really don't need, and trying to spend as much time with the animals as I can while I look within myself at what is going on. (and crying.) I'm even going to make a cleaning chart so I can always have something to reference back to on what needs to be done. I want her to know that I am here for her and that I am putting in the work NOW, rather than never, to be who she fell in love with. To show that I am still here, that she can still love me and we can still have a future.





I guess I needed to vent more than anything. I'm sorry. I'm just scared and needed to gather my thoughts. I probably will continue to do so as I think of more things.





Feel free to drop thoughts, or whatever. OR! Ideas on coping and redirecting scared and negative thoughts!
I have a self counseling session on Tuesday, and if my therapist can swing it, she's going to see if she can fit a couple's session in on Wednesday (which my wife last minute told me she would make a detour trip to do with me, even if she just feels like yelling at me.)

So that's good, I think it is. She agreed to couple's counseling and several sessions at that.

69,"Everyone I care about, I associate with the darkest times of my life. Some have played a major role in that darkness. Everywhere I turn to look, thinking, maybe I can find support here, but I realise that I can't. Because I have too many things to deal with in my own mind before I could ever allow myself to be vulnerable enough to do that.

I know it isn't good to seek comfort in other people. But I've isolated myself more than I ever have this year, and I feel utterly alone. I feel like I am losing my mind and all my relationships from having dealt with what I'm going through in silence for so long. It's like my mind has zoomed way too far into itself, like a fucked up fractal, and I can't find the way out. The slow twist it's been doing for the past decade has become a violent writhing. I have a lump in my throat all the time and the thought of suicide has once again become a permanent fixture in my mind.

70,"I don't know how to start this, it'll be a long one, I know that. I apologize if it's rambling, but I wanted to vent.

I am a 23 year old mail who is about to start college in a few months. 

I have always had moody swings and growing up, I was an angry, sullen child. As my life progressed, the mood swings would range from intense, fiery anger to deep dark depression. I have attempted suicide twice, in the last 2 years.

The first attempt was following a break up with a woman whom I had been with for over a year and a half. We broke up, the circumstances not relevant, and I felt consumed by this black, dark emptiness that seemed to hollow me out and just strip away at my insides. I felt like I was alone and no body loved me, so I tried to kill myself because I thought that no one would ever care if I was gone. I chambered a round into the pistol that I carried on my job and sat down in silence, trying to will myself to put it to my head and pull the trigger. I hesitated and a coworker interrupted me with a question about something. I put the weapon away and went about my day.

The second attempt, was a half\-hearted attempt at driving in front of a train. I was driving along the tracks and made a right turn just as the crossing boom was coming down. I hadn't timed it right and the train was still a few hundred feet away and I missed my chance. I kept on driving, thinking that ""I guess I'll live today.""

I feel like I must cling to people to survive. I hate being abandoned and the thought of someone close to me, whether it is a romantic partner or a friend leaving me evokes deep suffering inside me. I'll often be doting and smothering because in my mind, it relieves the anxiety that any change in their behavior means they're tired of me and will leave me.

I will get obsessive as well. When I meet someone that seems to fall for me and take an interest in me, I will latch on to. I dated two people, each for a month before breaking up. The first ex, ghosted me because I feel like he was afraid of serious relationships \(or of me\) and I became completely obsessed. I blew up his phone with texts and phone calls, messaged his friend on Facebook Messenger and even showed up at his house once, asking if he were there. He blocked me on all social media and that became that. I did have thoughts of breaking into his home and watching him sleep at night, or even worse, walking into his work place and shooting him in a ""If I can't have you..."" fashion. 

The second ex wasn't nearly as dramatic, but I was still obsessed. 

I just feel overwhelmed by this emptiness that has plagued me all my life. It was only recently that I had any solid feeling of what I would want to do with my life, before just free\-falling in a kind of way.  When I feel empty and lonely, I will usually slide into dark feelings and the other day while driving to work, I was gripped by an urge to accelerate into a concrete barrier at 90 miles per house \(I was already going ten or twenty over the limit\) to end my suffering.

I will get these violent, disturbing dreams from time to time about anything from graphically murdering someone, to dismembering them and in one case, raping them. The most graphic of them all, involved me decapitating two burglars with one of them being still alive.

  I was diagnosed with ""Depression NOS"" when I was a teenager. I looked for psychiatric help following the first suicide attempt, and was given a prescription for Prozac and told that I had a ""chemical imbalance"". I just went along with it at the time. I know it's something worse then that, but I don't know what is wrong with me.

I now know that these are my highs and lows and that with time my meds will help me control them, but that doesn't help the emotional pain I'm feeling at the thought of doing all these horrible things just because I could and they made me feel great about myself, that I could get away with all that.

75,"So basically I have a friend who is has been displaying, the best way I can describe it as, odd behavior for the past couple years and it seems like it’s getting worse. Im thinking it’s schizophrenia based of what I’ve read online but I’m not super well versed on the subject so maybe some of you can help me. 

For starters he is 22 and I’ve known him for about 6 years now as he is my best friends older brother. He and I aren’t super close but I would definitely consider him a friend. When I met him he was someone I almost looked up to even tho he’s just a year older than me. He was a completely normal guy, on the quiet side, but overall a chill dude. 

For at least a year now I’ve noticed a real change in him though, I won’t be able to describe it all but I’ll try to list and explainsome behaviors of his. 

For one I’ve noticed he always over analyzing situations, he will question what I’m thinking when I’m just sitting there and often stare at me and others. He admitted in basically having thoughts that people are  out get him. He seems to be battling demons in his own head constantly. I can see him struggling, he becomes very fidgety sometimes and it’s hard to watch  because I know he’s hurting. I’ve tried to understand his thoughts but he is unable to describe why he feels certain ways, and if he does, it makes little sense. At this point I know something is off so I don’t try and understand it or have him explain things to me. 

He also has a very hard time comprehending the things people say and takes a very long time to respond. Even the simplest of things like “do you work tomorrow” for example. He seems too focused on the things in his head to listen to what other people are saying. 

Other behaviors I’ve noticed is his sleep schedule is all over the place, he will be up in the middle of the night and sleeping during the day pretty often. He lacks basically any motivation and does basically nothing besides work at a gym. Past interests of his he does not care about anymore. For example we used to talk about the NBA together and now doesn’t follow it at all. He also used to be very into bodybuilding but he now doesn’t seem to care about that either.

He has shared with others that he thinks fake acid is what did this to him but the acid he took was the same as a bunch others did including his own brother so while I don’t think it was bad acid, I know that psychedelic drugs can bring out an underlying mental illness like schizophrenia. He has tripped on acid and mushrooms more than once but he no longer does. Also he smokes weed regularly and this only seems to makes him worse. Close ones to him have encouraged him to stop but he doesn’t listen and smokes just about everyday still. 

Just last night I invited him to go to the bar to watch the Warriors vs Rockets game and he was talking to himself at times which is something I haven’t noticed until now so I’m not sure when he started doing this. He was also eyeing just about everyone who walked by, he was not watching the game at all even though he used to be a big NBA fan as I stated before.  At one point we had these two attractive females sit next to us and he would not stop looking at them the entire time and I could tell it was making them uncomfortable. He’s very sexually frustrated and it seems his lack of success with women really gets to him. 

His family has caught on to this all and I was hoping he would get some help but he seems to be getting worse. I’m not sure if they’re really taking it as seriously as it may be unfortunately.  Its getting to the point where it’s hard to even hangout with him at all because of this. I’m not sure what to do if anything but I’m worried about his well-being because he only seems to be getting more and more disconnected from reality.

Diagnoses: 
1. Anxiety 
2. Bipolar
3. ADD
4. Eating Disorder (Not Otherwise Specified) 
5. Borderline Personality Disorder 

I’m in college, transferring to a University in the fall. 
Summers are always hard for me because without school to distract the anxiety, I engage in ED thoughts and behaviors because the anxiety is bored. I have an internship this summer, so that will help with structure, but they have a stocked kitchen and it’s really hard for my ED to be around all of that food. I really need to go to the gym and I think I will start going next week in the evenings around 7-8 pm. 

My ED and anxiety have been getting into fights with my boyfriend lately. I don’t know how to make him understand that I’m not trying to “take it out on him”, that those aspects of my mind take over sometimes and don’t give me a say in my words or actions. When I calm down, Rational Me is back and can apologize for what ED or Anxiety said, but that’s not enough. 

Just because I’m functioning and I have a job and I’m not crying every single day doesn’t mean that I don’t still feel like shit 24/7. Doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t be worried about me hurting myself (engaging in ED behaviors, cutting) instead of mad at me for being grouchy. Because I am. And I’m worried about myself. And I’m sick of myself. 

I was in contact with a therapist but she’s flaky and doesn’t return my texts.  Finding new therapists is exhausting and takes a really long time. 

I guess I don’t have a question for any of you. Just venting.
