0,"I remember at a young age a traumatic event, I remember being up against the ground and in my mind begging and begging for it to stop, for someone to come and save me. And it did stop but my memory is patchwork, what I remember I remember so well it hurts but what I don't is fuzzy around the edges and almost nonexistent in the middle. And I'm recovering, I'm recovering really well, and I'm almost there. I have  started to feel again after so many years and it's like wearing my glass. I remember feeling like between me and the world there were massive panes of glass, I could see out, they could see in but it was thick and I was alone. But then came my younger sibling, and I love her so much now and even then she melted me a little. It was through her that I was saved. Only my feelings for her I am not ashamed of, but everything else, my happyness less so but my depression, my anxiety and my expression of it pains me when I go through it, it pains me to open up. How do I get over this? I have carved my way through so much pain, I remember waking up in the night with so much fear as my heart raced so hard and I hurt, deeper then ever. And I carved through it, I carved through the pain. I carved through the memories, when they appeared. I hid my memories and I hid my feelings deep down but when they surfaced I carved through them too. But I can break through this. It feels like something solid and unbreakable, and very much defines the boy I am today. But I don't want it to because I got his hands.off my body and I want them off my mind I want to be free from all of this but I can't get rid of this last little thing. Please, what can I do to not be so ashamed? I know that I will read through this again when I am thinking properly and I will want to get rid of it, but at the same time I don't want to feel like that. I want to be free. That's all I want.",01Dec2018,1
1,so i am subscribed to a self harm subreddit but people constantly post saying they’re inpatient at a mental health hospital but being able to post. i just wanna know if people can really have devices. because my multiple hospitalizations the only contact i’ve had to the outside world is visitation. i though maybe it because i’m a minor so i’m always in the children’s wing so maybe just kids don’t get devices. but one of my hospitalizations i could see into the adult wing and never saw devices. so is there actually places that let you have devices while inpatient? (sorry if this isn’t the appropriate subreddit idk where else to ask),01Dec2018,1

I also have very little emotions, i get jealous, hurt, angry and i think those are the only emotions i can fully feel. I don't even know if I'm capable of loving anyone or caring about them but i really want to. I also don't feel guilt as strongly as other people seem to be feeling. I see myself as superior to others and I'm good at manipulating and lying to others to get what i want but i try to stop myself from doing that. The thing is i don't want to be this way but i am, i used to love this it was a lot of fun just doing whatever the fuck i want and not giving a fuck about others. But i changed, i see how wrong i was in the past and how fucked up some things i did were, don't get me wrong i still don't feel guilty about it. I just can see why it would be wrong to do those things and how i could be hurting those people and i don't want to do that to others.",01Dec2018,1

6,"I know this subreddit is more about serious mental health problems like bipolar and that stuff, but I'm struggling with this so I thought I would ask you guys for some advise.

I used to be really proud of the fact that I was always planing 2 steps forward and that I was always thinking about multiple things at the same time, because it's efficient. But lately it has become overwhelming.

I'm studying my second year of economics and like always we have multiple things to do at the time. For example, in one week, I might have a presentation, 2 cases and a weakly due date for a part of the big project of that semester. Furthermore, at the beginning of the year we had to make a contract with goals (like learning HTML, get better at photoshop and make a portfolio, that kind of stuff), so each week there are an additional 3 things I have to do. Last of all (regarding school) I'm also already thinking and planing ahead for next year (I have to find a minor and a place to live). 

About 2 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend at the time after about 11 months. It was my desision, so not too heartbroken or anything. But I missed being wanted and having a girlfriend in general. I'm noticing I really dispice being single. Therefor I also got back on Tinder, which brings a new thing to worry about to the table. 

Now, because of all these things going on at the same time and my inability to only focus on 1 thing, I'm always worrying or working. When I try to relax I always think 'ugh, I've got soo many more things to do, this is just wasting my time'. And even when I'm working on something I'm thinking 'you have got a lotttt more things to do after this'. 

And I know what you're thinking, 'just cut something out of the equation, that's one less thing to worry about'. But I can't cut school out of the equation because ...my education and money. I don't want to cut out looking for a gf cuz I hate being alone.

So my question to you all is: how can I stop myself from always thinking about the things I need to be doing and take a break from my own head? ",01Dec2018,1

10,"Alright, I have schizophrenia, don’t hallucinate e or hear voices, I just have exotic beliefs. I’ve been inside of a mental ward 4 times or so since entering University. Upon almost graduating, I had to call it quits due to the severity of my illness interfering with my studies. 

Currently I receive $750/month in disability and $90/month in food stamps. I live with a family I essentially rely on but one of the members in the house is an alcoholic I can’t get along with. I’ve suspected for months he abuses his dog, whom I treasure, and tonight I came home and feel as though it was confirmed. This dog will usually push anyone over bolting outside once the door is open to play. Wouldn’t even flinch tonight. He never goes in the room I stay in (has just been that way since they were pups and I wasn’t around when they were pups) and tonight he came in and wouldn’t leave. Once his food is put out he inhales it. Wouldn’t come out for dinner, I had to bring it inside the room he never enters. 

All was fine before I left him alone with his owner, after I played fetch with him to go to the gym. 

I can’t take this shit anymore. No amount of therapy or bullshit can heal the SUFFERING I experience alone on a day to day basis, both in my head and the people I’m forced to be stuck with. NOTHING can heal these wounds while I’m trapped in a house like this. I’ve had this suspicion for months but my family always just dismisses it. If I setup my time lapse GoPro and gather evidence there’s a high percentage chance I’ll just end up with nowhere to live for potentially tearing a ‘family’ apart. 

I found a house for sale in a remote town in some nice mountains (I love mountains and snow, I’ve only seen snow once) for $69,000. Mortgage comes to around $410/month. Is it remotely possible for me to be qualified to get a mortgage?

13,"I am unsure where to bring this question, so please let me know if there is a better sub for it!

My fiancé and I have been talking a lot about the possibility of having a baby in the next few years. We're pretty cautious and not sure if this could happen, because I have a long history of depression and borderline personality disorder, which are currently well-managed with Cymbalta and lithium. The medications themselves seem to be fairly low risk; we're more concerned about post-partum depression. It seems pretty much guaranteed since I already have severe clinical depression. I don't currently experience symptoms and haven't in a couple years, thanks to the meds and a LOT of therapy.

Basically what we're wondering is: am I likely to experience new symptoms or a resurgence of the old ones? Or will the medications probably continue to keep things under control? I'm mostly looking for statistics or anecdotes from people who have similar experiences.

I want to be able to have a baby so badly. I'm just worried because I know how I was back before I started on the lithium...wild mood swings, impulsive behavior, smoking and drinking way too much, and all I could think about, every single minute I was awake, was killing myself. I'm scared to go back to that while carrying another life inside me, and I can't be that kind of mother. I also don't want to put that burden on my fiancé. I can't imagine forcing him to take care of a newborn baby *and* a clinically insane, suicidal, alcoholic fiancée/wife.

Does anyone have experience with this? I hate the thought that we might never be able to safely have a child because I can't get my shit together. I know I should talk to my doctor, but I'm not currently seeing an actual psychiatrist - my family doctor has just been giving me refills. And he's just not quite the right...personality type to open up to about something like this, I guess. Anyway, thank you guys for any responses you may have.",01Dec2018,1

*I also may share some things that could potentially be triggering to others including self-harm, suicidal thoughts so just as a heads up guys please do not proceed unless you are okay to!

My boyfriend of almost two years (20 months) has been battling depression for 5+ years. He’s 22 and does not work and dropped out of school but will be going back for the Spring semester.  He is an amazing and loving boyfriend however his depression has really taken a toll on him.. He doesn’t share his feelings too often however when he does, it can get really emotional. Lately, it’s been really bad and I’m getting scared for his well-being.He states that he has nothing going for him &amp; that he doesn’t want to be here anymore. He does self-harm and I try to help him from doing so but sometimes it still does occasionally. He tells me he has suicidal thoughts every day and it makes me so worried. I don’t want to leave him alone so I try to accompany him as much as I can. I also go to work and school so any minute I have available I spend with him.

I really really really want to help him. What can I do? Anything would really help. Suicide Hotline number has unfortunately not been the best in the past. I am also looking for honest tips, not “go see a therapist or doctor”. I know this must be done but i am also looking for more than one thing to do for him because this alone is not enough.

I don't think murder would be hard as a child I used to kill animals I one time threw a cat constantly against a garage door until it died I did this at the age of 4 and I killed more animals. As of recently past 9 years I haven't killed anymore animals but I constantly think about taking my families pets outside and just shooting them in the head to see how it would make me feel as of recent I don't feel much emotion as there is no literal point in feeling emotion it serves no person to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I ever felt these thoughts really come on or come out was my freshman year when I felt I was used as entertainment by someone who never really cared to be a friend while I liked her she would talk to me but outside of the class it was like I was noone to her and then next semester in my other classes I remember thinking about just walking into class gunning people down not stopping checking heads to make sure they are dead and get no mercy nothing just death the end like they deserve they see me as a monster I become a monster.

33,"A little background: I've had depression for about three years now, and part of the reason I developed it was due to the lack of sleep I got because of how much I took on at once. I am now taking a break from school to work and save up, but now that I only have that and a few other commitments, I sleep a LOT. Some days I'm 2/3 in bed and 1/3 at work. More often than not though it's an issue of me staying up late and wanting a full eight hours. This leads to me feeling guilty that I'm not working on my other goals (ie practicing my instrument, learning German, decluttering my room). I realized that the only way I can do this is to force myself to get up at a certain time (unless I'm ill) regardless of when I went to bed. However, I'm worried that this ""your actions have consequences"" technique (wow that sounds so sad writing it down) will backfire, making me even more depressed than I am now and perhaps not doing the things I want to the quality I want, ringing me back into the awful cycle.

It's hard to explain especially since english isn't my native language so excuse me if at some points it might sound out of place or don't make sense. 

So right now, I keep questioning and trying to find answers by myself as to how I got to this point. One side is me trying to accept that it just happens. I should let it go. The other side keeps telling me that I should keep finding the answer, which in turn keeps making me dig more and more for nothing, well the other side believes I'm digging for nothing and yet I want to keep digging because I want an answer that I can accept. 

A few of the answers are just me wishing that my parents done more, and I keep dwelling on that. So much to the point that I'm kind of convincing myself that it's their fault. But realistically I know it isn't. I already know what happened but I keep deluding myself by finding other answers, trying to make the real answer not real and making my answers the real answer. 

I guess I just want to blame someone/something? And not just accept the ""Because that's the way it is"" notion...",01Dec2018,1
39,"I’m new to reddit so I apologise in advance if I’m not using forum terminology correctly.

I (22M) just want to start this post by saying I was born into a perfect life with very little to be concerned about. Even though this is the case, I have been experiencing almost crippling anxiety throughout my whole life. My anxiety started as long as I can remember, even as a little boy I would experience severe stress, fear, panic and uneasiness. At this stage my anxiety was bad but not as bad as what it would become years ahead. I’ve played club and competitive sport ever since I was 4 years of age and my anxiety started to increase roughly around ages 7 and above. This is when my physiological symptoms started to appear due to my anxiety. It began with nausea followed by severe diarrhoea and vomiting. My father never forced me to win and it’s not like a competition as a child is that important so I had nothing to be nervous about but my mind just went haywire like it usually does. These symptoms would only be apparent during certain situations therefore it wasn’t concurrently happening throughout the year. My anxiety started to lessen in high school from years 7-10 and I found myself experiencing less symptoms. During this time I was a kick-boxer and very good for my age. One day before a sparring comp my ex-friend pushed me over a horizontal pole, bending by back backwards. I didn’t think much of it and continued with the sparring comp and my usually training for a few months. After each session I was finding my back in pain so I decided to get a scan and found 3 herniated discs in my back. After I visited a spinal surgeon and he told me I was never to be able to play sport again (I know, big deal, i can’t play sports, there’s people in worse situations). I dropped to the ground balling my eyes out while my mother tried picking me up. Once I got home I finally stopped crying and went numb. This was my breaking point and where I feel like my walls were broken down. I told my parents I was going for a walk, little did they know I was walking to my ex-friend’s house to beat the crap out of him. I started screaming on his lawn to get him out but his family came out first. Once I saw this I grabbed a boulder and chucked it through his windscreen. I began being chased by his family and once I got home, the cops were waiting for me. The whole cop experience was fine; the Australian police were nice about it. And after about 8 hrs they let me out with an AVO against my ex-friend. I moved schools and this where shit got fucked. I went to another school for senior years 11-12. The second I stepped in there my anxiety went crazy. It wasn’t just situational, it was chronic. I experienced it all day every day and I have no idea why. All I knew is that I couldn’t be away from a toilet for more than 30 mins. I used to go to the bathroom every 45 mins to vomit and have severe diarrhoea. I was vomiting so much I was vomiting blood. This transferred into out of school situations. I couldn’t even leave the house because I kept running back to the toilet from pure nervousness which affected my social life. My sleep was also disrupted so I was basically running on 3 hrs of sleep, with no food in my gut because I was vomiting it out which continued for 2 years straight. Every. Fucking. Day…. And still having no idea why it was happening, once again my life was considered perfect. The pain of paranoia, pessimism, and my physiological conditions arising from my anxiety was too much for my weak, fucked up mind to handle. The only beneficial scenario that SEEMED to be correct was suicide. I dreamt of that shit. If it wasn’t for my mother and how it would affect her I would have hung myself long ago on that rope dangling from the palm trees in my back yard. The same rope I spent hours looking and contemplating (which I should have been studying, hence my bad grades) whether I should do it or not. The person reading is probably thinking I should just toughen up but that’s not how things work for a mentally disabled person. Someone experiencing severe chronic anxiety and depression is psychotic and completely out of touch with reality. Suicide is never okay. It’s been 5 years out of school and the intensity of the anxiety has lowered but I still do struggle leaving the house or going to social events. I’m getting better and just hope things will work out. I have read that some people are born with higher emotional activity in the brain but I want my ability to control my anxiety to surpass that. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced something similar to this and if they’ve gotten better. I still have my days but as time goes on I’m getting better. ",01Dec2018,1

52,"So I have a good life. I have an amazing girlfriend. An alright family, with their own issues. Doing really well in school without making school a big part of my life (I like to have fun, I'm 16M). I have a hobby I'm really into (making video games) and am on a really good track to doing that for a 'living'. I have a job where I'm an IT intern at a startup. Idk, lifes going good. My issue is, what I would name it (I need help finding a name) rehearsal loop OCD. History: I used to constantly make lists, every single thing I had to do whether it was remembering to do a homework assignment, tweak something in my game, buy \_\_\_\_, make my bed.. It was accessive list making which is a symptom of OCD. This started in early middle school, I remember walking home from school and listing off all the chores I was gonna do at home -multiple times, it never ""stuck"". Fast forward to a bad time in my life. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for almost two years, I had family issues with my brother losing it (drug-induced schizophrenia basically)... It got worse, that's when the lists became even more excessive, they were everything I was gonna do from clipping my f-ing toenails to typing an essay to remember birthdays.. I got out of that relationship and grew up a little, fast forward to about halfway through last summer. The list making died down a bit - I had a great new girlfriend, my brother (and me) were home less of the time (I got my license and a car). It was now more of a list of elements of my life (school (n/a during summer lol), work, my game, and exercise). Making sure I was constantly making progress on these things was my 'list'. Never stopping always rehearsing things I have to do for these things. So the last fast forward- now. Now I have gotten a handle on that, I have 3 checks in my head now. I will recite this in my head dozens of times, which is the current issue. ""School, work, and other. I think about school, got everything done/planned out assignment-wise etc? Okay good. Work. All on track? Okay good. Other (e.g. made plans to call a grandparent (remembering to do that), made plans to go to dinner, planning that out). Okay good.""  This is a good system- I like being on top of what 'matters'.  However, that is only in theory. It doesn't 'click' or 'stick'. I constantly am reciting that. Constantly! I get so overwhelmed and I will just sit down and almost cry to myself because I can't stop the recitation. It's ovehrlemeing, and anxiety causing. Rarey rarely does reciting this only once (which would be my goal) stick/work. It's a problem in my life, I need it to stop. I never feel at rest tasks wise. I know I need to relax, watch a movie, etc. but I cant! The OCD doesn't let me. I don't even know if it's OCD even.. I want to know what it is so I can research other people struggling and figure it out more. I have no history of anxiety other then what's talked about in the post. I have no other mental illnesses and really I'm fine besides this - but it is a very crucial part of my life and I'm SCARED it will ruin my life.

I see these people that look free. People that don't recite stupid ocd lists in their brain over and over. People that travel and are care free. That's what I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would all work out but I need this problem of honestly crippling OCD/anxiety/list making(?)  to be out of my life. I'm scared about ruining my life.

It took a lot of therapy and life changes.

In November, I started with a personal trainer. Today, it came up that he wanted me to start tracking what I eat. I told him it is a bad idea because I become too obsessive over it. I avoided answering most of his questions regarded the topic of tracking.

I think he took it as I am just uncomfortable talking about weight and food tracking like most people. In reality, it is not a safe habit for me with my mental illnesses. I tried tracking eating before, and it was one of the triggers that led me to being suicidal. I become too obsessive over the numbers which leads to a negative though spiral. At that time, I was still on meds to try to control the obsessive thoughts.

I know I need to eventually tell him about my mental illness for him to be able to help me effectively. It is holding me back. I just can’t find the courage to speak up. It scares me to tell him, “I can’t do this because it triggers me to have suicidal ideations that I tend to act on”.",01Dec2018,1

They treat me like it's *their* responsibility to keep me happy. I'm 18, for chrissakes. I know to ask for help when I need it and have an excellent track record of doing so.

***TLDR; Looking for job openings and networking makes me, within seconds, immediately depressed, suicidal, physically ill, and I feel like I am physically unable to do it, making it extremely difficult for me to work on job-hunting. Spent past year job-hunting with constant failure, after usually being first-try successful with everything else in life.***

Everything else in this post is details, so just look at the tldr if you want to comment but don't have time to read all this. I appreciate any comments. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Core of the Problem:** When I sit down to work on looking for job openings, networking, seeking professional advice, etc, I get a bad physical and mental reaction from looking at these pages. Almost every thought in my brain tells me to do anything else, look at anything else, despite the importance of my tasks. Even if I'm in a fine mood, I immediately become depressed and sometimes suicidal, and I keep thinking, ""Why am I failing"", ""What am I doing wrong"", ""Why don't I have a job yet"", ""What's wrong with me"", etc. 

It becomes extremely difficult for me to do any of the work at all, and what I have done so far, I've done by forcing my way through and taking inefficiently, absurdly long times to do it. It's been going on for a few months probably, though I've been job hunting for a year and a half now.

I want to succeed, I work hard, I don't want to lay around and do nothing, I am trying to do what I must, but this problem has become more and more of a waste of my time. What should take 30 minutes has, at times, taken the entire day. Disgusting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I've been job hunting for a year and a half now, after I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University. I currently have a small part-time where I clean up a storefront, and I've done so much work for my parents and helped them out with their businesses so much so that they're fine with letting me stay, but I wish to have a job in game design and move out.

Partially because I originally sought out graphic design, a field I had no passion for, that first year was constant failure for the whole year, no matter how hard I tried, and after I had been first-try-successful or exceptional at almost everything else in my life so far. Yikes. I fell into a deep depression and nearly killed myself on one occasion, but thought better of trying it (was on the road, failed an interview, genuinely thought of crashing into a wall, but decided not to). This is likely the source of the reactions I have now.

This past half-year though, has been pretty good. I originally sought out graphic design jobs but switched to game design because I made a video game and it was an overwhelming success, relatively speaking for the first game of someone with no reputation in the field. I focused on upgrading and expanding that game until I recently released the final edition. 

With that behind me, I tried today to do some more jobhunting since I now have an impressive portfolio, but I had the problems listed at the top of the post. I was feeling good, but like the flick of a switch, became unable to focus on any of it, as if my brain is fuzzy or my sight is blurry (sight not actually physically blurry), all my senses numbed....until I do anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, I am probably writing this post as a way of distracting myself from having to even think about doing the jobhunting in the multiple other tabs I have open.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other:** I hope I'm not a choosy beggar when I say this, and let me know if I am, but there are two comments I'm not looking for. ""Rest, back off of the jobhunt, recharge a while"". I did all of that, with a significant months-long break in jobhunting after focusing on my popular game, and it does not seem to be helping. ""Don't worry, you'll get a job one day"" is a very nice sentiment that I appreciate, but I am looking for advice to solving a problem instead of being consoled about the problem.

Is this a real, bonafide phobia? Or am I being overdramatic? Or is this something that everyone has? I don't know. I would greatly appreciate answers.

69," So let me preface this a little bit: I'm 28, Male, married and have in the past year been recently diagnosed with severe ADD. I've had this all my life and my brain works so differently than others and now I finally understand why as of my diagnosis.   


Now, I feel like my ADD is so bad its literally ripping my life apart. Out of all the symptoms I have it all the worst. I'm so disorganized, I'm all over the place all the time and I cant remember anything. I feel like I just cant function in life and my marriage is falling apart because of my wife not knowing how to handle someone with my level of ADD. It affects everything in my life so negatively I'm at my wits end and I'm struggling with wanting to kill myself because its just too much.  


I'm not sure what to do anymore. I know getting on medication and finding a medication that works for me is probably the most obvious answer for anyone reading but my biggest fear of not doing it is because im so scared of medication hopping, dealing with all the potential side affects just to find the ""one"" that works for my bio chemistry. I'm afraid of it making me a total zombie like some people are with add / ADHD medications. Does anyone know or could recommend any medications that worked great for them who have add? I'm just terrified of taking medication that alters my brain chemistry   


I've tried other stuff on and off to see if it would help: cannabis, magnesium, vitamin D, cod liver oil, etc but I cant remember to take it enough to truly change my life around and I feel like I do need meds.

71,"These lyrics speak to me atm. Right now, I'm drunk af, which I love cause usually my head stops working, but right now its working too much and way too good and clear but foggy as well.
What has happened: today I was officially diagnosed with pcos, two weeks ago however the docter mentioned it as possible diagnosis. I've read a few things about it, but the main thing is that I had to loose weight, although I'm currently at a regular weight and all fine and dandy. However all I saw way loose weight, so I started restricting again as my former eating disorder self would have done. This resulted in me not having had breakfast and lunch in 3 weeks. I've lost weight. But I'm also very drunk and even more easily drunk now. I can't seem to manage to eat normal.

72,I’m wondering if any of you know what this means? I have never went to the doctor about being angry and have never been aggressive or angry with my doctor.

73,"Sorry this a bit long, so thank you if you read all of it. 

I met my best friend a year and a half ago, now we have the best and deepest bond. She’s very loving and supportive, she’s also very successful and have an achievement oriented mindset. She doesn’t have any mental problems. I love hanging out with her, and she helped me through a lot. Now I’m motivated, getting my life on track, and I can tell her absolutely anything without being judged. I also take medication for bipolar (started 10 months ago) which is the mean reason I’m better. But being around a very supportive, accepting, high achieving person have also helped a lot. 

Couple of weeks ago I met this girl (let’s call her S) who’s 20 years old I am (I am 26) she has a lot of problems with her family, she hangs out  with the “young wild and free” crowed (weed regularly) and she says she’s going through depression although she’s managing okay and she really doesn’t like to give people any negative energy. We bonded, and I saw my younger self in her to some extent. I wanted to be a positive example for her, that you can overcome things and be happy and stable. She’s not on medication but her therapist suggested it. Anyway, I don’t mind S. She doesn’t give me bad vibes. And although she talks about her problems and her family and friends, I can listen and not be affected too negatively, specially that her mental issue is not too severe. I actually love hanging out with her a lot. Besides my best friend I don’t have many friends (most my friends and I went separate ways) I met some of S’s friends couple of days ago and they were chill (no mental issues, but some regular college student problems)

But today one of her friends, let’s call her M, texted her when we were hanging out, and said she’d like to meet up. S asked me if it’s okay if she comes I said sure. She told me about M. M overdosed on purpose couple of weeks ago. And my friend didn’t talk to her much ever since because she’s been going through a lot herself. M has Schizophrenia, she hears and sees things. Stuff like that scary the shit out of me. I don’t like being around such people or hearing about what they go through. Even when some random person in McDonalds is talking to themselves and I realize they’re seeing or hearing something I get scared and feel down. 

I previously had a psychotic break after abusing weed and before I was diagnosed with bipolar, it lasted for like 5 months. I didn’t have hallucinations (I didn’t hear or see things) but I had delusions (I used to think that people’s tweets on twitter had secret messages that were saying bad things about me and my family, I saw metaphors in ordinary sentences, and thoughts these metaphors were about me) it was horrible and it almost ruined my life. I wanted to commit suicide because whenever I saw the metaphorical messages in the tweets I thought “my reputation and my family’s reputation was ruined and they’re bullying me”. 

Then I took antipsychotics and it stopped. After a while and for like a month I had this phobia that I’d start hearing voices or seeing things. Whenever I heard some noise in the street while I’m in my bedroom I wanted to make sure it’s a car noise and not in my head. The phobia went away but not completely. I still dislike seeing or knowing about people who hallucinate. 

Back to my original story, so today I spent a few hours with M and S, I tried my best to be extremely supportive, positive, to let them know they have hope, I heard both of them talk about their issues (S with depression and her family and friends/ M with her Schizophrenia and friends problems) I listened to their stories. I talked with M about medication, I suggested she talk to her therapist about a specific medication that might help. I gave her a lot of advice. And listened genuinely to both of them. M also asked me for my number and said she wanna stay in touch and that it’s the first time someone actually knew what she was talking about, I gave it to her and said sure I’d love to talk and hangout. Then each of us went back home. 

I’ve been home for a few hours and I’ve been trying to stay busy, saving food recipes and making weekly schedule and trying to stay motivated. But I feel that deep inside my heart I’m somewhat sad. There’s just this sadness, and fear. I don’t feel upbeat and positive like I did before we met. And I have this feeling that I don’t wanna see or hear about M anymore. I can barely see S. And I felt that I really really miss my best friend even though I saw her like 2 days ago. I have a more deep appreciation for our bond now and for her. And while my best friend was that special person for me (she says we have a magical bond and she doesn’t see me as a mentally ill person, she said I’m one the best people she ever met) I realized I can’t be that person to someone else. I can’t be completely accepting and so supportive, it drains me, and somewhat scares me. Maybe not day to day, but I can see myself being sucked into it in the long run.

Am I selfish or hypocritical that I don’t want to spend time with other people who have mental issues (specially Schizophrenia)? Should I cut them off, or at least don’t stay in touch with M? I can tell S that I don’t want to see M again so please don’t invite her. I don’t know the whole thing left me a bit unbalanced, and feel that my heart is tight. ",01Dec2018,1

75,"God I just don’t know if what I’m feeling is a mental illness. I don’t know how to describe it I’m a teenager and started in a new high school for my freshman year, the school is a city school and I have anxiety when I’m in a crowded place but I have headphones so that helps not idk freak out has much. My parents are divorced 50/50 which I am grate full fit but there is so much stress and there is all ways a problem. I feel alone all the time except with my friends and I have good friends but there older then me there like juniors and seniors. Sometimes I get in a dump of my mind and I just feel sad I don’t know how to describe it and I don’t know why I am trying to I just needed to know if this worthy to go to a therapist I wish I could not be so alone I wish I had a partner but I don’t have the social ability to just talk to new people.

76,"I’ve struggled with anxiety my entire life and recently developed depression, and I don’t *necessarily* feel worthless or guilty or whatnot... I don’t really have anything to feel super guilty or worthless for. I mean, why would I be worthless? Actually, why would anyone with depression be worthless? Don’t those who have anxiety or depressive disorders have a high level
of empathy, so what could we have done *so* wrong to feel badly for? Couple that with a negative filter, and were in for a bad time unless we change our patterns/negative self-talk, which I find pretty easy to negate; its like an asshole trying to put you down (which I have plenty of experience with) you simply talk back/ignore the BS.

Isn’t depression a separate entity from us? I’m not saying I’m ‘cured’ and I have scary existential thoughts and such, but I believe I know the path to betterment. ",01Dec2018,1
77,"In 6th grade, 4 years ago from today, I attempted to take my life. Fast forward to today, this has been one of the hardest years as the day typically surfaces a lot of old feelings and I tend to find the differences in the state I was in then versus now. I don’t have any plans to hurt myself tonight, but I’m really struggling to cope with the weight of the memories and the occasion itself. 
Only this year, I feel completely alone and forgotten about. No one had remembered what today is who was involved with me during that time in my life. 
Not my mom, my dad, my boyfriend, or any of my close friends. All I need on a day like this is a simple acknowledgement of “how are you?” but it seems that thought hasn’t crossed anyone’s mind today.
It’s 5:30 and I haven’t brought it up to anyone, I thought I was handling the day like any other day earlier but the feeling of being an insignificance is hitting me pretty hard right now. So here I am, sharing my story and thoughts today to strangers. I guess that’s the best positive outlet I can find currently. Thanks for listening. ",01Dec2018,1
78,"Ok, so a little background first.

I (16M) was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 13 months old. It’s something that doesn’t make me depressed, since I’ve had it all me life.

In kindergarten, the staff refused to feed me so that they didn’t have to worry about correcting my blood sugar. This is completely illegal, but instead of suing, my mom took me out and homeschooled me until the 8th grade (except for 4th grade private school, plus two of my 3 siblings being homeschooled as well). For a lot of middle school I was in this group of people my mom knew well, all very Christian, that were also homeschooled. For 9th grade I did an online school which may have been the tipping point of my mental health. All day, every day, I sit in front of the laptop, home alone for most days, doing the shittiest version of broken education possible (I won’t get into it). For a whole year. In 10th grade, I started to change. I did an early college program, where i took all my classes at a community college. This was my first “real” experience of social interaction, to be a little dramatic. The program put me ahead, gave me college credit, along with this same group of kids I’ve always kind of known. But something important happened here. It was around this time that, after being in gymnastics for 4 years, I injured my arm to the point that I’ve had 3 surgeries, my median nerve snapped, they replaced it with a nerve from my leg, i lost feeling in most of my hand, burnt off the tip of my finger (because I have no feeling) and lost my thumb muscle. To this day I still can’t use most of my hand. This devastated me, since I had to quit gymnastics, my whole team quit once I did (my only real friend group) and I was completely alone. I started to strongly dislike that group of kids from the homeschool group. I noticed that they were odd, had even less social interaction than I did, and (I apologize for using this term, but it’s how I felt) felt like they were “retards”, or otherwise not updated on social norms. Here is where I made my only close friend to this day.

For the sake of this post, I’ll call him “Tim”. Tim and I hated each other in gymnastics. He thought of me as I thought of those homeschool kids, and I thought he was just a jerk. In this college program, we had two classes together, and after both quitting gymnastics, started to talk. By now I felt more normal, separated from the homeschool kids. He and I started to talk a lot, and hang out more and more. When I’m around him, i feel like my “real” self. And to this day (I’m almost 17) he’s me closest friend.

But I don’t think I’m completely mentally sane.

I feel like I have to explain problems, thoughts, ideas and decisions to myself. I often find that I’m talking to myself, and I use the term “we” instead of “I”. “We just need to get through this class”, “I understand, you don’t need to explain to me”, etc. It’s as if there’s another “me”, but I worry that labeling it will be officially insane.

I go to a public school now, and I love it. I’m actually making a couple friends, and feeling “normal”. I have issues with my family that I won’t get into, but that also contributes to my mental health. I won’t talk to them about this, as I try not to talk to them about much these days.

So, is there something wrong with me, serious enough to seek help? I feel like I’m in a the best spot I’ve ever been in, but this other “me”, stemmed from the past social trauma still exists. 

I really don’t know what to expect from here, I’m just posting to see what some people say. Maybe it’s stupid, and I’ll delete this, or maybe it’s serious.

Thanks for reading.",01Dec2018,1
79,Hey everyone I’m super new to all this. I kinda wanted some advice. I’m a 23 yr old mom of two boys. I have DID along with severe depression and anxiety. It’s really hard to navigate every day life without something or someone coming out. We switch daily at the very least. So to try and help myself cope and understand and accept I kind of just started a YouTube channel talking about it. And honestly it’s so much harder then I thought 😂 there are days when I really wanna just curl up into a ball and hide and no very well that I can’t. I’ll try to make a video and just break down or have to stop half way. I really want to get ahold of my courage so that others don’t feel alone and know that they’re not bad people or parents for dealing with what they’re dealing with. I’ve tried kind of just blurting things out on camera 😂 or meditating before hand. Any advice would be welcome. We really do love being able to educate and raise awareness and love for mental health. The anxiety is just making it so hard,01Dec2018,1
80,"I have these vivid images (almost like memories) of events that havent actually happened. They’re bad 99% of the time and usually revolve around my biggest fears (my boyfriend cheating, people i love being hurt or killed, everyone leaving etc...) When these thoughts pop in my head i cant make them go away. I feel unable to move or think of other things. Its like a bad daydream i cant leave. These usually heighten my anxiety and make it hard to do anything. I fall into this depressive episode and i can never just shake the thought.
When i tried to google what this might be (to ensure im not crazy) Intrusive Thoughts kept popping up but when reading the definition i dont seem to fit under that (Intrusive thoughts usually involve thoughts where YOU are the one doing the bad thing ex:hurting loved ones, sexual thoughts with inappropriate people etc..)  I dont ever image MYSELF committing the bad things but rather i witness them.
What might this be? How can i fix it? 

TDLR: i have vivid thoughts about bad things happening to people i love ",01Dec2018,1
