0,"I used to be so against the idea of drugs in general but as time grew by, so did my cockiness.  I experiment with drugs for fun to see the effects. My mild depression starts to turn into moderate depression, don't stop the drugs, keeps getting worse. As I started having so much fun with drugs in general and they were a huge part of my life  i kept using. They took me to find places. Cool binding with old friends, rediscovering nature, letting out trauma and lust. 


Lately it has been a struggle of staying sober for long enough to feel any sort of normal headspace. And then needing to get my brain slammed with some narcotic at some point for no fucking reason. I will find something to take randomly when I feel like it.  I will take a loved one's pills from their drawer, I will text a Coke dealer to get me some h. I will take 2 edibles just to feel sedated enough to not cry in self sorry while sitting with my ex. I've lost so much because of my own fault and idiotic decisions I just dissociate with any situations or encounters of any kind. I can't deal with the pain of my breakup and my mental illness I go back to smoking joints couple times a day and searching out tabs everywhere to lose sense of reality for a while. Sorry if this is hard to follow or incoherent, just very confused about my condition is mental capacity",23Aug2018,3,
1,"Life is strange... When you are a child, everything looks so nice. When you grow up, the world becomes gray. I feel I'm dying, something inside me yells that. It's... hard to describe. When I think about what happened my heart is beating... like it's almost over. I'm only 20, I moved abroad to study, and everything is different than I thought. But let's start from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a boy (6 years old maybe), my mother asked me if he can go to a party. I agreed. Because of that, I destroyed my parents' relationship. Mother found a new ""lover"". They divorced soon. I had to choose with who I want to live. It's the worst decision to a child. Sometime later I've moved with my father to his mother, my grandmother. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I even write this... When I'm alone, sometimes I think I cannot go forward anymore. I never told anyone how I feel. I never had a first love, I have some problems with my heart, or something (sometimes it hurts and I cannot breathe deeply, but never went to a doctor (because of potential costs). Once, when I was around 14, I ate a lot of pills. Hospital, questions, feeling sorry...

&amp;#x200B;

Today I could be dead. I fell from a cliff. Few seconds in the air and what? Only my hands covered with blood, nothing more. I still cannot believe how could it happened I didn't break anything. I fell on a tiny beach. I was stranded for a few hours because of the tide. But here I am, writing this...

&amp;#x200B;

Payment for the flat is coming this month. I have only 50 pounds of 280. I cannot find any job, mostly there's silence, sometimes an e-mail, saying: "" After careful consideration, we're really sorry but you won't be moving forward in the selection process this time."". I didn't even start my studies which I dreamed of, and instead, I'm going to the end. On the internet the same. No-one want's to buy any services, no-one (or only a few) are interested in what I'm doing...

&amp;#x200B;

Without the flat, I thought about going to an unknown direction and to never come back. But it won't end well. Why I'm still alive? If I'm going to the end, why those pills didn't do anything? Why that cliff didn't do anything (except hands).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm dreaming about the past so often now, I'm running out of time, but still, I'm writing this (who knows why). So many choices, what could happen if I chose differently? So many questions. I don't belong to this world, but still, it keeps me alive. Before the civilization you were hunting, surviving, breathing... Now? Stupid laws, pointless wars, relations, education...

2,"I always feel like I don't fit in anywhere. My friends who have behavioral health issues also have substance use disorders. My normal friends dont have any of that. Ibhave behavioral health issues so I don't fit in with the normies and I dont have addiction issues and so I cant empathize. I try to be there for them all I just feel like no one really gets me anymore. In angry so much lately. I try to open up cuz all I wanna do is cry and bottling my emotions makes me worse. But then no one care or listens. 

I was trying to talk to my husband about my day and he acted like he was listening in the very beginning. And then he was all quiet. Not even responding. So I ask if hes even listening and he says what? Like I hadnt been talking. Then he repeats the first 2 sentences. But has no idea what I said after which was alot. So I just said nevermind because who cares right. And he just says ok. So I went to bed. And I'm laying here trying not to cry and he doesn't even care. 

And its like that with everyone around me. I give everyone every part of myself. And when I need something no ones there and I'm alone again. And im always alone.

Even though I have 20 years to back that I've always been a good hardworking and grateful person.. but no now I am in a world that hates and misunderstands me because I have an illness that cannot be seen. Why the fuck are we in the 21st century and still, with all the scientific backing and even public education of all illnesses, am I feeling like part of the Salem Witch Trials? I have actually been referred to by my mothers husband as a creature who dwells in my room. When all I've done is taken a few months to try to take it easy, get some rest, and better myself. I tried to keep working but I just couldn't take it anymore.. and now everyone is shaming me for not sticking it out or getting another job...

9,"Or living anything close to a life that isn’t in supreme suffering. My inability to focus or be present now manifests as crippling physical pain in my head and sometimes facial nerves. I truly think I am brain damaged due to a traumatic event and a very very long period of extreme stress that followed. I’ve seen so many people and done so much and so little has improved. I want to believe that I have repressed emotions or something but I don’t know. I’m trying EMDR/brainspotting and potentially Neurofeedback on Monday but for now I can literally only feel pain. I used to be so present and connected spiritually with myself and the world before my trauma. All I can think about sometimes is going back and stopping myself from doing the thing that traumatized me. Everything I do is forced and I truly can’t see any way of having any healthy sustainable relationships when I’m both in this much pain and largely cognitively and emotionally impaired. Especially a relationship with a significant other. I had my first one since the trauma (4 years) a few months ago that didn’t last long and ended for valid reasons but near the end I was becoming extremely attached due to her, an external source, being the only place I got any internal pleasure from and I fucking hate it and I know that is a recipe for destruction for any relationship. I want to go back to feeling natural internal love and joy and having healthy, warm relationships. I hate that external things like food and love feel like addictions because my brain is fucked and feels only pain. I’ve struggled with ADHD and bad thoughts my whole life but was able to work through that before the trauma. Now trying to be present in the world is physically painful and it drives me insane. Is it moral to allow a human being to live like this if they’ve exhausted all options? I’m not saying I have yet but it’s really starting to feel like I’m getting close. I truly feel brain damaged and the irony is I used to study neuroscience so after my trauma and I lost my ability to relax it literally felt like my brain was atrophying from stress and I was powerless to do anything and I had countless mental breakdowns trying and failing to save my brain from being ravaged by the stress. In the end I failed miserably and I can’t imagine ever feeling human again and I have so much grief for the person I used to be. I just want my brain and body back. I truly can’t believe I’ve lost more than 4 years of my life. I’m sorry it hurts to think but I just needed to vent. I hope everyone else is okay as they can be. ",23Aug2018,2,

12,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, if there is a better place let me know.

A couple weeks before the 4th of July a new album came out from a band i liked and i read a book that's plot was centered around suicide, it left me in a very strange headspace. I remember going to a bar with my partner and telling him I was thinking a lot about suicide in a new way, i think I told him it helped me to see it in new light. I've had suicidal ideation for over 15 years now. I started to feel depressed, really depressed. At the end of two weeks i could barely stomach rice, had become very melancholy, i felt like a ghost. By this time i was listening to this cd nearly 30 times a day, on constant replay. I was annoying everyone in my life including my co-workers.

My partner and i were toxic for each other and over 3 years would get drunk and physically fight a few nights a week and the 4th of July night we got into a really bad one. I don't even remember doing it but i hit him in the face with a pot and split his forehead open, i had blood all over me and started to act erratic, laughing and yelling at him to kill me. He called the police and i had them take me to the hospital, listening to the cd the whole time.

I was in the psych ward 2 weeks where i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (previously diagnosed MDD and BPD). I had a screaming crying episode at the hospital  when i heard someone singing, i was so mad that someone got to hear music but i couldn't hear mine so the nurses would let me play the cd at night so i could calm down and go to sleep. Eventually got into a recovery program afterward to work on codependency, sex and love addiction, ptsd, and trauma. I stayed there thirty days and got my therapists to let me listen to the cd to calm down.

I got out last Thursday, moved to a new city, starting my whole life over but i still can't listen to anything else. I have a very physical response even when trying to listen to other music i love. I feel uneasy like something in my head broke in that depressive episode. I'm listening to it non-stop all day long now. I've never done something like this before.

Does anybody please have any insight as to what is happening in my brain? Is it good? Bad? I enjoy it fully every time i listen to it, but everybody around me is already driven bonkers by it. It makes me feel like I'm in a trance, not really happy, but unaffected by everything outside and inside of me.",23Aug2018,9,

19,"  Posting this a few places trying to just get stuff off my chest hoping it'll help...  
 

I don't even know where to start. I'm sure that happens a lot so I'm going to type until it starts to get somewhere. I am just so lost I do not have anything that I find fun anymore. There are brief moments where I am really driven to do something and I have fun but they happen maybe once every 3 months. I just really get into my Korean learning for a day. I guess that is what is prompting this. I'm kind of plateud in my Korean and people say you just need to learn using something you enjoy. I don't have anything I really enjoy. I don't like watching TV, I have never been a fan of listening to music. I have only owned 3 Records, 3 CD's and two casettes in my entire life. I did used to enjoy reading when I was really young and I always read way above my grade level. That didn't help with all the bullying and stuff that I went through. I have tried to read but I just get so bored so fast nothing I've read really engages with me like most stuff now.  
 

People then say well what did you used to like to do. I think back and most stuff I only did because I was trying to find something I liked. I put on a smiling face whenever I did something with my friend because they enjoyed it and I wanted to stay friends so I just went along and pretended to like it. Fake it till you make it but I never made it I just keep faking it.  
 

I don't have any drive to do anything. I wander around stores just looking at stuff but it used to be retail therapy. I put myself into debt (medically and with retail therapy) but I'm currently working my way out but stuff usually keeps dragging me back in but I am slowly inching forward. I would love to get therapy but it is expensive where I live and I don't qualify for ""discounts"" that people do based on income since I make more than enough, I just have debt that takes away most my money and they don't factor that in. Also my insurance doesn't cover any of that.    
 

I try to force myself to eat healthy it lasts a few days (maybe) before I can't even force myself to do it. I can't even get myself to do laundry all the time. I'm always barely having things to wash. Sometimes I just want to buy new stuff just to not deal with washing clothes. Same with dishes I'd rather go out and buy new dishes rather than wash them.   
 

You just need to meditate... This is where I started to learn all kinds of things about me like I have aphantasia. I can not picture anything in my head. I don't have a ""mind's eye.""  
 

I also learned that people have a voice inside their head. I do remember being younger my mom always had to tell me to think before you speak. I never knew what she meant, I don't know what I'm going to say or type until it has been said or written.  
 

When people ask me a question that requires thinking my mind just goes blank and I stare.   
 

When people ask me what I'm thinking same thing its just blank and nothing comes out of my mouth. I try to explain that I'm sure my brain is doing something but I'm not aware at all. They're like ""Say anything you're thinking"" and my mind still just blanks until something comes out of my mouth. I have no idea if that's what I was actually thinking or if my brain went through a list and picked something way down it.  
 

You have to have a voice in your head when you read. Yeah I do its my own voice it doesn't change when different characters speak or anything.  
 

I think I'm just broken. People will tell me to ""man up"" and ""you just have to do it"" but that's all easier said than done. I just keep putting on the fake smile and attitude in order to make it through the day.   
 

People drain me of energy so fast as well. I have never been one to go out and do stuff. I get very tired very fast when out with people. I have someone at work who is always trying to get me to go out everyday but it just kills me and annoys me. I hate hearing my phone go off. I get too many texts and I just want to slam my phone into the ground. I miss the days when cell phones didn't exist.   
 

The only thing I keep going back to once in a while that I enjoy is the Korean. I just can't seem to get anywhere because I need something to study from that isn't a textbook that I enjoy and I have nothing. I have been able to force myself to post one new Korean Sign Language video a day for a long time. I do think I sort of enjoy video editing but most of that I have to deal with other people. I'm also slow because I'm not creative I just know steps to follow. I can't come up with something original. I also get picky because I've been trying to think of an opening for another sign language series thing but I don't like any of my ideas.  
 

I'm running out of steam... Thanks for reading my rant, its random and I'm happy to answer questions or anything. Online people don't drain me like texting or calling does. Maybe next time I post I'll talk about relationships or the bullying I went through or something like that since I didn't touch anything specific here... ",23Aug2018,2,

21,"Hi, I am schizophrenic and I was ""released"" from a severely mentally abusive relationship almost a year ago. My therapist informed me I was gaslighted, but I still struggle with the aftermath of having been a victim of gaslighting. It's already hard enough for me to decipher reality from symptoms of schizophrenia let alone reality from a seething guilt complex heightened by an abusive 3-year partner, and it's hard to decipher, as a schizophrenic who was gaslighted, what thoughts of mine have ""true intent."" This is very hard to explain for me.

A LITTLE backstory to my relationship to get the jist: I was not allowed to dress certain ways, I was severely depressed in this relationship to the point people noticed an abrupt change when I left it, I was constantly pressured into sexual acts I didnt like or want(i'm gay and this was a straight relationship. I never felt happy), many of the innocent things I did were made sexual either through my ex's perversion (him hugging me around people could turn into him subtle grazing my chest with his hand, or my favorite shirt could become an innuendo and I cant wear that shirt now.)or ex's anger(""Dont wear that because everyone who sees you in it will think sexually about you, and you dont want that do you? I'm the only person allowed to think that.""[heightened my paranoia of other people, too which was a reason i Isolated]). My ex was severely possessive to the point I didnt have any friends except for him for years. He was also passively cruel with his words, blame shifted, etc. I was called a crazy bitch when I tried to break up with him once, he intended upon picking at my quirks around people to remind me everyone thought I was weird. He put into my head that I was insane and that's why I would want to break up with him-not because he was terrible but because I was insane and possibly couldnt understand how amazing he was. I didnt want sex because I was insane and would eventually learn to be okay with it.  It was very unhappy.

There are many things that pile onto this terrible state caused by abuse and schizophrenia.

I feel like, by society's standards, I am insane: I hear voices, I see things that dont happen/arent there, I believe these deformed creatures from my literal nightmares want something from me. I've been put into a ward multiple times. I'm psychotic. I dont think like a normal person. By society's standards, I am insane, and also by his standards... I am insane. I cant help but think even though I was told by a professional I am a gaslighting victim that, no, I was the abuser. I was evil. I did everything wrong. I was bad to him. I did it because i'm insane not only by his standards and my insecurities, but by society's standards i'm insane. I'm the bad one, how can I trust myself.

Other than that^ I feel like it worsened by ability to trust my thoughts or decipher which thoughts are reliable. When you are gaslighted, you are tought not to trust yourself. I already had a hard time trusting my thoughts, so even when I get a grasp of rationale, i'm thrown into this pit: ""how can you even trust what you're thinking? You're just a bad person,"" kind of thing... When I try to judge if someone is treating me wrongly I think something along the lines of ""No, this is right. You're the bad person. You're always the bad person. Let them do this to you. Fix yourself. You can do it right. Fix yourself. You're coming off crazy again. Fix yourself and be right to them. You're evil, dont be evil."" It's hard for me to explain this right now and maybe i'll make a new post when i'm in a better mindset, but i'm still posting this.

Also... -there was something and I forgot.-
Ah,when it comes to attempts at other relationships and my inevitable failure, I have convinced myself i'm too bad for a relationship because i'm insane both by my only ex's standards and by society. It's because i'm bad in some way or that way. Because i'm wrong and a terrible person doing things wrong. I've come to this dreary, grim conclusion that I will die unloved because I could never be loved as A) someone with schizophrenia or B) someone who is so bad as a person, who does everything wrong in a relationship.

I had a hard time explaining all that I could but I feel like being gaslighted as someone with schizophrenia has a huge effect. I'm insane by the standards of many, which reinforces the idea perpetuated by a gaslighter. It is even HARDER to trust myself, and I lost a whole spectrum if things I thought I used to trust myself on. Lastly, my future in love is grim and sad because, not only am I schizophrenic (a word society and Hollywood love to make a monster), but I AM a monster, especially in relationships, by the standards of my ex. I could never be loved.

I guess i'm hoping for light or maybe some intelligent insight.

I could have explained this better another time and I may make a second post another day.

I’m suffering from emetophobia (the stupidest phobia ever. however, it’s ruining my life.) I’m suffering from panic attacks, stomach problems due to anxiety, obsessive compulsive behaviours (hand washing and sanitizing to the extreme) and finally just overall depressed.

What’s hurting me the most is how robbed I feel. -I can no longer leave my house.
-I had to go on leave from a job I love
-I’m unable to eat out or order takeout
-I miss family dinner after family dinner
-I can’t pet my cat without needing to hand wash 
-I have to sanitize everything constantly (my hands are cracked and bleeding from it all)
-I can barely even hug my partner for 2 going on 3 years for fear of “contamination”

Alongside this, I’ve developed an extreme anger and the shortest temper. This isn’t me. I’m not someone who ever gets mad! I’ve always been the most positive guy you’ll meet. 

An example is my cat has been increasingly bad/mischievous/noisy/destructive as of late (of course) and it causes such an insane amount of anger, I have to leave the room for fear of becoming violent. Over something so small.

Wtf is happening to me? I honestly wish everyday that I just don’t wake up because everyday mental illness robs me over and over and keeps stealing whatever joys I have left.

27,"hey everyone
so to start.. I have BPD and depression my partner is schizophrenic. A few months ago he ran away following his delusions, and after looking at his social media history he had been fueling them with things he saw online. I had never felt pain like when he left-- he left a note that seemed like a suicide note, and luckily we found him and got him to a hospital. those were some of the worst days i've had... i hadn't really known loss and pain like that. and now after that, hes been in residential treatment and in and out of hospitals... there are a lot of hospitalizations i think like 8 in a year i've been dating him. I love him a lot but I'm not sure I can take all of this anymore-- you see, he still looks up the same things that fuel his delusions. Like, I told him, hey you can't come home if you keep doing that because one, you're not gonna be safe and you can run away again and two because I can't take that pain. I just feel like he's chosen his delusions over me so many times. Not that its a conscious choice but he cannot do things for me that I need for my sanity. I want so badly to make it work but If I can't make a demand like that then .. I don't know. I'm hurting a lot..

Is it unfair to expect that from someone schizophrenic? .. Like... god I just can't go on worrying he's gonna run or something again!! Any insight would be helpful. Just typing this I'm pretty much near tears.",23Aug2018,2,
28,"TL:DR Troubled childhood and abuses, present circumstances still sucky plus mid-30's and single stress, daily depression + other physical health issues, applying for disability, also other family stressors, and friend events I'm not emotionally ready to attend.

Long rant ahead: Was raised in large mormon family, became ex-mormon in late 20's while facing identity &amp; existential crisis/ culture shock. Childhood consisted of: Routinely cleaning family home for hours as my stay-at-home Dad is a messy narcissist hoarder type. He's mellowed somewhat in later years, but I carry lots of resentment. I also had minimal socializing opportunities, very few friends, and was molested by older brother in youth for a few years.
My church and parents raised me to desperately seek marriage as my primary value and key to adulthood. Up to now I have not had a relationship last longer than 6 months, and I've never been intimate with anyone. Closest I've experienced to sex was when my brother would molest me. Church didn't help matters, as anything pertaining to sexual feelings/ acts is viewed as a sin second only to the act of murder. Not until therapy around 30 did I fully understand my victimization and abuse. In addition to mental health issues, around 30 I was also diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and dealing with eyesight complications, which required jumping through insurance hoops to prove medical need for coverage.

Currently 32, I am now the only remaining sibling still single, with majority of siblings younger than me. To rub salt in the wound, when my younger brother recently got a girlfriend, his ego became inflated and he immediately started looking down on anyone still unattached, even though up till now he was basically an incel. Financially I'm unable to move out anytime soon, and I'm in the process of applying for disability.

For a while now my sleeping patterns have been erratic, I've lost interest in all my hobbies and interests, and self care is a big struggle. I don't feel like I'm good enough or have anything to offer to anyone right now. I have no healthy socializing outlets ever since leaving Mormonism. I also don't own a car, making this even more difficult. 

I'm supposed to attend an old friend's bachelorette party this weekend, but I wish I could disappear in the background. I don't want to be asked how I'm doing. I'll do my best to put on a good front, but just not feeling it. Plus, I opened up to this friend a year ago about my depression, and felt like I was basically pushed away. Despite this I think she's still a good person overall, maybe just doesn't handle certain stressors well.

And my grandma is on hospice where we live and is now hallucinating on the daily. My mom just asked if I could consider helping grandma full time with her. I don't feel like I have anything left in me to give. I just want to sleep all day and forget my problems. I feel very alone.",23Aug2018,1,

Hi Everyone, 

I am extremely socially aware and politically correct as is my best friend and I made a comment complaining about a teacher at uni who was incredibly rude and bad their job and disregarded me when I asked for help with an assignment and she hasn't spoken to me in 2 days and sent me a message saying my comment was unnecessary followed by a passive-aggressive comment with a shrug emoji, it was also written very formally so I know she is mad at me because if she gets mad this is what happens she just cuts you out completely. 

We have been best friends for 8 years and have both experienced &amp; currently do experience trauma and mental health issues which we have helped each other through really tough times and I feel incredibly guilty that I might have offended her and made her mad at me and hate me.

All my other friends think the message I sent was fine and not offensive and that I'm not a horrible person but I feel cancerous and I can't stop crying and feeling so guilty I feel sick and can't concentrate on my studying and .I'm so anxious about this I didn't even consider the comment to be offensive and if it was it was 100% an accident and so I have sent her 2 messages apologising for profusely but she hasn't replied and I feel like this is going to mean she doesn't trust me anymore or hurt our relationship and I feel sick. 

I can't stop worrying about this and because I have an anxiety disorder it's even harder to stop I feel incredibly guilty and like a horrible person who deserves nothing ",23Aug2018,1,

33,"A lot of my thoughts are just foreign thoughts, or what I think that other people I know would think or tell me. Or like artificial personas that conglomerate of internalized feelings, thoughts and fears. On many topics I have multiple opinions simultaneously and it can be very hard or impossible to make a single decision. Often I just say what I believe I'm supposed to say or what I think expect me to say, even if I feel bad about it, but that's not always possible. Some topics, like mental health, are more complicated. Then I have like thousands of voices representing facts or opinions that I've heard, read or learned. They start yelling at each other and threaten each other and comment what I do. Now they're not actual voices, or impulsive thoughts, they're just my regular way of thinking.

Now the only thoughts and feelings that come from inside are of pathological nature, and the foreign thoughts, or actually my other thoughts, are making fun of them. It's how the people that I personally know would react to my feelings, with disgust and lack of understanding. That's how I feel too then. I try to act like a proper person. It doesn't matter what kind of person, just not this mess that I'm actually am. I don't even want to be the person I am. I hate all of those feelings. The biggest issue is that I can't make myself feel the way I'm supposed to feel. I laugh at myself because of how pathetic I am when I'm crying. It makes me feel sick and want to punish myself for being weak. It's digusting. It doesn't lead anywhere. Yet I feel horrible for thinking like that. I would never treat someone else like that. Maybe I actually would. This sucks.

My personality is really broken beyond repair. I'm not sure this is something pills could fix. Half of my issues are probably coping mechanisms for even worse issues. Therapy could probably drive me to insanity, because I totally don't want to face the mountains of suppressed emotions beneath the carpet.",23Aug2018,1,

I also felt an uncontrollable excitement as I tried to sleep, and had to take some sleep aid. And this morning when I woke I was angry at myself for telling the group, the world THAT. I was loudly upset at myself and berating at myself - as in speaking OUT LOUD. At myself. I don't understand why. I think it's because it sounded pathetic, and part of me don't want to be seen as pathetic. 

I can't see a therapist at the moment - no job, broke so that isn't an option, so reddit you are my last resort.

I just wonder why at times I am so torn internally like that, or why I am so sensitive about sharing personal issues or problems with others. Part of me is ok with sharing this - I want to, as my health problem isnt unique but often misdiagnosed. But part of me hates how dramatic it sounded.

39,"I’ve been off Paxil for about a year. 

I started February 2016 with 10mg for social anxiety. It was impossible for me to speak in my seminar-style college classes or in loud spaces like parties or on the subways in NYC and I was generally just very sensitive. I stayed on the Paxil for two years. 

Those two years were amazing. I felt cured immediately, although I’m sure the placebo effect had lots to do with it. I was super sleepy all the time and had to cancel one of my 9am classes because I could not wake up in time. 

It also became very difficult for me to orgasm, which I liked, because prior to Paxil I had suffered from premature ejaculation. 

My sex life and social life started flourishing. I felt limitless, or like how Rihanna is perceived.  I started to really feel in control of everything in my life. I still had some anxiety but it never felt like an issue. Even when I was homeless for 3 months while trying to save money because of an unexpected financial situation, I felt fine. 

I met my boyfriend toward the end of my Paxil journey and ended up quitting cold turkey because of him. He helped me realize I’d become a bit of a sociopath and had a hard time considering other people’s feelings. 

So I stopped in July 2017. Right before winter, which was a bad idea. Tons of negative thoughts came rolling in pretty quickly and I didn’t even realize. I started to loathe my job and coworkers, my body felt very sore (mostly my feet) and I cried a couple times as I tried to re-establish who I was and what my values are. I lost all my friends because I had no confidence or desire to be out in the world. 

Before Paxil I felt anxious and after Paxil I feel more depressed than I’ve ever felt. I’ve been feeling much better after a year, but it’s still extremely hard for me to get out of bed and do things. I barely work, so when I’m off I literally lay in bed all day or force myself to do laundry and cook with the help of coffee. 

I tried Wellbutrin briefly to see if that would help me get things done, be productive, exist as a healthy adult now rather than an impulsive, slightly manic kid on Paxil. 

It made my heart beat at a rate that made me uncomfortable, and I realized that coffee really was plenty of help for me, so I stopped the Wellbutrin after a week. 

I still find myself missing Paxil. I miss how it took me out of reality juuuust slightly enough where I felt comfy doing whatever I pleased. But now that I’ve matured, gotten a relationship, and refined my values to include things like mindfulness, I think going back on Paxil would be a step in the wrong direction, putting me in a worse place potentially. 

Any thoughts or advice? I’m wondering if taking Paxil through the lens of depression rather than anxiety will yield different results. Thanks",23Aug2018,3,

41,"Basically as the title read; I reckon I have undiagnosed ADHD, assuming I’ve had it most of my life.

Didn’t have the telltale signs of a, for lack of better term, ‘spastic’ child.  But up until recently, things have started making more sense as I see a lot of my youthful mannerisms in the kids I take care off in my job as a disability carer.

I don’t really know where to go from, anywhere. My local GP is probably pushing on 70+ and he’s not all that helpful when it comes to talks about mental health. Parents aren’t too into the idea of online counselling but it’s a better option than trying to find anyone out where I live on immediate notice. 

Anyone reckon they could give me a path to walk? Just somewhere to start cause I’ve really lost my own with this.

They claim they hate animal abusers, but when my man abuses animals, killed them, gets reported to animal control, Gets a felony gun charge, admittedly emotionally abuses me and physically harms me, they love him. It use to always scare me back into staying with him. Not anymore. 

 My father also is against pedophiles when they’re priests, but when it’s HIS OWN FRIENDS AND BROTHER IN LAW it’s ok for them to take advantage of his own daughters. He says, “It’s ok, because the ancient Greeks use to have sex with children. It was normal back then.”

48,"Next time you do the dishes, clean the house, or do the laundry (insert your worst nightmare here), I have a challenge for you.

Do that frustrating thing in the best way you possibly can.

If you’re working on the dishes, turn on some music, focus in, and make sure every single dish is as clean as can be.

Skip the dishwasher for this round.

Try and enjoy this process.

This will help you with fixing real life problems, because… Guess what?

**There are always going to be dirty dishes.**

That pile will be right there again tomorrow, with no sign of your previous efforts.

How maddening is that?

There will always be laundry and trash.

There will always be pain, hunger, financial issues, fights with family and friends, or what have you.

**So, do you just give up?**

It sure is an option.

You can contemplate the meaninglessness of your existence, and that gives you a pretty good excuse not to do the dishes.

But that comes with consequences, doesn’t it?

When you don’t work on solving your problems, your problems spread like weeds.

Gardens will always have weeds. It’s just your job to deal with them, so you can enjoy your garden.

If you want any chance at having a happy and healthy life, you can’t try and make the dishes go away forever.

That’s quite silly.

**The only sane thing to do is figure out how to enjoy doing the dishes.**

And that is very different from seeking the accomplishment you get from finishing the dishes.

There's an old story we can learn a lot from called the Myth of Sisyphus.

He was a man banished to hell, and his punishment was to roll a giant boulder up a hill.

As soon as he got close to the top, the boulder would roll all the way back down to the bottom, no matter how hard he pushed.

His only option was to try again, even knowing the eventual fate of his struggle against the boulder.

Unfortunately for the devil, Sisyphus found happiness.

He learned to love the struggle, to laugh at the absurdity of it.

**Our struggles are what give our lives meaning, what makes us stronger every day.**

Maybe he went crazy, and maybe we all have to be a little crazy, if we want any chance of enjoying this life.

So, go do the dishes. Then, go do the next thing.

Deal with your financial debt, start the most uncomfortable conversation in the world, or dig into the worst part of whatever your career makes you do.

Have a laugh at the ridiculousness of your situation.

Maybe next year, you’ll have a million dollars, the partner of your dreams, and complete inner peace.

**You’ll still have some version of “dishes” to take care of. Just breathe and get to it.**",23Aug2018,118,
49,"*Obviously, take what I write and the commenters with a grain of salt. YMMV. Psychiatric drugs interact with different people differently.*

I don't remember it clearly, but I think my first anti-psychotic was risperidone. It caused very sudden weight gain, and I had to switch to sertindole.

Sertindole only caused a failure to ejaculate and nothing else. I was on 12mg at first, but dropped it down to 4mg on my own. After that, I dropped down to 3.5mg and messed myself up. Lesson learned -- DON'T DO WHAT I DID. I'm currently thinking of getting back on sertindole 12mg or higher, but there are still two other drugs I tried.

The first one is ziprasidone. It caused insufferable akathisia (desire to walk), and I had to switch over to aripiprazole 10mg.

The 10mg aripiprazole worked beautifully, and I didn't have any side-effects until I had to increase my dosage to 15mg. Now I have increased anxiety, increased depression, and very slight (but still very discomforting) akathisia.

I'm trying to decide whether I should ask to be put back on sertindole or find another drug, hence this thread. I'm just very afraid of the QTc interval prolongation caused by sertindole and the possibility that my attempt at withdrawing from sertindole might've left me with a high chance of neuroleptic malignant syndrome happening or something else bad.

My boyfriend is amazing, I used to think he was something supernatural, like an angel, but nowadays I think (cause I've been doing a lot better lately) that he's an ordinary person just like me. 

But I hear these voices. They always are about the things I fear the most so I question them. Yesterday everything was well but then I heard/sensed a woman saying ""get rid of her"" to my boyfriend. I cried for hours. He's honestly very understanding. I love him so much. But lately the voices have been themed so that my boyfriend has another woman in his life, and I don't know what to believe, even though he is literally with me all the time so it's impossible.

But she always tried reaching out to me. Didn't delete her from Facebook. We started talking again sometime during my birthday. And it's been on and off since then. I know I don't love her anymore but it hurts to see her move on with her life. She's successful, Happy with her boyfriend and we're no longer best friends. Had to happen though, we're in two different countries and what not. But I don't know why it hurts so much. And I keep doing the ""let's nto talking"" dance and then cave a few months later. I can understand how shitty it is for her to tolerate my crap. The whole push and pull. I hate for putting her through this. I sometimes feel like I'm doing this to grab her attention cause I'm no longer a priority in her life. I guess I never was. She was in mine cause I loved her
 But that's besides the point...I just don't know what to do about this whole thing.
Actually talked to my psychologist about this and left her confused as well

In terms of my disease history, anxiety and depression cocktail. Constant anxiety with on and off depression. But strong depressive episodes. Medications I've tried, in order, lexapro, zoloft, pristiq
Zoloft worked the best so far. But it wasn't helping with depression that's why pristiq. But pristiq made me feel terrible all around. And then I stopped medication
I'm prescribed duloxetine but I'm scared to start because I've too much on my plate so as to deal with any negative implications/the medication not working. Plus I'm tired. Tired of trying.

I also got married later that year and had the same photographer (I wasn't paying and her pictures looked good so I just went with it).  I've actually been out with my sister and run into my wedding photographer and her sister (my former therapist).  


So lately I've been feeling pretty lost and filled with anxiety and possibly going down the path of depression again. Is it weird to go back to this therapist? I really liked her and I actually moved within the last year right near her office.   


Honestly, I'd prefer to not go to therapy at all, but I'm not sure what to do.",23Aug2018,3,
58,"I wanna talk more... People say, that if you have something in your mind bothering you, you should  talk about it. And i want to. Also, keep in mind, im still underage. Won't tell my exact age thought.

\*\*1. Gender.\*\*

i'm jealous of girls.. because they are biologically stronger, apparently.

in this website they talk about how women are the stronger sex. 

There was a another website too talking about it, im too lazy to find it. 

There is more..

Maybe about testicles? Well first off, no one has ever hurt mine, but i still get really angry when i see someone else getting hurt. Like, yea, thanks evolution, for putting them right outside my body. I know why, i don't want to go into more detail about this stuff, i hate to think or talk about it. It just triggers me,angers me..

And i don't want you to explain more about it. I just fking hate it. Hate them.  


People said that the ""system"" (what system? the system in united states? I live in europe, i dont care??) benefits males more than females. Why? Could it also be because of stupid men?  I also know how females were treated in the past like trash, thanks to males, which is really nice of men, isn't it? And still are.. in some countries like India. Oh, and some women problems are caused by males, huh?

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure this has affected my way of thinking, years ago.

My dad is an very quiet alcoholic, idiot (according to my mom) who disturbs her sometimes (somehow? through phone calls? im not sure) ,left her when i was born,to date with other women, who has never taught me anything, doesn't seem to really care that much about me, threatened to kill a close relative of mine. I do know, there is worse dads out there.

\*\*TL;DR.    So i.. really dont like to to be male. It feels embarrassing,shameful,awkward.. and bad. Because of a bad father image and jealousy of women, and here we are.\*\*

\*also i gotta make clear, im not a drug addict, no no no\*

\*\*Depression.\*\*

\*\*Ive had depression for years..\*\* it started in elementary school. One day, i noticed how i haven't done anything during the classes.

I felt like.. useless... bad. I thought how bad i am. Some other thoughts started coming to mind. ""I haven't done anything.. im so bad, ill never get a job. Ill just become poor. I should just die.""

&amp;#x200B;

I got bullied in third grade before, there was this one kid who did three things; ""stealing"" my friends, making fun of me, and insulting me. He left my school, however. But someone else stepped in and did those 3 things to me again.   
At some point i discovered an animated fan made series. I started imagining those characters in real life. I couldn't even sit down because i saw someone else sitting there. That's how strong my imagination was. And that REALLY bothered me. 

\*\*TL;DR    I spent time thinking about these fantasies, all i did was sit down, do nothing... i couldn't focus, i couldn't sleep. This put me into the situation in 6th grade. And these still bother me today.\*\*

I couldn't even do something as simple as take a glass of water, for example. Because i was imagining some people watching me, and it felt awkward to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So, i got lack of sleep, lack of exercise, my eating hasn't been that good, bad father image, depression, jealousy of women, ive been bullied, other stuff..\*\*

Just as the title says, I just feel like giving up on everything lately. I am being taken to court because my kids dad is trying to get half custody from me. It's possible he might get it too which terrifies me considering there is an abusive history between he and I. I was recently approved to move into an apartment and will move myself and my children out of my family's house that I have resided in for the last 8 years. This should be exciting news, but now I am stressing over money. I also now can not afford a lawyer for this court date, not to mention the mediation appointments that will cause me to miss work. My job is about to hire someone new, with less experience, and will be paid more than me. I feel trapped in this job now that I am about to move. To add insult to injury, I lost my grandmother a few days ago which used up my remaining PTO which I was saving for the upcoming court date.

​

I feel like this should be an exciting time for my family, but the odds are stacked so far against me and I do not feel like a strong parent right now that can overcome any and all obstacles. I feel like I am about to fail in so many ways and my kids won't see me as much. I am at work holding back tears and I just feel like giving up right now. Crying my eyes out. I feel like I am about to be defeated and am trying to regain the confidence I need for my kids but I am struggling...

​

TLDR: Odds are stacked against me ATM. An upcoming move, court date for half custody, lack of funds to fund both of them, recent death in the family, underpaid at work. I am feeling so defeated as a parent and as a human. I could absolutely use some words of advice....",23Aug2018,0,

How many inches of dick are you below the national average* [1, just to put that to bed]*?* How far back has your hairline pulled from your forehead? How dark are the circles under your eyes? How bad is your breath because you decided you needed to comfort-eat and had a soda for lunch and you've been belching like Dwarf for the last 3 hours? Just answer me those questions, then you can go talk to her. By the way, she totally knows you're angling to fuck her and she's disgusted. You disgust her and the fact that you want her disgusts her even more. How about you take this to it's logical conclusion and go fuck yourself while you cry about it? Asshole.""

I applied for an entry level job as a prep cook.  After years of debilitating trauma, My dads passing, my broken relationship, years of my illness sabotaging everything important in my life, I pushed myself through unbelievable levels of insecurity and I feel good about it.

&amp;#x200B;

 Ever since May this year I've been giving life my best effort. Properly. I'm not fighting to just stay a breathing husk of humanity, I'm fighting to be *happy*. I feel like I have an unreasonable amount of distress to go through. I shouldn't be suicidal every week but still going to training programs. My body should be sleeping properly after investing my day to proper eating, exercising, stress dis-tolerance and everything under the sun to fight my PTSD. *Not* being awake for three nights with only two hours of sleep and hallucinations. I shouldn't feel the complete loathing for myself till the sun rises and seeing only how I can fail for hours and hours every night. I shouldn't have to deal with my illness alone aside from doctors but it might be the only way. It's been 11 years since I got depression and so much feels hopeless. I feel like a toxic monster to everyone I care about. I feel like poison. I have let my sickness destroy me and my loved ones around me. I've sabotaged so many good things because I felt like situations wouldn't work out anyways. And then the people who loved me gave up on me.  


 Despite all this, how much i'm fighting right now just feels *right*.   


It's unfair what I have to do everyday just to feel a little bit of happiness but . . . I really want to live. It doesn't matter if i'm 25 and I never had a proper job, it doesn't matter how hopeless and suicidal I feel per week - I can't even count the amount of times I've wanted to off myself in the last two months - I'm fighting for my life. Pushing through the discomfort feels worth it.

I was on the two meds for 6 months and it's been six months off of them now. Is this well periods because the meds might fully be out of my body after not using them for six months? 

I say this because after taking Prozac when I was 16, something changed in my head. Some sort of barrier broke where I just didn't give a shit about much anymore.

I was recently voluntarily committed (US) for a short period, which was my first experience with the psychiatric system (had tried to get an appointment, but lead time was several months). I was placed on medication which, both during and after the commitment period, had some troubling side effects (extreme tiredness and mild auditory hallucinations). I, as directed in my discharge paperwork, called my healthcare provider's mental health service number to ask about an appointment to adjust my medication (they had implied that this could be done easily and on an outpatient basis). I was told to proceed immediately to the nearest emergency room, where I then spent 12 hours in the observation wing waiting to speak remotely with the assessment specialist from said service number (why couldn't I have done this from home?). 

After a 10 minute skype conversation in which I and my SO reiterated our concerns I was presented with 3 options: 1) voluntary commitment, 2) involuntary commitment, 3) have a volunteer talk me into option 1 or 2. I was explicitly told I would under no circumstances be allowed to leave the hospital, despite repeatedly affirming that I was not a risk to myself or to others. I was not given any specific protocol description of why I was being forced into commitment (even though I ended up going with the ""voluntary"" option I do not consider this to have been in any way my choice). I then had to wait another 11 hours for placement and transportation (the latter was literally two cops escorting me to another part of the hospital) and go through all the degrading procedures of admission *again.*

The thing which saved me most of the potential further pain was that I had brought a copy of my action plan with me - I had a specific list of things I recognize as behaviors of concern for myself, things I can do to manage or respond to those behaviors, specific names and phone numbers of individuals who can help keep me engaged as well as people who are aware of my mental health situation, and the names, locations, and dates for my next mental health appointments. I still had to spend the night inside (because the entry level gatekeepers were clearly following some kind of protocol which didn't allow for explanations), but I was able to get my meds adjusted earlier than my next appointment, so that's something.

Due to past things (gaslighting in particular) I get really freaked out when I notice someone isn't being entirely honest. But I do a lot of research about how to improve my mental health and have been coming across stuff about 'identity'; That true change comes by changing the stories that you tell about yourself.

A therapist might help someone reframe a bad memory into a more positive one or into something they can learn from instead of just feel bad about. And I understand that is a really good and useful thing. What I don't understand is making up a story to fit an event that just isn't true (but makes you feel/look good), editing the details of your past or making something up completely that didn't actually happen. 

I don't want to be miserable forever but I also don't want to be a fraud or inauthentic (that would make me feel awful and guilty!) I can't handle it when I notice someone is lying about their past because... that's lying and now I feel like I can't trust them. I have a friend who does it a lot and yeah, it seems to make her feel good because it makes her look super cool and her life story can be told like a novel but I know a lot of what she's saying is an 'edit' of an actual scenario because I've known her for years and was there when stuff happened (or didn't).

Is this really a normal and helpful thing to do?

 I’m not the best at grammar or expressing myself generally but I’ll do my best...so in the past two years I’ve had 2 family members pass away, my parents’ long time marriage end on Christmas Day, which ended in my dad walking out, this was also happening just before my A-level exams (I was 18 for any people who aren’t familiar with these) which contributed to me completely failing my exams and ending in me having to redo the year, this led to severe depression, anxiety and several suicide attempts...since all that life-stuff has blown over I’ve lost 2 relationships and I witnessed my dad have a heart attack (which I blame my new found hypochondria for). 
Anyway, background info out of the way...I’ve been noticing that my day-to-day moods vary quite a lot to where I can be completely hopeless and loathing in suicidal thoughts and ideations on Tuesday then Wednesday comes around and I can be almost hypomanic, this happens quite frequently almost every day has a different extreme and some days are quite mellow and less ranged.
 My question is aside from anxiety, could there be something I’m missing (mentally) that I’m not addressing or anything I should take into consideration? Thanks.

85,"I had stopped writing about my mental health, and I felt great about it. I just want to be done with all of this. Sadly enough, I don’t get to choose my struggles. Last year I decided to stop using tinder and just accept the fact that romantic relationships aren’t meant for me. It went great (all things considered) until recently, when I, foolishly enough, decided to give tinder another shot. Why not? Everything else in my life improves greatly. Maybe this is the start of my new life... maybe I should give tinder another shot. 

At first, it didn’t bother me. Then I realized that I don’t know what the heck I am doing. Barely anyone ever responds to, and it rarely happens that I get any matches, so it’s not as if I get a lot of shots at this. What am I supposed to say? What are we supposed to talk about? And, the biggest question of them all, how am I supposed to physically meet someone when I have no idea how any of this works?

Fast forward a bit (to make this post shorter)... yesterday I decided to conduct a social experiment. I created two fake tinder profiles: one female wearing a bikini, and one hot man with a rocking bod standing in front of a mirror. The response for both of them was more than I could have ever imagined... the female account has 99+ likes (but also a lot of men commenting on her body and asking if she wants to have sex). The male account presently has 10+ likes, but that was after a round of swipes from me. I had 25+ likes. What about my real account? 0+ likes... at all times. The most it has ever been is 3+. And that was a while ago.

So... my conclusion is this: I’m just not good looking enough. The picture is of me, smiling, trying to show my pearly (bleached several times because of my awesome self esteem) whites. No good... I asked my psychologist (I don’t have one anymore) once if there was anything wrong with the way I look. Her response? No. I then asked her why I can’t find anyone, and she said it’s probably because it’s difficult to get to know me. It did make me feel a little better, but this test kind of proves her wrong.

The entire time I am away at school I feel like I am holding my breath until I can return home. When I’m at home I feel like I can truly relax and feel at peace. 

Ever since I have moved back into my apartment I have been having panic attacks. I have this overwhelming urge to run away, wherever I can go to get out of here. I simultaneously feel like I just want to crawl in bed and sleep for days and days. It’s exhausting.

I have a few good friends and feel generally fulfilled by my major. There are activities that I enjoy doing (working out, going to the movies, cooking), but no matter what I seem to do I just can’t shake the nagging anxiety that sits in the back of my head telling me that I need to get home ASAP. 

Do you guys have any ideas of what I can do to conquer this? Like I said, I’m here for two more years, and while in the grand scheme of things that isn’t a very long amount of time, it seems insurmountable right now. I also feel completely and totally pathetic for being a 20 year old who is this homesick. Any thoughts would be very appreciated. ",23Aug2018,1,
