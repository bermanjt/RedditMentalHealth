I want time to freeze for me to feel relaxed and at peace but it’s constantly moving faster and faster and I feel like it’s going downhill, it’s not just I don’t want to make certain decisions, it also feels like times moving too quick and I’m not ready for anything and never will be, it’s just getting more negative, anyone  know why this is?

3,"Hello I’m new to posting to this sub. I’m a 21 year old senior in college (music major), and I’ve been grappling with depression for nine years. I’ve been on and off SSRI’s, and I’ve been taking celexa for over a month now as well as going to therapy for about 2. 

I got injured in my hand and wrist about four months ago, and I’ve been to doctors and going to physical therapy for months. Since the injury I haven’t been able to play, work, lift weights, and I’ve been in constant pain that doesn’t go away until I sleep. It seems that the depressive episode seems to correlate a lot with the timing of the injury, but it’s common for me to go through times like this in college. 

I’m also a former heroin user. I love opiates, and the feeling and relief I’ve found in them is heavily enticing at times like this. In truth I’m never more content than when I’m on an opiate. 

With that as a background, I want to get off my chest where I am right now (and where I’ve been for some time). 

I want to die. I’ve talked to friends, family, roommates, professors, doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, and crisis hotline operators. Suicidal thoughts and ideations have turned into real possibilities. I’ve heard that it gets better. I’ve heard that time, meds, therapy, human connections, and passions are the answer. They’re not helping. 

I can’t get out of bed. I can’t connect with people on a real level. I can barley hold a conversation anymore. I’m unable to play music, and I don’t have a day without pain. 

A crisis hotline operator once asked me how it would make the ones I cared about feel if I killed myself, but really that’s an awful way to shame a suicidal person into staying alive. I don’t want other people to hurt, but I’m tired of hurting and living a bleak life. 

I want to get back on dope. I want to drive far away where I won’t be found, and I want to fade away into oblivion. Why shouldn’t I?

&amp;#x200B;

I have few people I would regard as friends, and the ones I do are people I went to school with. I can't understand how people just make new friends, it seems so much more complex as an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

As a teenager, I would see other people in my school getting into relationships etc, and this is also something else that I can't seem to wrap my head around. I see total strangers meeting in bars and having long conversations like its nothing, and it totally blows me away. How is that possible? I walk down the street and people actively try to move away from me or just look at me with pity / disdain.

5,"Okay so, I'm not posting this on the Subreddit where the original post is because I don't want the person to see it and think I'm being hostile (I'm not...I'm just a little confused). Hopefully they aren't on this Subreddit as well, but if they are...I hope you can understand where I'm coming from. This is not an attack on you, it's simply me expressing my (probably irrational) feelings.

So I made a post about something that I needed advice about, and the person initially made a comment and I replied, giving a bit more information. The person then DMed giving me their thoughts and wishing me luck. I responded to the DM and said Thanks...I also offered to keep them updated about what was going on. They replied back with ""I don't know you, that wouldn't be appropriate. Good luck."". 

I guess my issue here is I don't understand, why DM me if you have no interest in conversation or being friends? The things that were said were things that could have been said in the comments. It's embarrassing to admit, but I am the tiniest bit hurt and disappointed, because it would've been nice to have someone to talk to. I guess it's the BPD in me talking, but it kind of makes me feel like crap because no one *ever* wants to talk. I don't know why I get my hopes up.

I'm pretty new to Reddit, so maybe there's some rhyme or reason about the DMing thing that I'm not aware of?

TL;DR: Someone DMed me then turned down further interaction. Not sure why they DMed me, and I'm confused and slightly hurt. Wondering if I missed something here.",29Dec2018,1

7,"Not to make this a long one hopefully. Backstory, i’ve had two members of my family drink themselves to death, one murdered through a drug addiction and one on the way out through the same.

I remember when i was seven years old and Uncle Darren came round asking for a beer. My dad went nuts and made him leave. My uncle was my idle, he was a professor and a well known scholar teaching in a British uni. Shortly after this, his addiction escalated. He became addicted to crack, meth etc

Eventually we got told he hung himself. A year after the acclaimed Suicide it came out he was lynched. 

It’s hard to deal with some times. I’ve not long gone to a specialist, who has hugely betrayed my trust, 

My best mate is quite literally my rock through no particular reason. We don’t speak about specific events, i don’t cry on the phone to him. He just talks to me like a human. 

So if anyone needs a person to speak to by all means hit me up. Dan (the bezza) has stopped me doing silly things just by saying hi sometimes, if i can be someones Dan then i’m here.

12,"So to make a long story short, I've been hesitant for a lot of different reasons to try and medicate my depression, and about a week and a half ago I gave in and started taking the Effexor (venlafaxine) my psychiatrist prescribed me. This stuff fucked me up way more than I was ready for. I couldn't sleep, I kept waking up at 1 or 2 am wide awake and unable to fall back asleep. The sleep loss compounded and my mind became steadily more fuzzy all week. Then the manic states. I was told these are rare and mild, but for 8 hours daily I felt like I was on a coke come down. Not even exaggerating, I constantly felt my muscles half tensing, that crappy stomach feeling, feeling like I was gonna puke only to burp instead. Combine that with a sluggish brain and I got written up twice, and then pulled into my bosses office to get yelled at for why I suddenly suck at my job. I couldn't tell him what I was doing because I felt like he'd fire me for it, which he almost did anyways. I stopped taking it, and now I feel like my normal, depressed self again. What the hell? How am I supposed to medicate this if the medication is worse than the depression? Even if it settles down after a while, how am I supposed to get through that period? It all just feels like the final answer is that I'm never going to be happy, and now idk what to do next",29Dec2018,1
13,"Hey so I (15M) kinda need some help to deal with this issue I've been recently having. As you already saw by the title of this post, I've been having some intrusive thoughts about harming/killing my dad and step-mom. They're not bad people by any stretch of the imagination and in fact they're very supportive of me. It's just that over the last few months what they say and what they do get under my skin. My dad is a lil bigoted and racist and my step-mom always voices even the most trivial of things that bother her. Sometimes my mood can change pretty rapidly when I'm with them. For example, I could happily go out shopping with my dad but over the course of a few minutes I can feel really annoyed being with him.

Most of the thoughts I have about hurting them consist of savagely stabbing them with a kitchen knife while they were watching TV. Anytime I get flustered or annoyed about anything, my mind always seems to drift to this for some reason. When these thoughts to creep in my head, my entire body shakes in anger for a few seconds as the violent thoughts flood my mind. 

I don't wanna hurt my family but these thoughts always show up while I'm frustrated or angry, so maybe thats saying something else?

I do have a therapist but I'm really nervous about telling him this. I see him in about a week or two and the wait is killing me so I'd appreciate if you guys could help me or tell me what's going on with me. 

Thank you!

14,"I’m a law student. I struggled with depression and anxiety back in college. Immediately after college, I started las school. Both my college and law school were Ivy League. I mention this because lately (as in for the past two years), it’s been a constant struggle to convince myself to do work. I dread being in front of the computer. Anytime I have down time between classes, on holiday, or during the week, I spiral into negative thoughts or worries about the future. I have a therapist. I know I’m anxious. I just want to know if it’s normal to hate working (in any form) like I do now. I used to love writing, reading, staying on top of things. Now I can’t do any of that without fighting a mental hurdle. I barely turn in assignments. I browse the Internet / YouTube about self help articles and avoid assignments. I don’t take joy in work like I used to. I have friends and family. But I just feel so lazy all the time!! I’m worried this will affect me when I start working after school. I have a lot of goals (of course), but I just can’t bring myself to look at a computer screen and write anymore. What gives? 

My therapist says it’s normal to be bored with school after being there this long. I just worry that it’s something more. So Is this just burnout? If so, how do I overcome it?

15,"Every time my parents try to teach me to do something, I mess up, I can’t remember. They’ve been working hard for my whole life to try and get me to have a better memory, to try to get me to listen, to try to get me to be less of a disappointment. Why can’t I change? Why can’t I learn? They’ve said they’ve given up on me. I know I deserve it. They take away my chores and I feel so shitty about it because they have to do everything that I keep forgetting to do. I’ve asked for second chances and they’ve given me them multiple times but every single time I fuck it all up. They’ve hit their breaking point. They aren’t giving me second chances anymore. They’ve given me incentives, for example, if I remember to do my responsibilities, learn to take initiative, they’d let me get my other ear pierced, let me get my drivers license in 2 years when I’m old enough, let me go out with my friends more, but even that won’t drive my stubborn, selfish ass to be less of a disappointment. They’ve said everything I do ends in disappointment and they’re no longer taking this shit from me. I don’t think what they’re doing is wrong, they aren’t bad people, which makes me feel worse. Sometimes I can’t bring myself to apologize to them. I don’t know why. The words just don’t come out of my mouth, or I just simply can’t bring myself to go to them and look them in the eye. I’m a coward. I can’t stop thinking about how much I want to end my life. I won’t do it though, don’t worry. Every time I disappoint someone like this I can’t help myself from fucking punching myself in the face. That’s so fucked up and I shouldn’t be doing it but I can’t help myself. I’m sorry, this has turned into more of a rant but my question is: how do I fix myself? What’s stopping me from doing the shit I’m supposed to do? Why am I being so selfish??? Am I a narcissist? Am I just lazy? Is there some kind of mental illness that makes you fucking stupid? I’m sorry for this giant, probably grammatically incorrect paragraph.

17,"Hello. I’m not sure how to start this off, besides saying that I’ve had almost a lifelong problem with mental health, and since I won’t be able to really access mental health help until I’m an adult. I’m writing this down here because I, along with my friends, have been getting increasingly worried about a few things in particular. For clarification, I have abusive parents, and I’ve been abused by religious means and by friends. I am a minor (15). Long post warning.

Like I said, I’ve never been diagnosed, but since I have spent years trying to help myself, I’ve realized a few things. I show almost every symptom of CPTSD. I can’t diagnose myself, so I won’t say I have it. I show a lot of signs of depression, or some sort of personality disorder. I’m very unstable, but I do admit I’ve also disconnected a lot, so I don’t know how bad it actually is yet. I’ve had plenty of discussions with my best friends about service animals, but it’s way too soon to say with definition.

I also have a hard time getting a grip on reality, if that makes sense. I daydream a lot, and a lot of times I slip into them when I’m stressed or bored. I create people in my head that I am more attached to than to people in reality. When I leave the daydreams, I get incredibly distressed. I’m upset that they aren’t real, I’m upset that nothing I think of is true, and I’m stressed because it takes away time and makes me guilty for not liking my friends as much as I love the characters in my head. I don’t like real life, and that’s what’s been concerning my friends the most. I am always bored when I’m not online, and most of time even then I have a hard time being entertained. At my best it’s me saying that I wish things were more like fantasy or sci fi. At my worst, it’s either me wanting to die, or wanting to make life “not boring” by doing something horrific. The latter is a lot more of me having intrusive thoughts that get spurred on by my stressful life, but it gets to points where I have to have my friends convince me not to do something I’ll most definitely regret when I’m very close to snapping. A lot of the regrets are violent idealization of harming the people who have wronged me, and about 99% of that is aimed at my parents. I know not to do it, but there’s time where I sit down and genuinely believe it would be better if I went through with these things. There’s been two times where I legitimately believed I was going to hurt my parents, and that I should, as it’s the ‘right thing to do’. 

I have breakdowns a lot, I’m a very scared kid. I flinch when people set things down next to me, when a voice is raised or when somebody even waves in my direction. I’m slowly going mute, and I’ve resorted to having a school acquaintance teach me ASL. (So for all I’ve learned is swear words, my favorite is Motherfucker) I have paranoia beyond what would be considered normal, I even get convinced my friends are out to hurt me, when I ‘know’ they wouldn’t. I’m very dependent on my friends, to the point where it’s damaging when I can’t speak to them. 

All in all, Trauma has royally, royally fucked me over. I want advice, if available. I want help, if possible. I’m a Californian. And for peace of mind, I am arranging plans with friends and I’ve had dozens of people confirm to me that what I went through was abuse, and that I have enough to get my parents in trouble.

I continued home only to realize that hours had passed since biology class and I didn't remember any of it.  People would tell me about really bizarre things that I'd done that I didn't remember doing.  My school counselor once told me that she came into her office one afternoon to find me hiding under her desk in the dark.  No memory of that at all.  I took up sculpting but would blank out within minutes of starting and come to hours later.  Alot of work would be done without my remembering doing it.

22,"This is aimed at those that have, and I hate to say it, the common ""possessor"" of problems in relationships. If anyone here has been in her boots, could you please give any insight that might make sense of why she did what she did? Not being able to understand what happened (in her mind, but she never could tell me) is making this breakup so hard to move on from, even though the last thing I want to do is give up on us.


Nobody's perfect, but the girl I spend a year and a half with, the one I thought I'd marry and raise children with (She told me she wanted that too) and I broke up just under two months ago, but it didn't officially set in until a month ago. The break up left me mentally broken, but as far as she's let on lately, she's doing just fine without me. I know most people say this, but I really don't think I'm going to meet anyone like her again, at least not until I'm out of my current town (here for college). But enough about me.

She admitted to me this has been a problem in all of her relationships, and blames herself even though I've tried to help her, tell her I'm not perfect either, etc. Her insecurities coupled with communication issues and (post break up, lack of ability to handle criticisms) have inflated very normal issues that most couples have. I never tried to make concerns confrontational, but inquisitive, to try to understand her and be there for her the best I can. She however takes them as confrontations and attacks, and almost entirely shuts down. If we're on the phone she will hang up, and tell me she'll talk to me tomorrow. In person she will just stop talking, stare off and almost not be ""there"" for small periods of time unless I'm constantly trying to talk to her. I don't think it's anger, she said she gets so mentally fogged up when she's upset that it's no longer productive for her to continue that conversation. We've agreed it's not healthy, and when our relationship started taking a real spiral, I begged her to go to therapy. I said I would even go with her if she wanted to. It's free on our campus so there wasn't any practical reason (like cost) not to go.

She never had a lot of ""good"" friends growing up. I found out she was jealous of me for having a very tightly knit friend group from high school. It made her deeply sad she had nothing like what I had, and admitted it was stupid to be upset about, but couldn't help it. Her older sister was the best thing she had in terms of family as her ex-methead mother cheated on her father, divorced him, then married the guy that she cheated on him with. That guy became my ex's stepfather for the last six years of her living at that house. She has a lot of resentment towards her mother (I don't blame her.) and hates any implication that she is like her mom in terms of personality or habits. She was abused at a young age by a family member and claimed up until meeting me, she never had a healthy relationship with sex. As we grew closer she opened me up to these problems, and I felt I had done as much as any boyfriend could to help her/reassure her she was worth being loved.


We broke up on the note that she wanted to take a break from any romance/relationship to seek help for her mental health. I felt that we were at a good point of understanding, and would revisit the idea of being together again after however long she needed to heal. At this point I felt she was still in love with me, as she was crying. She faulted herself for the end of our relationship, said she shouldn't have jumped into us so soon after her last relationship (We both just got out of a relationship when we started dating, were friends for a year before that) I was putting no pressure on her, and found it best we kept contact to a minimum, as she said that keeping in contact would be too difficult emotionally. It tore me up inside, but while I have never suffered from mental health issues, I was just glad she was finally considering therapy. I wanted her to be happy.

We kept very minimum contact. She said she missed me, and broke down in class crying a couple days after. Then after three weeks, I asked her how she was. She told me she realized she only loved the idealized version of me, and not really me. That I'm ""a very cold person"" because I didn't cuddle her enough, and she felt she couldn't touch/cuddle me when I slept due to me being a light sleeper. That on our one day a week we'd hang out, for 8 hours, we wouldn't be regularly ""next"" to each other. We'd be in the same room, but she wanted us in the same spot, even though we were maybe 5 feet apart at most, doing our own things separately but together. Still talking, still physically engaging and laughing and loving, but I guess that wasn't enough for her. She told me her life has gone unchanged since the breakup, since she realized this, and says we wouldn't have worked out anyways.

When she told me this, I was in a complete state of shock. The woman who I've cooked for, took care of when she was down, danced with in my kitchen to french love songs, and many other gestures of love, just told me that we wouldn't work out, because of issues she had never brought up before. It felt like part of me died inside. She just came at me with these things.

I waited a month, let my thoughts build up, and sent her a message. I rejected her idea of how this relationship fell apart (Me not being affectionate enough) and in a shortened version told her how I felt we fell apart. That her insecurities inflated very reasonable issues, but not coming to me and deciding to pull away from us the last two months of the relationship was not the right way to handle it, even after many times me asking her if everything way okay. That I always tried reassuring her she was worth being loved, and that she was my partner through and through. That I don't blame her for her deeply seeded insecurities but how she decided to handle them even after admitting multiple times how unhealthy it was. I felt that I needed to set that record straight, because I didn't like that her idea of how we ended was all on me. I realized later by her reaction, and that I sent my opinions to someone who can't handle criticisms at all and is already struggling with her mental health, that I made a huge mistake. One I deeply regret. I felt it would have been a wake up call to the person I deeply care about, but I didn't consider that her being in the state she is, that she would only see it as a personal attack on her. She told me she no longer wanted to speak to me.

We're not longer on speaking terms. I tried to reach out a second time and apologize. She left it as read.",29Dec2018,1
23,"Current gf and I have been together for 1 year and she's the absolute best thing to ever happen to me. The day we matched on Bumble I told her she was special, she was the only one I was talking to/interested in, and if she wanted to meet up, I was totally on board and would drop what I'm doing to meet her in a heartbeat. I was absolutely mesmerized by this angel and I let her know it from Day 1. We met and it was magical. Since that day, every weekend, I drive 2 hours there and 2 hours back to see her and get a hotel to be with her (we're long distance) and hope to propose within the year. She's worth it all this and way more.  


Fast forward, we've been dating for a year and it is so much happier and healthier than any of my prior relationships (the few I've been in). A month ago, I  applied for a job out closer to her and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we were stoked about, we've been checking my emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point she  googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email I  sent to an ex (girl he dated right my current gf) the day right after we matched on Bumble. The message read: ""I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.""   


My gf was devastated and said this changed her perception of all our  foundation and she didn't know how to handle it. She explained she was confused and didn't know how I could say from Day 1 I wanted her and only her, meanwhile in the background saying all these emotional things to my ex. She said she believes herself to be the backup plan, and that I'm with her only because I couldn't convince my ex to work things out.   


Before I get to my reply, I should give some background:  
*I was married before to my first real gf. After some time, we discovered she had Lyme disease and I dedicated my life to healing her - went to nursing school for it and everything. We divorced when I discovered I was being cheated on. We did not have intercourse once through the marriage (though we had before) so to discover the minute she was ""in the mood"" was for her mom's pool boy killed me. I gained over 100 lbs due to stress. We divorce, I move, I get back on my feet again and lose the weight, and some time later start dating someone for a couple months, then poof - girl 2 disappears. Some background from that relationship:*   


*Girl 2 wanted to marry and for me to move in with her and her 3 kids right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week). I thought this was a little forward, but considering what a fail my prior marriage was and desperation to feel loved and wanted, I figured this must be how a ""good relationship"" is. So I get a job lined up (we were over an hourish drive apart so I relocated)  and slowly start moving my stuff in.* 

*The week before I move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over the pettiest things. The day I'm due to move in, she starts saying we should see less of each other, maybe every other weekend. So with me due to move in, I start questioning what's changed? She then breaks things off altogether. I kept contacting her asking what happened? How'd this go from 100 to zero suddenly overnight? I then get a call from a detective from the police dept telling me she has requested I no longer contact her and if I do,, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her.*   
*I speculate she was on a ""break"" with the previous guy she was in the process of 'moving out'  (who never knew her dating me - she hid it saying I was just a coworker and never introduced us, saying she wanted to keep the peace), re-made up with him, and wanted to avoid the confrontation of having to explain/be the bad guy.*   


So I explained to my current gf, ""At the time of this breakup with Girl 2, I was insanely desperate to learn what happened - how did my second relationship in a row fail? What was wrong with me? Where did I go wrong? I MUST do what I can to figure this out.""  


My gf said ""Why not ask that instead of telling her you love her then?""   
I said, ""Remember? I tried that already and she had the cops call me. If I did that again she'd have me arrested."" I explained maybe if I sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe that would prompt her to reply SOMEthing that would clue in on why she ended things (met someone else, I wasn't fit/rich/etc enough, etc.).  


My gf is still having a hard time grasping all this and I'm wondering if anyone has any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice? I love her more than anything and want to being her clarity so we can move forward.

24,"Two days ago, I woke up in the middle of night to voices in my head. When I was younger, about 3, this would happen frequently except it wasn’t voices, it would be loud banging and every time I moved the noise would get louder and more terrifying. I have major depressive disorder and anxiety. I’ve never spoken to a doctor about the sounds I can only hear. I also haven’t been taking my antidepressants medication.

These past three months have been so hard for me, I had to take a leave of absence from school for me to work on my mental health when in reality, all I did was stay at home and sleep all day.

It’s hard to talk to people, even friends or family about these types of things without sounding like I’m losing my head. I tried to talk about this with my mom multiple times and she either changes the subject or ignores me.",29Dec2018,1

Anyone else experience this? Any thoughts or suggestions?",29Dec2018,1
26,"This is a legitimate question that I’ve been wanting to have an intelligent discussion about for a while now.
As someone who began cutting around age 12 as a coping mechanism for depressive thoughts and feelings, I laid down pathways in my brain that make cutting my first instinct (even today, at 30yrs old) when I feel overwhelming negative emotions—especially during major depressive episodes.
I’ve always cut the top and outside of my right thigh. There have been periods where I’ve gone many years between cuts.
I’ve been in intensive therapy. My degree is in psychology. I still have not found a satisfying answer to this question: if I’m not hurting anyone else, not making life-threatening cuts, and it works to effectively release/diffuse intensely negative emotions, why is it something I should stop doing?",29Dec2018,1
27,"My mother has always wanted me to go to a pretentious university and was very upset when I decided to go to a ""non target"" school. She's pressuring me to transfer to a name school, but she's emphasizing how she wants it to be my choice. I don't  want to transfer. She will be  furious if I dont. She said that even if I try to transfer, the only way I'll get rejected is if I don't wish for the transfer to happen. 

She was lecturing me about how I'm ""not normal"" and how I'm better than everyone else. She wants me to be a CEO at 30 that makes a couple mil a year (her brothers gf). She has never been happy with my marks (80s) and has always said how I have the potential but I just never try. She tried to control my friends and wants me to only make friends with people who are ""at my level or above"".Her values don't match up to mine at all. She's super anti LGBTQ (I'm straight but an ally), anti mental illness (believes it's a gross contagious illness), and puts marks and ranking above everything. I feel suffocated every time I'm around her but she has no friends or husband and stresses ""family time"". As she was lecturing me today, I started ""cutting"" myself with a sharp tool. It only broke skin and no blood but I feel myself sinking. It distracted me from her words and the implication that she was disappointed in me 

My dilemma is, what do I do with my mental state? I'll try to transfer (but I'm 99% sure I won't get in). I don't want to talk with my mom about it, because she will definitely not change and is only wording it to sound like it's all my choice. 

I've considered therapy. I've had slight ""abuse"" from my dad that my mom brushes off and commitment issues due  to my dad's cheating  and divorce. I've considered therapy but my friends said that therapy is useless and for the weak (quote). I guess I just wanted to rant. It could be worse.

29,"Hey guys. I depressed and on medication, probably a bit obsessive compulsive as well. I seem to keep downloading anime wallpapers for my phone and change them constantly. Sometimes I'll even spend hours cropping or touching up an image, and when I apply it I don't get satisfied and sometimes revert to my old wallpaper. 

It sometimes gets to the point where I'm like having dinner with someone and keep glancing at my phone to set a good wallpaper. When I finally get it right, I feel incredibly satisfied and excited, but I'll usually change it again within 3 days. 

I'm sleepless on some nights trying to download wallpapers and images, and even though I have over 10000 wallpaper images I'm still not satisfied. 

I also have a problem with using wallpapers that I used to like but are pretty old. I keep getting a rush with newer downloads. Almost like i find it adds value to my phone. When I make an expensive purchase. I download images to somehow convince my mind it's paying off for the item. 

The other thing I realized is that I only can tolerate anime wallpapers with female characters full frontal and centered. If the character's head is  not centered it upsets me. I'm also not happy if there is a lack of digital information on the screen. For example like too much sky to the left of the character or something. The images have to be anime or art like, and I generally can't use wallpapers of real people. 

The female characters I download usually have to wear pants or tights or body suits. I don't like anime girls in underwear or swim suits. The background has to have digital information like a background, and black or white backgrounds drive me mad. I also realize that I touch the wallpaper on my phone and assure myself ""it's a quality wallpaper. You did good."" I know this is kind of weird... 

I'm on Lexapro and lithium. And I take Xanax for anxiety. My doctor thinks that this is just a little bit of a compulsive disorder and hasn't recommended any other therapy. This is beginning to bug me badly though. By the way I'm also the kind of guy that keeps all my icons organized and sorted, but I'm not too obsessive in life though I do arrange things. 

Does anyone have any idea what's wrong with me? Is there any medication that could help or just help me calm down a little and just stick to one wallpaper for longer than a week? 

It's the first time I'm opening up about my wallpaper addiction. Apart from this I'm actually very functional in real life and tend to be very social. Sometimes people think I'm too hyper and sometimes I take Xanax to calm myself if I get too anxious. I also play in a band, and am generally normal during performances and stuff. Thanks for listening. Thinking about it I know it's weird but sometimes it goes beyond an urge. Like wallpaper is life...

30,"So recently, I had to get a new doctor. I never had any luck with my therapists until my current one, who I had to stop seeing for a year because she transferred to a new hospital that required I have my primary care doctor be through their hospital. So I switched away from the doctor I had my entire life just to be with my therapist again. Here's the thing about this new hospital, though: they're cure-oriented. They have no interest on keeping people on medication their entire lives for things they don't need, they would rather you be healthy than make money off of you.

&amp;#x200B;

Their mental health care is especially progressive. You see, in recent years especially, scientists and doctors have started to be more open about how anti-depressants and mood stabilizers permanently mess with your chemical balance. They will do everything in their power to keep you off of narcotics, opiates, and other heavy, highly addictive prescriptions, ie Xanax and Prozac in terms of what we're dealing with here. They've also started to realize to most depressive issues in patients are either caused by and/or worsened by hypothyroidism. Long word, I know, and it sounds really scary, but it's not as bad as it sounds. See, hypothyroidism is a lack of hormones called triiodothyronine and thyroxine, and is caused by autoimmune disease, radiation treatments, certain medications, and by being passed down genetically. It causes depression and depression'like symptoms, like lethargy, muscle weakness and pains, impaired memory, thinning hair, menstrual cycle disruptions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

As a real life example, before I very recently started seeing my therapist again, I was at such a low point in my life that for the first time in years, I honest to god wanted to kill myself. Last time I was so low, I was in a sexually and emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship with a drug addict and completely unmedicated. I was chemically addicted to the adrenaline created by cutting myself, my parents were constantly fighting, I was bullied, dealing with repressed memories resurfacing in grotesque night terrors (and unwilling to admit any truths about them or tell anyone about them, therefore meaning I was trapped with half-remembered, repressed trauma memories by myself). Just a few months ago, despite having a relatively happy life in terms of its current state, things just crashed inside my head, and I was back to the same place I had been when I'd been passing out from blood loss and overdosing on pain meds (and just so no one worries, I've been clean of cutting since July 18th, 2015, I haven't broken yet and I don't ever plan on going back to that). So my boyfriend got me some appointments scheduled so that I could finally go back to the only therapist that's actually been able to handle me for longer than three months, let alone help me.

&amp;#x200B;

And on the very first appointment my new doctor did a blood draw to test my thyroid levels. They came back so low that I now have to get an ultrasound done on my neck to check the gland, to see if I can get by with medication or need an actual surgery. I have hypothyroidism. I've probably had it for years. And it's really common, a lot more common than people think, and a lot more common than how often it's actually tested for suggests. I've been talking to people all over the United States about it, and I have yet to see someone that doesn't go to my same hospital that it was actually tested for before putting them on a ton of mood meds. Seriously, **get tested.** For the first time in my life, I have hope. Sure, I might have to get surgery, but my BPD, PTSD, and Manic Depressive Disorder will be so much easier to treat once that gets figured out. My old doctor had me on 200mg of Zoloft and was about to switch me to Xanax, despite having a long family history of drug abuse. Now I might be able to go down to a not literally overdosing dosage of anti-depressants (max dose for Zoloft is 150 and I only weighed 100 pounds when I was on 200).

33,"I can't remember ever feeling particularly happy, and though I have a lot things in life that others may not (financial security, a reasonably supportive family) there have also been reasons for me to be unhappy. When I was 7 years old, my father committed suicide (my mother would later tell me he had untreated bipolar disorder). That event sticks out in my mind as the event that caused my own mental health issues to begin. My mother remarried shortly after. I didn't get along particularly well with my stepfather at first, but we're on good terms now. I can't recall many particular experiences from my adolesence, but what sticks out to me the most are feelings of alienation, frustration, and depression. I was often bullied throughout my childhood and adolesence, and I've had very few people I truly considered close friends throughout my life. There are still faintly visible self-harm scars on my forearms from when I was in middle school, and after particularly bad days, generally in the wake of incidents involving humiliation by my peers, I would often fantasize about committing suicide or bringing my father's shotgun to school the next day and exacting revenge on the person/people that had humiliated and rejected me throughout my life, but the knowledge of the lasting consequences of my actions and the thought of how it would make my family (my mother in particular) feel has always been enough to stop me. I'm 20 years old and in college now. I still have no friends (and has never been in a romantic relationship), but I'm in a better place mentally than I was in the past. I also have decent grades, am involved in extra curriculars, and managed to find an internship opportunity in my chosen field. However, I still feel that I'm not truly happy, and am missing out on a lot of what life has to offer, namely when it comes to interacting with others. Despite being in a better place overall, I do occasionally have bad moments, and when I do, I can see a precipice far in the distance past which thoughts like the kind from my adolesence would become action. I can feel that if I was ever truly ""pushed off of the edge"" to a point where I had no hope remaining, I would likely have it in me to act on whatever my mind may be telling me at the time. I think that in order to move forward in life, I will need to seek psychiatric help at some point, but at the moment, the process of getting started is intimidating to me, and I also likely don't have the financial means to afford it.

Long story short is that I texted her during the night cause I was bored and we talked for a while and then talked through the private stories on instagram. She started to send revealing pictures and it just made me uncomfortable. That's when I told her I texted her as a bet from my cousin (stupidest thing to do I know) and I deeply regret it because I think it saddened her.

35,On top of the anxiety and depression that I have been dealing with - I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. I am just completely utterly overwhelmed - just by going into the google blackhole of trying to educate myself more on what it means to be borderline personality disorder.

I have struggled with accepting what is culturally appropraite and what is abuse - and I cant stop ruminating about it. I know at the end of the day it was trauma. It was abuse. I just dont want to sit with it - I dont want to be with it. I dont want to take care of it. I dont want to procses it. I dont want to deal with all the emotions that come up.

36,"I talk about it in depth [here](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/how-to-stop-anxiety-in-its-tracks-68eabc189ce0), but the TLDR is that I have found that by focusing on the sensations coming in from my senses, I am able to reduce the severity and duration of panic attacks (and anxiety in general).  


The process basically involves talking slow and deep breaths (great on its own), whilst asking the question ""What can I see (touch, taste, smell, hear) right now"" and then focusing on the results.

37,"I want to start this out by saying I was diagnosed with C-PTSD, social anxiety, and depression . 

Most of my life, I would have these ""Instrusive thoughts"" .. they we're always kinda all over the place. Some would cause me extreme disgust, while others would cause me crippilizing fear. I'm too disgusted with some of the thoughts/images id get to ever tell my doctor, or really anyone at all because id be afraid that they'd see me as a disgusting person, when I know for sure that I'm NOT like that. 

It use to be all disgusting things, it still kinda is, but within the last 2 years, my thoughts shifted. The images became about things like the end of the world, and me getting brutally murdered, being spied on by the government, religious shit...etc.

I could be with some friends, and my friend could pick up an axe to chop some wood, and id get these very graphic images pop into my head that he would just swing the axe at my head. Id almost imagine the feeling of it, and I could see it happen infront of my eyes. Same thing with the end of the world.. I see death around me all the time, and even myself burning in hell. (I'm not religious, either.) I have no control over it.

The thoughts have made me physically sick. For months I couldn't be left alone, it was basically a 24/7 Anxiety attack with an over whelming feeling of doom.. for roughly a year. 

I stopped trusting everything. My reality, the Government, the doctors, medications.. believing I was being drugged and brainwashed.. (as I said, it's all over the place)

40,"First, a little backstory: I have a 4 year old daughter who is in a closed adoption. I got pregnant at 19, I was young and dumb and didn't use protection. I'm also not 100% sure who the father is because I was sleeping around a bit at the time. I didn't find out until I was 14 weeks so abortion was out of the question. Basically I struggled through the pregnancy and ended up inpatient a couple times because bipolar/BPD and hormones don't mix well. Nonetheless, I had plans to get my life together and raise my daughter. Fast forward to a few days after she's born via c-section. I developed an infection and got sick to the point where I couldn't get out of bed, which means I was unintentionally neglecting my child. My roommate decides to call CPS on me instead of taking care of the baby and sending me to the hospital. They took my daughter because she was ""at risk"" based on the current situation and my previous mental health struggles. I tried getting her back, but due to some stuff that happened (mainly me moving and struggling with transportation), I eventually decided to sign my rights over, and she was adopted by her foster family.

Now despite me believing I made the right decision and making peace with it, the situation did kind of traumatize me and make me question having kids in the future. I love kids, and I'm great with them. I did babysitting for a while in high school. I've always wanted kids of my own once I'm able to be more stable, but now I'm not so sure. Part of me is afraid that I'll end up neglecting or even being abusive towards my child(ren), because at times I struggle to care for myself. Not to mention I don't even do well living with other adults without fighting. However, another part of me feels like this could be avoided by working through these issues before having kids, and also that having someone who depends on me might actually push me to work harder to maintain stability. 

One thing that has been suggested to me is to get a pet and raise it before I make any decision on having kids. I do think I would benefit greatly from having an ESA, and it would give me a sense of purpose. I'm highly considering it once I get a job and I'm bringing more money in.

What is everyone's opinion on this?

Homeless in the wake of Hurricane Michael and currently staying in a hotel with my disabled/elderly mother, who I take care of and who has been taking care of me.

I have people that love and support me, and I do want to get better, it's just... no matter how much I try, I can't seem to summon the willpower to really work towards improving my mental or physical health, or work past my social anxiety to do basic things like make calls to help look for a place to go. I had to drop out of high school for fear of having a severe break, and haven't been able to get my GED or seek employment due to my issues and simple lack of resources.

46,"Hello people :). So I have PTSD from sexual assults and I have been very aware of my triggers and can avoid them most of the time. At the moment my mom and I share a room (small space) and she is in a new relationship currently. We had the talk that I can't have her bf invade my space so when he stays the night they sleep in the living room. Well there is just a thin door between us and they have woken me up a few times from a dead sleep in a panic.

We have had many talks about it because it has been a large trigger of my panic attacks. I am not on medication, have been managing well for several years now without it. So it has been hard with her triggering it. She said it was unreasonable for me to expect them not to have sex in the house when they can't go to his seeing he lives with his parents. I had talked them into getting a hotel once a week in hopes they can take care of their stuff and not have to during the week when I have been trying to sleep for my classes.

 She has been aware that hearing them (normally her moan is what breaks my sleep) has been triggering me. To the point that we have gotten me sleeping medicine from the drug store and I take every night that he comes over. We tried her telling me to put on music on nights she thought things would happen but it still ended up causing panic. 

Has the time of this post probably has informed you the sleeping medicine and everything else has worked. I have been woken up by them again and this is the 4th month of this.

48,"I’m new to the whole mental illness thing, or new to being aware of my own mental illness I should say, and I’ve been having a really hard time lately trying to find ways to deal with it along with my chronic pain and some other life stuff I have going on. A friend on mine told me to try putting my thoughts on paper. Maybe that would get them out of my head. Make me feel a little more at ease. I figured hey, I liked poetry a lot back in high school, so I’ll try doing it that way. The first one was easy and it was a great feeling. Then nothing for a while. Now I’ve had two back to back and it’s been tough to look these things in the face, but great to finally accept them for what they are. I shared my poems with her and she recommended I share them more because they were good in her opinion so I wanted to share them with y’all in hopes that you may be inspired to find your own constructive way to face mental illness. It’s a whole health approach and I feel like this filled a gap I was missing. If you want to check out my poems follow the link, but be warned, I talk about anxiety, PTSD, and suicide.

50,"Hey everyone! I'm a 17 y/o Belgian student and I was wondering if there's anything I can do by myself to improve my mental health. I am currently unable to get professional help, because my parents have threatened to not let me get a dorm room if I was not mentally stable. I currenty live in one, but that's only because my parents are in no way informed of my mental health. I would like to keep living in a dorm room, because my family is very chaotic and my parents are not the most healthy to be around. The first month living in the dorm was awesome, I felt renewed, and thought that this might be the key to getting better. Sadly, it wasn't. Now I'll just briefly explain the problems that I have. For clarity's sake: I am not looking to get diagnosed, I would just like to now if there are concrete things I can do until I can get the help I need.

My biggest and most apparent problem is being suicidal. I don't know if I'll actually commit suicide, but for the last few weeks, I have thought about it every day. I have a long history of being suicidal, and once even visited a therapist and took medication, but the therapist didn't seem helpful and after a while I stopped taking pills because I felt better. Before thinking about it everyday, I used to think about it when I had a tantrum or felt lonely, but now it feels like something I've rationally decided to do because the pain is just too much. I try to keep myself from doing it though. 

The reason I'm thinking so much about suicide right now is probably stress. I'm a stressy person, and I'm studying for my first university exams ever right now. A constant cloud of failure seems to hang over me, because I can't seem to meet the goals I want to meet, and I'm easily distracted. The stress is also caused by the relationship I have with my boyfriend. I always get overrun by feelings, and hurt him without wanting to. It's super shameful, because I can't get ahold of myself and I get unnecessarily jealous when he goes out with friends, because I don't like his friends. It's even worse when he's out with female friends. I don't get why I feel this way, because 90 procent of my friend group is male. I also don't react slightly jealous, I sometimes get panic attacks over it and even am in physical pain because of it. I get chattering teeth and sometimes even stereotypically start to rock back and forth. I always try to hide how much he affects me because I don't want him to feel guilty about going out. I am an introvert so I don't go out often, that's probably why I feel angry when he does.

The last thing I struggle with immensely is identity. Sometimes I just go blank and don't know who I am, but in a more 'spiritual' sense, it's not that I forget my name. I don't know what my passions, ambitions are, or even what I like to do. I don't know what I am and where I fit in. I feel like I'm an 'observer' that has no gender or substance or anything, if that makes sense. If I get this while walking home, I get the feeling that I'm walking on a preset path that I didn't choose, and everything around me seems alien. It's very overwhelming, and I'll sometimes start to cry because I feel scared.

I hope I didn't bother you too much! Sorry for the long post!

to recapitulate, more shortly: I have suicidal tendencies, stress, and some identity problems.

Just the fact that all these fucking people come to this little store in the dead silence of the night and bother me kills me. I feel as if im being tortured every time i come to work. I cant even take a shit without someone banging on the window so viciously (even though i have a sign up telling them I may be 5 or 10 mins) that i have panic attacks. Every time.

55,"I really wish neurotypical people would please please please stop using this joke.

I suffer from PTSD and I have genuine triggers that make me have panic attacks so hard I lose time and memories or even lose control over my actions. I'm not alone in this. Please look up real life PTSD episodes and real life panic attacks - those are brought on by a trigger. Triggers are a real medical term. Because of this joke, I can't even use it within a professional setting without trivializing myself - and that's a reaction and self-view I cannot control.

I wish I could easily escape it, too, but...so many popular youtubers and bloggers use it. People I genuinely enjoy the humor of outside of those jokes. People who are known for being kind and open-hearted, just gutting all hope from me by flipping and defending use of triggers as a joke.

I know I'm not alone in this - many other adults suffering from PTSD can agree with me. I know some who might disagree, too, but they are well within their right to claim that because they also suffer from PTSD.

It's just...it's gotten so much for me. I've pretty much avoided all my favorite online users because just...at some point, it's ""haha i know it's a bit triggering"" or ""oh nooooooooooo triggerrrreeedd"" or ""im so triggered right now""

it's. too much to deal with. I know there is next to nothing I can do, and people who actively enjoy this ""joke"" will skim this, avoid it, or maybe try to ""defend themselves"" by getting upset with me... in that case, then this is just a rant post. Maybe someone with more influence will believe that this is not just controversial - it's downright detrimental. 

I know most people who use it don't know the full situation, and they really are good people but.... I just don't know...what to think, really...  I hope the joke dies soon.  I'm not even really angry, anymore. I'm just...hurt, I guess, that this is something we're mocking now to try and mock radfems and easily-offended people.

I'm the kind of person that gets no side effects to medicines that tend to have side effects (Benadryl and Flexeril don't make me tired in the slightest), but I also tend to have side effects from medicines that most people handle well (Lexapro made me highly impulsive, and I didn't have great results with Zoloft or Wellbutrin).

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty severely beaten as a child and also mentally abused. Also pretty much lost all connection to the friends I had, And I only remember ever having one ""best friend"". Was also disowned by my parents a whole back, but i'm on speaking terms with them now.  


The problem is, is not my in ability to be sociable, I can easily find friends. But when I do, i reveal how messed up i am, talk about messed up stuff, and end up being slowly ""pushed out"" of the friends group. I have a problem with projecting my own pain on others. The thing is, I know I'm doing this, but I can't stop myself.  


I am a compulsive liar, something I developed from child hood. I lie myself into huge holes, which often forces me to ghost new people i meet because I can't live up to what i say i am.  


I don't know how to display affection, don't really feel any empathy (I still have a little but i can feel it going) and every time I try to make a new relationship the first thing i always think of is how that person can benefit me.  


I spend most of my free time browsing social media, looking at girls. I often find myself falling in love, to the point where I non stop keep staring at the girls pictures. The only time i ever tried to make contact with one, I was shutdown.  


The only ""friend"" I have is as depressed and down as me. But his life is way more structured and he's a lot more intelligent so he still get's by.   


I'm also starting to loose my level head. I simply don't care anymore. Before I would put so much effort into assessments and exams, my work and everything in general, but now i just don't care. I don't tolerate employee bs anymore, I start arguments. I was once the guy who stopped the fights, now i'm the one starting them.  


I now feel little joy, even overcoming huge barriers feels like nothing now. I watch a lot of porn and masturbate a lot just to ""feel"" even if it's for seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I continue to live out this ""fake"" life i constructed, I feed my parents lies to keep them of my back. I'm finding it harder and harder to keep these lies in tact with everyone.  


I hate my job, hate my body and hate everyone around me. Every time I move and try to make some change, I just hate more.  


I go through random spurts of motivation to change, which lasts for a day, then I go back to being my depressed and depleted self.  


Can someone with any idea whats wrong with me offer me help. I feel like the voids infected me, and i'm slowly leading myself to a lonely end.

I started to go insane, watching videos of myself holding my (DOG)daughters paw as she died, my ex took me to court saying i was sexually assaulting our son and i was emotionally abusive and i.... I grew up with that little girl, i fell in love with her over a long period of time. When i was asked about what i thought about the mother i said i dont know her anymore and i started tearing up, because this is the only person i ever fell in love with, and the last. So i really didn't know her anymore, because i thought we were suppose to protect each other. I know her fuck boy convinced her she could wrap up a court battle quickly by saying such... Heart rending words. At the time i saved up thousands of dollars to send our son to summer camp and also pay for my CDL license to improve his quality of life, but when i saw her say those things about me i went all out. I used up all the money i had saved up to defend myself because this would be permanently on the record, how could i not defend myself? Close to this time my dog had a seizure and i asked how much it would cost to save her. I was told 500$ was the base fee to begin treatment. What i heard was 500 to look at her another few hundred for medication and another few thousands in tests. So i... I murdered my daughter. It was cheaper to put her to sleep than to save her, i knew as a father this was the first decision of my life where i had to make a sound financial decision and forgo my humanity. Because if i tried to defend myself and save my dog i would get nowhere with either goal because i would be spread to thin for any positive outcome. So i made a cold decision but NEVER will i forget that feeling of helplessness inflicted on me by the love of my life. The love of my life took the love in my life, I was forced to make a calculated move. 
So every year, at the end of the year, i sit down and watch the video of my whimpering daughter dying in my hands, to remind myself of the suffering love inflicted on my life.
I never socialized with another human being ever again because if the little girl i grew up with would justify her actions no matter what repulsive things she's done behind my back, i am terrified what a stranger is capable of doing in the name of personal freedom. So i would rather do without. Without love, without laughter, without friends. I am ok with silence because the silence has never betrayed me.

Now i ran out of weed and my... Emotions.. Were starting to come back after 7 years of just working all the time for little progress. Even now i couldn't afford to give my son a christmas this year. I saw it coming though, so a few months ago i had a little stash of cash saved up and bought him a ps4 and spiderman and told him its his christmas gift early because i could foresee our christmas, we would skip it this year. Ended up being laid off before december so my intuition was right.
Now i decided to ""educate"" myself instead of delving into madness, and a free mental health class popped up on my instagram feed, at 4am, the class would be at 10am that same morning, i signed up without hesitation.
When i got there i ate my breakfast infront of the building while i waited for the class to start. I could feel their disgusting stares, no respect.
Then it started, an 8 hour class on mental health first aid.
It was reefer madness all over again, first everyone sat down and started unpacking all their things( so many things) and a few minutes in, the instructor notifies us we shall be moving into a different room. Right off the bat it felt like a test, how much self inflicted baggage do you now have to move to another room, i only brought myself, so i got up and walked into the next room first. It took a while before the others could pack their stuff up and relocate, a few minutes wasted on these divas.
Everything they said sounded like bullshit to me, i ran to the store to by a pen and i talk to myself regularly. So i was shitting on their ""test"" outloud to myself. they heard me, and the instructor tried to make an example out of me when i came back.
They asked everyone to introduce themselves(fishing for information to use against you) and i mentioned my son beat me up in dbz fighter z to get them off my back. 
Now comes the fun part, the instructor stole a glance at me before asking the class, say a father and son are walking in public and the father happens to be speaking to himself, how would you explain that to the child?
I stayed silent knowing he was targeting me, I'm used to public humiliation because of my ex, I'm used to being a ""waste of space"", she called me that...
So i stayed quiet and listened.
A: i would tell the little boy that his dads brain is broken like a broken toy car
B:i would tell the boy his father is very sick and needs help
C:  ""insert reefer madness quote here adjusted to represent mental health.
The dumb things i heard... Bigotry...
I felt something, i felt the need to defend people who talk to themselves because i couldnt believe what i was hearing, i was disappointed with how retarded these people were.
I had to raise my hand
He smiled when he looked at me and ignored three raised hands and picked me.
Me:i would tell the boy his father is tired of the repetitive societal drivel coming out of the mouths of those he tried to speak with, hes so repulsed by the diarrhea coming out of the mouth of those who hes spoken to that hes learned to prefer his own company.
No more hands were raised, but he picked on the last person whos hand was up, a woman At my table, i dont even know what she said because she chuckled before answering, which made me lose interest in her response. She was the same as the others.
 The instructor said ""wow you went straight for the jugular"" to which my response was "" he obviously prefers the dialogue he has with himself than with others.""
That subject was dropped, but if i hadnt defended myself, then the scenario he saw in his head might have came to fruition. Me squirming in my seat, anxiety levels escalating, but he angered me by using my son against me, so i responded. 
Next came schizophrenia, hearing voices, etc, they showed a video of a man in his house alone just having a mental breakdown in the PRIVACY of his own home, telling the voices to shut up.
Reefer madness.
Then it cuts to a random woman who was WATCHING THIS DUDE THROUGH HIS WINDOW???
She then goes on to tell the mans neighbor that they should check on him and they proceed to lure the man outside of his comfort zone and made him speak to them outside where all the neighbors can watch them talk about his mental health issues, then they find out he stopped taking his medication because he didnt feel like himself anymore he felt controlled. 
The women proceed to use positive association of good times he had drinking tea with his neighbor on the porch, to clarify they are ""friends"" before proceeding to throw down an ultimatum, call the nuthouse to come collect you or they call the police to come collect you.
Obviously police give you a record on the local blotter as to how and why you were arrested so yes any sane person would want to avoid the police, especially someone who is suffering in their own mind. If they are having trouble with themselves then having to deal with an arrest and the possible reverberations to follow, well then yes he will let you pump him full of drugs until you go away again. Because you are now endangering his way of life through good intentions, paving the way to hell for that person. 
I told the instructor he was looking at it the wrong way, i believe split personalities are all a part of a whole, i told him what i see is an efficient distribution of labour, say something is so haunting. You cant move on with your life you cant progress because it consumes you. And people talk to eachother all the time, noone can truly be trusted because again they screw you over with ""good intentions"" but what if you had 6 people in your head? 7? The struggles you were experiencing are suddenly divided and the workload is shared. Lessening tbe burden on the hosts psyche. I feel that different personalities are just different perspectives from the same source, created for a purpose, to figure out what you could not do alone but if you reject what is a part of you, then you suffer a backlash, to embrace those perspectives as your own is to remember in the end you are their only priority, they exist to serve you.
Then i asked the instructor
Don't you think by teaching this class you are perpetuating the cycle of social isolation these people feel? Knowing that they have to cut out another one of the few people they have in their social cycle because they've been ""contaminated"" by using positive associating with the victim to make them abide by YOUR personal wishes they now know they can never speak to you again, because it always comes down to, are you taking your medication? No? Im gonna call the cops? No? Then take the medication.
The woman at my table turned to me and said ""dont you think your overthinking things?""
I didnt respond because it wasnt my place.
My response came to me right away but i bit my tongue, 
""You're here with good intentions, but through your actions you become a part of the problem, you are here selfishly not selflessly."" 
If anything this class made me more reclusive because theres dozens of these classes all over the city for free as part of the nyc mental health association.
That means hundreds of thousands of people have been trained to sink an individual experiencing mental health issues down to hell, Because the world is truly against them. Disguised under good intentions they are trained to restrain you or drug you.
Despicable.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Situation: just turned 24, male, I have been single for 4.5 years and have had depression, anxiety and OCD since 15/16. 

My problem is ever since about 20 years old I have felt very lonely and in need of a companion, I know this for sure. However I find that I can’t really ever get interested in a girl or have that excitement that I’d really want to be with them for pure fun and company and hanging out etc. I find that I find them sexually attractive and when I’m in a arousal state of mood I am excited and think to be with them mainly for sexual reasons, however as soon as my arousal state is gone I am left completely un-interested in them but still left in a state of loneliness and lack of company. It is if I am only interested or want to talk when I am aroused. 

In the past 4.5 years I have only had 2 sexual encounters(hookups) due to me being highly cautious of who I meet, 4 dates of which I only developed feelings for one person and even then I felt slightly uncertain if I was only interested when aroused. And I had a “relationship” 2 weeks with one girl however I never enjoyed it and was treated horribly by her. However I have spoken to a large amount of girls via texting and 98% of them I only feel interested when I’m aroused.

Right off the bat it felt like a test, how much self inflicted baggage do you now have to move to another room, i only brought myself, so i got up and walked into the next room first. It took a while before the others could pack their stuff up and relocate, a few minutes wasted on these divas.
Everything they said sounded like bullshit to me, i ran to the store to by a pen and i talk to myself regularly. So i was shitting on their ""test"" outloud to myself. they heard me, and the instructor tried to make an example out of me when i came back.
They asked everyone to introduce themselves(fishing for information to use against you) and i mentioned my son beat me up in dbz fighter z to get them off my back. 
Now comes the fun part, the instructor stole a glance at me before asking the class, say a father and son are walking in public and the father happens to be speaking to himself, how would you explain that to the child?
I stayed silent knowing he was targeting me, I'm used to public humiliation because of my ex, I'm used to being a ""waste of space"", she called me that...
So i stayed quiet and listened.
A: i would tell the little boy that his dads brain is broken like a broken toy car
B:i would tell the boy his father is very sick and needs help
C:  ""insert reefer madness quote here adjusted to represent mental health.
The dumb things i heard... Bigotry...
I felt something, i felt the need to defend people who talk to themselves because i couldnt believe what i was hearing, i was disappointed with how retarded these people were.
I had to raise my hand
He smiled when he looked at me and ignored three raised hands and picked me.
Me:i would tell the boy his father is tired of the repetitive societal drivel coming out of the mouths of those he tried to speak with, hes so repulsed by the diarrhea coming out of the mouth of those who hes spoken to that hes learned to prefer his own company.
No more hands were raised, but he picked on the last person whos hand was up, a woman At my table, i dont even know what she said because she chuckled before answering, which made me lose interest in her response. She was the same as the others.
 The instructor said ""wow you went straight for the jugular"" to which my response was "" he obviously prefers the dialogue he has with himself than with others.""
That subject was dropped, but if i hadnt defended myself, then the scenario he saw in his head might have came to fruition. Me squirming in my seat, anxiety levels escalating, but he angered me by using my son against me, so i responded. 
Next came schizophrenia, hearing voices, etc, they showed a video of a man in his house alone just having a mental breakdown in the PRIVACY of his own home, telling the voices to shut up.
Reefer madness.
Then it cuts to a random woman who was WATCHING THIS DUDE THROUGH HIS WINDOW???
She then goes on to tell the mans neighbor that they should check on him and they proceed to lure the man outside of his comfort zone and made him speak to them outside where all the neighbors can watch them talk about his mental health issues, then they find out he stopped taking his medication because he didnt feel like himself anymore he felt controlled. 
The women proceed to use positive association of good times he had drinking tea with his neighbor on the porch, to clarify they are ""friends"" before proceeding to throw down an ultimatum, call the nuthouse to come collect you or they call the police to come collect you.
Obviously police give you a record on the local blotter as to how and why you were arrested so yes any sane person would want to avoid the police, especially someone who is suffering in their own mind. If they are having trouble with themselves then having to deal with an arrest and the possible reverberations to follow, well then yes he will let you pump him full of drugs until you go away again. Because you are now endangering his way of life through good intentions, paving the way to hell for that person. 
I told the instructor he was looking at it the wrong way, i believe split personalities are all a part of a whole, i told him what i see is an efficient distribution of labour, say something is so haunting. You cant move on with your life you cant progress because it consumes you. And people talk to eachother all the time, noone can truly be trusted because again they screw you over with ""good intentions"" but what if you had 6 people in your head? 7? The struggles you were experiencing are suddenly divided and the workload is shared. Lessening tbe burden on the hosts psyche. I feel that different personalities are just different perspectives from the same source, created for a purpose, to figure out what you could not do alone but if you reject what is a part of you, then you suffer a backlash, to embrace those perspectives as your own is to remember in the end you are their only priority, they exist to serve you.
Then i asked the instructor
Don't you think by teaching this class you are perpetuating the cycle of social isolation these people feel? Knowing that they have to cut out another one of the few people they have in their social cycle because they've been ""contaminated"" by using positive association with the victim to make them abide by YOUR personal wishes they now know they can never speak to you again, because it always comes down to, are you taking your medication? No? Im gonna call the cops? No? Then take the medication.
The woman at my table turned to me and said ""dont you think your overthinking things?""
I didnt respond because it wasnt my place.
My response came to me right away but i bit my tongue, 
""You're here with good intentions, but through your actions you become a part of the problem, you are here selfishly not selflessly."" 
If anything this class made me more reclusive because theres dozens of these classes all over the city for free as part of the nyc mental health association.
That means hundreds of thousands of people have been trained to sink an individual experiencing mental health issues down to hell, Because the world is truly against them. Disguised under good intentions they are trained to restrain you or drug you.
Despicable.
I had to vent because of the sheer disappointment i had. Also I'm now certified in mental health first aid, but ill just say im a certified bullshit artist, has a nicer ring, title is more fitting as well.

72,"&gt;Introduction:  
&gt;  
&gt;Hey my name is -----, I'm 18 and I am very unsatisfied with how I act and acted for the past 18 years. My current state has been with me since I remember myself trying to put effort into certain objectives I had in life.  
&gt;  
&gt;Backstory:  
&gt;  
&gt;At the age of 1.5 years I was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma (eye cancer), in the surgery they took out the tumor with my right eye, so I only see in one eye.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was always hooked to computers, so I played since kindergarten and I spend about 8-16 hours a day on the PC gaming (sometimes coding).  
&gt;  
&gt;I used to get bullied in elementary school quite a lot (age 7-12).  
&gt;  
&gt;At the age of 11 (somewhere around that), my 2nd psychologist diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, I was treated by him until I was 15, I went to a psychiatrist and took anti-depressants (which I take until today), moved to another psychologist who I left about 5 months ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the age of 14 I was diagnosed with Colitis (chronic colon disease) and PSC (chronic liver disease), I got is very easy compared to other people with these disease. I am only limited to not drinking alcohol (not too sad about it).  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout my life in school (middleschool and highschool), I only acquired one person I could call a true friend who I moved to a highschool in a different city, that's the place he got new friends and kind of ditched me... at that time I got myself more into the internet especially Minecraft where I got some internet friends (who I called true friends back at the time), I have known them for 5 years and some of them met in real life at some point (one from Sweden and one from England), we had a huge arguement and that seperated us but not completely. We are not as close as we used to be but we still play together.  
&gt;  
&gt;Real life examples of the issue:  
&gt;  
&gt;E.G. Number 1  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;I finished Highschool not long ago and keeping my grades high was important especially in Maths, Physics and English. Part of that was consistently studying which I could bring myself to up until the last 1-2 days before the test and I wouldn't study that much. Everytime I thought about it I told myself ""this test, I'm going to do X and Y, everyday I am going to complete Z exercises"" and I could never keep up with my own promises. I loved Math &amp; Physics back at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;E.G. Number 2  
&gt;  
&gt;I code plugins for servers as a hobby in a game called Minecraft, that's also how I started learning to code. We are currently working on a certain project and no matter how much I get excited just thinking about it I just can't bring myself to constantly work on it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why I came here?  
&gt;  
&gt;My motivation with these kind of tasks was rocketing into the sky when I thought about performing them but when it came to actually doing them I just got ""lazy?"" (that's how I call it) and couldn't really do them.  
&gt;  
&gt;I brought these two examples because they cover up all kind of different things in life that you'd want or not want to do. Studying is usually boring so it's reasonable to not want to do it, but I couldn't do it even with my favorite subjects. Coding is my hobby and even if it's what I love doing I still can't bring myself to consistently work on that same project.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why I suspect my abnormal laziness is a bit more then what being lazy is. I typed out most of my life story to help people in the comments figure out where this behavior maybe comes from.  
&gt;  
&gt;Feel free to ask any question about my life or what did I do in certain situation if that could help you somehow help me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edits:  
&gt;  
&gt;1: Found the defintion for my state. Instead of doing anything else that could contribute I play video games/sleep all day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Akrasia is the state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else.  
&gt;  
&gt;2: Another definition for my state could be procrastination but I am still unsure how accurate it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The above is a post, I made 5 months ago. After some consideration I took off my anti-depressants completely and I'm already around 2 months without them. This issue persists, it has been with me my entire life, and it happens with things I love doing and things I don't. I have asked my psychiatrist but there was no solution in the end. I am open to any suggestions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Edit:**  
&gt;  
&gt;I am slowly neglecting my health as well, I get ""lazy"" making certain types of food since it takes some preperations.

The above post is a post I made 5 months ago and re-posted 22 days ago. You know the deal...  
I tried a solution suggested in the comments saying I should trying to combine thing I like and things I don't together. I have tried but my brain is letting me down for no reason. The comment also suggested that it definitely sounds like procrastination. As always, open to suggestions.

73,"For god knows what reason, a couple weeks before a semester starts, the thought of college sends me into a panic. I’m not worried, and know I’ll be okay with everything. 

My problem is that college causes me to think of a million different things and it overwhelms me to the point where I cry and can’t breathe at least once a day. It feels like it keeps happening earlier within my vacations. 

I’m currently prescribed on an anti-anxiety medication that helps me with generalized anxiety, but it doesn’t help me enough with this. 

What do I do?? ",29Dec2018,1

75,"So I came across this book called ""Almost a Psychopath"", about people who fit the description of being psychopathic minus being violent or criminal. I hate to admit it, but I see myself in a lot of the traits. I'm not completely unable to feel true empathy, but sometimes I ""empathize"" with or help people only for my own gain (for example, helping someone through a bad breakup only in hopes they will fall in love with me). I tend to use people...I've been living with and sucking money from someone for 3 years; even when I had my own job and income, I would get this person to buy me a bunch of stuff so I didn't have to use *my* money. They treat me like shit (deservedly so, to a point), and yet I stay because of the financial support. I have trouble accepting the word ""no"" and I will manipulate, beg, and badger until I break the person down and they give me what I want just to shut me up. I have no concept of boundaries and I don't notice or understand non-verbal cues of discomfort/disinterest. This has made a lot of people extremely uncomfortable with being around me. 

Now for the flip side...I'm not generally violent and I don't generally have thoughts of harming people. It's not something that preoccupies my mind. I also feel remorse for my actions when I know I've clearly hurt or violated someone, and I'm usually able to stop doing what it is that hurts them (but in some situations, I don't because in my mind my personal gain takes precedence). I have the ability to feel genuine empathy and I have often helped people even when I stood to gain nothing from doing so. I know I'm not a totally ""bad"" person, but it sometimes seems like my ability to consider others' feelings is impaired.

With me having BPD, is it normal to possess some psychopathic tendencies? I know both are personality disorders, so I imagine there is some overlap.

TL;DR: I have BPD and psychopathic traits. Is this normal?",29Dec2018,1

78,"My mom has schizophrenia and the drug is haloperidol. She can't live without this drug - she will hallucinate. Where can we learn more than the drug's estimated return date?

-------

A piece of my mom's story: 

My mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia in '07. She was in the hospital for nearly a year while they tried to find a medication that worked for her hallucinations, and haloperidol was the only one to do the trick. 

For another seven years, my mom continued to struggle with her self worth and finding a place of belonging. She eventually found a great community of people who supported her and helped lift her up, and she continued to grow and better herself. She's worked hard to learn as much as she can about her diagnosis, to learn about coping mechanisms and healthy living, and has successfully pushed to better herself in every way imagineable. She's fought through stigmas held by both herself and others, through ignorance, and through disbelief and misconceptions.

She now works in the community who helped her, offering support and guidance to others who are struggling with a mental illness. She is a truly incredible woman who's overcome more than I think I could myself... I often try to put myself in her shoes, to imagine the way I'd handle myself through some of the pain she's experienced, and I can't. She's worked so hard to get to where she's at and I'm so proud of her. 

For nearly fifteen years she's taken her medication daily, never missing one, and refilling it a week early so that she might never run out.
We learned today, though, that haloperidol, the antipsychotic that keeps my mom's hallucinations at bay, isn't being manufactured. We don't know why and don't know when (or if)  her pharmacy will have their hands on it again. 

It's scary, because it's not simply a matter of finding a similar medication, like perhaps swapping antihistamines. She's spoken with her med provider, who isn't able to do much of anything for her. If this medication doesn't come back, my mom could lose everything she's fought so long and hard for, and my heart has become so heavy with feelings of helplessness. 

If anyone could she'd any light in this, or offer resources for us to learn more, we'd be very grateful.

I have bad social skills and always have, a doctor asked if Id ever been tested for aspies before I said no but it would explain some things. Although if I am i'm not atypical.

 Today I spent more time seated in a chair than lying on bed! It's not that amazing, but it means a lot for me.
 For a long period of time I felt like it wasn't worth waking up, doing things or even trying to get better, so I layed on bed only waking up for eating (sometimes) and using the bathroom.
 But now I have find my motivation, art. Most especially, drawing.
Even if I wanted to give up or returning to bed I keep drawing and finishing something. I'm in tears, I thought I couldn't draw anymore because of my tiredness, but I could, and it works.

82,"I already know this is gonna be downvoted into oblivion and if you want to just comment that I'm human scum you can do that, because trust me, I know. But this has been on my mind lately due to recent events in my life and I just need some answers for once. Basically I have always had an obsession with hurting or killing animals. If you don't want to read more about that, stop here.

When I was maybe 4 to 6 I had this stuffed unicorn that I would pretend to kill. I punched it, jumped on it, stuffed it in my toy oven etc. There was also this movie I watched a lot because of one scene where a cat was about to drown but was saved by a dog. Every time that scene came on and the cat was struggeling in the water I hoped it would drown. I remember getting this very particular feeling, this wild desire for more and this immense pleasure.

Then a couple of years ago when I was 12 or 13 it came back. I started looking for videos of cats getting hurt and watched them for hours. I wrote about it too. I wrote very detailed and graphic descriptions of kittens being abused and killed. It gave me the same feeling.

Then finally, at the height of this I killed a kitten. I was on weekend trip with about 15 other kids and there were these two kittens that we found in a shed and named Levi and Charlie. Levi disapeared (not my fault!) but Charlie was always in that shed. I went down there as often as I could. Needless to say, Charlie got injured under suspicious circumstances. ""Someone"" poured sand in his eyes untill he went blind and ""someone"" left him screaming on top of a dumpster all night. One day, I went to far and accidentally killed him. That night I was so excited I couldn't sleep. My mind was racing and I was just over the moon. It was better than any high could ever be. I feel no remorse for it. I know it was a scummy thing to do but I don't regret it in the slightest.

It briefly came back a couple months ago but that thankfully only lasted for a week or so. I can't find any cause for this. My family life is perfectly normal. Nothing majorly bad has happened to me *ever*. I just don't get it...",29Dec2018,1
83,"My spouse and I had another blow up because of my reaction to things. I get super, extremely, worked up and flip out at the slightest things. When I'm with others, I am usually fine, but with my spouse I go off the deep end. I believe deep down it's because I'm comfortable ""showing"" her how I really feel, but it's almost as if I'm ""taking out"" my emotions on her. It's like a raging storm inside me all of the time. I hate it so much. We have smoothed things over again, but I'm just so afraid of hurting her again. 

I have tried to identify what sets me off exactly, but it seems random. Sometimes when I feel sexually aroused or ""in the mood"" I get emotionally overwhelmed. I haven't touched myself in a very long time and now when I do, I feel guilty and shameful. I've never felt wrong about it before, but now I do. And even the feeling of sexual arousal makes me want to vomit. With my spouse, it is totally fine and cool but when I am by myself I feel disgusted. Other times, I get very emotionally overwhelmed by a perceived lack of control in my life. In situations where I would normally not care, as I have been in the Army for 6+ years so ""going with the flow"" was a must, I start wanting to hit myself or scream or run away. Another major issue I have is when I upset loved ones. My spouse, my father, etc. Seeing them get upset makes me freak the fuck out, especially if it's because of my words or actions. I am afraid to engage in hobbies or things on my own, as I perceive them to be selfish and therefore bad. I'm just an utter fucking mess right now internally, and although as I write this I've already talked to my spouse and we are good and I feel great, I'm still unsure when it'll switch.

85,"I am aware I cannot be diagnosed online I am just asking because I am curious what you guys think. I am not sure if this matters but I am a female and I don't want to say my exact age but I am under 21. Ever since I was younger I didn't particularly care for people. All the kids would want to play with me but I was just not interested. I've also always been a bit philosophical I guess? My mom has told me when I was a child when I spoke to other children the things I would say would just go over their heads a lot of the time. That sort of behavior has continued throughout my life. I also don't like to hold onto relationships with people. Most of my life I didn't have many friends and it didn't really ever bother me, most of the friends I had also ended up being really bad friends and were more so bullies. I get very anxious around people and I don't enjoy others being present. I will make friends with someone and they will love me, text me everyday, constantly want to hang out and I honestly couldn't care less. As a matter of fact I hate it. After a while of being friends with someone I will drop them. What I mean by that is not reply to their texts, block them, overall not really want anything to do with them, even start to dislike them. This may just sound like being a bad friend but there's more to it. I get very easily angered and upset, I will go from calm and living life to in a fit of rage in a second and somewhat shock people around me because it seems so sudden. Bipolar does run in my family if that means anything. Also I don't know if this means anything but I suffered some what I would consider emotional abuse from my big sister growing up. She would always talk about how she would love to stab me, push me off a cliff, torture me, see the blood run out of my body. She would tell me these things as like a seven year old and it terrified me. My mother wouldn't really do anything about it and my dad wasn't really around growing up as my parents divorced when I was six and before that he didn't really pay us much attention. My sister to this day enjoys seeing me cry and will laugh and try to encourage it. My mom tells her to stop and just kind of leaves it there. Recently my mom has started dating this guy and I am furious. The only thing me and sister seem to agree on is that she is being so ignorant and acting like a teenage girl with her first boyfriend. She has known this guy for less than a year and she CONSTANTLY talks about him and says he and her are gonna get married and he's gonna move in and this and that. He lives in another state and he comes here a lot and stays for like two months and he annoys me so badly. Whenever I say something about him she guilt trips me because he has health problems and it makes me even more angry. Back to my mental health though, I've noticed I don't care about people. I don't care about their suffering, their pain, I just don't care. I don't understand why someone would want any kind of commitment to someone, rather it be a lover or a friend. I never want to be married or even be in a serious relationship, hell, even friendships are draining and annoying to me. However I don't think I'm a sociopath because I do authentically cry and I care about animals. I am vegan and watching animals in pain makes me sad and angry. I may just sound like a crazy vegan but ever since I was young, even before I became vegan, I put animals on a pedestal, if I had to kill a human or an animal I would gladly choose the human. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to take a human life though I probably would never do it. Another thing, I have what seems like bipolar streaks. One day I may be perfectly happy and the next I will be so sad I can't even explain it and there is not really much of a reason. This has become more of a problem since my mom started dating and she refuses to see that her ignorant life choice of moving in and marrying a man she barely knows if affecting my mental health and it will be at least 3 years before I can move out and even then I probably won't be able to. All everyone does is bully me and call me a weirdo, a slut etc and its my own family that says these things. I contemplate suicide a lot though I don't really want to die I just want to drift into another universe where things are different. I find my comfort and solice in the internet and animals. I have a very cynical outlook on life and I don't think anyone truly cares about you and people only want you if they can exploit or make fun of you. I wish I could take my animals and somehow runaway and not be murdered or trafficked but that is quite literally impossible. If you are just going to be a dick and tell me I'm a crazy bitch go somewhere else please, I'm looking for actual opinions. To condense all of this I am social anxious, non committal, bullied and threatened by my sister, had bad friends, hate people and don't care about them, extreme bouts of depression, love animals, and have suicidal thoughts.",29Dec2018,1
86,"Long story short, I was raised by my father until I was 15, they moved half way across the world and due to some personal matters I moved in with my mother.

 I drifted away from my father's side of the family only seeing or talking to them rarely. I visited this Christmas and was struck hard just how unlike them I am now, I just don't relate to them anymore.

I feel like my ""family"" are my mother and stepfather and that my father and stepmother are... something else. 

I'm not really sure what I'm feeling, it's like I'm grieving for a life I've not had. Or perhaps I'm grieving the person I once was, I really don't know.

I'm not sure how anyone could help on this, (don't feel obligated) I'm going to discuss this with my therapist soon but some insight from other would be greatly appreciated too.",29Dec2018,1

Anyway, I’ve also realized depression is like someone constantly berating you? Anyway, my goals are to be happy, be helpful, and kind. Pretty easy goals for now. Even being all of these things, I still feel depressed. Anyway, I haven’t seen my therapist in awhile. They wouldn’t think I’m a danger would they?

The intrusive thoughts are like:

&gt; What if I become so depressed I’m suicidal?

&gt; What if I killed myself with a knife?

I’m pretty sure these are intrusive thoughts related to anxiety/OCD? See post history for OCD. :)

I'm about to get pretty detailed just so people can understand better I suppose. So, one night, 4 years ago I woke up to the feeling of my pants being pulled down. This was the first encounter mind you. I was in the middle of a dream so I woke up sort of confused. I turned around but it was super dark in my room. While i could barley see anything, i could make out something moving to the corner where the door was. I don't know why i got up, but i got up and turned on the light. It was my step dad and i was a bit confused. I asked him what he was doing or what was wrong- something like that. He said he was checking on the dog and left. It was weird, and i felt really awkward about it and thought about it a lot but kinda brushed it off as nothing. Not too long after, like a few nights or so later, i woke up to the feeling of somones hand sliding between my thighs. I felt their hand brush against my private area through my pants and it woke me up as soon as i felt it. The TV was on that night so I turned around and sure enough it was my step dad. I was confused i think..i didn't freak out but i just asked him what he was doing. He said he was checking on the dog again then he left. I remember i cried a lot that night..like this is the same man who i thought of as a father. This went on many times, same thing pretty much where id feel his hand sliding between my thighs and id wake up, ask the same thing. Sometimes hed pull away really fast and nothing was said. Once he even tried pulling my shirt down. This went on until i was 15 and i only ever told my best friend and people on anonymous apps. It kind of messed me up..like I really felt violated and gross. But sometimes i feel like I'm overreacting and it wasn't even considered sexual assualt because technically he never went farther.  I never told my mom because I felt super uncomfortable..like the thought of having to tell her made me feel weird and it was harder as time went on because he was our sole provider and we had money issues. It made it so i felt like i couldn't trust older men. At one point i was staying with my dad for the summer and i was just worried he was going to do the same thing to me. I feel like I'm being dramatic..like it could have been way worse..",29Dec2018,1
90,"So my ex and I reconnected after about 2 years of being broken up. We had a terrible breakup. She contacted me and initially things were great. We were friend and she was off hooking up with other guys and just living what I thought was happy life. She mentioned that she wanted to be fwb and that she was totally over us. 
Fast forward a few months later she’s in a horrible places. Depressed, anxious and ptsd symptoms just going off. She’s incredibly Codependent and can not be left alone. 
Anyways she mentioned that she couldn’t do the fwb things anymore because she just felt empty and like sex just complicated things. I said okay no problem. She disappears for a few days and comes back saying that she was out of that dark place and that she wasn’t herself. She said that she was okay hooking up with me and the other guys she was having sex with. and that she was totally fine with it. Fast forward Christmas. She’s down at rock bottom again talking about how she hates life and that life isn’t fair. How her past is effecting her. The whole vibe sucked and she asking for a hug. 
While giving her a huge she asked if I wanted to sleep with her, I said no, I wasn’t in the mood. She gets upset, starts crying and says it because she’s ugly and etc. makes it totally about her. I didn’t wanna sleep with her because I know things aren’t okay, and she’s having all these strong emotions and that’s gonna make things harder. 
So last night I call her because she’s feeling alone and I try to comfort for her and listen to her vent about how horrible life is. 
I mentioned that I wasn’t feeling  to great I hung out with this girl and we tried having sex but it was hard for me because I couldn’t perform. She blows up at me and starts crying. That I can’t sleep with her but I will with some other girl. I tried to explain to her that the situation and how I felt, but she totally made it about herself. That she was ugly and disgusting. 
She asked if I got jealous about the guys she was hooking with and I said I didn’t care that she was free to do as she please, and blows up again. Saying that it’s not fair that I should feel bad, and says all I do is use her and that’s all I’ve ever done. That Im not a friend 
Obviously I feel hurt and betrayed so I choose not to talk to her anymore 
She blows up my phone saying 
What kind of friend am I, leaving her to face all the pain alone. 

I feel like a horrible person, I feel upset. Everything is about her. No one can do anything that might upset her because she’ll break down. She’s insult you and say your toxic but wants you to be there for hours on the phone as she balls her eyes out till no end 
I give up. I can’t help her, or be a “friend” anymore 

Just a rant ",29Dec2018,1
91,"Basically, I overthink a lot. And I feel like I burden my friend with my issues. This school year, I moved schools and still keep in touch with my best friends who go there. But, my closest friend, that I’ve known for years doesn’t send interested in talking to me anymore. I’ve asked her the classic “Are you bored with me?” And she said no. But, I really feel like she’s tired of me. She’s told me over and over that I’m her best friend and she’d never be bored of me. But my mind doesn’t want to believe her. I feel like that ever since I moved, she’s lost all interest in being my friend. I really want to believe her, but I can’t. I so desperately want to stay close. But I feel like she doesn’t want to. I feel like she’s just friends with me out of pity. Does anybody know ways that I can get out of this mindset? ",29Dec2018,1
92,"I’m coming here to seek advice because I have a very dear friend across the country back in NYC (I’m in LA) who I’m becoming really worried about and am running out of places to turn. 

She and I have always been each other’s go to people for discussing our struggles with depression and being listening boards for each other in that regard ever since college. This has always felt like a safe and healthy way to talk things through for the past 7 years until recently when things have started to take a darker turn. 

She’s mentioned on several occasions that she wants to take her own life sometime next year which is something that feels different than our usual discussion of suicidal urges. I’ve tried a few ways to talk her down, mainly trying to remind her of how many people including myself who would be devastated if she were to do this, but she doesn’t seem to care. 

There hasn’t been any talk of specific methods or specific dates, but it just feels real, and I’m really worried that if I don’t take some kind of action something terrible will happen. The fact that we are on opposite coasts is especially putting me on edge.

My question is: has anybody ever sought out professional help for a friend or loved one in this situation and can give advice on a way to do it that doesn’t make them feel sold out or betrayed? What I’d like to do in a perfect situation is find a place where she can physically go and talk to someone briefly about what she’s feeling and what her options are and make a tentative appointment for her, but I don’t think that exists or can happen based on research so far. I’m just mainly hoping for something beyond a phone hotline (because she can just call me) and a place that makes the person feel actually heard as opposed to being churned through a system that just checks their boxes of “we tried”.

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks for listening. ",29Dec2018,1

94,"A year and a half ago was the worst time in my life that i remember. 
To keep a long story short i started seeing a therapist. They recommended a certain psychiatric. After seeing her twice she diagnosed me with multiple illnesses. 
Depression, anxiety, PTSD from my childhood, manic, bipolar. 
I got several medications. 
Some of my problems would seem better but others worse. 
I ended up not returning to her when she said i seemed to have multiple personalities and she also wanted to test to see if i had schizophrenia. 
I believed i May have had a few issues from my childhood. It wasn’t a normal childhood so i understand. I just felt she wanted to tell me everything was wrong so she could just keep me medicated. 

Since I’ve seen other therapists but dealt with everything on my own because i don’t believe the medications helped or made me feel what i think “normal” would be.

96,A little over a month ago I experienced a psychotic break which was induced by weed and a large dose of psychedelics. It was irresponsible for me to be playing with drugs like that and I’ve now committed myself to being sober and have completely quit weed which was once my drug of choice. This was an isolated incident and I’ve never experienced anything similar to it before. The greatest extent of any other psychotic symptoms would be minor paranoia induced by weed which has completely subsided now that I’m sober. I’m wondering if this psychotic break means that I will likely develop psychosis at an older age even though I am staying sober. I feel pretty normal now and haven’t noticed any persisting symptoms that resulted from the break. What does this mean for my mental health?,29Dec2018,1

(I received positive feedback and no complaints from my first self-help post, so I'm back with another!)

I've gone through some tough events in my personal life in the past few months.

One of the things I learned is that writing has been a good therapy for me. As such I started a blog where I aim to reflect on the experiences of my past and present experiences as I feel I bring a unique viewpoint.

I'm ending 2018 with a recap of some of the most important lessons I learned , I will aim to post several more lessons throughout the weekend.

My first lesson was learning to show **vulnerability** in a time of need instead of using some of my more ""traditional"" strategies. I hope my experience can resonate and even help someone looking for a fresh perspective. 

As such, any feedback is appreciated and I hope to generate some discussion with this post. Feel free to subscribe for notifications on future posts.

100,"For some reason I can’t get this girl out of my head. It’s not relationship advice that I’m looking for here. We are not actively talking to each other and I’m hardly on social media. We spent two nights out together and had one bad night in bed (long story).  The issue with us in bed was just a wacky set of circumstances (hurt myself during it). Regardless, I got the sense that she wasn’t really that into me to begin with but I decided to just roll with it and see what happened. I told her that, even after spending the night together, I wanted to spend more time with her. She rejected that. I accepted it and politely backed off. 

We likely would not have worked out anyway. She’s successful, I’m not. She isn’t a good communicator. We have a 14 yr age difference (I’m 38). I don’t message her or see her. Even with breakups that had more of a history, I let myself heal and was able to detach because I knew time would heal all. Only saw this girl twice, why am I still ruminating so much? It’s been two months since the last night together. Would expect this with a more solidified relationship but we saw each other TWICE. Is it a pride thing? 

Full disclosure: I did drunk text her a week or so after. She acted the same but was cool about it. Then I left her alone since. She texted me out of the blue a couple weeks ago saying a bar that we spent one night at was closing. That was it, bit weird but I blew it off. 

Any thoughts are appreciated.

102,"I have been struggling with pretty bad depression for the past 5 or so years, there were times where I felt great but there were also some really low points where I could barely get out of bed and couldn't think of much else than wanting it to end. I thought all that was normal for someone with depression. I never did much research on what bipolar order even was until recently when I became friends with someone who has it, and now I'm starting to see the patterns.
I've been at a real low point for the past month or so but today I woke up feeling much better, maybe not absolutely amazing, I actually feel like taking care of myself for once and not starving myself all day. So, I decided it would probably be best to seek some help while I actually feel like doing so.

104,"When I do feel emotions they're either very mild or very intense, there's not really an in between. My emotions change very rapidly, yesterday I went from crying on my girlfriends shoulder having suicidal thoughts because I felt worthless to being completely calm, maybe in even kind of a good mood. Sometimes I'll get extremely angry, I'll throw something or break something then I'm immediately calm again. When someone does something bad to me I usually feel no emotion about it. My parents a lot of the time think I fake my emotions because I'll go from crying and freaking out to being calm in probably about 5 seconds. I used to get super happy for maybe about 5 seconds then go back to just being calm, but not anymore, that being said I don't ever really feel happy, sometimes I do somewhat content though. In my head it feels like I have 2 brains, one is super rational and the other is super emotional, and whenever I'm in an emotional situation they just flip back and fourth randomly. Are these symptoms of BPD or maybe something else, I don't want to do a lot of research because I tend to get fixated on a diagnoses, mostly because I just really want answers. ",29Dec2018,1
105,"The title may sound a lot like I’m bipolar but I do not believe that I am because these “episodes” are very short lived and frequent. I just want to have a brief, general idea of what these sort of episodes could be so I could get the appropriate  help. Not looking to self diagnosis. 

I frequently get these “episodes” wherein I experience a drastic mood drop. They can be random or triggered by something like an argument with my bf or insecurities etc. Then i experience a euphoric feeling that isn’t full-blown mania (as far as I can tell, anyway). I’m just more hyped up and feel impulsive. My thoughts tend to race around in my head and I just want to get up and conquer the world. I mostly don’t give into these types of impulses though as the mood drop comes back and leaves me feeling debilitated. The time between these two feelings can be under 5 minutes to an hour. Rarely take more than hour to switch between the two moods. 

As far as I’m aware, bipolar episodes aren’t as short lived and switch quickly. Please correct me if I’m wrong. 

 Could also be useful to mention that it’s just my moods that switch. My feelings are basically nonexistent when I have an episode. I do feel anger though and often cry a lot but there’s no emotion attached to it?

107,"Hi all! So I'm just gonna give a little background so you guys sort of know what we are working with here.. I'm a 20 year old male and I have a half sister who just turned 26 recently, we have the same father but different mothers and grew up in different completely homes essentially, she moved in with us when she was 18 years old.

Going off of that tangent, I grew up in a very stable household with two loving parents who I knew cared for me but she did not have that unfortunately. My Dad divorced her mom and lost the custody battle in court before I was even born, then he remarried and had me with his current wife. Like I said I grew up in a great household with lots of opportunities and many great influences around me, she grew up in a household with parents who were thieves (they had multie cars get repo'd and were evicted from numerous houses in the 18 years that she lived there). She also got into legal trouble a few times for minor things but still offenses nonetheless, shoplifting, under aged drinking and things of that nature. She was kind of a mess growing up and I never really understood why until recently, she just didnt grow up in an environment like I did..

Recently for the past six months or so, I hate to say this because I love her and shes my sister but shes kindled of been hard to be around.. We know that she is going to a counselor for depression and on top of that she has gained a LOT of weight in the past year or so. Additionally I've been researching personality disorders and she fits criteria for dependent personality disorder, which would make sense because she never had security growing up. She needs constant reassurance e.g. always asking if she ""did good"" after simple tasks as if she were a toddler, constantly asking for other people's approval on basic decisions (she took 10 minutes to order food on vacation and I'm not exaggerating, it was brutal). She also makes jokes about her weight and comes off as if she has no confidence. She works a decent job and can sustain herself and she has a boyfriend but he just enables it honestly, they both just sit ar their house and play video games, they dont have any hobbies and are both content with doing nothing. Another major queue I've noticed is that she is very moody and I mean MOODY. For example on Christmas when the appetizers that she wanted were not ready she pretty much layed down in front of the living room in front of everyone and powted like a little kid (once again embarrassing for our family, it's almost as if theres a cultural gap between her and the rest of the family). Its like a switch will flip and she will just be super rude to everyone all of a sudden, it happens at about every gathering honestly. If her boyfriend breaks up with her she will be an absolute basket case, he already said he doesnt want to get engaged for like another two years so idk. I think she wants to get married just for the sake of being married, she doesnt care to who I dont think. Shes also very materialistic and buys things that she doesnt need impuslviely as well as always asks our Dad to buy her things, which in turn angers him. One last detail I've noticed is that she constantly has to be in a relationship, when her last boyfriend broke up with her she brought home some POS trashy dude and I literally had to kick him out of my house because I had a horrible feeling about him. Idk man I'm just worried that shes not gonna live a happy life and idk what to do, my parents and I have talked about sitting down with her and just talking as well as going to a counselor with her. What do you guys think we should do?

How do you deal with practically not getting any matches in online dating? Be it Tinder, OkCupid, etc.

How do you not fall into an oppressive cycle of depression and not lose your self-esteem?

I don’t have many people to discuss this but I’ve been in a rut for a few years over this and the one two times I found people interested in me (social media but not online dating and kind of happened organically) I became clingy as I didn’t want to lose them.

I managed to pretend online dating wasn’t a big deal and of no importance to me and kept myself afloat for a year or so. But I’m reading Aziz Ansari’s Modern Romance this week and the numbers tell another story. It’s showing me, the book, that online dating and specifically Tinder is such a big part of modern day culture. The stories they have paint a very different picture from the experience I had, so now I signed up for Tinder again without much success.

113,"So I really don’t know where to start, my name is James and recently my girlfriend has been through something I don’t know how to explain.

I’m just gonna cut to the chase here and explain what’s going on.

It started on Thursday my girlfriend a very smart girl in her third year of nursing school very kind very calm sweet sweet girl was not in bed when I woke up, I checked my phone to see 15 text messages from her explain that she had a panic attack and that she is in the hospital so I went to see her, she was nauseous and really lethargic she was in a distress unit being monitored, after about 5 hours of waiting I had to leave because of some issues at home. I explained to her that I had to go and she seemed fine aside from her tiredness and trouble finishing sentences....flash forward about 2 hours she’s calling me saying she’s being discharged, she’s telling me I can come out now and that this was all very funny, confused I say that idk what she’s talking about and that she needs to get home to me, she says okay, another hour passes and she calls me saying she’s lost and that someone tried to kidnap her and I tel her to call a taxi and she gets angry and hangs up the phone, finally she arrives at my house seemingly very angry and upset..

She tells me she needs to shower I say okay, then I hear her screaming from the bathroom screaming st the top of her longs “James come help me” I burst through the door and she’s in the shower crying yelling to me “tell my mom I’m okay” 

I’m gonna skip over a bit just to condense those but at this point I’m very scared and crying so she comes the the bedroom after the shower, she’s not responding to me, and anytime I ask her if she’s okay she keeps repeating “my dad needs to go to the hospital” “ my dad isn’t okay”
Finally I call 911 because my girlfriend is just not ok and nothing she’s saying is making sense.

Fast forward to the next day she’s now in the psych ward and I went to visit her today, she seemed calm and could talk but somethings isn’t right, she is happy one minute and crying and angry the next, it’s like part of her is lost and idk what to do.

116,"A bit of background. I'm 26 years old, six years ago, I was raped, subsequently became pregnant, and had a very late miscarriage (17 weeks). Over the past year, I've started trying in earnest to work through these things, and improve my mental health. Over the summer, I had a very difficult few months. I was suicidal, and wound up in psychiatric hospitals three separate times. I've been working with my current therapist since mid-September, after the last hospitalization. She is the first therapist with whom I've ever felt truly comfortable, but during my last session, she said some things that are really getting in my head, and making me doubt whether I can benefit from continuing to work with her.

This session was the day after the sixth anniversary of my miscarriage, so that was the topic that I started with. I told her that I had flashbacks throughout the day. She asked how I got through it. I told her that I watched movies with a friend, and petted my dog to keep myself grounded in reality. I also told her that I was successful in staying grounded through most of the flashbacks, I knew that they weren't real, and that I was safe (huge personal victory!!!). I can't remember what her next question was, but eventually I told her that I felt fear while having the flashbacks. She said something along the lines of, ""Which is it, you felt fear or you knew you were safe? It can't be both."" I got the sense that she was trying to catch me in a lie, but there was no lie to catch. Anyone who has had flashbacks (and plenty of people who haven't) can understand that it is absolutely possible to feel fear despite knowing that they are safe.

Another thing she said was that my baby, Ivy, wasn't real. She asked, ""how can you miss something that isn't real?"" But Ivy was real. Is real. I know that everything would have been different if I had carried her to term. She wouldn't have been mine, I'd have given her to someone who was capable of caring for her and giving her everything she needed. Does that mean I can't mourn her? Does that mean she was never mine to begin with? I know the answer to those questions is ""no,"" but why would she say such a thing? It doesn't make sense.  

I've been mulling all of this over in my head for three days now. I know I just need to talk to her, but I'm so desperate for some sense of understanding. I need to know why she would say these things. This session was too much for me to handle. I feel myself slipping back into the headspace that I was in over the summer. I'm not suicidal, but I'm not far from that. I've made so much progress in the last few months. All I want right now is to keep moving forward, but this feels like I just fell flat on my back. 

Any insight that you may have to offer will be greatly appreciated. I really don't want to start over with a new therapist. This one has already helped me so much. I just want to keep going.",29Dec2018,1
