0,"I always feel really lonely. Even when I see my friends regularly the instant they’re not there anymore I feel lonely and isolated. I have no ability to hold onto the interaction I had and let that keep me from feeling lonely.

The loneliness is the last bastion of my depression and I don’t know how to solve it. I feel undesirable and I don’t know how to stop feeling like that. 

Sometimes the loneliness is very overwhelming and consumes all of my thoughts.

Any advice is appreciated. ",28Jul2018,3

3,"So, as a kid from the age 5-6 up, I started getting terrible dizzy spells where I would almost fall over for no reason and out of nowhere. I'm not sure if this started first or if the perception problems started first. From about the same time, I also seemed to sit back in my head and see the world as an observer, and, frighteningly, myself almost as an automaton. I really started to question what real perception was and never seemed to recover from these questions. The dizzy spells subsided as I got older, but I was never able to kick the feeling that I'm sitting 6 inches deep in my eyes. I wasn't sure where to ask a question like this, but I thought this might be a good place. Sort of along with this has come terrible clinical depression and anxiety that couldn't be kicked with diet, exercise, sleep, socializing, etc. I guess I just want to see if there are other people that have felt this way, whether this has a name, and what sorts of things can be done to mitigate it.

4,"My dad abused me until I was 18. He was unpredictable but a completely different person when he would “snap.” He was terrifying and would scream insults, throw things at me, lock me in his closet until I stopped crying, or other creative punishments. I have a younger brother that never got any of it and my mom only would if she tried to intervene. She was an alcoholic who couldn’t take care of herself so I couldn’t rely on her. 
By the time I was 11 or 12, I taught myself to remain stoic and not react to make it end faster. I loved him and sometimes he was great and normal but he’d black out from drinking constantly. I was always on edge. The day after his episodes, he’d try to buy me things to apologize. I vividly remember a night where I thought he might kill my mom and I. 
As soon as I got to college, my boyfriend at the time suggested I seek out counseling. After verbally abusing and controlling him, I was wearing him down. I’ve done it in two relationships and it felt completely out of my control. My relationships would spiral out of control fast and I could just watch. They both broke up with me after over a year and a half of abuse. I was put on antidepressants and I’m finally on medication that works for me after 3 years. 
My dad died suddenly from a brain tumor he didn’t realize he had at the end of my freshman year of college in 2016. My family kept me in the dark for the week and a half he was in the hospital so I never got to see him while he was still somewhat lucid. That was traumatic in itself as I never got the chance to have a good relationship with him. I felt like as I got older and he could relate to me more, maybe seeing me as a person, things got better between us. It honestly seemed like he couldn’t control his emotions and he was constantly paranoid. 
I went back to school after his death and that was tough, but I made it through the semester. Upon returning home, my mom kicked me out within 2 days of me being there. My dad was so controlling and left her so suddenly that she could barely function. She cut me off financially and I was homeless for over a month until my grandparents took me in. I was working full time but had nothing in my bank account so I ended up sleeping with an older guy for money twice. I hate to think about it. This was the lowest point of my life. I didn’t talk to my mom until months later and we’re just getting to a normal relationship a couple years later. 
I’ve been quiet and nervous my whole life, but in the past couple years I’ve been completely devoid of emotions. I can read people well but they get uncomfortable interacting with me. I’m not approachable or someone that people want to be around. People constantly tell me they can’t read me, especially guys I’ve pursued. I feel like I have no life in me and I’m afraid that I’ll never connect with anyone. I haven’t been in a relationship because I’m afraid of the erratic way I act when committed to someone. Is it possible that I could change or is this a permanent result of the abuse and trauma? I’ve tried talk therapy and grief counseling. I’m sorry this is so long, but I feel like I never got a chance to be normal.",28Jul2018,18
5,"So this guy I used to know took advantage of me in the not so distant past. He would urge me to smoke a lot of weed (like I would take a couple puffs then he would be like here have another and whatever and yeah I was weak I could have not smoked but I did and so my fault for putting myself in this situation) but so I would be very high and when I get that high my panic response kicks in and I have attacks (my pseudoseizures-absence, grand mal, etc) and I wouldn't be able to move or talk and we would.... y'know be intimate. Sometimes I was coherent enough to be um active but like it was a self destruct thing cuz whenever I have sex I hate myself and whenever I smoke weed (which I no longer do) I hate myself. So like I would like turn off the part of me that makes me want to make good choices and just give in to all the bad choices. Well we ended things and he was pretty mean at the end, like he wanted to whore me out, like he wanted guys to pay to have sex with me. 

So what happened was I joined a dating app and then it popped up that he ""liked"" me. I just straight up started panicking cuz just seeing him. Remembering all that crap. Just everything and just no no no nononononoNONONO!

7,"Hi,

I just went through a horribly scary experience, and this is far from the first time this has happened. Please help this is destroying my life.

I'm 25 and have gradually developed a pretty intense fear of people. Today, I was going to go out for dinner with my brother and 2 of his friends at 7 PM. I can deal with that because its only a few hours and I can prepare myself before going out. 

However, they ended up coming over to our place (i live with my brother temporarily) at like 3:30 PM, while I was in the bedroom taking a nap. I heard them come in. I had no idea this was going to happen. The thought of going out of the room, not knowing how many people were over (it sounded like a lot), knowing I'd be stuck there for hours is just INSANELY scary to me. So I ended up pretending I was sleeping for hours, just to hide away in the room feeling soooo goddamn shitty, because I've been doing this for way too long, because its just pathetic to be this scared and not do anything about it, but I did.. I didn't even walk out of the room to pee. So i just felt shitty for hours until they FINALLY left for dinner at around 6:30 PM and now hopefully they won't come back to the house (but knowing my brother they probably will.. he is social)

I've done variations of ""hide in my room when people are around"" in hundreds of situations for years now, ghosted people dozens of times, lost dozens of friends. It just feels fucking miserable every time. But the surprise of them coming over unexpectedly just terrifies me and walking out feels like I will get ambushed. 

This kind of crap carries over into work too and is partly the reason I've lost a few jobs.. I'm just soo tired of this shit, what do I do?? I know exposure is recommended, but that is in gradual increments I have control over.. I haven't really worked up the courage to do that either, and for now I'm living with my brother who has friends over all the time and I have no control over when these people come, how long I spend with them etc. and I fucking hate it.",28Jul2018,1

i am a cynical man-child, and i exist in the space between a functioning adult and a beast, unbound to any complex thought or notion. I am eighteen years of age, born on the 17th of april, 2000. my life to this point in time has been spent almost exclusively in the towns of Coos Bay, Oregon and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Riding in a dirty commercial box full of societal middle-aged rejects, so similar and yet so different. a lifetime of decisions and actions i have yet to make etched on their saggy pockmarked faces, the only thing separating me from them. on my way to Seattle, i reflect on every second processed and forgotten that's led me to the stained patterned seat that i sit on now. this bus smells like old fermented indian food.

i lack the knowledge. i'm deluded and angry with life. a need to drown out the outside worlds distressing constant feed of information and a cruel inside feed of self-induced despair and a perpetual child with an addictive personality and manic nature might find refuge in substances. marijuana, cigarettes, alcohol, mescaline, ketamine, amphetamines, LSD, Dimethyltriptalene, cocaine, and the kinetically, magically, wonderfully twisted psilocybin. 

The original idea for psychedelic and stimulant abuse was a belief that mind-bending would produce understanding. 
I am infinitely more confused than i began. not only am i incapable of being honest with others, but also with myself. a search for meaning has became a descent into a new lifestyle. is this madness or escapism? have i rendered my mind catatonically inert? 

what i remember of elementary school is a feeling of falling behind, separated from the rest as a black sheep by my refusal to ever participate or complete assignments. i'm not sure how the divide from public school and academics began. i followed the same structure of reckless abandon in high school that consistently intensified  not because i wasn't interested in pursuing becoming some form of scholar or intellectual.  i have always beat the devil out of my own drum and the fact has been my driving force. i just have not identified or connected with any authority or teacher figure that i've met personally. i do not trust others because i do not know anyone's motivations except my own. this applies to peers, disguised predators residing in every corner and crevice, companies, corporations and government. 

people live their own reality by their habitual perceptions. i need to pay attention to the Now and the Forever. it's the only way i can be of any service to the common oppressed man. Only by seeing what's really here, and discerning the difference from fact and fiction can I contribute to the collective of genuine good will. kill the cyst, keep the foot.

american values are horseshit. laws are cruel and unjust. i feel the need to commit acts of cosmic justice to tip the scales. but i am not a savage nor do i feed the hateful dog in me and everybody else. i let the filthy dog starve until it's ribs protrude, it keels over and it's despicable life force disperses for decency in its place. 

i barely eat. i get high all day and then get higher at night. what the fuck man?

its crazy how i dont have a stable sense of self at all.  one second i am trying to tell myself to 'grow up' and that playing videogames is childish and stupid and immature, and i should sell all my videogame stuff; the next day i feel the opposite, i can claim playing videogames as a positive part of my identity, i enjoy playing as long as im not being obsessive about it.  i go to the comfortable living room to play a videogame on my handheld when my mom tells me i need to go to the basement so she can watch her tv shows in the living room.  suddenly i dont want to play videogames anymore, because going to the basement feels entirely different than sitting in the living room.  i also feel stupidly shamefully childish for feeling this way, yet this is how i feel (so i would appreciate it if you didnt shame me for it, i am already very aware of how childish it may sound).

14,"**Warning: mentions of suicide, self-harm, self-loathing, depression, anxiety.**

Sometimes what causes me to feel like shit is /that/ I feel like shit. 

From early childhood, I’ve had an image of what a proper, respectable person should be. They should be there for others, when others need help. They should be brave. They should persevere, despite all odds. They should be confident. And they’re tough. They don’t whine, or complain, or act spoiled. They behave with humility, and are not selfish, and put others’ needs above theirs. 

And that sounds beautiful, and wonderful, and honorable. And it is. So I lived it. I volunteered to go first when they gave us vaccines at school, relishing in the chance to feel tougher than the other girls. I got stung by a wasp and bragged about how it didn’t even hurt. I never asked for toys, or gifts, unless it was my birthday or something I had thought about for months beforehand. I would look at a classmate crying at her desk and comfort her but inside think, “I’m so glad I’m not weak and pathetic like that.” Then I’d go home, and cry in my bedroom, because if I cried in the living room my mother would yell at me to grow up and stop crying over every little thing. 

Apparently, my displays of emotion were too much. At home, I got labelled as ‘sensitive’. I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to emotionally handle the real, adult world like living in a dorm by myself. And I did everything to prove them wrong. Finally, I packed up my bags, put on my big-girl shoes, and moved out from my family home. Determined that I wasn’t an emotional weakling, that I could handle anything life threw at me. 

I was diagnosed with depression (high functioning) in September, a month after I left, though I had begun to show symptoms months before, and had had panic attacks years before that. I was referred to a mental hospital. But I didn’t go, because that’s not a place for me. That’s a place for weak people, who cry because life’s unfair, who can’t handle it. Big girls don’t cry. 

It’s now been almost a year, and only now am I taking steps towards getting therapy, and medication, as well as trying to get a second diagnosis with GAD to allow me to get the medication I need. And I hate it. Depression makes me hate myself, for the reason of having depression. It convinces me that it’s not a real disease, even though I’m a biologist and I know better than that. It convinces me it’s a lie made up by sensitive college students afraid of the real world. It convinces me that everyone was right all along - that I am weak, useless, not good enough to be the strong, respected person I want to be. 

Who do you turn to, when you’re convinced everyone will hate you for being a whiny little brat? How do you reach out, when the reason you hate who you are is that you reach out too much? It makes more sense to turn it all on yourself. Berate yourself, punish yourself, until you suck it up, get your shit together, stop asking for people’s sympathy and treating yourself with kid gloves so that you feel safe and not like you’re going to fall apart. It gets to the point where you become afraid of not feeling depressed or anxious, even terrified of feeling okay. Feeling okay means you’re missing something. It means you’re in denial, and that’s a thing weak people do. You have to confront it, and feel every ounce of pain with your entire being. /Feel/ how much you messed up, how absolutely /pathetic/ you are, and then go and fucking /fix it/. Except eventually you hate yourself so much, you don’t want to fix it. You don’t deserve to have it fixed. You just want everything to be okay again. But you can’t get out of bed in the morning, because hating yourself is exhausting…

15,"I just saw my psychiatrist and I just feel really sad and fucking angry. I feel like he doesn't listen to me and doesn't take my concerns or issues seriously enough to give me a diagnosis, so I can finally get fucking treatment and not feel like shit. I made a whole ass post about what I've been going through since I started day treatment and began addressing the things that happened to me when I was a kid and I even showed that post to him, and he still said that he's keeping my diagnosis as only depression and anxiety, even though even the counselors at my intensive outpatient program have said that what I'm going through is PTSD. My psychiatrist did say that he wanted to track my mood for possible PTSD, but it just fucking pisses me off so much that I told him every fucking thing that I'm experiencing but he doesn't take my word seriously enough to give me an official diagnosis so I can get proper treatment already, and I already have major issues talking to people about this kind of stuff because I have this intense fear that they won't believe me or that they'll think I'm making it up for attention, idk why I've just always had this fear when it come to talking about personal stuff, even when I was a kid. and his reaction just makes me feel like he doesn't believe me and makes me feel like what I'm going through isn't real or something.

17,"I hope he doesn't see this but i have to say something about what happened and what he did.Here is a little backstory of the events that led up to this.

I met this boy in 7th grade in my humanities class. He was in 8th grade. Anyways we became friends and he was okay but looking back there was something a little off about him.
He would always do things that would get him attention like be obnoxiously loud and do wired shit and it would make people look. This should of been red flags for me to get away from him.

He graduated at the end of that year and went to high school. I started high school the year after him. He was alright for a little while like his old self but then he started to doing stuff to me that i will never forget.

All of this happened at lunch. I was at lunch one day and i don't remember what we were talking about but he said that if i were unconscious he would rape. That caught me off gard like wtf why would say something like this. 

After this day he started harassing me like he would call me his slave and his sex slave. Sometimes he would grab my ass and other times another boy would join in. I tried to sit with other people to get away from him but he always followed every where i went. Even if i was standing in a big group of people he would always find me. I tried to pretend i was listening to music but he would always come over. I remember i would try to get to my next class as fast as i could to avoid him. Me and my friend would hide from him at lunch.

I regret telling someone at my school like a counselor or the principal when he was enrolled at my school but i never did. I regret not making a scene at lunch or standing in the big group. Someone could of helped me but nobody ever did. 

I told my mom and she wanted to do something about it but i told her i would take care of it. I was always scared of going to school especially lunch cause i was worried i would see him. He left my school after that year.

I title of this is i need to do something is because i recently found out from a friend that he watches child porn and is a pedophile. He sent my friend some child porn but he deactivate it. 

I need to do something to save little kids and teenagers from him hurting them and giving them trauma. I cant go to the police because i have no evidence. 

I have ptsd because of him and i thought i saw him at the gym and i freaked out. Last time i heard of him he graduated from high school early. He tried to follow me on social media but i blocked him on everything.

Im still recovering. I hope my story can help someone.

I have done therapy for years and I stopped for 2 months. I am going to start again in a week. Then alternate every other week with my therapist then psychiatrist. 

Has anyone ever really recovered from PTSD? Any ideas or suggestions would be helpful and appreciated. 

PTSD comes from childhood trauma of abuse, neglect, molestation, and witnessing a family member pass (while I was alone). The family member who passed was the only mother figure I had. 

I’ve had to withdraw all contact with my family to keep my location private and TRY to heal. 

This is affecting my marriage, my work, and my interpersonal relationships. I have become more withdrawn and have lost all confidence in myself.

I have lost all desire to exercise, meal prep and eat healthy, stick to any routine, or engage really with anyone. I can hardly sleep on a regular schedule and struggle to wake up for work and stay focused on my work.

I have never had a close relationship with my parents, but three years ago, my father told me that he was gay and his marriage to my mother was essentially a contract so they could both have children. Naturally I was in shock for a few months, but the feelings of anxiety and fear haven’t gone away. I still have nightly anxiety dreams about it where I wake up crying and sweating and unable to breathe, and it’s getting to the point where I get pretty severe panic attacks from being around him for too long. 
I don’t know why he told me this completely unprompted, but now he brings it up every time we’re alone like it’s some kind of fun inside joke. He loves to point out men he thinks are attractive in front of me. 

I’m losing my mind over this. I’m in college but I’m forced to live at home for financial reasons, so I stay out of the house as much as possible but I still have to see him every day. I desperately want therapy, but have no access to it because I can’t exactly tell him about the problems I’m having, and my medical stuff is through their insurance.

21,"Hi, I'm 25 and I have a long history of mental illness. I also suspect I'm somewhere on the spectrum. But I haven't gotten an official diagnosis, as I've never gotten the opportunity to do that.

I've had major sensory issues since I was a kid. My headband/accessories had to be a certain way, the seams on my socks could not touch my little toe, stuff like that. It made me so physically uncomfortable if anything was sitting weird on my body. I'm constantly finding sensory things to do, such as rub materials or pull at fibers of cloth. I have a lot of misophonia related issues too. 

There are certain things in clothes that touch me in such a way that makes me have fits when I try to wear them, and it's really embarrassing to admit as an adult that I feel this way. It is horrible, though. I can't wear certain things because the feeling is so distressing that I can't focus on anything else. Believe me, I have tried to ignore it, focus my mind on other things. I've worn certain things for years and every day it causes me to lose focus on school, work, etc.. It was only when I avoided these clothes that I felt better and was able to do better with my daily tasks.

There is no rhyme or reason for any of these things to make me feel this way, but it doesn't stop me from feeling distressed when I feel or hear them. Is there a way to get rid of this, or to alleviate these feelings, or is it something I have to deal with? I've been to therapy for years (had to recently stop because I have little money and time) so I have a really good idea of how to deal with things from the root causes, and how to identify the root causes of my issues. It is how I have gradually learned to heal from my OCD. But things like this have no real causes. It just is.  I guess I have to approach this from a different kind of angle. How can I get started on dealing with this, if I can? Anyone have experiences with this?

I had a handful of jobs, usually weekend stuff, nothing major just paying for gas money and a few classes here and there.  My brother was out of state for college and we'd been sharing my grandparents' old car ever since he got his license. So while he was gone I could use it whenever and everything was kosher. 

Cut to him moving back to town and pretty much using the car non stop. I mean taking it for over two consecutive weeks at a time. He got a job pretty full time and said that he'd get his own ride soon. 

That was a year and a half ago. 

Since then, I haven't been able to get a job since I live in a tiny town and having a car for one fucking afternoon is damn near impossible. During the school year I have classes and I have to schedule around his shit and usually end up having to wait around for \~3 hours before or afterwards. During the summer I have one thing I do once a month on the weekend and the only solution is to drop him off at work and wait around for \~3 hours until my thing starts, fun shit like that.

Oh and he moved an hour and a half away this spring without asking or even telling me about it while we're both ""sharing"" a car. So that just makes this stuff even stupider.

I'm not trying to be entitled or anything, I know the universe doesn't owe me a car and I really want to work for it and buy my own, but the only job nearby is third shift at a gas station and that's minimum wage and gonna fuck up my sleep/school/social schedules so hard. 

I'm going insane here. Have cabin fever in the middle of summer because I'm broke, can't go anywhere, have people calling me a lazy piece of shit left and right, and even scheduling one or two things to do a week has become such a god damn pain in the ass I don't know what to do.",28Jul2018,1
25,"So recently something has been happening that I can’t explain and it’s starting to make me super paranoid. I’ve struggle with anxiety and depression for about three years now and I’ve always been a very emotional person. But lately, something’s been off. I’ll be talking to a friend or family member and then out of nowhere, I start to experience these instance spikes of negative emotion. These spikes can be so intense at times, that it’s almost metally debilitating. The two most recent examples are as follows; my mom mentioned my high school homecoming and I started to feel an overwhelming sense of dread and sadness, and my stepmom mentioned rap music/hip-hop and I started to experience raw unfiltered rage (this one really confuses me because I love hip-hop).

30,"I have been a very hateful and disgusted person because of unresolved trauma at a young age. Currently unable to get help. For context I am a teenager with little access to therapy or counseling, and the free help you find online like 7cups isn’t fulfilling for me in the slightest.

So I’ve gotten thru w/ mental health problems that have added to my constant anger and aggression alone, but sometimes online friends help. Most of the time I’m stuck by myself due to time zones and not wanting to be a burden to them.

I’ve smoldered my anger and hatred in middle school, specifically 6th grade so it would be manageable, but thru middle school as I got teased and bullied it just grew and grew. I’m now entering highschool as a freshman, and all my intrusive thoughts are of middle school, how I wanted everyone to feel hurt and in pain. I’ve been journaling as way of self help, and currently that’s my only form of ‘therapy.’
Sorry for the long post, didn’t mean to post my whole life’s story

But in moments where I let my guard down for just a millisecond around my emotions, it’s like the floodgates are opened and I feel myself lost in them. And in these moments of pain and anguish caused from the anger I have received as a gift of being born, the need to have people feel what I feel grows. 

I feel like my anger is controlling me and it disgusts me to be myself

35," For context: My parents are divorced for awhile now, and i guess their distaste for each other has fermented over time. Im in high school and my mom has custody and i see my dad like once or twice a week. Naturally, im more attuned to my moms beliefs because of this. I think she slowly fed me the all bad things about my dad, so now i have this skewed mental image of him. Now more recently, my dad has opened up to me about his feeling toward her and my one of bigger brother.

Ive have idolized these two for most of my childhood, and my dad basically highlighted their flaws and this messed with me. He essentially broke down their characters during a rant to me, which started by me basically verbally abusing my brother in front of him. Its important to note that i am dealing with some sort of mental illness, whether its depression or depersonalization, silently. Also important to note, i have been pulling away, emotionally, for about a week now. So i sat stone-faced while he talked to me. I let not a single word or emotion pass out of my filter. Whats extra shitty, hes is the only one who seems to care that something off about my demeanor. And yet i pull away from him. What seems to be my only support, i block away. 

I am so disgusted with myself. I want it to just stop. I want all my cares to go away. I know it wont happen unless i end it early. I hate having to choose. Im internally sad, hateful. I dont see the light at the end of the tunnel.",28Jul2018,1

Every time I talk to a friend or someone , why do i somehow slip up and tell them things that shoudlnt be said. I dont understand why i do it......i dont know why i think its okay to do it? I constanlty tell myself to stop doing it, yet i still do it..... I can't remember when it started but its gotten to the point that if I don't stop, it will ruin everything I value in my life. (which resulted due to my careless action to one of my best friends, to my family) 

Do i just tell them because i don't feel like i am enough for them? Do i feel like i need something to prove to them? 

I am reluctant to get specific, but some examples include such variety as; lying to my sister about preheating the oven, lying to my friends about how i am feeling, lying to myself that i can do it. It's just total bs, and every time someone asks me a simple question, half the time the answer is a lie. I can't explain why I do it, because I don't want to, and I can see how much it's affecting the people around me.

Funny enough, I'm most afraid of the same things that occur during school trips, which is why I avoided them. Just eating with someone else makes me feel anxious, sleeping in the same room is nearly impossible. I hate it when people look at me and feel judged. And I *really really* don't want anyone to touch me, like anyone, ever, at all. Not even family. Not pets. I can't shower when someone is nearby, and I for sure *physically* can't use the toilet when someone is in the same room, even with closed doors, or if I'm afraid of being watched. Prison-style facilities are a literal nightmare in that regard. Another thing they do is forced physical exams. Like, fuck, no. I'd rather have someone stab me with a knife. How is this fair? Another thing I'm scared of is medication. I have an idea of what medication they drug you up with, and the side effects freak me out. Just SSRI was bad enough. I know I'd have no choice so I'd have to submit to whatever they want me to do and that is terrifying. It would make me feel even more disgusted by myself.

Im 16 years old, and a few months ago, my girlfriend (Who I love and care so much about) went out of town for awhile with her family, and at night I like to sneak out and walk around, or sometimes I hang out with friends at a river or their pool, I would never tell my family that I sneak out though, I know I would be sent away to a military school or to live with my grandmother states away if I did.

Well one of her best friends invited me over to her house to watch a few movies, and in the back of my head I knew it probably wasen't the best idea for me to go to her house, and I feel horrible that I did, but she ended up hitting on me and one thing moved to another thing and we ended up losing our virginity to eachother.

I fealt guilt the second everything hit me, and I wasen't able to sleep for a few days after, realizing that I did something so horrible, getting cheated on hurts, so I knew the feeling, but I did it anyway and I was not able to get that guilt off my chest. So I told my girlfriend everything, and she wasen't mad at me, she understood mistakes happen, and only requested for me not to talk to the other girl anymore.

After I told the girl, that I could not talk to her anymore, and that I'm sorry but it was a horrible mistake, she didn't take it well, and she ended up hurting herself, and harrassing my girlfriend, they ended up getting in a heated arguement, and from that point on, me and my girlfriend blocked any contact with the person. A few days go by and a few of her friends start harrassing me saying how horrible of a person I am, and that she tried to kill herself, so I contacted her and told her people care about her and that she should not do it.

After the talk I had with her she began harrassing my girlfriend again, so I blocked contact with her again, about a month go by and I decide to unblock her, she notices and messages me, but I ignore it and don't open it, a few days go by, and she sends a picture, I take about 4 hours to finally decide to open it, and its a paragraph about how she is sorry about what she did and it showed her bloody wrist, and it said she has a gun at her disposal and that she is gonna end her life. I was to scared to call the police, I don't know if it would have made a difference, it was 5am, I tried calling her for over 20 times, I tried reaching out to her family and friends, but nothing.

I feel like if I would have went to the police, my family would have found out I snuck out and had sex with someone, or that I could've been charged for murder because of my actions leading up to everything, and I still feel like something is gonna happen to me, but I don't want to worry about that, I feel selfish if I think like that.

That's when I started exercising and eating right and doing sports. I got happier until about a year later when something really fucked up happened in my relationship and translated over to my group of friends and kind of caused a divide and since then my mental health has been at its worst in 7 years I'm on certain meds but can't even get them refilled because my doctor is on vacation. I can't talk to anyone else but my mom sister and unle about it because mental illness doesn't exist to the rest of my family.

47,"I'm not sure if there is a better subreddit available for this.

I find myself wanting to be sexually desirable to people but I don't act on it, mainly since I have low self-esteem and confidence. I don't really desire the relationship nor am I looking for one either. I just want people to touch me - to find me desirable, attractive and worthwhile because it feels good. It makes me feel whole and complete. It makes me feel happy.

I don't exactly know where it has come from, but I think the most reasonable possibility is my last relationship. At that time, I didn't trust my family or was close to them and didn't really have any friends. I thought I was never going to have any sort of meaningful connection or purpose, and that I was going to die alone by suicide. I then had this person that started talking to me. Eventually, we started dating almost two years later. It was really the first time I felt loved, as we kissed and touched. They broke it off a couple of months later, due to my extremely poor mental health at the time beginning to affect them too. We're still on good terms.

Despite being almost a year since then, I still desire them. I want to start over again to have them make me feel loved and whole again, though I know it's not a good decision. I fantasise about it sometimes. Those fantasies usually end up to the point of being sort of a BDSM thing where I'm collared and I serve them. A part of it isn't really BDSM though, since aspects of the fantasy aren't healthy/consensual. I guess it doesn't really matter what they do to me, as long as they give their attention and love to me. As long as I feel like I'm special to them. They could cut me open and I would be okay with it. It would obviously hurt, but I don't feel like that would matter to me since all I desire is to be loved. I guess I'm also sort of isolated in that fantasy.

I'm not in danger though, since they have zero interest in pursuing anything of a sexual nature. I also don't really know why I think of love as being of a sexual nature. I am seeing a mental health professional but I couldn't find it in myself to explain this certain issue this deeply to them. I think I'm ashamed, embarassed by it.

51,"Hello! 
The reason I'm making this post is because I don't know what I'm dealing with (or if I'm dealing with anything). I've been googling around, but I feel like none of the things that pop up really is what I experience.
Thing is, the last 12 months or so I've been a bit down. Not depressed or anything, just the average 20-something college student kind of down, worried about the future and about things not being sorted out. There were times when I felt like I didn't want to live anymore, or that there was really no point in living (not that I wanted or planned suicide, I would never commit suicide). However that stuck in the background, though not controlling me completely. These past 6 months however I noticed a rise of stress in my everyday life, and in May this year everything kind of just crashed for me and that's when I realized I may be dealing with quite a high, unhealthy level of stress. I did some online-tests about stress, some of which was made particularly for students at my university and found out that I could be at risk of a burnout.
From this I've concluded that yes, I am at a high level of stress and I'm going to seek help for that. Thing is, the clinic that I'm going to have free consultation and care for students (a university clinic), but that also means that they aren't open during summer so I have to wait a while before I can talk to anyone professional.
Aside from the stress, when I get really upset about anything (once it was from just missing the bus, even though there was a bus just one hour later) I start crying and hyperventilating, and I just can’t calm down to the point that I think I'm going to pass out from not breathing properly. Always in retrospect I'm like ""it wasn’t such a big deal...I’m so lame"", but there and then It's like the worst that could've happened. Once just recently I got the same reaction while driving, because all the roads I usually take was closed down due to a big event in town and I didn’t know where to drive. Same thing happened, and this time it got to the point where I couldn't feel my face anymore (even though I wasn't hyperventilating as hard as I usually do). I wonder if anyone knows if this is related to the stress I feel? When asked about it I've just called it a panic attack, while after googling it clearly isn't. It is always triggered by something that makes me upset.


How should I deal with this until I can get professional help?

52,"I'm not sure if anyone can help me, but I believe I have PTSD. Let me provide some background information: My name is Adam, I am 20 years old, I have no job (currently), and I am not attending any university/college-although, I do have a semester of some time at a university. 

I grew-up in an very abusive home as a child. My father would hit my mom a lot, and he would come home from work mad if anything was not to his liking. As a punishment, he would often want to spank me (my mom never approved of this), or he would take us to a random room in our house, turn off the lights, and keep the door held shut tight with his hands-I do have a fear of the dark, is this why??? My mother and father divorced when I was 8, and any time my father had us on his weekend, and every Wednesday, there would (almost) always be a fight. My father would come around off and on in the following years, but no consistent schedule. I added this because I have read articles and heard from many credible sources, that children who grow-up in an abusive home tend to get PTSD. I apologize if this is a myth. I don't mean to come off as miseducated, I would just like to know if my concern is rational. 

A few other things I have noticed in recent years: in late 2017, around October, I started working at the local county jail. I had no incidents with the inmates, but more with my co-workers. I got into this fight with one of my co-workers over something stupid, and it has had an impact on me ever since. I often place myself back in this situation, and I have this intense feeling of rage come over me. I'll just be standing there and for a brief second, it feels like I am back in the jail, standing there, having the argument. Almost like a flashback that I am physically in (if that makes any sense). 

I also had an incident with one of my family members on Wednesday of this past week. I won't go into details because it is too personal. 

Sorry for the novel sized post. If anyone has any idea about PTSD, or is in the medical field, I will take any advice you are willing to give. I am just looking to mainly know I'm not insane. Sidenote: if my stories were too vague, or you need more information to determine if I have PTSD, I will be more than happy to message you in private.

I tend to need to have a TV show or Youtube video going so that I don't feel so lonely, even though my family sleeps next to me.

I sometimes even feel abandoned and begin to feel a little panicky as well. When I was a kid and I was with others and they would move on before I was ready (like leave the building as a group without me) and would almost immediately have a panic attack, and I think this feels kind of similar.

I am a 20M, I work nights, and I usually take some melatonin to sleep (although this doesn't seem to affect the issue at all). I just wish I could start getting up earlier so I could work on getting my Driver's license.

56,"Good day people of Reddit!

I know I am mentally different, but I want to be sure. If I am in a wrong subreddit, let me know.

So last few months were...tough for me, but let's start with beginning. This will be long and might be boring, so be prepared lel.

I always was a shy, introvert, even a little antisocial type of person, but with good intentions and heart, helpful as much as I could.
I was like that since 6 years old. My father always meant everything to me. Mother? Nah, I want to go with father! Father father father!
One day when I woke up he wasn't there to say hello. He was at work in different country.
I was 6 so I didn't understand that, I thought he left me because I did something wrong.
I like to say that is the day I became who I am now. Rather shy person, that wants to help but is also really untrustful when it comes to others. 
Years passed, I went to school, got few friends, few enemies, my mental state improved highly, as when I started going to school I could just cry in a corner for no reason, and after few years I learned to laugh from my own mistakes and behave like normal person and such.
And also, parents. Father, who worked at company, was not with me for 2-3 months, then he was returning for 2 weeks, and returning to work, and cycle was continuing.
I never looked at him the same since ""he left me"". Of course now it's all in the past but we talk about those other times...
My mother. She always was carring more about my younger brother. Never really did much to me, treated her like mother, she treated me like a kid, but not as her own own.
Never learned to ride a bike, or swim, or even tie fucking shoes. My brother did because she taught him. I did not, even today I can't tie my shoes, and I am 18. Pathetic, right?
All she did was putting into my head this: your future matters, so be sure to get best grades possible to get the best job. Everyone was saying that, I, like a blind person, followed that.

Also, here is an important detail.
Games.
My father bought me first console when I was 7, a gift for ""leaving me"".
Since that, I have fallen in love with gaming since they reminded me of my father.
Funny how now he says all I do is play games, when I am like that because of him, heh.

So, life was going fine....ish. I was myself and it worked out pretty well, got friends got enemies, passed schools, got grades and such.

My mother chosen me a new school, because I guess where I will go for next 3-4 years is not important, she should decide not me.
But luckily, class was great. 
Then, my father stopped working at company.
I was 16 then and that was probably the biggest change.
After 10 years of seeing a person every 3 months for 2 weeks, you feel like in home, there is only 3 people, not 4.
But I was happy back then, he could help me in school, maybe we could go places...and such.
Shamefully, it never was like that.
Then I started...changing. 
Seeing world differently.
I spotted that, nothing changed since father returned. I was still going to school, I was still returning and going out with friends.
Everything was so...repetitive. 
Anyway, school started, I got to new class, it was fine but...those changes in my head, not worked. I didn't manage to pass a class, as my father never helped me. Pssh, that was normal for mother.
For me, that was a big failure. A lost war. I didn't spend whole year to give up.
It was too late tho. Start a new class. I don't have a choice, do I?
New class. New changes in my head.
Hate. Why people are so...so weird? Why they pretend that they love to do same thing over and over? Why we even do this? We learn some stupid crap we will never use, because some donkey who is a leader thinks this education system is good. Why I pick same road over and over? Every single time I was going to school, seeing those people, it was triggering me.
We are doing same thing, over and over and over, expexting shit to change. Then I understood.
I am insane. From mental perspective. I was..scared of those people, basically. I quitted school. Never finished that class. I still didn't get my papers back, I hate that place. What my mother and father did? Did they kick me out? Helped me? No. They just went quiet for 2 days, then everything returned to normal things. Like I never quitted school, never ruined my future of getting a job. They only scared me that I will be homeless one day, and I will die.
My responce? ""Everyone will die, Father. Everyone will.""
After that, I..I dunno, I was just, doing normal home stuff for them. One day saw my ""friend"" who backstabbed me. He laughed at me, going with his girlfriend, said that I am pathetic.
Never helped, and he never did. He wasn't my friend. Just a person that pretends to be one.

After that, I stopped quitting from home. While I type this, it's about 3rd month when I haven't went outside. Shame, as I love outside, I love travelling. 
I...eh...my parents still don't care about me.
Now I am more closed than ever, scared to go outside. I am weak. Mentally and physically.
I will never get a job I want, I will never visit certain countries. I am fucked, basically.
All I have is gaming. Gaming, that my father started and says ruined my life because I spend so much time at it.
No support, no caring, no help, no nothing.
I wake up, I drink tea, I go play games, then I eat dinner and check stuff on phone, then I take a nap, go play games, check stuff on phone and sleep.

Weirdest part? I don't really feel...suicidal. I don't want to kill myself or something. I actually want to show everyone how wrong they are. I want to get my dream job, one way or another, I want to visit countries, and I want to get myself a nice home to say ""fuck you"" to my parents.

If you still read this, thanks.
If not, I don't care.

Point is, I am mentally sick, but I would like to know what sickness actually, is this a antisocial or what?

Also, there is a gaming disorder thing going on lately. Sounds like a cheap way to call someone a retard because he plays videogamss, but can I use it somehow?

Thanks for...whatever. Now when I think about this, why I even type this? Do I look for support? For help? The fuck I do here? Nothing will probably change. I am useless, let's be real.
I type here for attention? 
I think I will end here, post and see what happens. I need...help. But I also don't want any.

I...need help.

57,"I think I have depression, but I don’t know. I can distract myself from thoughts of suicide or self harm, but there is always a nagging feeling. Sometimes I just want to curls up in bed and die. One of the things I do to cope is pace around squeezing a hacky sack and telling my self “I’m okay”.

58,"For about 2 years now I developed this weird and rather exhausting tic...

It's really hard to explain - I press my tongue and kind of ""suck it"" against the hard and soft palate, it's a constant pressure and sucking of the tongue every second (as if I'm swallowing something, the rate of the movement going on), it makes me feel a bit sick.

I've had the ""closed throat"" feeling but this is very different... My jaw hurts really bad and my cheekbones as well. Also the tongue seems to taste sweeter or something since I started doing it. 

I could \*almost\* describe it as if you tried to swallow your tongue but instead it is hard pressed into the hard palate in constant motions. It stops without me realizing it when I'm around some people or I'm truly distracted but as soon as I'm just chilling out, specially on my own, it starts again... 

There is a possible link to anxiety but I've never heard of it nor anyone having this particular tic. Has anyone gone through such a weird habit? How can I stop it? I've tried everything, I'm constantly drinking liquids, using lollipops or chewing gum to stop it for a bit but it's starting to be a bit much for me to handle...  Thanks!",28Jul2018,1

I just start doing it and I don't even realize it, when I notice it I stop most of the time though. I remember I used to do the same thing when I was a child, but then I stopped. I'm 18 now.

62,I have a friend that tends to struggle quite a bit with her mental health. She has bipolar mood swings that often lead to her feeling “out of control” (her words) and disassociating. She has me listed as one of her main crisis supports and we talk a lot about things and what can help her feel better. I want to make her a book of things to help her feel in control or “grounded” that she can flip through when she’s spiraling. So what are some things that make you feel that way?

He is on probation (1 month till he is off) the hospital wont come get him unless he admits all this stuff and goes willingly and the only way to get him there is with a medical warrant which the cops are telling my mother that will effect his probation.

68,"Hey guys. I've suffered from chronic Depersonalization since 2008. I've been on a steady medication regimen of Lamictal (100 mg), Klonopin (.5mg 3x daily), and luvox (50mg 3x daily). 

It's a lot of medication, but it's the only option. It's also the recommended treatment from the university of London Depersonalization research institute.

I'm lucky it works. It's helped me live a much better life. I still have Depersonalization, it's Just more in ""the background"".

I tried adderal and Ritalin to help with wakefulness, cognitive function, and feeling more ""present"" and they worked wonders. 

Unfortunately, for me I also have atypical facial pain which those drugs exacerbated.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I started Armodafinil.  
It's been a life saver for me. I'm more motivated, and more present - in the moment - less dissociated.

Most importantly, I'm awake. The armodafinil is negating the effects of my current medication regimen and keeping me awake. For the first time in a decade I've gone a day without napping (although I could).

One thing that's really surprised me about armodafinil is its ability to help me with intrusive thoughts. Whenever I have an intrusive thought I don't entertain it - its easily ignored.

I'm only using 50mg per day. 

However, yesterday and today I'm having a hard time listening. The words ""read"" in my head first before I actuality ""hear"" them... i also think what I'm going to say before I say it...

It's really frustrating and although I'm still far better on the armodafinil I'm wondering why this is happening and if the armodafinil is going to stop working altogether.

75,"So very recently I’ve been starting to hear voices and noises which I know aren’t real. It started about a month ago when I started hearing voices in my head that were very loud, almost unbearable. The voices were saying violent things in a very angry manner and it freaked me out, it was right before I went to bed and I was very tired so I assumed it could be that. But, a week later it happened again, this time around noon when I was relaxing at home. Except it was hard to understand what the voices were saying it just sounded like gibberish. It’s happened a few times since then, the most recent being yesterday. Usually it’s pretty fast paced and hard to hear but very aggressive. The strange thing about all of this is that’s the only symptom that matches what it could be, I don’t have depression, anxiety, psychosis, or any suicidal thoughts, and I’m very in touch with reality and the world around me. Schizophrenia also doesn’t run in either side of my family, not sure if that matters but if anyone can give me a bit of insight on this it would really help a lot. Also I’m 18 years old and Haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorders, I’m also in really good health physically and mentally. ",28Jul2018,4
76,"I could go on and write page after page about this, but im short on time, and im not sure if the specifics are necessary. 


Does anyone know what to do when you cant seem to forgive yourself for things that you perceive that youve done wrong, even when the truth is that you've done nothing wrong? Its messing with my relationships. I spend a lot of time thinking about what other people think about what im thinking, and inevitably i reach a point where im convinced that i fucked up. 


The thing is, this makes me seek to apologize, and put myself down, and give all the benefit of the doubt to the other person and not me. Inevitably they tell me ive done nothing wrong, and i thank them and go back to doing life. Shortly after, i begin to think that they now think somethings wrong, because i apologized. And i cant shake the feeling, which gets me more down, and i try to be a good person again to i apologize again. Sometimes this apology is for bringing up something small that the person does that bothers me, but i can't seem to feel justified, so i have to apologize for how i feel. 


This continues until the other person (im pretty sure) really thinks something is wrong or theres something im not telling them (which might be the case, i dont know anymore...i cant tell), and then the relationship is on shaky footing. And then, because its on shaky footing, i feel like i have to do something to repair and make up for what i did, so i apologize again. 

The cycle continues, and eventually they tell me ""you need to get your shit together. I dont know ehat you want from me. Obviously theres something wrong, but you're not telling me, you just keep acting like somethings bothering you"" and they push me away because they can't handle me, and just like that another friend lost. 


If it helps, my mom moved away when i was 7 or so, and my dad did a pretty terrible job of validating my fears and concerns growing up. He also had a good way of making me feel like bad things were my fault. 


I really dont know how to get through this, but it feels like its not even worth it to make close friends, because im just gonna find a way to fuck it up. 


...see..even there. Just then, that last thing i said. I dont think thats actually true, at least it wouldnt be if i didnt believe it. But i do.

When I was young she was very controlling,  violent and over protective and I don't believe she had any good intentions. She would beat me and my brother very aggressively almost every single week for the smallest things. We could barely do anything cause anything would piss her off and she'd beat us.  At some points it was so bad that it literally felt like she wanted to kill us.  One day I remember she was choking me in the middle of the dining room. With my brother she was ten times more aggressive. She always said she hated him for looking more like our father. She didn't allow us to go out with friends or talk to anyone on the phone. We were never able to speak against her. After she had my last two siblings who came from another father she went soft and treated them literally the exact opposite. She didn't beat them at all. She actually gave them permission to hang out with friends. She always claimed she never chose favorites but we all know she was obviously lying. When I was around 5 or 6yrs old the father of the last two siblings would choke me numerous times and always threaten me when ever she wasn't home and when she returned I would tell her about it but she refused to listen to me.

80,"I was very caring when I was younger. (Though I could be a bit oblivious to emotions at times.) This diminished a fair bit when I got older due to trauma. I still cared in a way I just didn't feel much emotion about it unless I was personally connected or involved in the thing upsetting the other person. Which is about as good as it'll ever get for me. I've been feeling less and less able to sympathize with others these last few months though. In particular the last couple weeks.

My grandmother, who I've never been close to, has a terminal cancer and so has moved in with us until she passes. I felt nothing when I heard the news of her cancer. I felt nothing when they said it would kill her. I am more annoyed and stressed at having been shoved into a situation where I have to be her caretaker than anything. Last night she had incredibly low blood sugar and could've died if she hadn't woken up to check it. I didn't feel concerned at all. I felt exactly the opposite. I felt disappointed, almost angry.

I should feel ashamed. Scared of myself for feeling that way about anybody. But I don't. I still feel emotions, don't get me wrong. I just can't empathize anymore. It's like that part of my brain has shut itself off. Logically I know this is wrong and I shouldn't feel this way but at times it feels like a relief because I know what I would've felt in the past. What I should feel. And I don't want to feel those things.

I would've been terrified of myself in the past. Horrified. Which I guess is why I'm here. I suppose I just want to know if it's a normal response to trauma for some people or if it's something else.
