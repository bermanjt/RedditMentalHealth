I arrive at appointment after rehearsing the whole way there and shaking. Only to have the doctor walk in with her side kick nurse.

In the last few years my social phobia has developed soo badly that i have started believing people can LITERALLY read my mind and make noises simultaneously to my actions as a response to my thoughts. For example if I think ""you guys are annoying"" I feel like someone will know it and slam a door or make any type of aggresive sound as a response.

This fear of people knowing what I think in turn gives me major anxiety &amp; panic attacks for noises they can potentially make if they are angry or nervous with my thoughts. I feel like this mind reading belief is the root cause of the fear of simultaneous noise that's why I want to tackle it however idk if it's schizophrenia or not.

I have been battling anxiety and i guess also depression for the past year, and have felt at various times that the only way out is death.

 Two days ago after work i was feeling extremely desperate from being rejected online and just hopeless about every aspect of my life.  Stupid I know, but i have major major rejection issues i guess? Traumatized from childhood rejection maybe, that i just can't seem to get over.

Anyway, all i remember is going to the kitchen, grabbing a dirty knife and trying to cut through my vein on my arm. Well the knife was too dull and I snapped out of it.

What the hell was that? I don't even remember my state of mind at that point other than pure emotional pain and rage, but then i also felt nothing.   It's weird - it was almost like i was in a daze.

Also - should i mention this to my therapist or since its passed just leave it be?",16Feb2018,1,

16,"Because...because...F*$&amp; WHY????

Because I am dragging around this 10,000 LB sack that is full of so many different anxieties and problems and forms of self loathing, because I experience rejection everywhere, all the time, seemingly more than most people because I seem to be very awkward and just don't know how to relate to people, or maybe I do but i expect too much from all people and I'm definitely too fucking naive. I've know I'm too naive and awkward since the beginning of time but can't...seem...to...change....GAH!

I'm venting because I obsess over how confused my mind is, because no amount of writing or talking seems to help me change the way I think and the way I feel. I'm venting because I have so many problems in my life, most of which probably don't count as problems, or for which I would probably be mocked or chided for thinking are problems, but which cause me significant distress anyway. I hate my job and have made flailing attempts to change it many times but with no success. Now I'm trying as best I can to let some actual dreams gestate and take shape while also trying to cope with two jobs I don't really like (well, one of them is ok but I probably won't stay at it for much longer, because in order to improve my financial goals that will enable my dreams I have to try and take another job that will pay me more but which I don't really want).

I have two jobs i don't like, but need in order to pay off debt. Two jobs which are DEFINITELY the best jobs I'm going to find in this economy, in this place, but which I can't walk away from (well, I might get a new job at one of the companies that will offer a lot of overtime and will get me out of debt faster but which I have heard from friends who work in that department that it sucks also which I know doesn't necessarily mean I will find it shitty but it's enough to give me anxiety about pursuing it).

I used to get bullied at work which makes my work life a living hell, even though I've got friends there now and have gone through every step a person could to deal with bullying, but even still I feel like the outcast, I feel ""broken"" and hated, and no anti-bullying work can improve how I feel about myself in relation to my coworkers, and the bullies can still shatter me with subtle jabs, be it a weird tone of voice or a funny look, e.g- things I can't call them out on or report, but which break me down and retrigger the old wounds.

Jesus, I hate even typing what I've typed so far because it's just a teeny tiny little slice of two parts of my life which hurt when there are so many more, each one full of weird nuances and things I can't really explain. I wish I was smart enough to find ways to compartmentalize and refine how I thought about my ""problems"" so it didn't always feel like such a confusing flurry of emotional triggers and fears. 

I constantly say stupid things.
I'm pathologically polite and inoffensive most of the time but explode with rage and resentment at other times. 
I feel hopeless, UTTERLY HOPELESS to change the depression or fear or anxiety, despite intense efforts over years...even though things have gotten better in many ways, I am still in such a touchy mental state most of the time that suicide is on my mind constantly.

I can't stand other people, mostly because I fear them, and yes, the cliche is true, because i hate myself, because I don't feel like I can keep my calm or stick up for myself effectively or not take things personally, because historically I can't. I always seem to be the loser, the fool, but laughing stock.

I hate myself because i really, really, REALLY think I need to be funny and charismatic but i'm a bumbling fool who's mind goes blank during most conversations. I can't even listen to people, i'm so focused on me and my insecurities, and saying that implies that if I could focus on other people that things would change, but my background, default setting is and always has been a brutal, empty, sad, awful feeling (yes, depression) and that feeling is like a vacuum sucking up any and all ease or joy and making it cold and dead.

I obsessively resent.

I'm an addict and alcoholic (4 months clean this time in recovery, so yes, I'm in early recovery, surprise that I'm such a mess?).

Debt.

An unbelievable level of regret over some of my tattoos, unbelievable because of how many times I actually got tattoos removed and then some how got more tattoos (YES, PLURAL) after 30 tattoo removal sessions on different tattoos. (I still love tattoos and have gotten soem of my favorite ones since this whole drama).

The constant weight of unrealized dreams, specifically, working in comedy in some capacity (I know, I'm a cut up, right?!. Good thing most comedians are known for being messed up...I fit right in. But seriously, this expectation in my head has been so loud for so long, and I've started to make flailing attempts to move towards actually just DOING comedy instead of thinking about it, and did perform once and got a lot of laughs, and will do it again, but I rarely actually write and it's always eating at me.

Intense social anxiety, obsessing over perceived slights, or real ones, and hating myself for being so fumbling and awkward and for giving so much of myself away. I feel totally useless and exposed in this world and too weak and stupid and naive to change my ways, like I'm trapped in my own spineless body despite knowing I need to change how i carry myself, how I speak and what I say, how i make eye contact, but i""m so damned neurotic that I can't seem to hold any kind of confidence for long and people just see right through me and eviscerate me at will, even the people who other people think are weak and stupid seem to eat me alive, and offer myself up on a platter for them instinctively without thinking....why the hell can't I just REALLY stop and think before I speak or act? Why the hell do I cave so easily an disrespect myself in order to appease someone else??

My family is alcoholic and falling apart. Angry, abusive father. Narcissistic sister with a nephew i love to bits but often can't see because of my resentment for my narcissistic sister who I find intensely difficult and irritating, even though she is trying to be nicer, I still have a mountain sized smouldering resentment against her for years of her emotional abuse and domineering behavior, among other irritating quirks. Another sister who I don't see and how has been a heroin addicted prostitute for most of my life.

Few friends. I piss them off or am hurt by them because i invite abuse with my pathetic ways. Well, to be fair, I've forged some great friendships in recovery over the years with some fellow miscreants who have found their way and who genuinely seem to care about me, which has been amazing to experience, so I'm grateful for them.

God. Haha. Here is the familiar experience of all of the drama of the last few hours sorta evaporating, leaving me feeling stupid and melodramatic.

17,"Memory problems, cognitive problems, constantly down over *something* even if everything else is going well, I feel like I'm going insane.

* I can remember what the buttons for a video game do. I can remember procedures for a flight simulation. I can remember stupid crap a school bully said to me 16 years ago. But for the life of me I cannot remember and balance all the adult tasks I have to do every day or at work. I have a wall calendar next to my computer. I have a whiteboard in the kitchen. I have alarms set on my phone's calendar, and I **still** manage to forget things. ""Hey, can you do this for me on this day?"" Yeah, sure, *writes it on the calendar*.....*totally forgets it 30 seconds later.* It's a frequent point of contention with my girlfriend because I'm constantly forgetting her work schedule or plans despite them being written on a calendar that's less than a meter from my head for most of the damn day.

* My brain refuses to work. I sit down with a book to plan my classes for the next school term, (I teach) and my brain refuses to process what's on the page in front of me. Turn on a video game and I'm (mostly) fine. Even then there are days where I literally can't do anything mentally demanding because I just can't focus or process information. Today I dumped coffee beans straight into the filter before grinding them. Yeah, I know that's normal for most people when they wake up, but this was three hours after I woke up, and I have moments of incredible stupidity like this **all throughout the day**. My brain constantly feels foggy. There are some days when I have clarity, but even then I forget things. For one or two days I might feel great, then the next day I'm down in the dumps because I have to waste the day on chores. 

* I'm unorganized and inconsistent. I constantly lose things, unless they're very important to me. And of course, the things that are important to me are typically not important for real life. When I try to organize, my organization methods are inconsistent. Even organizing something as simple as an outline, my method will suddenly change halfway through the outline and I end up confusing myself. I can't even manage my time. The only reason I'm able to manage time at work is because it's already structured.

* I'm always worried about something and it sours my mood. I can have 99 things going well for me, but one single negative will dominate my mind and put me into a funk. *Will I ever get a higher paying job? Will I be spending the rest of my life working to make ends meet and never get to enjoy my hobbies? Will I be able to stay competitive in my field? Why do I have to use so much energy to identify and avoid all the deception and manipulation in adult life? Why can't I remember anything?* 

* I'm burned out on chores, errands, and work. I don't want to do anything unless it gives an immediate, positive return with minimal effort. I can hardly remember anything that's important. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to get out of it.

28,"Hi, guys

As I am struggling with most/all of the above I want to ask if you know and hopefuly if you personaly are people who could say that have really taken their life back, don't feel miserable and the previous conditions are long gone forgotten, your therapy did ""miracles""with you and nowadays you dont take any meds.

I am asking because deep inside me I am conncerned I will never find a therapist that will help me clear everything crooked and funked up in my head. I was a witness of domestic violence when I was 6 and again at 10 and had a toxic father for the four year period between six and ten. Nowadays I am 28 year old male, work as a legal adviser, could say good looking, and have a new ambition to study coding for a few years and become  developer. This being said, from an outer perspective my life sounds to be going just fine, but some of the monsters I have been living for the last 15 years became rapidly stronger for 2 years now. Without my meds I feel derealized and depersonalized, complete lack of desire to live, to pursuite goals, to do my laundry, to tidy my room, to shower, to EXIST - not being suicidal, just feel like existence is total pain and suffering. When on my meds I am just dead inside philosphically, I mean, the medication numbs the pain almost completely, I do stuff with pleasure, live, etc. but udner the surface it is all there and I am aware. Hence I know the only hope for me is real good life changing therapy and along with it some personality changes in my way of life perception, the latter would be up to me mainly, but can't be done with all the negative and crooked filters that depression and anxiety have put before my eyes.

Now a few years later, he's began to show a strange interest in ""paranormal"" stuff and actually believes some of them to be inexplicable phenomena, and it's all good. But just a few minutes earlier, he confessed to me that he's been seeing people and hearing voices that aren't actually there, and gave me huge and detailed descriptions of said people and voices, mentioned that one of these voices is the voice of a ""friend"". He also asked me to be ""discrete"" about all of this new development. When he told me this, I was like ""WHOA, what!?""... I mean, I'm really, REALLY worried now, this is kinda different.

Hi there, I am in the final year of my degree in Animal Behaviour Science and Welfare (BSc) at the University of Greenwich, and I am conducting a preliminary study to find out how dog owners that suffer from depression feel their dogs effect their mental health (if at all) the main aim looks at whether the severity of depression and the owners view on how the dog effects their depression are linked. In order to do this I have set up a survey which asks questions in order to find this out.

Background:
Personally I have suffered from depression since the age of 14 (i'm now 22) and wanted to do this study because I believe my involvement with animals has helped me in my good times and stopped me relapsing as badly as I could've.

Privacy Protection:
The study is completely anonymous does NOT ask for any personal identifying information such as name, email address, age, gender, or race as to avoid privacy issues on what is a delicate subject.

 *WARNING* 
The survey includes questions asked in the PHQ-9 self assessment form used by medical professionals to find a patients depression severity; this in turn includes asking whether you have had thoughts of self-harm or suicide (*no details are asked this is just a tick box*).
 
The project has been approved by the University of Greenwich and Hadlow College's ethics committees and already has 67 respondents (Needing 100+ to finish).

The survey takes around 15 minutes to complete.

33,"Hello, I'm from the USA.

Since I was a child, I've suffered from OCD. It used to be very acute and hard to deal with. Since then, I've gotten it to a manageable state that only flares up when under a lot of pressure.

Now on a note I previously thought was unrelated, I've been having intrusive thoughts for the past two to three years. There are unfortunate things that have happened in my life that keep trying to replay in my head, and in order to stop them I'll try to think of something... *Anything*... In order to distract myself and stop the intrusive thoughts. These distractions are usually silly or disgusting phrases like, ""Mable shouldn't be fucking dogs!"" and odd things akin to that.

The distractions have now become physical impulses. I'll mutter the phrases, or maybe cover my face in order to ""hide"" myself from the intrusive thoughts. On rare occasions, I've caught myself unintentionally saying some of these disgusting phrases out loud.

Before then, it never even *occurred* to me that my behavior was anything like Tourette Syndrome. I always thought it was a mental condition you were born with that showed up before adulthood. I only considered it after the first time I found myself embarrassed at something awful I said out loud. Upon looking further into this, I've been finding articles that suggest invasive thoughts are a link between OCD and Tourette Syndrome. It's all starting to make a bit more sense.

I hope to re-build better habits so that I don't need to respond to the invasive thoughts by saying awful things or reacting physically anymore. 

Has anyone had this experience or perhaps some insight as to whether or not I am experiencing Tourette Syndrome? Thank you very much for your time.",16Feb2018,5,

42,"Being aware of depression is not stopping the causes of it. Causes are most often societal implications. Practices, restrictions, expectations, and forced activities that we either do not connect with on a personal level because of disagreement or misunderstanding, or that drain from us any left-over resources we might use to explore new parts of ourselves, potentially leading us into a drive free from depression. Most importantly, we are not given the TIME to explore. Only expected to settle and succeed. This is incredibly unhealthy for the mental state of anything living, not just humans.

The only way to fix this is to gather the many afflicted together to determine what is a societal problem and what is a personal issue, and we need to first develop the tools and resources for use against personal angst and THEN move on to society and do, objectively (very important), the same.

Until we stop living a life based around reward, sales and maintenance will the depressed, the forgotten, and the angry ever see the light of contentment again and the number of occupants of these fields will grow ever larger.",16Feb2018,7,

46,"Hello, everyone.

My name is Maria and I'm 31 years old. 

Last year, I came off of Paxil after being on it for 13 years. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety (as well as ADHD) when I was 17 years old.

At first, Paxil worked WONDERFULLY for me. Over the years, however, my depression/anxiety waxed and waned, and I wasn't really sure the Paxil was effective for me anymore. As a matter of fact, looking back, the psychiatrist who originally prescribed them to me didn't REALLY do what I would consider to be a very good or thorough psychological analysis of me... and I was wondering if I should have ever been on Paxil in the first place. I was also experiencing some side effects that I wasn't happy with. 

I tried to come off of it SEVERAL times, and it was always an absolute DISASTER. I tried quitting cold turkey, against advice, that was a huge mistake. I tried weaning myself over the course of weeks - even MONTHS. There was NOTHING I could do that didn't result in severe emotional and physical symptoms. I felt physically ill, I had hallucinations, nightmares. I even had the terrible ""brain zaps"" they talk about. It was a BEAST to come off of and I always ended up going back to it because I felt like I was losing my mind and I just could NOT feel better. 

Well, finally, last year, I powered through it and feel like I really risked my relationship with my boyfriend, bless his heart. Things were really, really rough for SEVERAL months. I was struggling at home, I was struggling at work... it was just really bad. But I was determined to get off of it to see if, in the end, I really needed it. 

I finally got off of it and I feel pretty confidently that I DO need SOMETHING to assist me with my depression and anxiety - because they're still here. They are, unfortunately, very much alive and well. But I'm TERRIFIED of taking another antidepressant because so many of them have reputations for withdrawal/discontinuation symptoms - or serious side effects. I am EXTREMELY sensitive to medication and can't even take a singular Benadryl without feeling totally hungover and disconnected the next day.

Well, I saw a new psychiatrist and told him about my experience with Paxil and how I had recently come off of it after so many trials and so many errors, and he totally minimized it. He looked at me like I had 3 heads when I told him how difficult it was to come off of it and how it made my life extremely hard for MONTHS. I was to the point where I thought I was either going to have to quit my job or they were going to fire me. I just couldn't function. He basically glossed over it like I had just said ""I just didn't feel well for a day or so"" and tried to prescribe me Prozac, which also has been known to have discontinuation issues. Not to mention he also tried to convince me to buy hundreds of dollars worth of supplements that he swore would help me. I told him I didn't have room in my budget for such a hefty amount of vitamins and supplements and he suggested that I work more.

Can you believe this?

I was barely making it through my regular work week with my anxiety and depression and with the recent discontinuation of the Paxil, I TOLD him this, and he said I needed to consider working more.

I was flabbergasted. And so offended.

So I tried a NEW psychiatrist.

And guess what?

Exactly the same thing.

She prescribed me Prozac almost immediately once I told her my story, even when I specifically asked her if there were any other options. And again, she completely disregarded everything I said. She was like ""you probably just didn't wean yourself good enough."" And acted like my symptoms lasted for a day, not 3 straight, whole months. 

I almost lost it.

I had struggled for SO. LONG. 

My life was a living hell and my family was ready to check me into a hospital.

On TOP of this, the second psychiatrist said, upon meeting her,  that she and the rest of her office only dealt with medicine management. But their website specifically says they provide psychotherapy and tests/assessments. I really wanted psychotherapy as WELL as assistance with finding the right medication - AND to have new tests and/assessments done. Because maybe my problem is deeper. Maybe I have bipolar or borderline personality. Because my issues are significant and make my life and relationships very, very difficult. So I feel misled AND like I've just been given a prescription to shut me up.

What is going on here? 

I feel so disgusted and defeated and like I'm being totally gaslighted (gaslit?) by professionals who are supposed to be helping me.

Has anyone else had this experience? Whether it be with severe drug discontinuation issues or with pushy psychiatrists who don't listen to anything you say?

52,"I began medication roughly a year ago and while the process has been long and difficult it seems to be working. I have made several attempts to start some form of psychotherapy but it seems to be heavily discouraged. Rarely are my calls returned and even when they are most practitioners only initially diagnose to transition to long-term medication management.
This difficulty in accessing treatment combined with what I believe are psychological barriers and my general ND have prevented me from progressing as I'd like. 

I tend to be obsessive and very neurotic so I find myself constantly reading about potential conditions, different medications, symptom overlap *ad nauseum*  
My ideal treatment plan is to medicate the physical symptoms while I use psychotherapy to restructure my processes, with the ultimate goal of reducing my reliance on meds as much as possible. I understand SD is unreliable but I don't know how else to proceed my care without getting professional help. 

To those of you that are involved with MH/ND treatment, what recommendations do you have for someone in my situation?

55,"I recently started group therapy that is once a week for an hour and a half for 12 weeks total (I’ve done 2 sessions already). I just applied for a new job that would be a standard 9-5 job, which means the therapy times would overlap.  I haven’t gotten the job but someone in the department told me to apply and have already heard good word that I’m most likely to get it. I know if they say I can’t leave every week for an hour and a half then I would just have to stop going to the therapy session as this job is really important to me and I am still doing 1 on 1 therapy that is more flexible with scheduling. I’m wondering if I get the job should I tell them it’s just a doctors appointment, physical therapy, etc or what. 

Any advice on how to go about this?",16Feb2018,3,

58,"First of all, I don't have ADHD. However, when I become anxious, my attention span seems to decrease greatly. It's as if staying on one project, or one topic too long feels agonizing, and I must switch quickly. 

It's like focusing too much on one thing gives my brain time to focus on the anxiety, and make it worse. For example, I'll usually be able to sit down and read a book, but when I'm in this state, I won't be able to continue for longer than a couple paragraphs before I need to focus my attention elsewhere. 

I won't be able to watch long videos, and if I do, I'll need to be drawing, or browsing the internet, or have something else going on in the background. It's like I need an overabundance of stimuli to distract myself with. 

I'll get curious about a topic, and then I'll open an internet tab to read about it, and once I select an article, I'll read the opening sentence or two, and then click away and open another tab to get onto something else. It's very frustrating, as I can't finish the things I start. If I want to get a chore done, I'll get distracted halfway through, and then get distracted from the distraction, and so on.

I was just wondering if this was a common part of anxiety, or if anyone else is struggling with it. If there's any advice that's helped you, feel free to share. ",16Feb2018,7,
