0,"I don't know why or what is causing this, but in the middle of my sleep, or if I am waken up in between naps, (I work midnights and my wife days so it's frequent), I start having a need to do something. 

I don't know what but all I can think in my head is filling out boxes, or putting something together, or programming something. I feel like o have to organize, or clean or just get progress/finish something. I have yo complete something but I'm not doing anything, I'm just and have been just lying down trying to sleep.


I've been up wife awake feeling I have yo do something , and twice now it's led to a mental frenzy of a panic attack. 

This has hit me like a ton of bricks, no warning, and I've never experienced something like this before.

My everyday is just fine, no worries, don't have anything like this in the least through out, but every otheer night now it just comes back.",20Feb2018,3
1,"I went through something very traumatic at the beginning of last year. By the end of the year, I went and got professional help. I was hospitalized at first, then done outpatient, then switched doctors because I absolutely hated mine. I like the new one a lot.

At first they were bordering between PTSD and Schizophrenia, then decided on PTSD. The outpatient doctor decided on Schizophrenia. The NEW doctor thinks that I have PTSD, an “unspecified mood disorder,” and something else that I honestly can’t remember.

The old one tried me on Risperdal first and then Zyprexa. Hated both. The new one gave me four medications. Seroquel, Lithium, Abilify and Alprazolam. I think that I like my medications with the exception of the Seroquel. The Seroquel makes me feel drunk almost immediately after taking it. I’ve never drank, but it’s how I imagine being drunk feels. It makes me hate being around people. I feel like I lose my judgement, start saying everything on my mind (I don’t, but I talk nonsense,) etc. when I take it. I don’t know if it’s the only culprit, there’s four medicines here, but it seems like I feel the worst after taking that one.

Ever since the medication came into the mix, I have noticed an increase in my intrusive thoughts/paranoia. I get these horrible thoughts that I’m a bad person and get scared of everyone/everything. I’m a pretty good person. Obviously I have my flaws, but I haven’t ever done anything criminal.

This is all really scary to me. The Florida shooting thing didn’t help since everyone brings up the fact that these people are on these kinds of medications when they do these things. I don’t have a violent bone in my body, but they make it sound like they’re normal and then they just snap one day. 

I also have these awful nightmares, sometimes relating back to what gave me PTSD and sometimes not, about getting murdered or dying.

I just want to feel okay and start loving life/myself again. I’m a good person. I know that logically. But my brain is fucked up and has all these medications trying to change it. I’m really scared.

I don’t know why I’m posting this other than hoping that someone can relate to me?

Thanks. Good vibes and love to you all.",20Feb2018,1
3,"Bear with me please. I am struggling a lot and just want to get this all out + ask for some advice on getting through the rough patch.

I had a bad home life and was abused physically, sexually, and emotionally. I got out when I turned 15 and moved to live with my grandparents, which is when the severe depression kicked in. It feel like, as soon as I got away from the danger, I had all the time/safety in the world to think about everything. I was sad a lot before, but I was always positive and tried my best. But once I was safe, I obsessed over the bad thoughts and experiences. I stopped trying in school and just lacked motivation in general. I eventually pulled myself out of it and made a lot of positive strives in my life. I finished high school with decent grades, got sponsored by the government to study abroad, and started college when I got back.

I was doing really well my first semester of college; however, halfway through the spring semester I began to feel very depressed. I felt like nothing I was doing mattered and even though I made awesome grades, had great friends and lots of support, I felt empty. I started seeing a therapist (the 5th I had seen since I moved away from my parents), who I decided to finally tell everything to, even the things I held back from previous therapists. 

I felt instant relief and like I was actually understood. I started taking depression medication and, during the summer, I was doing so well and felt so great. Then, school started again and I felt depressed about what I was studying, about myself and about life in general. I started falling behind, something I didn't do the past two semesters even with bad emotional health. I blew through my savings and I took out a small loan on a car that broke down two days later (that I am stuck with until I pay off, I payed to have it fixed and it still is having issues). I had to medically withdraw from school and began to see a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with BPD. 

I transferred to another University and promised myself I would start this time ""right"". But, here I am... I am slacking and finding it hard to care. I am working hard to pay back the loan I took out, but it is difficult to feel motivation outside of that. I am in no position to not go to University and get a good job. I am independent, but I know if I spend my life working a service job, etc. I will feel like garbage and compare myself to my parents. I know there is nothing wrong with those types of jobs, but I have been given the chance to go further.
My grandparents love me and all, but they cannot support me. I wonder how I can be so lazy and ungrateful for all that I have worked for; for the opportunity to go to University and make something of myself. 
I come from a below poverty line, trashy family. I have always pushed to be more than what I would have been if I stayed there, but I seem to lack any gratefulness for how far I have come.  

I hate my brain. I hate it. I am no longer interested in actually putting effort into things. I like the idea but not the work. I feel an almost euphoric feeling when I think about all the great things I could have in life if I try. I like the idea of friends, but am too lazy to connect (especially if they do not push to connect with me). I like the idea of finishing my studies and working, but I am too lazy to put forth the effort like before. I get upset when I see a 0% by an assignment, but am nonchalant when I don't turn it in and there is only a ""late"" comment. 
Regardless, the bad feelings are not enough to motivate me to do things ahead of time, finish things, study, etc. 

I don't know what to do. I live with my boyfriend and he tries to motivate me, but he isn't the best at it, because he is already finished with Uni and works all day. He likes to do his own thing when he comes home, and I cannot expect him to babysit me because that would be selfish. He himself is sad that I am not being true to my hardworking nature (as in, how I was for the 3 years I got shit done and did well). 

Can anyone give me advice? Share with me their experience and how they pulled through? Meds and the therapist/psychiatrist help, but only with the illness. Neither have helped with the intense side effects of wanting to wither away so I don't have to deal with life or anything else.

4,"I can’t really put into words what’s going on with me. I have always been a thinker, and I question everything, but lately it’s taken a much stranger turn. I’ve become obsessed with theories on consciousness, and at times, I have become convinced that our reality is not actually real but rather hallucinations from our brains. On the days that I do feel real, I then focus on the corruption in the world and the overall helplessness and lack of control that we have. I have extensively research the death of the planet and the fact that eventually everything the human race has ever accomplished will be destroyed and forgotten. I don’t feel safe on the planet sometimes, I feel like at any moment something could go wrong (solar flares, black holes, asteroids etc) and it makes me uneasy. 

** please be kind, I understand these thoughts aren’t normal which is why I’m posting this. I just don’t understand why or what is causing me to feel this way. I somehow manage to appear normal, I go to work, I keep my house clean, I have friends, I’m social... but inwardly I cant connect with anyone and I feel like everything we do as humans is meaningless and futile in the end

Any thoughts on what this is? Causes? Solutions? ",20Feb2018,2
5,"Starting last September I used to smoke weed and drink a couple times a week. After a while i started dabbling in LSD and mushrooms. I stopped doing drugs after I realized that I was depressed and that they would only make me more depressed. I realized that I was depressed a couple weeks ago and told my doctor and am in the midst of working something out with a therapist using talk therapy.
But lately I haven't really felt depressed I've just felt kind of insane. You know when you smoke weed and your brain wants to group all your thoughts together? That's been happening for a couple days but I haven't touched a substance in at least a week. My thought pattern has just been completely different, everything is very visual and it feels like my brain is trying to make this web of thoughts, connecting every sight, smell, memory, and feeling. I feel like I'm high all the time. I feel like I'm going insane. I can't focus on anything and feel tense all the time thinking about what's wrong with me.

I looked into cannabis and LSD psychosis but the symptoms don't really sound the same. It also reminded me of synesthesia (connecting different senses) which I know that I have because the alphabet has a distinct color scheme, and thought it might relate to that?
Does anyone know if this an actual disorder or something? I just want to have control of my thoughts again without trying to connect everything. Thanks.",20Feb2018,3
6,"I've been on a very low dose of Sertraline for about 3 weeks now for both anxiety and depression.  I think I feel a little better, but I noticed that for the past few days, I've been getting misty eyed/crying a little if something touches me emotionally.  This is usually like watching stuff that reminds me of my dad who passed away 1.5 years ago or something like that.  Things that I feel are normal to get a little emotional about.  I've been depressed for 15+ years, mostly untreated, and up until about 6 years ago, I used to cry every day, often pretty heavily.  Then since 6 years I've stopped crying for the most part (again, except for some times when my dad died - but even then less than I would have before) and felt emotionally numb/unable to cry in a bad way.  But then my therapist said crying every day like I did before was also a bad sign.  So I'm wondering if crying a little bit more now is a good sign or a bad sign? I feel better that I'm able to experience/express my emotions more now instead of feeling like they're stuck inside me or numb.  I'll ask my therapist what she thinks, but I'd also like some other opinions.",20Feb2018,1
8,"Over the past few years I've been very depressed tho l've never been diagnosed as I can't afford doctors. For about 2 years now my depression has mutated into paranoia and anger. Everything makes me mad, every little noise means somthing and I can hear everything existing around me and I become angry. For a long time my dogs have helped me through life. I loved them and they ment the world to me. But now I look at them and wish they were gone. I with they would leave me a lone and I don't want to pet them or be around them at all and every little thing they do angers me to the point that I hit my youngest dog (not very hard, but he did yelp) the other day for drinking too loudly and not stopping when I told him too. And I don't feel bad about it. 2 years ago I would be crying over anything bad happening to them, and beside myself if I was the one who hurt them. But now I wish they were gone so I could be left alone. And I only take care of them because I'm obligated too. These feeling are scaring me. I've had one of the dogs for 8 years. We've been everywhere together, but now I can't stand him. I would never hurt them, I'm not a monster. But the fact I've already struck one with no remorse frightens me. It makes me sad to say it but I miss my old depression. At least then I was just sad. Now I'm only paranoid and angry at everything. ",20Feb2018,1
10,"I know the text you're about to read sounds pathetic, but please hear me out. 


So I've been told by some of my friends and family that I'm a good-looking guy, and I think this has gotten to my head, unfortunately. They've said things like, ""Dude, that girl was totally checking you out,"" or ""You never notice the amount of girls who look at you in public?"", to me. So as a result, I have a bad tendency of interpreting innocent actions such as a girl looking at me as I walk past her as if that means she's attracted to me, and that leads to me to thinking she's interested in me. In some cases, if I notice her looking at me multiple times (even if I had to look at her multiple times to notice her looking at me), I start thinking she's interested, and then I start projecting my fantasies on her because I think she has a crush on me. This is a delusional thought pattern, and I wish it would simply stop. My rational side knows that no, looks aren't everything and that just because a girl looked at me a few times doesn't mean she's interested, but for some reason, I keep having these destructive thoughts which leads me to having crushes on random girls I see around constantly. 


This is a problem because rationally, I don't want a girlfriend since I know it would take over my life and be the focus of it. I also think I wouldn't deal well with one in my current mental state. My main problem in all this is that my rational thoughts know what's good for me, but for some reason, my emotionally charged thoughts keep making me have destructive and unhealthy tendencies like I mentioned above.


What I'm asking in all this is have any of you dealt with feelings and thoughts like this, and how do you get past them or brush them off? ",20Feb2018,1

I don't know where else to go, but I need help. I'm facing an issue, that I love you girlfriend and she loves me back. But I hurt her because I'm manipulative, without really realizing what I'm doing. I make her feel guilty of things that she shouldn't feel so, and if I don't get things my way, I manipulate it so it sounds like it's her fault or she is wrong. I don't do it voluntarily, but I do it too often and it hurts her and me.

I always feel like a burden or like I'm over-explaining my symptoms to him when I try to make him understand. I can't help but feel crazy sometimes and feel like he has no idea how to relate. Have any of you experienced this? If/when you have kids, how do you co-parent like that?",20Feb2018,2
15,"I spend most days focused on my demons, which are many. 

I don't want to get in to too much detail about that stuff because whenever I try to talk about it all in meaningful way that weaves all the different issues and experiences together, I just end up frustrated and feeling totally unable to describe ""it"". This frustration ends up feeding this obsession I have with how lost in my head I feel, and how it only seems to be getting worse, and all of the sadness, frustration, and now rage comes up because I'm just so sick of being like this....

so, the thing I want to talk about mostly on this post is two things which are connected, and I might veer in to some other stuff.

Thing 1) Police helicopters have been ""following"" me for at least 3 years (can't remember when it started, but it's been at least that long). I will elaborate more on this.

This is obviously very paranoid, and it feeds in to the second issue of this post which is.... 

Thing 2) Because of my oddness, and increasing social isolation, and anger, and paranoia, I'm worried that I'm somehow seen as a danger to society and that this has somehow put me on a list, or that I am being tracked by intelligence agencies, or gang stalked,
 or just plain rejected instinctively by most people who I interact with.

I am not saying that I am a danger, and for f***s sake please don't ask me if I am, or anyone is in danger, because they're not, and that question will only exacerbate my sense of isolation and feeling that people think I'm ""bad"" or ""off"". 

I repeat, PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME IF I AM A DANGER TO ANYONE OR MYSELF. I hate that in this world I not only have to deal with the heaviness and emotional pain of thinking and feeling this crap that I didn't ask for, but also that I feel like it's not safe to share this poison with people without feeling judged. It's such an ugly, alienating mental health issue (this kind of anger and paranoia) because I already feel like a criminal for having these thoughts.

It's tough to talk about ""being 'followed' by police helicopters"" because people obviously have a limited range of responses and assumptions, since this kind of thing is automatically assumed to be untrue, or if it is true, the person being followed is assumed to deserve it. 
Imagine what that does to a persons sanity and mental health. Now imagine that this person is already in a long term shakey mental health state, e.g- depression, anxiety, loneliness, OCD, addiction, trauma from bullying and emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive family members,as well as obsessive body image issues from self inflicted things, and imagine what kind of mental state this person lives with every damned day.

Sorry if this is indulgent, but I'm indulging.

The police helicopters...

let me define ""following"", because it's a little more nuanced than that, and I needed a place holder to describe the experience in the introduction while still keeping it brief.

Often during my day, at all hours of the day, the police helicopter will appear, often flying different patterns near me, usually directly over head. Sometimes I hear it and a few seconds later it is flying in a line DIRECTLY over my head, not off to the side a few hundred meters, but over head, as if they were taking pictures of me with their zoom cameras. Often they circle over head. Sometimes they are waiting for me when I leave my house or leave work and they circle overhead as in my car, then circle over my car and track me in traffic for a few kilometers, long enough distance to be certain that it is not coincidence that who ever else they might be tracking  just happens to be taking the same route that I am.

Sometimes they seem to be flying larger circles over the area I'm driving and will keep appearing a few hundred meters in front of me, criss crossing, almost as if they want me to know they are there. Crazy right? How would they know what my line of sight is from my car? Well, not that crazy considering how experienced and skilled those pilots are since they are in the air 24/7 except for refueling and maintenance (I know that because it's information taken from the police helicopter website for my city).

It happens while I'm in my room, sometimes during the day, sometimes at night. I will hear them approaching, then they will circle a tight circle directly over my house for a few minutes. I've even recorded them with my camera phone before).

One way in which is happens, which would make the most sense, and is the easiest to dismiss with logic, is the ""visits"" while I am working. This is because my job is with the city utility and involves going in to the yards of several properties 5 days a week. I don't want to get too specific for privacy reasons, and I fear I already have, but it's part of the story and it's important. 

So you say, ""well, you're going on to peoples property, so it's logical that people would be frightened and would call the police! Case closed!"".

Yeah, sure, except:

1) my job isn't some brand new role that was recently created, it's a pretty old school job, and...
2) I have many, many co-workers who do the same job as me, and we chat a lot about the boring ins and outs of our line of work, and you know what? The constant police helicopter presence is not a concern that any of them talk about. Sure, lots of them have had a police cruiser roll up and ask them what they're doing and say they got a call, but those incidents are considered rare, and they sure are talked about when they happen, so doesn't it stand to reason that if all of my coworkers were experiencing the same thing as me that it would be a topic of conversation, like all the other regular irritations and pitfalls of our job are?

So it happens at work. Often they follow me as I drive back to the office from the area of the city I was working in.

It makes me wonder: why me? what is so bad about me? If I'm under investigation, then what for? and why for 3+ years? Seems a little overkill for a lowly city worker.

I should also add something, because it makes this concern more quizzical and difficult for me because it makes it easier for people to dismiss my concerns.

Here it is:

my old room mate, who was also my landlord (I rented a room in her home), was friends with a guy in the police helicopter division in my city, or so she claimed. (she was ""slippery"" with the truth and hard to believe about a lot of stuff). I was open with her about what was happening, and she asked her friend who she claimed was in the police heli division. He said he couldn't find any info on my in whatever database of police investigations he had access to, and she informed me that her house was on the ""route"" for the police heli.
Great! Case solved this time!

But why would it happen when I wasn't at home? Why does it happen when I'm not at work? When I'm just out and about, minding my own business? And if it's a ""route"", then why would they fly in circles over the house, and not just fly by?

This is really, really scary, and very frustrating. I am already very socially isolated and on shaky ground.

I know I ""should"" just pretend it's not happening, ignore it, use some CBT and shift my focus, and I do, and sometimes it helps, but then that sound of propellors appears again, and the black police helicopter appears, and I feel like I'm being watched by some evil bully that I'm helpless against, and I feel like some evil entity is enjoying the psychological harm they're doing me as they stir my brains with their foul aggression.


One more thing....
Twice I've noticed black SUV's, mid-sized, Fords, I think, but they had not markings and I don't pay enough attention to automobiles these days to be able to name the make and model easily......the SUV's followed me in traffic. The reason I noticed them was because they both had two small rectangular boxes on the front roof rack mount. One of the boxes looked like a small flood light, probably a 8""-12"" wide by about 2""-3"" high, and another black rectangular box on the same mount, but just all black.

As soon as it happened the first time I noticed it in my rear view mirror because of how aggressively the driver turned the corner to get behind me, and because the driver looked like some kind of goon would, e.g- big guy with a shaved head and those wrap around bug eye sun glasses.

I had a ""hunch"" and so pulled over because I was in no mood to let my paranoia start grinding at me. I pulled over, and about 50 meters after passing me the driver of the black SUV abruptly turned left in the parking lot of a building and turned 180 degrees and stopped (it was in the entrance to a commercial building next to another commercial building so the entrances to the two parking lots were right next to each other and were not separated by any barrier). He just pulled in, positioned him self so he could easily leave again, but stopped his car, right in the entrance. I drove by him to get a look and as I turned to look at him he was very obviously trying to hide his face.

Does this not sound strange? 

Does this really just sound like a paranoid rambling?

It's insane to be me these days because this IS happening, but because of my other mental health issues people are so quick to dismiss my account of what is happening!!!

16,"Hi. I'm a 16 year old in the United States. Throughout these past few months, I have had the worst mental breakdowns in my life, which have had an immense impact on my social relationships with other people. I feel so alone, and all of the passions that I had just months ago are now gone; I have no enjoyment from pretty much anything but eating. 

When I was a child, I was physically and verbally abused by my older sister, which has caused me to develop extreme social anxiety and problems with verbal communication. When my sister left with her boyfriend a year ago and other things preoccupied my parents' minds, my family gave me relative independence. At first, I liked being able to do what I wanted to do, but now I don't have any emotional connections with my parents nor my sister, and college application season definitely made the relationships worse. Plus, being closeted gay in a Christian household isn't helping, either.

I've always been a negative, pessimistic person, but ever since November, I've felt like absolute shit. I've had problems with overeating in the past, but binge-eating has become a coping mechanism for me. It has gotten to the point that I eat until I begin to throw up because I feel so empty. Eating gives me temporary happiness, even though it usually results in embarrassing digestive problems the following day that contributes to my continual anxiety during school. Plus, I've always had issues with my body, and so this increased binge-eating makes my body issues 100 times worse. Whenever I walk around school, all I can think about is how people are judging me by my appearance or how they're laughing at me because of how I look or what I wear.

I spend around 90% of the time that I don't spend at school in my room, which I've learned to love and hate at the same time. I have always been an introvert, but my room feels like a prison at the same time. The only place I feel comfortable in is my room, shutters closed and the only source of light coming from my desk lamp. I spend my nights doing homework, staring blankly at my wall or a computer screen, talking to myself, or obsessing over my mistakes. It's gotten to the point that I feel uncomfortable around people, no matter how close I was to them before. Even during school, I try to spend my breaks and lunches alone if I can, because I feel like a nuisance to my friends.

Sometimes, I wonder how much better my life would be if I could just end it all or abuse substances to feel happy again. I remember a breakdown back in December, when I made very informal plans to jump out of my window (located on the second story) and completely destroyed everything in my room. I don't do drugs, but I drink three coffees everyday to stay awake and to give me energy to get through the day. That slight rush is enough to get me through my homework, but it's just not enough. Sometimes, I feel like binge-eating, coffee, and music are the only three things keeping me alive. I don't self harm that much, other than pulling out my hair, scratching myself, and fantasizing about cutting/burning.

My sleep has been absolutely terrible; I've needed more sleep than I've ever needed in my life, and I always feel tired despite getting the recommended amount of sleep for people of my age. On weekdays, I get three to four hours of sleep on some days and twelve hours on others, while on weekends, I sleep for the whole day. On the weekdays that I get twelve hours of sleep, I usually sleep the minute I get back home to midnight; then, I spend all night on homework, writing, or crying. No matter how much sleep I get that night, I feel the same every single morning.

Honestly, I feel like most of this has to do with my extreme mood swings. Ever since I started high school four years ago, I have had these intense emotions that could change in a heartbeat, but they've definitely gotten worse, to the point that I feel like a completely different person whenever I experience those changes. It's not to the point that they have different names and such, but looking back on my social interactions, I can identify three or four distinct emotional personas that I adopt. I feel so volatile all the time, since some random thing someone says to me has the potential to completely shift my mood. The absolute worst part about this is that I don't know who I am anymore, and so whenever I have to make decisions that could potentially alter my life, I remain indecisive because I don't know which emotional state to please. These mood swings cause me to think that I'm a nuisance to all of my friends, which then causes me to isolate myself and do all that stuff. Nowadays, I'm always in a lethargic state, but those brief periods of energy/flamboyance causes me to feel more exhausted than before once they're done. Alongside the changes in energy are changes in attachment. Most of the time, I want to be left alone, but the other 10-15% of the time, I become so attached to other people, which I know annoys them.

Two of my friends have told me that they're concerned about me, which makes me feel terrible. I know I'm never going to have the energy or the will to commit suicide, and the whole purpose of isolating myself was to stop being a nuisance to them, so obviously my efforts were unsuccessful. 

I know this is an extremely long post, but I don't know what to do and if this is something to be concerned about. I don't have access to a mental health professional, since I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents at all, and they're the only ones who could bring me to a psychologist. Most importantly, though, I don't know if this is a normal thing to experience around my age. I hear of stories so much worse than mine, so I honestly have no idea if this behavior is anything to be worried about. Don't most people experience these feelings in their life? Am I overreacting, and will everything be okay in a couple of months?

It makes it hard to stay focused. It takes away my ambition to do my school work. I just want to give up and go lie down and rest my back. But I can’t. Because I need to graduate and I need to get a job. How do I overcome this back pain and my related anxiety issues? I understand that getting healthy is a long road that is going to require hard work, but how do I get by in the mean time? How do I grab my life back? I’m just looking for some good advice or uplifting words. Thanks for letting me vent.",20Feb2018,2
23,"I’m feeling great right now, better than I have in a long time. 

Both my fiancée and I have had a hard time mentally lately. We haven’t really been connecting well because of our mental illnesses and we’re kind of just struggling to get through each day. Today was amazing for us though! We went to her therapy session, took a walk, talked a bunch about both serious and lighthearted topics, got gym memberships and actually went to the gym, had a good dinner, and now we’re home about to spend a little more time together and go to bed. I’m so happy.

26,"I think I generally recognize when I am really depressed or anxious but this is something I just recently realized has been common in my life. This happens maybe a couple times a month now but thinking back used to happen at least weekly. As soon as I wake up everything happening in my life feels alien to me and it feels like that usually until the next day. It really kills any sort of momentum I have in life and I feel  I have to start over again. 

 For the entire day or days, I don't feel like I am a part of society/reality. Many times I have had something I need to do that day but I didn't even consider doing due to it not feeling ""real"" (I can't think of another way to describe it). I really struggle with any sort of interaction with people and will not talk to people I know unless I absolutely have to. My clothes feel really strange on me and I feel sort of deformed if that makes sense. 

I don't know how to respond to basic everyday things that 90% of the time don't really think about. I tend to avoid doing anything when I feel like this except when I have to.I can remember so many interactions with people (less now that self-checkout is common) that were awkward because I couldn't figure out how to respond. I am trying to think of how to describe it, I tend to respond with things I have thought about earlier in the day that may or may not be relevant. I have never been able to figure out how to do anything to change this feeling and hope that I feel normal the next day.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this? I am in therapy and taking medication for depression and anxiety but have never been able to really describe this state of mind in a way that people can understand. ",20Feb2018,3
27,"Hi, a few months ago I started dating someone who suffers from PTSD in the form of very vivid nightmares. Often times when they tell me about it or when I’m there and it happens (usually they jolt awake or gasp, and are usually covered in sweat) I find myself at a loss for words. I generally just end up listening to them while they talk about it, and if they want me to, offer consolation in the form of a hug. I’ve never experienced any sort of trauma, and have never really dealt with a situation like this. I feel utterly helpless, and am looking for any advice on what I can do to be a better support system.",20Feb2018,1
28,"Throwaway, because my boyfriend knows my reddit username. :p

I have been suffering from depression for almost 10 years, with the usual symptoms. I can never sleep, I'm always exhausted, and I have trouble focusing. However the last year has been different.

I don't know what happened to me, but all my symptoms got worse all of a sudden, and I started having other symptoms too. I've been having trouble discerning the real world from books I'm reading or shows/movies I watched. Everything seems to run together and get so confusing. I've also become really anti social, avoiding my friends and really any social situations and I don't know why. I just feel like something bad is going to happen. I've also become really anxious and paranoid about anything and everything. All of this has become so crippling lately. I've been feeling more and more suicidal every day.

For example: I was driving home from work the other day, and suddenly was convinced that I wasn't real, and that I needed to kill myself to get back to my real life. I thought that I was dreaming, and could only wake up by dying. I don't know what's wrong with me, and I don't know who I can ask for help. I'm just really scared of what's happening to me.",20Feb2018,1
31,"In November I noticed I had a lack of emotions. It started with my birthday and I realised I wasn't excited at all, even though I had been waiting for this particular age (16) since I was young. I didn't think much off it, until things would happen and I didn't react. Now, I still experience the same lack of emotions, maybe even more so, and it's like I'm numb. I did some research, along with other things I've been feeling and experiencing lately and I found they were similar to symptoms of depression. I did some of those online tests, such as a few PHQ-9 tests, that give you an idea of if your symptoms are similar to those who have depression, to what degree and provide the next step you should take (Obviously they aren't diagnosing you) In the PHQ-9 I got 23 and the other tests said I had similar symptoms to those with severe depression. They all suggested I talk with someone and seek professional advice. However, I'm conflicted. I started feeling incredibly down about my life and hating myself in 2014. I managed to overcome it and just thought it was more or less a phase. But that same feeling would be on and off again for ages. It would suddenly come and I'd be lost and feel so many emotions, particularly pain. Through 2015 and 2016 these feelings were off and on. The thing is, each time I had these feelings, I'd be confused. Half of me wanting to erase these thoughts and be positive and work on my future, however another part of me wanted me to keep these negative thoughts and not do anything about it and just self-destruct. In 2017, the feelings were less for the first half of the year. Then things were back to being on and off. Now, it's like it's just numb, and everything is dull. I'm unmotivated, I'm tired, I'm unsocial and other things, and it's affecting my life, particularly my school life in which I have goals. But still, I'm conflicted. Half of me wants to get better so I can focus on my school work, but the other half of me is wanting to keep feeling numb and self-destruct and in the process, see how far I can go with feeling numb and if it will ever stop. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm feeling and if it's common. I tried to research, but I couldn't find anything, or at least with the way I tried to explain it. I don't know what to do. 
Another part of me feels that I don't need to seek help about what I've been feeling because it's not doing any damage to anything (besides my school work and I literally don't know why but I don't seem to care about it anymore) and I think the self-destructive part of me is trying to use that as an excuse to push myself to destroy all my morals entirely and do things to see if it will ""cure"" my numbness. 
I don't know what to do or what I'm feeling. I'm lost. I'm alone. I'm numb and empty. I tried to explain like my heart is full but just there, like not filled with any emotions in particular and it just remains that way, however, there's occasionally a small hole in my heart which just feels so empty and that's the only sense of emotion my heart feels. This numb emptiness. I don't know if that makes sense but any help would be appreciated. ",20Feb2018,1
32,"I deleted my Snapchat account yesterday, although I didn’t actually use it. Other than that, I’ve removed my Twitter, my Facebook, and my Instagram accounts. I technically have one twitter account, and perhaps a few others, but I never use them. I only know the username of one account anyway, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I have some forgotten accounts from the past.

Technically, Reddit is social media, but it doesn’t really count! It’s more of a blog/Internet forum.

I might also have a google plus account, but who uses that? And another one that doesn’t count is LinkedIn.

Why is it so liberating?

Well, there are a number of reasons:

1. It’s super addictive.

2. It seems meaningless when you don’t have any friends. Why be on social media if you’re not going to talk to anyone anyway? What’s the point in having social media accounts when you only go solo?

3. Nothing important happens there, so it’s a waste of time.

4. It’s pretty much a constant reminder of how lonely I am, and how much I am missing out on.

Any more reasons to add? Why did you decide to quit social media once and for all?

P.S.

I have kept my distance from social media for years, but I’ve still been on there. I probably logged on to a secret Instagram account everyday these last few months, only to look at posts by people I don’t know who were having fun and enjoying their lives, while I was alone in my bedroom. It was time to pull the plug once and for all (I deleted this account in January I believe).

P.S.S

People with social problems should probably stay away from social media. Take it from me, it only causes pain and suffering. The few times it causes some sort of joy, it doesn’t last very long, and it’s often followed by even more pain and suffering.",20Feb2018,2
33,"Standing where I am today, I constantly ask myself how I allowed myself to make the decisions I did knowing what I knew. I know right from wrong, good from bad. The road to what I want has always been right in front of me and yet I constantly steer hard left off the main road into wildfire. Wildfire I had always believed I had control over but a blaze like that could never be tamed, it takes everything and leaves nothing but ash in its wake. Sometimes when the wind picks up I watch sparks of myself fly away like embers off a fire. I have always chosen light over darkness, I fear what lays on the other side; your biggest fear, your worst nightmare fuck, the end of everything you know could be right around the corner and you would have no idea. Yet every day I make decisions that fuel the blaze turning me to carbon from the inside out. I refuse to let myself disintegrate. I cannot.. I will not crumble, I will not lose myself. I will not watch more of myself fade into darkness. The sun always rises and you can choose to fade into nothing or you can choose to grow, finding your strength one step at a time; unearthing power you never knew you held. I choose to move mountains. I choose to fight for what I want. Even though my mind fights against me I will keep moving forward, keep learning, keep growing. It may be a long walk out of the flames but I will fight and work until I am the fire the world fears. It isn't me against the world, it's the world against me and you fuckers better be ready.

35,"* My father was physically abusive and disrespectful of my personal space

* I spent a year at a boarding school where people I was in conflict with would sometimes come into my room at night and physically attack me in my sleep.

* I do have depression and anxiety issues, and I'm very easily irritable when I'm at my low points.

Whenever someone enters my room without knocking (most often my mother) I absolutely lose my shit. I contain myself, but I instantly have a feeling of intense distress, anxiety and lack of safety - somewhat like a ""defense mode"". I then cannot relax for a very long time, as I feel a mix of rage and insecurity.

I've told her many times to not do this, and it angers me that she still does - but at the same time I recognize that it's not rational for me to react to something so simple this vigorously. 

Could this be PTSD? I've heard that people have intrusive memories of the event, and are stressed out when thinking about it, but in my case I can think about what happened to me over the years rather easily but my reaction to similar situations is absolutely over-the-top strong.

38,"I've been experimenting quite a lot with LSD and every night I always smoke quite a bit of weed (about 0.5g to 1g a night). During the day when I'm sober I feel like im constantly tripping, for example I can stare at a chair for what feels like hours and just overthink about everything. I feel like my thoughts are super loud and annoying and they are sometimes louder than a persons conversation, meaning that I can't really focus on what that person is saying. I pretty much just stare and space out for most of the day, even when I'm typing this I just stop and stare at my keyboard and just think about random things and my thoughts are so vivid its almost dreamlike. I also can't really sit still I always have to have something to grab and play with, an example is when im watching netflix with people I cant just sit still for more than 10 minutes, I constantly have to switch positions and mess around with my phone case or pillows. Everything just feels random and doesnt make sense anymore, its almost like im constantly living in a psychedelic world. I can't make eye contact with anyone as I feel they are going to ask me a personal question or I feel i am staring into them and they might think Im in love with them.

I also want to mention that before the drug use, I was quite depressed and am an incredibly lazy person. I've never had a job nor do I wish to have one because I know i will just quit anyways as it's not worth the money to work for someone and to constantly be socialising with other people (mainly co workers). I am pretty introverted.

44,"I'm not gonna go into details about my mental health issues, but this came to light and I'm fucking scared of myself.

We broke up few days ago and it wasn't nice. I still care but I don't think he feels the same way. We've been broken up before and I was never able to fully move on. I think that it will obvious why is that in a few minutes.

Disturbing things I do:
* check my email multiple times a day in hope that he reached out
* check only app he uses to see is hr online maybe
* check his youtube channel to see did he 'favorite' any new songs and if he did, are they maybe about missing someone
* on online forum me writes again I spend time looking at his ""recent activity"" (what's he doing at the moment) and read his posts
* I've also develop to stalk his ex for literally no reason at all

When it dawned on me how incredibly creepy that all is I started to feel like trash. I don't bother him (had no contact since break up), I'm not making any passive-agressive comments towards him. I don't call, I'm not sending emails and I don't trash-talk about him. 
My justification is - I miss him and maybe he will write about missing me too.

Now I know why I wasn't able to ""move on"" in the past because he was (in a weird way) stil part of my every day.
I feel like this is connected with my OCD and cheking all of those app just feels like a compulsion. Not satisfactory one.

I feel weak, bad, creepy and crazy. But I feel like I can't help myself. I'm addicted to being online and obviously not strong enough to not check up on him.

I felt crazy and like I'm losing my mind just few times before but today, that feeling is stronger than ever.
I don't want to be like this. I don't want to do those things. 

I would like to move on, but that will not happen if I don't stop to be a creeper and I don't know how.

I feel broken and sad. I miss him.

I am very very very worried that maybe he doesn't have severe depression but not sure. He told me he has texted his parents things like ""I'm scared...plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz help me....I need help omg....when will this suffering end? I'm scareddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"" tons of times ever since he has had this illness. He also seems very nervous like and bizzare when he tries to carry on with conversations with other people. For instance, people will ask him questions and he will respond and carry on conversation like a normal person at first and then all of a sudden he will just stop like mid-sentence unable to carry on with what he has to say. He has told me that he has to stop a lot during when he talks because otherwise he will get into weird states where he will start feeling extremely uncomfortable and everything will easily make him startle and it will take him like a day or two for him to snap out of these weird states that he has no control over. He also supposedly yells and has tons of anger outbursts with his parents because of how much he is suffering and does really odd things like not being able/wanting to fully shut car doors or not being able/wanting to lift the toilet seats when he has to go to the bathroom. All these things that he has trouble doing make him feel extremely uncomfortable and make him feel extremely worse so that is why he refuses to do them. Other examples of this are him not cleaning up his dishes in his house after he eats. He also talks very little and moans like all day and he is unable to function, work a job, or go to school. His father yells at him a lot and tells him that doctors will probly think he is psychotic and is not dealing with severe depression if his son ends up getting more opinions about his diagnosis from more doctors, especially if his father shows all the doctors all the strange texts that his son has sent him ever since he has had his illness. Also, if he does things too fast, he will often times get this weird dizzy type of feeling. He has seen like 6 or 7 doctors for his issues and none have been able to help him at all. He has also had counseling and his counseling has not helped him at all and even his counselor has told him that she can tell that counseling is not helping him at all and so asked him if he would like to stop counseling if he doesn't think it is doing anything for him. He even had to go to one of the best hospitals in the world/country to get evaluated/diagnosed. Im so scared and worried about him omg. Even though his parents love him, they threaten him all the time that they will have to eventually send him to some mental institute like place or a group home if he doesn't get better or try harder. He can't try any harder and he can't help it that he hasn't gotten any better. He has also been on like 6 or 7 meds and none of them have helped him at all. Plz plz plz, doctors what are your advice? I really don't want him to be put in like a mental institute or group home for the rest of his life. Also, ever since he has had this illness, he has had no joy/happiness, no motivation, no energy, no desires/interests, and is scared as hell to wake up and live through every day with this illness. Omg, im so scared for him. I and his family and other people have said they have never seen anything like him before- that is how messed up his brain is from his illness. What should he do? Should he get reevaluated at another high end place like johns hopkins or mayo clinic in order to get second opinions about his diagnosis- should he try something besides medicine?

49,"I've been studying a lot of personal development and psychological material lately, and trying to apply this material to both understand and improve my own life. 

My current thinking is that most of happiness is generated internally through our thinking and not by the external world (""external solutions are unlikely to solve internal problems"").

With this in mind, it seems prudent to pursue self-love and self-acceptance before pursuing an intimate relationship, else one is susceptible to codependency - the other person becomes an attachment object to fill an internal void.

My questions then are: 

1. How far can self-love go?
2. To what extent is fulfillment and happiness dependent on emotional intimacy?
3. Is this all highly dependent on personality?

Much of the information I encounter seems contradictory - part of stable attachment and healthy interdependent relationships means someone is content being single, but how that can be if we need intimacy to be content?

Personal background: I'm a 27 y/o gay male with disorganized (fearful-avoidant) attachment that I'm working on and am aware that my avoidant tendencies could be clouding much of my thinking e.g. ""Why would I want to be reliant on someone else for my well-being?"".

50,"This has been a thing for me for as long as I can remember but a recent incident made me feel really guilty.

Our small canteen hired a cook. He cooked really well and was very clean. But we soon observed that he was having auditory hallucinations and delusions. This went on for around 3 weeks and we tolerated it because he was functional and respectful, but we learned that he was completely different to our staff, and it came to a point where he had the tendency to become violent.

We wanted to get him therapy but we didn't have the resources to. Also it would be a problem to convince him to get therapy. The government funded centers here also are not very conducive for recovery (I won't specify what country). We paid him and let him go. We gave a little extra just to help out even a bit. He was not remorseful or apologetic. Instead, his tone suddenly became sinister and threatening. But he seemed like he was used to it.

I feel guilty because he needed help, PROFESSIONAL HELP, but we could not give it to him. I feel guilty that he didn't realize that he had a problem. My manager keeps telling me that our safety is priority, and that he has family to go home to, and that he's had many jobs so he's able to take care of himself. I understand really.

Still, it just really sucks knowing that you can help, but at the same time, you can't. And I know that someone out there with the resources and time is willing to take the risk to help him out, but I just can't help but be frustrated with how we can't be in control of what we want to be in control of.

I also couldn't help but think that psychology should be more of a vocation and lesser of a profession. I sought advice from 2 psychologists who said that psychologists rarely do home-service, and if they do, it's expensive. I understand that it's a service, but what about those who can't afford it or aren't educated enough to realize they have a problem and won't even think about seeking help on their own? But I guess I'm just being too ideal. Our social workers aren't trained either to deal with mental illnesses.

Im currently on ketipinor 50 mg, Venlafaxin 150 mg, melatonin 3mg. Also I sometimes get so bad panic attacks that my dad actually has to sedate me or call 911 (It happens rarely though) I live with my dad and two dogs. I also have a mother and a brother. I dont know why i'm like this, why am I so ungrateful even though I have such a good life compared to some people? I have attempted suicide twice in my life and been in mental hospitals almost 6 months of my life. 

I have no friends and the only thing why I can't die yet is because of my dad and dogs. I can't leave them just like that. But im in pain all the time, it´s like im drowning 24/7, so surely my family would understand right? I dont know anymore. Im just drifting trough life at the moment. Im a pretty bad person, I drink and smoke daily. (I get really wasted only on weekends though) I know this sounds horrifying but im not even a virgin anymore. I just don't care what happens to me anymore. I feel so bad all the time and I just want some relief, even if its trough alcohol and sex. 

As you can see, im very desperate begging for help on the internet, but thats all I have left right now. I have tried everything else till now but nothing seems to be helping. So please help me, any comments are welcome right now.

58,"I’m writing this because I want to rehearse it before I go to my psychiatrist on March 5. The last time I went into a place for treatment I couldn’t bring myself to say anything, I made up a bunch of easy problems that were easy to solve because I wanted to go home and stop talking.

For my entire life I've had incredible difficulty doing the most basic things. When I was a kid I couldn't sit down next to the other kids in class and I would stand up for the whole day. I couldn't walk up or down stairs. I would crawl up them and scoot down them on my butt. This wasn't a physical problem. I knew how to do it right, I just had to do it the weird way. I wet the bed until I was 12. I needed to have someone read to me in order to sleep until I was 15.

As an adult I feel like I'm barely functioning. It takes me so much mental effort to talk on the phone, to take a shower, to send an email, to do anything at all. I used to think it was just terrible anxiety, but I don’t think it’s that. When I finally manage to say, hold a phone conversation, afterwards not only do I feel completely drained, I can’t control my movement. I twitch and wave my arms around, I make weird squawking and barking noises, sometimes I lose my balance.

I feel completely disconnected from everything. Nothing feels real and I'm getting scared. I'm just writing this so I'll be able to say it out loud when I have to. I don't want to lie again",20Feb2018,12

62,"Hello all. I just came home from work, and I feel exhausted. Again. I currently work as a technical recruiter (since last October), and because I do not experience any job satisfaction, I’ve decided to quit. 

Why this post? I’m mainly writing this because the activity in itself helps me to feel slightly better. Also, I hope to come into contact with individuals who can relate to my experiences and have suggestions to cope with it. 

I have studied philosophy and graduated in 2014. It was a great study, and although I wasn’t so naïve to think that getting a job was going to be easy, I didn’t expect it would turn out like this. I’ve had several jobs in the past, and none of them provided any satisfaction. People tell me that jobs aren’t supposed to give you satisfaction. Why not, I ask? Why must we continue wasting a large part of our lives to doing things that are simple, imposed, demarcated and repetitive? How isn't that undignified? 

There have been several reasons why past jobs have been difficult for me. For one thing, I’ve have experienced difficulties with authority telling me what to do. For another, I generally find the usual topics that are discussed during lunch breaks boring, to say the least. I have no interest in discussing sports, cars, gossip, music or material wealth. I’m generally confronted with the fact that most people do not care to talk about ethics, politics or other such subjects. It makes me feel like an outsider, and that, in turn, makes me more of an introvert (which, naturally, I’m not).  

I look at my colleague’s and I feel jealous and flabbergasted at the same time. They say they feel satisfaction with the work, but how can one feel satisfaction by doing the same, repetitive tasks every single day? How can they feel satisfaction when the company they work for has made more profit this year? I want to experience what they do, but this has been impossible for me. I’m turning into a sceptic more and more because I cannot see how they can experience the satisfaction they purport to feel.

I hate to admit this, but I’m convinced that Ted Kaczynski has a point. I’ve read his manifesto again, and I generally think that his arguments are valid and sound. That doesn’t mean that I respect him: I strongly condemn his actions of the past, and I consider him an evil individual because of that. But the truth of one’s words and the morality of one’s deeds are separate things. Can anyone here relate to this? What have you done that made you feel better? 

Thank you for your time to read this and I hope to learn from your suggestions.

69,"This is a vent on a throwaway account but I can’t sleep and don’t know where else to turn. I want to call a mental health hotline but I’m not actively suicidal or anything so I feel like I’d just be wasting the time of whomever answered.

Anyways, I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been living abroad for several years and the longer I’ve been away from home the more homesick I’ve gotten, and the more I’ve isolated myself. In part this is because of my job... I work an additional part-time job that requires me to live alone and I never thought I’d miss having roommates but so many days I don’t interact with anyone outside of work or transactions and I think that’s starting to take an unexpected toll.

I’ve also been in this relationship that has become steadily, increasingly one-sided. She no longer cares how much she sees me and has told me as much. But I still try to hold on to her. And then I hate myself for caring so much, and if I try to confront her about being unhappy she tells me my happiness is for me alone to determine, and intellectually I agree with her. She went through a major depression before and got through it on her own, and she had a much tougher upbringing than I did. But what if I’m just not as strong? Or what if there’s something chemically imbalanced with my brain that makes it not so simple? My family has a history of anxiety/depression, and here I am 8,000 miles away from home in a place where people don’t really speak my language and I’m working a job I don’t really love. I just feel trapped by everything and I don’t know how to escape it, because returning home would be admitting defeat. Sometimes I think about ending it all but I would never do that to my family. I don’t wanna go on anxiety meds because I’ve got an addictive personality and I’m terrified of the pharmaceutical industry. I can’t go to a therapist or counselor for professional reasons. I don’t wanna confide in my friends because I don’t wanna use them as free psychiatrists, I would feel guilty. I don’t wanna talk to my family because I know my parents would blame themselves for me feeling so rotten, even though they did everything right. And so on and so on. Meanwhile my anxiety and dare I say depression just keeps getting worse.

I just don’t know where to turn. On paper I’m living my best life and being my best self, and I’m in the prime of my life, but I’ve never felt so alone. ",20Feb2018,1

Backstory: I see my therapist every 1-2 weeks and talk to her online as well. (Thats all the backstory you need)

But when I need someone to just talk to me, she never seems to be online. Theres no way I can find someone, and my problem gets worse. I know there are suicide hotlines out there, but there arent any hotlines to just find people to talk to that are readily available. I feel like that should exist.

74,"My name is Gillian Potter and I'm a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. I'm conducting research with adults who live with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis and have experience with Mindfulness Meditation (at least a weekly practice). Mindfulness meditation is described as a practice of using an intentional, nonjudgmental, and accepting quality of attention towards present-moment experiences of the body and/or mind.

In this study, you will be asked to take part in an individual interview about how mindfulness impacts different aspects of your life. Some of the questions will include, “What role does mindfulness play in your life?” “How has mindfulness impacted your experiences with your illness?” This information will be used to better understand the processes of mindful living in the context of IBD. Participant names will not be used in this research, and any personally identifying information will be changed. 

All that would be involved is a telephone or Skype interview. If you fit this profile and are interested in participating, please send me an email (gillian.potter@usask.ca). Your help would be greatly appreciated, and would work to inform medical and psychological interventions in chronic illness! 

This study has been approved by, and received approval through, the Research Ethics Office, University of Saskatchewan. There are no conflicts of interest in this research to be declared in this research. I would be pleased to provide any additional information you may need!

Thanks everyone, Gillian",20Feb2018,1
75,"I am working with a major cable network looking for anyone struggling to get the proper diagnosis for forms of mental illness.  Are you or someone in your family suffering from what you think may be untreated mental illness? Have you tried “getting better” but have had multiple episodes that feel uncontrollable?
 
There's no easy test that can let someone know if there is mental illness. Unlike diabetes or cancer, there is no medical test that can accurately diagnose mental illness. And, there is no magical cure for mental health issues.
 
Many people who have mental health conditions consider their signs and symptoms a normal part of life or avoid treatment out of shame or fear. There is no shame in seeking help.
 
If you think you or your family member is suffering with mental illness and it’s tearing your family apart we would like to hear from you and help. We are looking for families for a documentary series on how people are diagnosed and how the family copes with and heals around mental health issues.
 
Please e-mail UndiagnosedCasting@gmail.com with your name/contact info, situation of the person struggling with their mental health and how it’s affected the family dynamic.  Thank you for your time and we look forward to hearing from you!",20Feb2018,2
76,"DW and I have been talking about seeing a therapist.  This has nothing to do specifically with our marriage (which has been going pretty well so far!), but rather just as a general outlet and sounding board for each of us.  She remarked how her sister and her fiancee see one semi-regularly, and others as well.  The tentative plan is for us to go individually with the occasional visit together, but not necessarily with the same therapist solo.

My question has to do with whether I should bring background materials for the therapist to get up to speed on my life more expediently.  I have kept a regular journal for the past 6+ years, currently 550+ pages and counting in a Word file.  While it does start at a particularly low point in my life, it is heavy in not only my day to day thoughts, but over time has retold many childhood stories and experiences with my family, school, friends, adversaries, work, etc.  The first quarter of it in particular would tell stories that otherwise take many months to retell in-session.  It chronicles everything right up to my present day marriage and new family and shows how far I've managed to come on my own.

The other paper I am wondering if I should bring is a copy of a workup I had in 2012 when I started to wonder if I actually had Adult Aspergers or something similar.  This report was the result of a full-day session talking about my life, their observations of me, a full MMPI-2 workup, IQ test, and other things I can't remember off the top of my head.

When a therapist is found, should I offer to bring these, and if so, do you think they will actually read them or just take them to humor me?

Thank you in advance for your input.",20Feb2018,1
77,"Coudnt think of a better word than violently, not trying to scare anyone. Immediately upon being exposed to cringy situations on tv my tension skyrockets and I immediately begin muttering to myself rather loudly. ""Shut up"", ""you fucking idiot"", ""it's ok Joe"" along with a slew of other things. I very litterally shut down completely when I'm exposed to these things and repeatedly make an ass out of myself in public. 


It bleeds over into real life situations as well. I was hanging out with a girl I liked and I just was so nervous and tense the entire time. Finally it got so unbearable that I just started hitting myself in the head with an open palm. That is very uncommon but does happen when I'm in a very extreme amount of distress because of awkwardness. That memory alone illicits the same kinds of responses now if I dwell on it for too long.


I had thought it was something akin to tourettes, but it's not random and has a very specific trigger. And when I'm stressed out about my social awkwardness because of this, the problem gets so much worse. Unsure if it's misophoria, but that's as close to a real diagnosis as I have. It puts a terrible burden on trying to interact with other people and I'm not sure what I can do about it.

The reason I wrote this now was because I was watching a movie - Kingsman golden circle - and the main character just yelled at the king and it caused me to again start muttering and yelling at myself alone in my own room. So it's been paused on the television for more than twenty minutes while I take a break and calm down a bit. I would be very open to any thoughts or recommendations anyone could offer.",20Feb2018,2
