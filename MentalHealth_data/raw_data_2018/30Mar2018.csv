0,"It is one of my main symptoms: huge dark eye circles. I am 19 and I look so damn exhausted because I struggle with the things going on in my mind, my brain, my life. It just takes so much energy. My body looks tired, my face, everything. I just dont know what is happening to me, my symptoms dont fit the psychosis spectrum, a little bit of OCD, but delusions too, but I have a main problem with my identity, it is split, I dont feel like a normal person. I just dont know what to do, I feel like a lost case tbh. I rather have a clear diagnosis than living with this unknown shit but it is not possible. I'll be treated for OCD soon...

Anyways, I think this time I wont get rid of the mental suffering, so my body wont fully repair and I'll end up even more exhausted. What can I do to prevent this?

I’m sorry
For apologizing
Because I do it every five minutes 
And for asking if I’m annoying you
Because I annoy myself
And for taking ten minutes to respond to a text
Because it has to be just right
And for lying
Because if I say I have plans
My plans are to lay in bed thinking about how I should’ve just told the truth
And for tricking you
Into thinking that I’m a reliable person
And for seeming distant
Because I’m having a conversation with myself
About how awful I am
And for crying
And for texting you at 2 in the morning because I’m having my weekly existential crisis 
And for questioning if you’re really my friend
Because I don’t know why anybody would want to be within ten feet of me

Because this seems like it will never end

2,"Well, a few bits of background information about me are in order.
I'm a 17 yo dude from Poland, currently in high school. Didn't really know where to write all of this. It's also my first post ever on Reddit. Long-ish post ahead.
I don't even know what to start with. For as long as I remember, I have been simply devoid of all feelings and emotions, save for the negative ones, and some positive outbursts. Even if I do feel something, it's weak, and dissipates almost immediately. There is also no mental part of experiencing emotions on my side. I can yell at someone, smile, or cry, but I just don't have any sort of mental reaction, only the physical. My head is also completely empty of thought; there is nothing. 
I'm completely apathetic as well. Nothing moves me. Not even the death of several people I personally knew. I can't gather any remorse, sadness nor empathy towards anyone. It's like I'm unable to care for any being other than myself, and even that is questionable. I often feel unusually bad about myself, and think stuff like ""Why won't someone just kill me"".
I have no interests/hobbies, everything I do, which is wasting all my time playing LoL and browsing the internet, is only to kill time. I don't get any enjoyment from whatever I do. I probably would just lay in my bed staring lifelessly at the ceiling if I couldn't do that. It's like I'm a soulless husk, a zombie.
No social life for me either. I have 8 people I call ""friends"", which is wrong, because I simply don't care about them. They sort of started talking to me for no reason, and are sticking around. I don't know why. There is nothing appealing about me.
Now my lack of thought and interest in anything, complete with a lack of general knowledge on what's happening, makes me unable to socialize/talk. I can go weeks without saying a word. I also don't feel any need to speak, socialize, etc etc.
Sorry for the disorganized sentence structure, there is so much more I could've written, but who would read that.
How do I conclude? This is getting mentally tiring for me. I am only 6 months away from my 18, already failed a year in school, have no job experience, skills, or willpower to gather either. It's not going to end up well for me, if I don't do something to become a normal, feeling human again. I just want to feel happiness again.

Tl;dr - I'm a emotionally dead, lifeless doll, without any willpower or purpose.",30Mar2018,1,
3,"I'm 19, M, I'll try to keep this short. Essentially I don't feel normal when I'm around other people. They seem to be talking, socializing, and happy, and I try to copy or mimic the way other people socialize or act to feel normal. I try to smile, say hello, and do normal stuff, but it feels extremely fake, almost like I'm a robot. I can't really find anything to talk about, for example in class, people are chatting and stuff and I'm just looking and pretending like I know what's going on. I can't really remember things that well either so I'll forget what I'm talking about in conversation. I've tried to make changes, I got a hobby I really enjoy, I've been reading, trying to get out of my comfort zone more, talk to more people, go on dates, recently I got another job, I've been trying to improve my confidence by clearing up my acne, doing weights and working on my body language. I've stopped using weed as much as I used to, keeping it to max 3x last month, as well as stopping most porn usage. All these things said I feel pretty unhappy right now.

I'm an adult male who have been struggling with depression the past 4 years, and I cannot seem to get through it, so I'm trying to vent/share my story here in a desperate attempt to get *something* out of it.


My childhood was largely influenced by being left out of social happenings, which lead to being an easy target for bullies. There was no apparant reason for me being bullied, other than being picked as an outsider of sorts. In hindsight, I could've been more socially smart than I was and gotten myself out of the situation. Nevertheless, I was bullied for about 10 years from the age of 7 through 17, but I had soccer/football to keep my head above water all the way through. 



My parents was completely unaware of the bullying, simply because I didn't let them in on it. I was ashamed of being some sort of victim, and to proud to let anyone help me. Some parts of me really wanted them to help, but subconsciously I expected them to tell me that I was a pussy and that I weren't *THAT* bullied. I also have a tense relationship with my father, a typical top-manager dad that brings home his work to his family. No fun to be around and always talking to me like I was his employee. 

My mother always tried to help me and defend me against that type of behaviour, which led to conflicts between them, that again decreased my willingness to share *anything* with them. My problems was always undermined and explained as exaggaration. Now that I'm older, I can see the constant manipulation. My love for my parents is strong, but I also hold a grudge against them, which I have told them aswell. They tell me that they wanted to do what was best for me, and that they did what they could. I believe them, but it was not enough. I feel like they always took the easy way out and blamed me and my head for everything.


However - I was constantly excluded from parties and social-happening, cyber bullying, tried to beat me up to establish some sort of social dominance in their respective group, stealing my stuff, name-calling. The standard bullying package on your local high-school (4,99$ monthly). 
They even made a fake MSN-account that was a girl with the pure intention of fucking me over. 

I HAVE to tell the MSN-story, because it somewhat humours me in an ambivalent way; they created an account which seemed to be a really nice and cute girl. Nothing sexual or anything like that, but it was just a really nice person talking to me all the time. After having contact with this fictious girl over the course of 5 months, they revealed themselves and for 2 years I got constantly harrassed over this incident. Especially when they found out that I thought I had a crush on this online person. 

This episode happened when I was an insecure 14 year old boy, with no friends whatsoever. The culprits? Three female bullies which were in my class, and boy did they share that story with everyone they could. For me at the time, it was a drop in the ocean and just another thing I could get harrased for. A sad drop, but a drop nonetheless.


Luckily, the bullying somewhat stopped when I 

* decided enough was enough, and knocked one of the bullies out cold

* became a professional soccer player. 

Sadly, the only solution for me was violence. I am not a violent person, and I hate to do others harm, but this incident was in self-defence. On my regular route home from school, I got attacked and decided to fight back for once. The bully kicked my leg and punched the side of my chest from behind while I walked about 3 times. I tried to keep my cool, but when he actually managed to trip me, I lost it and turned around. One punch straight to the jaw and a kick in the face as he fell (which made him lose his tooth), and I was suddenly not as harmless as I seemed to be. People started to think twice before harrasing me.
I was still excluded tho, but it was wonderful to just get some quiet around me for once, even if it ment going against my beliefs against violence.



Times changed even more drastically when I became a professional football player. There was some sort of idiotic social status to it, especially when you are 18 years old with a contract. Please keep in mind that neither the club I played for, nor the country I reside is considered especially impressive when it comes to football, but it's still a dream for thousands of kids, and locally I was more than welcome to become anyones friend. However, I had grown into such a cynic (or a skeptic, if you will) that I doubted everyones motives around me. This dream did came to an abrupt end when my back went to bricks and pieces when I was 20 years old. Back to square, with no real friends and no plans or desires for my life.

But I got a taste of love. My first girlfriend, one of the best persons that excist in my mind. Even to this day.
When I saw her, I was completely out of breath. She was a small brunette, had an Ed Hardy-cap on (**LOL**) and had the most beautiful green-brown eyes I ever saw. For the first time in my life, I couldn't help myself - I talked to her. She smiled back, and I just asked her to spend some time with me. She fucking said yes, and I couldn't believe it. This was one of the greatest girls I have, and probably will ever meet. She became my girlfriend for the next 4 years, and we studied together and hung out pretty much every god-damned day we could. Sadly, we outgrew eachother for a variety of reasons.

But she decided to jump into bed with one of my roommates, who at the time was one of my best friends, straight after out break-up. This tore me completely apart, the one person I put my full trust on had hurt me that bad. I do not blame her for it tho, I just want to acknowledge that it tore a huge hole in my heart that probably isn't going to heal back up. It changed me. It started my depression.



For the past 4 years, I have graduated from college, got myself a new girlfriend (3 1/2 years and still running), got an OK job at a bank, but still I cannot shake the depression I have. I'm not socializing well at all, which I used to do at the college I went to. I'm activly excluding myself from the company of others, while I self-loath and complain about how fucking bored and sad I am all day. I try to keep up a smile, but the past weeks I just can't. I'm tired and my body has given up completely. I feel like the wierdo that just doesn't fit in anywhere.

Thoughts of suicide are going through my head at a larger rate than usual, and my body somewhat welcomes it more. I have tried several therapists, but they cannot seem to help me with my issues. I'm also becoming more open about my depression by trying to acknowledge that I **am** not the depression, but the depression is a part of me. I find no joy with my girl, my job, my hobbies or myself. Not a single person that has chosen to partake in my life deserves to let me be their burden. They deserve to see person that smiles once or twice a day. And I'm shitscared that I'm burning bridges in all directions by the minute.

Luckily I have an appointment with my doctor in a few days. Maybe it helps..

I also want to sprinkle *some* positivity: Remember that someone loves you, and don't forget the happy thoughts. :)

5,"There once was a house, small and white with a wrap around porch and a beautiful yard. The most beautiful part was the flower bed. There were Lillie’s, red pink and white  roses, and tulips and tall beautiful sunflowers. Everyone who walked past stopped to admire the beautiful garden. The wonderful man, in the beautiful house loved the garden and the beauty it added to his wonderful home. He picked the weeds and rid it of pests that tried to take away the beautiful plants that grew strong and tall. One day the man moved away. He married a women and needed somewhere new to stay. Soon after a new man moved in. He took one look at the flowers in front of his new found home, and stepped on them on  the way to the door. In the months that followed he never picked weeds, he never shewed pests, he did not seem to care about the house. When others came around and whispered about the once beautiful house losing its luster, he told them it was because of the previous owner. It wasn’t his fault. He tried the best he could but the flowers just weren’t strong enough. The flowers began to wilt. The weeds became abundant, the pests ate away at the flowers that remained. Soon the flower bed was unrecognizable. You would never guess the soil once held such beautiful plants. ",30Mar2018,31,
6,"I don’t know where to start, constantly I feel like I’m not welcome, at no fault of other people, I feel like I don’t belong and like I’m not wanted, like I’m bothering everyone and they’d be better off if I wasn’t there or if they didn’t know me, this even extends to family and I obviously know they love me but I still feel like I am a burden on them all. It tortures me, as I wish I didn’t give a shit, like I wish that even though I feel it I didn’t care, but I do. Not because I need people to talk to or because of any harm on myself, as much as I obviously want to socialise the main torture comes from the feeling that I’m bringing discomfort to others. Every time I see someone sad, it fucking kills me, and I hate it, why do I feel their emotions, why does there pain bring me pain. This sounds horrible. I obviously wish no pain to anyone and think empathy is good but I feel as if I am overly empathetic. I would argue there’s no such thing but sometimes it feels like I’m hurting more then the person who was originally sad. The worst thing about this all is I am often so happy so I feel like saying this is attention seeking or unfair on all the others who suffer mental illness and are constantly tortured. I feel like I have no right to complain and like I’m weak for even thinking that I have mental illness. But is this just a biproduct of mental illness.

Hello,

I'm really concerned about my mom's mental state at this point. Late last year she said to me that she believed that someone bugged her phone. When we would talk on the phone she claimed that she could hear the person breathing in the background and sometimes making comments. I just brushed it off and would laugh anytime she would attack the ""listener"". 

Before I go forward I need to make this clear: She really hates the neighbors, I mean REALLY. And we live in a house, single-family style.

I would say around January of this year is when things got wild. The family computer wouldn't boot up *which has happened before, like 3 yrs ago* and she was convinced that one of the neighbors hacked into the computer, took some files, and tried to permanently shut it down. Also with this same neighbor, she claimed that she heard the women and her significant other moving around in their bed and they were talking. There is no way she heard that because every house has a different layout and I would've heard that. 

Other things have gone on, like one of the outside lights went out and she claimed that another neighbor broke it. She will go on these rants, just talking to herself about the neighbors. Also, anyone driving around the neighborhood is connected with her enemies. 

I really need some advice.

9,"Hey all,

First off, I'm in Northern California. 

A family member (adult) is on disability for mental health issues and also has a history of drug abuse. Another family member (adult) has attempted to support this person for MANY years, but is preeeetty codependent and long story short their relationship is a huge toxic mess. 

The first person is safe and has stable housing (thanks to the 2nd person) but is definitely at risk for relapse of any sort at any time, including the pressure they interpret from the 2nd person, and a huge fear of the 2nd person backing off is relapse. 

I've offered some ideas of how to change the methods of support, but MOSTLY I am very interested in finding some kind of 3rd party to step in and support both people, but especially the first person with mental health/addiction issues, get their life together, learn skills, access resources, access positive community, etc., or at least just check in regularly / serve as a mentor who isn't family. 

Does this exist? I tried to do some research today but it looks like what I'm imagining is only available to people who have just left inpatient treatment. This person has been through inpatient before but their most recent hospitalization was due to an alcohol overdose during which they should have died but their mania basically kept them alive. That was about 5 months ago. Things improved for a little while after that hospital visit (re-evaluated meds, saw a social worker, got sober for like a month) but the improvement definitely hasn't lasted, and the relationship between these two people is extremely unproductive and toxic, despite love and best intentions. 

Best case scenario would be a 3rd party who is paid, whether via insurance / state resources, or privately, because I am guessing this will be a very challenging role to play at times with mood swings and resistance. 

(I know you can't help someone who won't help themselves / doesn't want help... but... I don't know. I just don't feel like that's applicable in this situation, given the mood swings and what I can tell from the individual's truest of wants for themselves. )

So... any help? Any resources? Any search terms I can use to try and find help? 

The plan is already to attend therapy together, and to construct some kind of contract to ensure therapy happens for at least 6 months before re-evaluating. But there's lots of reasons to want a 3rd party who can pull some weight in keeping the first individual accountable / giving support to help the first individual take better control of their life (which they want, but very much struggle to obtain). 

Any help or advice or even just kind words would be amazing. It's been a pretty enormous tax on my family for many many years, and as the youngest person involved who has watched this all my life I am definitely feeling the weight.

10,"Lately I’ve been pondering on what had caused my severe depression and anxiety, even to having scary religious delusions. My parents have been divorced for about ten years but I don’t think that’s the true cause, though it could be a factor. I’m starting to think that my long history of being socially excluded from my peers in school is the main culprit though. I have been quite shy and easily sensitive (from not being able to talk until I was three) as far as I can remember from pre-k until somewhat now as a senior in high school. It honestly does hurt seeing everyone still distant from me despite my efforts in being friendly. However, in every medical article on depression that I’ve read, being impacted by social exclusion doesn’t appear as a cause. So is it all in my head? Should I just buck up and hide my feelings to avoid embarrassing myself? I don’t think I’ve ever been abused or suffered from serious trauma so maybe it’s not that big of a deal? What do y’all think?

12,"Hey everyone. 

I'm extremely new to reddit (this is my first post ever, as it happens) so I apologize if I step on any proverbial toes in this post. This is gonna take some explaining, but I hope it's at least semi-cogent.

I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (Asperger's syndrome) in late high school, with the usual quirks: poor social skills, high anxiety, a tendency to become easily depressed, etc. I was first hospitalized for suicidal ideation near the end of my junior year, but I was able to recover and finish out my high school career with good enough grades to attend my state's flagship university on a scholarship.

When I got to university things fell apart fast: I wasn't used to all the socializing, the place was massive, I couldn't manage the work/life balance well without the help of my parents, and the anxiety became so extreme that I experienced derealization and depersonalization (this has happened since then periodically whenever I'm extremely anxious), hallucinations, and paranoia. Needless to say, I dropped out and returned home.

The psychological blow from that experience was bad enough that I was despondent for close to two years. I didn't take care of myself, physically or mentally, and just wallowed in self-pity. Things started to turn around a bit when my parents arranged for me to see a therapist (not the one mentioned in the title of the post; we'll get to her in a second), who said I was ready to return to college, this time more locally. I went again and lasted about a month; rinse and repeat (the same therapist once again saying that I was ready to return to school after another five or so months of therapy) and I made it one week. In between the second and third attempt I tried to hold down a job, which I was able to do for six months. My leaving that job was unrelated, in my view, to psychology; I have a bad back congenitally and the job involved constant heavy lifting.

Currently (I'm 23) my parents and I have postponed all plans for returning to school indefinitely. I'm with a therapist now, who I more-or-less like, but I'm starting to distrust. She was very helpful initially (she's in the CBT tradition to provide some context), but I'm starting to wonder about her more practical advice.

Which brings us to the salient part of my post: my therapist wants me to apply for Social Security Insurance, a welfare program in the United States for the disabled. I have absolutely no objection to welfare or entitlement programs in principle, but I do have a problem with viewing myself as disabled in that sense, or worse, taking money out of a system when it should be there for people who really need it. I recognize that autism is a disability, but my ability to finish high school (I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma, was an AP Scholar with Distinction, and had a 3.9 GPA) seems to belie the fact that I can't do intellectual work. Likewise, if I had a job that didn't involve heavy lifting, I'd likely be able to do at least part-time work.

I guess I'm just trying to get some perspective on all of this. For further context, I have made some progress, mostly by reversing previous negative coping techniques: I've quit smoking, quit drinking, I've started exercising, I've lost some weight, and I'm eating a more balanced diet. There are some kinks to iron out (my meds are still being adjusted, for instance), but I'm optimistic, on the whole, about the future, despite some occasionally bad (or awful) days.

On the other hand, it's true that I haven't been able to do well in college yet. It's also true that the unemployment rate (in my country, the United States) for those with autism spectrum disorder is elevated compared to the general population. I honestly don't know what to think, and neither do my parents. 

Anyways, this post has gone on long enough. I appreciate any and all responses, and I won't lie by saying I'm not nervous about posting here: I am! I guess social anxiety is transferable to the Internet.

Also, if you need me to clarify anything to give a better response, feel free to ask. I can get specific (within reason) if necessary.",30Mar2018,4,
13,"I am a 26 yo male and I'm doing this to help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues, especially in men, and to open a dialogue for other people who might be struggling. 

Some background:
I met my friend freshmen year of college. We roomed blind together and so we had no idea how we would get along, but we instantly became inseparable. We ended up living together all 4 years of school and I considered myself closer to him than I was with my own brother. 

After graduation, we went different ways, but we always managed to stay in touch, texting each other every couple of weeks, mainly to reminisce and just say hello. It is my greatest regret that I didn't do more to stay in touch and to make it a point to visit. 

I got the call while I was at work. A member of our friend group spam called me, which I ignored at first, but eventually I picked up on the 4th of 5th call. I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. I remember calling in an employee to come cover my shift (I was the only one working so I couldn't just leave). I remember thinking over and over again that my hands wouldn't work right (I know now I was in shock). I remember vomiting. 

I've dealt with a lot since then. The funeral was one of the toughest things I ever had to sit through. Most of my law school applications were due soon after, and I couldn't think of anything to write about but him, so that's what I did (I also got in and am attending now). Pretty much any reminder of him (which was pretty much everything) sent me into tears, and it wasn't for at least 4 months where I thought I was starting to get better. Turns out, I was just avoiding thinking about it while I focused on moving and starting school. I remember one night in particular, the song ""Heavy"" by Lincoln Park came on. I sat there listening to it and just thinking how sad I was. I just wanted to stop being sad for 1 minute. Think about that for a minute. The ideal scenario I could think of at that moment wasn't being happy, it was to just feel nothing. All I can say is, thank god I lived with my girlfriend at the time (and still do). I can unequivocally say that I would have attempted to take my life that night if I had lived alone.

One of the hardest things I've had to deal with is my new interactions at school. I used to be super outgoing, always trying to make friends with everyone. Now, I'm inside my own head so much that half the time I walk by people I know, I don't even realize they're there until too late. I'm sure some people think I'm just an asshole. 

Recently, my days seem to be going a lot better. I made it a point to join a mental health awareness group at my school, and it gave me a platform to get information to others who might be struggling as well. I figure if I can help others with the struggle, then maybe I'll feel a little less guilty that I didn't do more to help my friend (I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it). As of right now, my plan is to go into policy making as a career upon graduation, with the intention of helping to end suicide for good.

TLDR: Best friend took his own life, I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts afterwards, and now I'm working towards a career in policy making that will help me to raise awareness about the issue.

14,"I've suffered from poor self esteem, depression and social anxiety for most of my life.  Until recently I attributed these feelings to a traumatic accident I had as a kid, but I've realized that my feelings of brokenness and inadequacy were taught by my mother, and I need help learning how to accept this realization, and how to heal from it. Here are a few examples of how I was taught to believe I was handicapped, or incapable:


-After my accident my mom had me repeat the 3rd grade, despite the fact that the doctors told her it wasn't neccesary.  

-Just a few months after the accident my family moved to a new town, away from my friends and my social support network.  The kids in my new school had no idea what I had just experienced, and I had to adjust to a new life while still utterly traumatized from the recent accident.  

-A couple of years later she decided I needed cosmetic surgery to fix some minor consequences of the accident.  I never asked for the surgery, but I went along with it because I trusted my mom.  I remember at a pre-op meeting with the plastic surgeon the doctor stood me in front of a mirror and pointed out the problems with my face that needed to be corrected.  I told him ""I don't see anything wrong"", then he turned me into the light so the flaws could be more visible and I consented.  That surgery was brutal.  The incision became terribly infected and painful, it looked gross and it hurt so badly that I couldn't bare to wash my hair, so I looked like a mess, and the kids at school were really mean to me about it.  

-In the years following my mom started telling me things like people who have had terrible accidents like mine shouldn't expect to go to college, and can't go to a regular high school, so she started looking at special schools for me.  I put my foot down and demanded to go to the same high school as everyone else.  Back then she would say things to me like ""You know, some people never get married, and if that's the case with you, you shouldn't worry"" as if to suggest that that is the outcome that I should expect.  

-When I was in high school my mom enrolled me into horse therapy.  The instructor would have me do weird exercises on horseback.  After a while it just became horseback riding lessons, and they eventually had me train for a competition.  When competition day finally came, I noticed all of the other participants were significantly handicapped.  The only person I personally competed against was profoundly autistic.  After it was over my mom and the lady who ran the place were congratulating me on a job well done, then they told me that I needed to start training really hard because the Olympics were coming up in a few months.  I was really confused.  I had only been riding horses for a few months, how could they be talking about the Olympics?  I asked her about this and she said, ""No, I mean the Special Olympics"".  

After all that, I'm now nearing 30 and I've never had the confidence to meet someone and never had a relationship that lasted for more than a few days.  I've realized that these things my mom taught me about myself are a lie, but I don't know how to stop believing them.  Also I don't know how to keep them from affecting my relationship with my mother.  Despite the negativity of this post I love her a lot, and I'd never tell her that I feel this way.  What do I do?

The first was this morning.  I was playing a video game with my cousin online. My cousin is an alpha like leader top of the pack, Bitching yelling kind of person. He likes to try to dominate people. And I had had enough. I don't like the alpha mindset. It doesn't agree with me. If a person cant be my Equal they can't be my better. I am my own person I make my own decisions. and If I want to go left and he wants to go right.  I still go left, he gets upset and called me a son of a bitch. he meant it.  I snapped, Like Bad, I told him he needed to shut the fuck up chill the fuck out before they have to wipe him off my walls with baby wipes.   When I said this, I was like, nearly stroking raging angry. But you have to understand. I had simply had enough of his Alpha dominating bullshit. And I mean every word. They would have had to wipe him off my walls with baby wipes. I wasn't joking. 

The next two where just online with strangers which doesn't amount to much. My thing is this. I know I was still in an ill mood, and the other two probably just spilled over. But I know there has to be something wrong with me, My other friend was here to, He just kind of stayed quiet and didn't say much through the whole thing. 

Is it wrong to blow up like that? Please understand this wasn't about just where to go and what to do in a video game. This cousin, He has to feel like he's in charge of people and over them and they do what he says. It gives him a thrill, And I've just never been a person that follows people. I do my own thing. so this had been building up for months and months. and today was when it call came out.  

So, Am I mental? What would you have done? ",30Mar2018,1,

30,"10 months ago I went off my antipsychotics. It was the biggest decision of my life. I was on them for 13 years I'm 25. A lot of people describe being on antipsychotics as being a zombie. I can't agree with this 100%. For me, it's being idle. I sit back and watch almost like an out of body experience. I watch this thing walk around and do nothing. Listen to everyone not fight back. The pills make me gain weight. Lose motivation and just become nothing. 

On the other hand being off meds was a different hell. I don't know how to react. It was like waking up after a coma. I lost 13 years of my life to these pills. Clozaril schizophrenia meds. They helped my hallucinations. I was tormented by them as a kid. It was the only med that somewhat worked. I hated them though.

I made the mistake of pulling an all-nighter not eating then going to a party with friends. They offered some weed and I had what I thought was just a bad trip. I felt everyone in the room had some plan against me.

Normally I would have put this as just weed-induced paranoia. But it never really stopped. I've become constantly paranoid. I've felt like I heard everything that has gone on in my life. Like a never-ending Deja Vu. It's been making me feel really crazy. I've done some incredible things since leaving the meds behind. I've helped a young man deal with his stalker safely we even talked her out of suicide. I helped the cops stop a school shooter at my college. I a managed to help some poor girls deal with their sexual harassment case in my college.

But there were terrible things as well. Just in the last 3 months, I lost 3 of my closest family members. The last one was especially difficult it was my grandmother. What was tough was not the grief but my family could not find my father. They found me though. They had no way of getting in contact with him and asked me to be the one to tell him his mother was dead. 

My life is getting exhausting. I have severe trouble with social interactions. I don't want to keep going on. I'm not suicidal exactly. I'm sitting here typing this thinking about taking the meds again. They are on my desk. But I don't want to be idle again. I really don't. 

It kind means I won't exist for a while. I like who I am better off meds. I like feeling. I like being in control. I'm doing a mix of emdr and DBT therapies which I found out recently is exactly what I needed. 

Nothing is helping. In fact, I've gotten worse. I'm starting to question reality more often. I get the feeling of deja vu so often now it's scary. I feel like there is something in my head warning me to not do something but I can't tell what it is saying. When something goes wrong or something terrible happens I feel like I heard about it somewhere before.

So I'm not sure what to do next. I'm continuing the therapy I guess. I'm trying to resist the meds as long as I can. I really want to exist. I know I'll most likely have to become idle again. There are many people I've met they I love and would like to get to know more. But once I go back on meds I won't really have a chance. I'll probably not leave my apartment at all except to eat or go to class. I fall into a routine and avoid all interactions. I guess I see the zombie thing a bit.

If you actually took the time to read all of this thank you. If you have some advice. I'd appreciate it. My moments of clarity are fairly long. So I'll be able to respond. I hate that this sounds like a story someone made up. I'm separating myself from my friends a lot lately. I don't have it in me to be around them.

I'm questioning everyone around me but I've found it easier to talk to people when it's anonymous. I don't question things really when I can't picture the person.

Oddly I get the deja vu feeling just from writing this so I think I'll stop here. It's nice to type this out though. I'm not so much in my head now. Thank you. And please if you can tell me what I should do I really need it.",30Mar2018,10,
31,"I am an active member of the r/makeuprehab community because I realized how quickly I started just buying things, things I'd never have used before and don't really use still.  Ever since I found that community, I started to analyze my thoughts with regards to purchasing, and why I was doing it.  I obsess about products I want.  Every day I check the forums to see what's on sale, and what I like.  I have done this kind of thing my whole life, and makeup is the trend right now.

But that trend is being muscled out by my desire to travel to my favorite country, Japan.  YouTube showed me all of the beautiful places there, and I actually went with my wonderful husband.  Twice.  We've finally decided to try getting pregnant, which in my mind equals no travel for years, especially not to great places like Japan.  The possibility of getting pregnant has filled my mind with the things I'll be losing, like the freedom to be a slob, and the ability to make my own time as I see fit, and more than anything miss out on Japan.  It's so strong, and makes me feel so resentful and concerned with the idea of getting pregnant right now, that I want to go again in the next couple of months to get that urge out the way.  We can afford it and I will be off soon (since I teach) so it would only mean vacation time for my husband.

I get like this about the makeup too, as I have about dieting, working out, school, job stuff, etc.  I tell myself I need that lipstick, or that cake, or that day off, or the next episode, and know it's true.  I do need those things, or it lurks in the back of my mind.  When I finally get what I need, the obsession is gone and I'm fine again.  It's something I knew about myself really early, and it's why I don't drink.  I know it's too much of a lure for me.

My husband has told me he doesn't want to go to Japan again so soon, and that we don't have to wait too long, but for him, it's years out.  I know that's reasonable, but his idea that it's only two or three years away rather than the seven or eight a kid would push it to (although actually even more since we want multiple kids, which means probably ten to fifteen years before we can travel with three or four kids to a place like Japan).  It's lurking in my mind and I really need help with some tips and help getting it out of my focus because since he said that, I now know it won't happen.

Thank you for your help.  I don't want to be obsessive like this.  I also understand that if your tips don't help, and maybe even if they do, I should talk to someone.  It's just that it's the middle of the night here and I can't sleep.",30Mar2018,3,

I do not know if hypochondria is the proper term for what I experience:    
    
When I was 16, I had the flu, and I got out of bed and when I stood up I passed out. It was just from dehydration, and a drop in blood pressure. The ambulance came, I went to the hospital, it was scary because I had no experience with anything ever being wrong with me. Little did I know that this single event would change my life forever. A few months later was when I first experienced symptoms of panic. It was scary. This feeling made me fear being in public and having panic. It also made me fear being “stuck” someplace, which meant I always had to be the one to drive, that way I could tell myself “I can leave if I start to feel panicked”.     
    
Over the last 10 years that anxiety has morphed into a full blown “im afraid that my body can’t perform normally”. Unsurprisingly, over these years I’ve developed heart palpitations (skipped beats). Well, I’m afraid to exercise, or do any sort of actions that get my heart rate going, because I’m afraid there’s something wrong with my heart and *I’ll die of cardiac arrest or something*.     
   
I get short of breath easily and I’m afraid I’ll *go into respiratory distress or won’t be able to catch my breath or something*.     
    
I am afraid of myself. Of my own health uncertainties, not so much “every spot on my skin is definitely melanoma and I’m gonna die” but more specifically, I am afraid of myself having an acute emergency or pseudoemergency like an episode of SOB or tachycardia with skipped beats that don’t go away and I pass out and it’s a whole emergency and it’s embarrasing and stuff.    
    
I have had a few cardiac work ups in the past. A holter, a stress test, 3 echos. EKGs. “Everything is fine and you just have anxiety” doesn’t keep me from thinking “well what if they’re wrong, what if I’m the exception, what if my condition is not like the others who have benign palpitations”.    
    
I love life and I want so badly to be a normal functioning adult who can run without wondering how his heart is going to act.

I am a 25 year old male; I spent the last 8 years of my life in the military as an infantry soldier. During that time I also went to university and maintained a 3.77 GPA across various classes from humanities to hard sciences like the infamous human anatomy and physiology courses. I was admitted last year to one of the top universities in my country (Canada). So I left the army at 24 and went to peruse a degree; but they fucked me (literally due to them over enrolling to many students; thought they claim my admission was caused by a ""computer error"" and I was admitted to my secondary faculty choice dispite multiple email and all of my university paper work confirming it was to study medicine). So now I'm in a program I hate but can't just up and leave and I already quit my job. But in Canada basically their is no legal outlet as a student for me to take because fuck it; the laws give universities absurd power over students; my freedom of information request is literally just black page after black page of redactions.

I literally feel nothing ... I just don't get it anymore. I don't want to keep going because I honestly don't have any end goals anymore. I hate everyone in my life, I can barely stand talking to my own family and just sit around and waste time. 

The only time I feel even the remotest sense of happiness is when I'm going to sleep; because I always secretly hope that I won't have to wake up.

I literally don't know what to do ... I'm worried I'm throwing my life away but I literally can't care enough to get out of bed most days? 

Then throw into the mix that lately all I've been able to dream about is going to prisons and getting stabbed by gangs. I have no idea why? No criminal record nor any reason to suspect I would be going to prison. 

Also I feel lonely I suppose but I hate talking to people b/c I'm awkward at times these days . . . I wasn't always awkward I just don't feel safe around people anymore ... I don't trust people either ... 

I know something is wrong with me ... But I have neither the resources (or honestly desire) to talk to a professional because it would fuck up my life if I ever tried to reapply for the army or something similar. I literally feel like I don't know what I'm even doing minute to minute anymore ...

Anyway thoughts? Before I get to head back to bed and hopefully I don't have to wake up again ...

I obviously wish no pain to anyone but I am overly empathetic. I would argue there’s no such thing but sometimes it feels like I’m hurting more then the person who was originally sad.

That when I mess up a single letter on a page in my notebook it takes a mental battle not to rip it out and start another page. That having the slightest mess in my room makes me too stressed to sleep and gives me trouble. That there's so many times I just don't feel like my life is real and that it's just one of my dreams fading into reality. That my classmates are some of the most toxic human beings on the planet and while I am not the best person either I stay up at night worried about their drug habits and relationships even though they couldn't give two cents about me. That out of the 3 people I call friends I only trust one and that's because of the fact that she's a loner and hates talking to everyone except me and only has things in common with me. That I'm so scared of not being perfect, being a burden or letting any of the people in my life down. I'm so scared I might miss the chance at medical school I've been working so hard for by going to a psychiatrist and being diagnosed. I'm scared of having to take pills after being given too high of doses for my body by so many doctors who cared so little about trying to help me that they couldn't even be bothered to read my weight off the clipboard they wrote it on moments earlier.

-They think it makes them weak.
-‎They think the whole thing is a ploy by Big Pharma.
-‎They hate the thought of being chained to meds their whole life.
-‎They think it'll change who they are.
-‎They're worried about the cost.
-‎And many others.

Well, fuck that. Fuck all of that. It's bullshit and you know it.

You know what taking meds makes you? A smart motherfucker who has taken the time to figure out their own shit, and realize they need the help of medication. 

Meds aren't the answer for everyone. Many people can control their mental health through therapy, meditation, lifestyle changes, etc. AND THAT'S AWESOME! 

But there are a lot of people - ya boi included - who know their brain chemistry is well and truly fucked without their meds. It sucks, but one can't control your brain chemistry through force of will alone.

Most people in my life forget I'm bipolar because I've worked hard with my care team to figure out the right combo of meds (3 meds, 4 small pills a day, about $15 a month total), that help me control my emotions.

Yep, control. Because even us medicated legion know that pills alone can only get you so far. But they can take you very far. They could be the reason you get off the couch and go to lunch with a friend. Or write for the first time in months. Or finally go on a hike.

Meds can help you take the steps -maybe even the first step - you need to get your life back. 

It may take a while to find the right med or combo of meds, and it might be mildly unpleasant while you and your care team figure it out, but in the end, you'll find something that works for you and all the unpleasantness will have been so worth it.

The side effects I have from my meds are mild - I sweat a bit more (common side effect) and I have mild tremors in my hands at times (SUPER rare, yay me ;) - but the benefits make the side effects nearly invisible to me.

And just as importantly, create a healthy network of support. I'm grateful my life is filled with caring people. My family and friends totally understand, support, and help me when I need it. I mean, it helps that they're all just as crazy as I am, but still. 

Lean on them when you need to; buoy them when they do. Cut the assholes out of your life. You don't need them.

And remember, if someone in your life asks you if anything is wrong, yes it is annoying, but they're just trying to help. Don't get angry. Maybe even listen to them? An insane idea, I know.

This has been long and rambling and disjointed - I'm bipolar, what did you expect? - but I hope it...I dunno, helps? Informs? Destigmatizes?

Anyway, if anyone - ANYONE - needs to talk about any of this shit, feel free to send me a message.

AND GET THE HELP YOU NEED.

DON'T BE EMBARRASSED. There is nothing to be embarrassed about.

You don't have to ""just deal.""

54,"I just need help because I’ve cut off everyone I used to know, including my mother because I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone about it. I can’t bare the sympathy from people I didn’t speak to for years before this happened. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar recently, after their passings however I now think I was suffering for years beforehand. 

I feel like my family are fucking cursed to be miserable forever. My grandfather threw himself in front of a train, this was my mother’s father. And now with this with my father, I feel I have no hope and feel even worse about bringing my daughter into the world.

I don’t even know what I’m asking for, just anything.",30Mar2018,8,

57,"My therapist says it’s depression and thought ocd. But I don’t know anymore. My head goes in circles all the time and it drives me INSANE.

For example. I’d get this stupid, random fear that I “don’t see the world as other people do”. Or that I’m “too apathetic to the world” (its hard to explain but it’s somehing like that). Then it would bother me to no end. I’d talk to someone, it would pop up. I’d breath, it pops up. It’s like when I tell you that you blink automatically, and you know, it bothers you for a few seconds (it stops being automatic) but once you forget about it, it’s gone. Well I can’t just forget it, and I feel my head exploding with thoughts all day and questions like “maybe I have schizophrenia” “maybe I’ve went crazy” “I’m crazy” “I’m not normal” everyday. And by the end of the day I feel like shit. I am literally afraid of my own mind. I hate it. I don’t know how to deal with it and all I can do is distract myself from the world by watching tv shows (which thoughts also bother me here but less).

60,"So, I don’t know how to control my anger. 
My parents are good people, but my father has PTSD and is a functional(ish) alcoholic and my mom has some odd avoidance and dependency behavior. The combination makes their relationship rather dysfunctional. 
I have always really played peacekeeper... just to get them to talk to each other. I understand the unfairness of the situation, but I can’t fault them, they have heir own issues, and I do truly think they tried their best with me and my little sister.
My dad and I had a difficult time with each other when I was a teenager; when I got my first serious boyfriend at 17 and he found out I was having sex with him, he essentially stopped talking to me for a month or shouted that the house wasn’t a hotel. 
My mom was very open with me about safety and was easy to talk to about for adolescent things, but in this case, she essentially wedged me into her overall outrage at him about his sexism towards her and his deficiencies in their relationship.
When those conversations too heated, I left the house and then got berated that I was a bad example for my sister. So I’d come back, feeling like I was still incapable of expressing my outrage and trapped because I was causing people pain. I didn’t believe I did anything wrong—my partner was a good person and we were safe. I would have been open about anything they asked about. My dad was never going to take responsibility for calling me a slut, and I didn’t want to make my mom feel bad for defending me however poorly. 
I needed to keep the peace just to live my own life. But I’ve sacrificed a fair bit just to keep people I care about happy, even if it makes me feel horrible.
So in the meantime, as an adult, I’ve realized that getting angry is really difficult for me. 
On rare occasions if I’m angry, I feel like I’ll tear apart a room or assault someone. That scares the hell out of me, and I know it’s not something I want. 
Every time I get angry, I get worked up, cry, then feel exhausted. I then try and work on the problem carefully if I can. I don’t really shout when I’m angry, I get despondent and disappear. I can’t use anger to help me solve something—which is part of what it’s there for. 

TL;DR
Does anyone have recommendations about a safe environment to practice being angry so I can learn to control it and express it in a healthier way?",30Mar2018,3,
61,"Tonight my boyfriend had quite a lot to drink. He got home and said he needed to talk to me. He said that he can't do 'this' any more. When speaking further he mentioned that he can't do life any more. He said he feels as if this life is not the life he wishes to live in. 

He is reluctant to getting professional help. And I have no personal experience with mental health within my circles. 

I've told him that I obviously love and care for him and that his friends dearly love him (which they undoubtedly do) and we all would be extremely sad if something had to happen.

He mentioned waking up each day that he wishes he just doesn't wake up. 

He works in the service industry and works many hours.

I feel too, that I (our relationship) might be a causal factor. I said to him that more important than our relationship, is our health. I want him to be happy and find meaning in each day. He did mention that he wants to end the relationship because he wakes up each day and just doesn't 'feel' anything. He said daily he just feels emotionless in general. 

If he doesn't want to see a professional. I'll be meeting with one next week to least get some advise. 

I'm a bit lost for words. But I know it's not okay for him to be feeling like he doesn't to live in this world.

He did acknowledge that it would be selfish to go the route of suicide. So I don't have immediate concerns.

Just for context. We've been in a gay relationship for almost 5 years. This is also not the first time I have heard him say things like this before. It does take him a copious amount of drinks for him to say this.

And advise/support/thoughts would be great.
Thanks in advanced",30Mar2018,3,
62,"Hi I’ve been struggling with this for a lot of my life and I just don’t know where to turn to so if anyone has any suggestions or advice for me that would be great. I’m 18 now, but ever since I was little I’ve always created people in my head and then imagined that person living my life for me. They live in my house with my family, they have my friends, they have my boyfriend. I’ve imagined hundreds of people but to some degree they’re all the same, they’re all young beautiful girls, sometimes it varies what color their hair or their eyes are but it’s pretty much all the same. They all have different names. I constantly imagine these girls dating my boyfriend and I’m happy about it. I imagine them interacting with my friends and my family and they’re so perfect. I don’t try to be like these girls that I dream up or try and act like I imagine they act because it’s unattainable to me. I have so many nice clothes but I never wear them because I can just imagine the girls that I made up in my head wearing them. I don’t ever verbalized it because I don’t want to be seen as bitchy but, I am also EXTREMELY jealous. My boyfriend constantly talks about his exes and about other girls that he finds attractive and I just smile and nod and agree. It bothers me because I know that he would be better off with these other women. And he would probably be happier with the girls that I have made up in my head too. I guess I’m just asking, is it normal to create other people in your head and then constantly fantasize about them living your life better than you live it? ",30Mar2018,2,
63,"For better or for worse, I’ve been diagnosed with manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder. I began feeling symptoms of mania last April and I crashed into depression around September. Depression broke in early March. I started going manic again shortly after that and was in the hospital again 2 weeks later. I’m okay now, and should be discharged in the next few days.

At first, mania felt amazing. I needed less sleep, had more energy, and became super-efficient with my time. I got in great shape. I could think more quickly. My confidence soared. Eventually I found myself in a state of constant, powerful, euphoria. As this progressed, I became mega irritable and restless to the point where I found it nearly impossible to sit still for more than a few minutes. I had zero patience. If I didn’t get my way with people immediately I’d freak out. I blew up on most of my close friends. I told my mom I had 1-3 years to live because I had brain cancer. I had hoped this would get her to agree with someone of my nonsense. Sadly, it worked. A little. I accused my dad of such awful things that I don’t feel comfortable elaborating on because I don’t want anyone thinking there’s even a grain of truth to them.

Things accelerated quickly. I began losing the concept of monetary value. I became much more interested in the “hidden meanings” behind numbers than their values. I blew over $60,000 over the course of 2 months and I didn’t have much to show for it. I quit my awesome job of 7 years on a whim (I figured I could retire off of 10 grand), started writing a how-to guide on every aspect of life (key word started – like 3 lines), attempted to start 3 businesses and I was planning around 8 huge charity events. I was working on acquiring a commercial property, two houses, a vacation property, and the entire building I was living in. I planned a trip around the world in a private jet (runs about a half mil in case you’re wondering), drew up plans for a solution to the high cost of space travel, (giant space teepee – fucking shoot me), and wanted to colonize Mars before Elon Musk. I was beyond certain I could pull all of the above off within a year, and I’d get downright angry when people disagreed with me.

I’d spend like 8 hours a day on my bicycle because I couldn’t stay still. One night I went to bed at 2am and woke two hours later at 4am. My energy level when I woke up was similar to what I felt when I went skydiving. I simply didn’t need sleep. As this was going on I increasingly lost touch with reality and began having some truly serious delusions that I’ll explain when I think you’re ready. Everyone always wants to hear about psychosis. You can’t handle psychosis – yet.

I finally agreed to get help and spent almost a month in a psych ward. You can’t handle the truth about the psych ward yet either, but don’t worry. We’ll get there. I tried to escape 5 times. I was successful on the 6th. More on that later.

Say what you want about big pharma, but my brain needed help slowing down. At the rate I was going, I wasn’t far from believing I could fly if I jumped from a high enough point. I was so fucking terrified, paranoid, and argumentative that I easily could have committed a serious crime under the wrong circumstances had I not gotten help.

When the mania finally broke I was released from the psych ward and depression quickly crept in. At first, it was mostly a physical depression due to the side effects of the 3 medications I was on coupled with that feeling everyone’s felt after a night of drinking too hard and making stupid decisions. Except in my case my stupid decisions were a result of my brain frying itself for 3 months. Regardless, I was $60,000 in debt, jobless, and couldn’t so much as make a meal for myself, never mind go and work. I think I only stayed at my place two nights or so and moved home to my parents within a week.

I’d wake up feeling hung over every single day. Puddle of drool, fog oozing out of my ears, and nausea the likes of which I can’t accurately explain. I wasn’t sick to my stomach – I was sick everywhere else. I moved like someone who’s just been through their second round of chemo. Driving was torture. I couldn’t handle music or TV – any stimulation was too much stimulation. I could eat and smoke easily. Everything else was a chore.

As fall turned to winter things got worse. Eventually I found myself sleeping over 12 hours a day. Some days that included hours of paralyzing anxiety while half-nightmaring. Other days those hours were extra. I’d go up to two weeks without showering. Same clothes. I was aware I was gross and stunk. I honestly didn’t care. I started researching ways to kill myself. It’s not as simple as you’d think. See, having bipolar disorder is a 1% chance. Celiac disease (guilty, almost died as a baby) is also a 1% chance. So a 99% chance of a successful suicide wasn’t even close to certain enough for me. I wish I could say it was my love for my family or my dog (I actually often wished death upon her – she was too much for me) that prevented me from making an attempt on my life. It wasn’t.  Only the fear of ALMOST succeeding and ending up with massive physical damage on top of depression stopped me from trying.

I did eventually find a method I could pull off that had a 100% chance of success. Around this time I started smoking weed more and more regularly. I purchased the components I needed one by one, days apart, and scouted the perfect spot. All I was waiting for was a good night to go and pull it off. Eventually I was smoking up first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and about 10 times in between. Every time I wanted to go kill myself I found myself too lazy and stoned to do so. I would just put it off. I can always do it tomorrow, right? I’m not advocating for or against marijuana here. All I’m saying is I was too stoned to go kill myself.

The depression broke this March...

65,"Today, I went though my Facebook posts from 8 years ago (to delete it all), and I thought it would be cringy. But it was kinda nice to see this other person I was before everything went bad. It looked like I had so much personality, I was inmature and naive, but I was also bold, clever, sassy, brave, joking all the time. And I am sitting now with the feeling that somewhere I lost myself. I feel like a tiny shadow of a person, I have no personality. My last relationship was an emotionally abusive one (just like my stepmother and stepsisters was when growing up...I finally broke the loop), and being an anxious person I put so much effort into avoiding conflict, he made me erase everything that was flavourful with me. All the good and bad. I feel empty. I don't know who I am. And I have no idea how to find myself. I dunno what I want with this, just to feel a bit less alone... Will I ever not be empty again?",30Mar2018,2,
66,"Is there anybody out there? I feel so very alone. Apologies as this will probably be a super long post. The gist of it, I'm seriously considering checking in to a psych ward/hospital. So a little about me and my situation. I'm a married 31/F with a three year old son, living in a rural area in the Midwest US. About a year ago I discovered my husband has been gaslighting me since the beginning of our relationship. Honestly I had no clue what was going on until I had told an old friend what was going on. They didn't try to convince me but instead told me to Google gaslighting and emotional abuse. After just a bit of reading, I felt somewhat relieved. Maybe I wasn't just too sensitive, as my husband says. As much as I hate to admit it what I'm experiencing is abuse. While I'd like to think it's mostly not physical, He has grabbed me too hard a few times leaving fingerprint bruises, he 'softly’ punches me in the upper arms and tells me to man up if I flinch, say ow or complain. He pretends like he is going to punch me in the face to see if I flinch. My husband constantly puts me down, nearly every moment we are together he has to make some sort of dig at me. He has a gun that he likes to take out at random. Everyday I hear how I don't do anything right (stupid stuff like putting a new bag in the garbage can wrong.. I didn't know this was possible). If it's not done the way he does it it's wrong. When I refuse to do it because I don't do it right, he says I don't do anything. He blames me for everything, stuff that shouldn't be an issue, or stuff I had absolutely nothing to do with. He literally says “everything is your fault, you should know this by now”. There is much more to this issue but the point is I'm not in a great situation here. He has worn me down to nearly zero self esteem. I feel so weighed down. Weak. I am usually up before my husband and go to bed after him. I get so few moments of peace.

Shortly after that discovery I had the horrible realization that I had been sexually abused as a child. My sister has confirmed she has some shared memories. Since then I've been randomly regaining pieces of memories that were previously just black spots. It's f***ing awful. Certain things set me off and I just… phase/space out, or have angry outbursts, or start crying for no apparent reason. My husband doesn't understand this at all. It's a hard thing to talk about anyway and his lack of care makes it worse. Sometimes sex can be difficult for me these days..some things set me off. He tells me that I don't love him and I don't care. If I am having a tough day and just cannot have sex he gets mad me. I guess he kinda throws a tantrum. Stomps around, slams objects, ignores me, looks at me with this look of utter contempt. I try to keep up. I've always been a very sexual person (which is starting to make more sense to me) and I still enjoy sex but some days I just cannot. A lot of times I just go along with it to avoid his angry mood. I haven't really talked to any professional about this abuse yet. I'm still having trouble accepting it, myself. Honestly I don't have a face or name that I can definitively put to my abuser. I remember events but my abuser is just a black shadow in my memory. I have a fairly good idea who it was but my mind just won't let me see them to confirm or deny it. (I can fill you in on my theory on who, if you want but for time sake I'll omit it here) This kinda makes things tougher, I am having trouble trusting male family members and close male family friends. I mean what if it's not my suspect but someone I'd never suspect? What if I'm still in contact with them? What if this person is around my son? I want to talk with my mom about it, I think she knows something, but how the hell do I bring that up? ( She once made a comment about maybe something happened to me that I didn't fully remember. At the time it made no sense now it's burned in my brain.)

Back to the point. I'm having all these issues.. I am so exhausted. I keep thinking if it wasn't for my son I would drive full speed into a tree. No joke. Whenever I say I'm tired of life people think I'm joking. I laugh it off with them and let it go, but I'm not kidding. I have a decent mask but it is full of cracks and about ready to shatter. I'm seriously debating on checking myself into a psych ward/hospital. I'm tired of pretending I'm okay. I'm not. I think I need to be properly evaluated and I think I need to be in a safe place for a little bit to try to begin healing.. accepting… regain some bit of self. I don't know. Maybe it's not a good idea. I'm at a loss. I'm worried if I admit myself, what might happen with my son. I mean I am his primary caretaker (stay at home mom, with him nearly 24/7, even when husband is home I do majority of the parenting) so an immediate issue is what happens with him when I'm in the hospital? Later on down the road would that affect custody?

I don't really have any friends or family to talk to about this stuff. My sister has her own issues and my one old friend who opened my eyes to the abuse has gone quiet with me. I don't blame him. (I am not a huge fan of myself these days either). So yeah I'm hoping someone here can give me a lil.. direction? Advice? Note if you just feel like dumping on me please don't comment. I get enough of that on a daily basis I don't need anymore. 
Also I'm sorry this post is kind of textual vomit. Just all over the place. I tried to hold back some stuff and make it neat but my mind is all over at the moment. Also I hope I didn't say anything to offend! Thanks

70,"Hey Reddit - not sure if I'm posting this in the right place or not but here goes:

I'm 24/f from the UK who has struggled for years with unexplained fatigue and lack of energy that stops me from doing things I want to do on the daily. I wake up feeling exhausted (and can't even function on less than seven hours sleep), have no energy to exercise, socialise, work, or concentrate on anything at all. My body is always aching like I've already done a workout. My brain is slow and I forget things and repeat myself often too. As a pretty ambitious person who is also interested in my health and self-development I can't explain how frustrating and upsetting this is for me. I feel so limited when there's so much I want to do, and at 24 I shouldn't be spending most of my time at home too exhausted to do anything. I failed my final year of music college because I was too exhausted to get to my lectures or get any work done, then failed/dropped out of a further two courses a couple of years later for the same reason. I try to talk to my S/O about this but he is a bit of a workaholic and has bundles of energy all the time, even if he's only had four hours of sleep and barely eaten all day. This not only makes me feel jealous, resentful and upset by emphasising the difference between us, but also like I'm a burden on him. I know he doesn't mind but I want to be out there doing things like he is.

I've lost count of how many doctors appointments and blood tests I've had about this, and never any answers. They eventually referred me to a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME clinic, and even the specialists there are not sure that CFS/ME is the case.

I'm sat here writing this in tears because it's been going on for so long now that it feels like it's sending me back into depression because I feel so limited and alone in this. I'm so overwhelmed all the time. I want to be able to work out and keep my body healthy. I want to cook for my boyfriend. I want to not have to struggle at work. I can't do any of these things without having to rest for ages afterwards. Sometimes it's too much to even shower. I only work a few days a week now as a freelancer and financially I am only scraping by because I can't handle something like a 9-5.

I suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time when I was younger and in recent years thought my mental health has been better than ever (have had CBT on and off over the past six years), but recently I've been feeling myself slipping into how I used to feel when my depression was really bad, years ago. I'm haven't self-harmed in years and my willpower to prevent myself from doing that is very strong now, but lately I just want to cry all the time, I hate myself and my body and how I feel like I've tried everything and I'm sick of feeling this way and scared I'm going to be this way forever. I don't enjoy my life when I can't give as much as I want to it. Every day just feels like a battle and like I'm dragging myself along at half-speed while everyone else my age seems to be able to fit a million things into their day and be fine (well, tired, but able to manage).

A bit of background about me and my habits:
- I eat super healthy and drink lots of water.
- I try and do yoga or light stretching on my good days.
- I take multivitamins and have no deficiencies.
- I have epilepsy, however I take Pregabalin for it and have on average only one seizure a year (usually stress/exhaustion related).
- I've seen cognitive behavioural therapists, acupuncturists, chiropractors, nutritionists, CFS/ME specialists, reflexologists.. the list goes on. I've also had my thyroid checked. No answers.

I don't know what else to do. It's all too much and I'm scared at how much it's started to affect my mental health. I'd really appreciate some help or even just kind words right now as I'm feeling so defeated and I really can't go on like this.

74,"One of the sad/funny things about intrusive thoughts, you know, those waves of psychic pain you get in a moment of self-hate, or something traumatic remembered out of the blue. Well, when i get them a yelp, grown, sometimes a howl, escapes me. It's like the thought of this shitty thing that, in that unguarded second, can’t be contained finds its way to escape through my mouth somehow.

Maybe, it’s for me too; my attempt at translating a moment’s pain into something less painful, less candid about the fact that for a moment there I failed to keep the lid on my pain. It’s pretty funny to me and sad in it’s own kind of way, a kind of autotuning the pain away, but it’s a nice bit of therapeutic alchemy in one way or another…

75,I had a nice vacation and it escalated to me and my screaming at each other. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel I ruined a perfectly good trip by ending it with yelling and screaming.,30Mar2018,3,
76,"I've been suffering with severe mood and personality shifts, to the point where I can't identify with or sometimes even remember my actions at other points in time. I go to a therapist but I haven't had a change to go in the last 2 months and am embarrassed that it will sound like I'm self diagnosing with something, so I haven't been able to tell him, or my friends. They've noticed but think it's just me being a psychopath and I've seriously damaged my reputation and friendships. Combine that with an edge to learn to sign and strong dysphoria about my voice (my shit body image and gender dysphoria along with my inability to tell people how I feel has delayed my progress in diagnosis severely) and I feel like becoming mute would be a valid option that I might choose. I'm not sure what I should do or if I should act but I feel locked in a spiral of hiding how I feel and this could break it. The only problem is I don't want to explain to my parents or the school, and don't want to have to go to special ed to be diagnosed with some stand of autism I don't have. What should I do?

77,"i'm guessing i can attribute the majority of the things im about to write to a few main issues lifestyle wise, such as:

1. leaving work to the last minute and getting ridiculously stressed
2. losing sleep due to having to work late at night 
3. borderline dependance on weed/alcohol to have a remotely good time (only used on weekends/holidays)

basically:
I feel like a complete burden to everyone around me. I would consider myself, and others would also as quite a popular person; I get along with people well. Only issue is I'm incrediby introverted (in comparison with others in my peer groups), and I feel like I just get drowned out and nobody really cares what I have to say. I've convinced myself that none of the people closest to me really want me there, and I have at times isolated myself entirely from everyone just to see if that's the case, but I have always ended up spending time with these people again. Despite this, the thought still remains in my head that either:
1. They're just putting up with me because I'm close friends with a few in the group
2. I'm just a clingy fuck they can't get rid of

Over time these thoughts just build and build up until the point where I'm in such a state that I just want it all to go away and have had suicidal thoughts, but I wouldn't dream of carrying these thoughts out.

I would talk to my closest friends about this, but I stop myself before I do as I convince myself that by doing so, I am just seeking attention and am being burdensome upon them.

I've always been a laidback person, but recently I've just felt emotionally numb apart from the thoughts which I have mentioned. People always mention how I look exhausted and ""out of it"", and have had people say that I never express any emotions and that I'm not the ""same"" person anymore. This stuff doesn't exactly affect me in any way, I've just got to the point where I don't really care at all anymore.

I've pretty much stopped eating, I feel completely unmotivated to do anything at all; simply getting up in the morning is a challenge. I've stopped pretty much all exercise; I'd rather just lie down and close my eyes and try to forget about everything and this is taking a serious toll on my physical health. I'm ghastly pale the majority of the time, and I have had a pretty much lifelong battle with accepting my own appearance; I shy away from photos as I don't want to see myself since it simply serves as a reminder of all my flaws which I have tried to embrace, and failed.

79,"I was on prozac for 4 years and didn't have any issues with anxiety or depression the entire time I was on prozac, my mental health felt great while I was on prozac. The reason I stopped prozac though is because even though I felt great mentally on it, it also caused me sexual side effects. I tried loads of other ssri's which did help my mental health issues, but they didn't help as much as prozac, and all ssri's gave me sexual side effects. I tried other medications that were not ssri's and even though they didn't cause sexual side effects, they also made my mental health worse rather than better. I then researched on the computer and you hear so much about how antidepressants are bad for you and how there is so much better natural treatments for anxiety and depression. I then try many natural things for years for anxiety and depression that are supposed to help, omega 3, 5htp, l theanine, green tea, maca, cbd oil, therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy. Nothing natural I have tried has worked for treating my anxiety and depression what so ever, and nothing has come close to treating my anxiety and depression like prozac did, like I say anxiety and depression basically didn't exist when I was on prozac and I was on it for 4 years. The problem is though I do not want sexual side effects and prozac like all the other ssri anti depressants more or less chemically castrated me. I have came across another natural thing online turmeric where there is studies that it works as good for depression as prozac? The problem is though I don't know how many times I have read stuff online for years where it says this treats depression as good as anti depressants, and for me this always turns out not to be true and the natural things I try always turn out to be completely useless. It's sad to say it but nothing has come close to treating my mental health the way prozac did, but yet so many experts, scientists, doctors say online that anti depressants aren't good for mental health and natural remedies are just as effective. Unfortunately this has not been the case for me. So does anyone know if Turmeric is a good thing for me to try? and does anyone have any advice and opinions for me on what I could take that improves my mental health that doesn't cause sexual side effects? I think it's obvious my brain likes serotonin considering ever ssri anti depressant I have tried has basically cured my mental health issues, and prozac was the best anti depressant that helped the most, but obviously I don't want the sexual side effects.",30Mar2018,1,
