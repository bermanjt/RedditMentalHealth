1,"My wife has been through a lot physically the past 3 months (C Diff, out of work, diverticulitis, malnutrition, GI issues) just many many things that built up. She's always had anxiety, especially about medical/illness, so when this all began it just ran her mind through a loop of things like pain but trying to figure out if it's anxiety or something serious or something minor but exacerbated by anxiety.  She hasn't been on anything for her anxiety and panic in a long time and even when she was taking something, it's such a small dose that it didn't do much.

Anyway, throughout the whole three months, she has been running to the ER at least 20 times for things that were very minor, or at least not something you go to the ER for, but rather her primary and GI for. But she didn't like that she would have to wait for them and would treat the ER like her same-day results laboratory (even though I know and have told her that there's urgent care for that too, but to her she felt she needed to be in a hospital being monitored.)

Thankfully, the physical has all wound down to where she isn't symptomatic, just trying to replenish her body since it's been through so much. However, when it comes to the psychological, she has been avoiding it at all costs. It has taken me calling for an evaluation team for her to go through seeing her psychologist ( and not really an established one at that).  There's more to the whole picture, like physically preventing me from going to work on certain days because she's begging me to take her to the ER, taking my keys and hiding them, turning off my morning alarms.  Just....things that a grown adult shouldn't do, no matter how serious they think what they feel is.  And it's not like I keep her there with me, I tell her she can go to the ER, even take an ambulance, we're already over a thousand in ER bills (god bless insurance).

Sorry, I'm rambling, but even before all this I felt she needed therapy and medication because she can never be alone at home or anywhere for too long without me because she feels that something is going to happen and that no one is there if she passes out.  She's never had any serious condition before this, so it was just irrational to think that way.  She's 31yo.

So, now to where things are calming, she's seen her GI, she's seen her primary, she's no longer symptomatic, but we all feel (me, her medical team, her family who has been in the loop with everything going on) we all feel that she needs help with the psychological side.  She has the opportunity to do a partial hospitalization program, but she says no PHP.  She saw the psychologist Tuesday who said she needs a PHP because it's been too much on her and she needs something to keep her occupied and onto the best medication to ease her back into going to work and dealing with life.

However, my wife is pushing back, says she doesn't want to do that and says she will think of something but hasn't come up with a plan.  She has been coming to work and sitting in my car while I'm at work because she can't be alone. She says she won't on Monday, but words/promises have been broken in the past and there hasn't been a day in 3 months where she didn't want to go to an ER or talk about seeing a new doctor or new GI to get things going faster.

I'm conflicted because no one is going to force her to do anything, but I feel she isn't doing enough to help the mental side. I think she needs the PHP, but I've exhausted encouraging her and I'm just at a loss.  Ideally, she wants to stay with a family member who is home 24/7 to be with them until she feels better to go back to work, but no one is willing because of the things she has pulled in the past to try to have them take her to the ER when I wouldn't. She blames me for that and says that I pitted everyone against her and made them all get on my side about the PHP.  I just....have no idea how to combat that except throw up my arms and have her figure things out on her own.

And I mean, that would be fine if she would do these things on her own, but she doesn't because she says she can't be alone.  She doesn't drive but I say for her to Uber, taxi, public transportation. But then it's a guilt trip on how she's going to be alone, and doing this or that because no one will help her.  It's just, if I do the things, I'm enabling, if I don't it's an entire night of hearing this sort of stuff that just messes with the mind and emotions so much.

It shouldn't have to be this hard.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",24Jun2018,2,
2,"Hi

We are a single income home, and as such, my wife is looking after the children. This is already tough on her, and she is taking Serdep to help her cope. 

Long winter holidays coming up. My kids (7 and 5,non verbal) are genuinely quite challenging to handle even on weekends, and it becomes more so when they can't spend time outside running around. I am working overtime a lot this holiday, which will help with the financial pressures, but I am concerned that my wife will crack or have some breakdown / anxiety attack.

What can I do to help her? ",24Jun2018,3,
3,"Hey y'all.   I have dreams about being raped, and molested really frequently.   The past few years, they started out of the blue and just haven't gone away.   I sometimes will smoke a bunch of weed before bed which does help prevent me from dreaming, but I really don't like relying on it so heavily.    Does this happen to anyone else?   Does this even mean anything?

For some context, my biological father is a pedophile, but my mom tells me nothing ever happened with us.   We don't really talk about it.    My step father was emotionally and physically abusive, but I disassociated so much as a kid/teen that I don't remember a lot of daily life or specific events.    I don't know if thinking about those things stresses me out so much I have crazy dreams?   They are upsetting and I wake up sweaty and stressed out.

Can a generally unpleasant childhood cause stressful nightmares?    

Is there anything I can do to prevent them?   

Thanks!",24Jun2018,2,
4,"I'm unsure what to do with my brother who is a NEET, sleeps all day, plays video games, watches anime and generally exhibits no willingness to work or do anything. Although I have considered sending him to a councilor, he would definitely not agree to it. Furthermore he is becoming a major burden on the family, as my parents are fighting about either kicking him out, or just waiting until he ""matures"". 

He is still young at 21 but his personality and general attitude makes me think he will never get a job, or even try at all. What level of intervention or action should I take? Should we force him to see a professional, (even affording one is hard), do we kick him out of the house? I know there isn't a lot to go off of, but if anyone has ever seen a recovery from this I would appreciate your insights. 

Thank you",24Jun2018,1,
5,"When I was younger I was a loner, I had no friends, never knew how to talk to a girl. I used to make up complex stories to my mom that I had a gf. I found pics on the internet to show her.

6,"I tend to avoid things I like. For example, I really love this podcast, but after having listened to a few episodes, I can't bring myself to listen to any more. I also avoid reading or watching anything about it as well. The same goes for TV shows, video games, and basically any other hobby/interest I have. No matter how much I want to, I can't make myself partake in them. I was wondering if anyone else has this problem? ",24Jun2018,1,
7,"I saw an ad on Facebook today for a special media platform specifically geared toward people with depression (MDD). It's billed as a way to discuss your questions, receive support, and find common ground, while quite possibly networking with mental health professionals that can help to moderate and provide help and insight.

Is it just me or does this seem like a terrible idea? 

1) mental health issues are often exacerbated by use of social media (there are sources for this you can find in a basic Google search... I'm too tired to link them) and can trigger depressive episodes.

and 2) this gathers together lots of super vulnerable people into one place that can be very easily targeted/manipulated by advertising, unreliable sources of aid, and general trolls. Plus, without moderators,I can't imagine that a bunch of people talking about their depression together wouldn't just be a black hole that even people with their depression under control could get sucked into...

Thoughts? Has anyone used something like this? Am I off base in my reactions to this platform (that I admittedly haven't tried)?

Somehow I don't even count Reddit as social media because of the lovely subs like this one that we have that are designated safe places. I see the potential hypocrisy in complaining about the platform while doing it on another form of social media, but the one I'm discussing just seems like a bubble of depression that doesn't seem safe.",24Jun2018,1,

12,"Hello, I'm a 19 yo guy and I don't know what is happening with me. I'm going to resume this. I have been this bad since I left 9th grade (4/5 years ago) I started to feel lonely. I've never had a best friend, or a pal that almost every guy has, and I have never had someone that I could talk about everything. Everyone I met at school was just my school friends. Just for school. I have met some great people but I got the feeling that they weren't good listeners or didn't wanted to talk. I have never been on the popular side but every person I knew never introduced me to someone else. When anyone appeared, that person only talked to my friend, not to me. It was like I didn't existed. I think that my friends were just  ashamed of me or they didn't wanted to introduce me to their other friends. Plus I have had more girl friends than guy friends. I was more shy, I was more reserved so it was more easy to talk with girls because guys were all very socially. But girls are just about drama and stuff (pls don't kill me if you are a girl reading this). So yeah I suffered bullying for being shy and using the only shoes I had. Since the first day every guy on my classroom sayed that I was homosexual basing on my shoes (the only shoes that I got because I barely had money to eat) without even talking or even knowing me and yeah they weren't very receptive at all so I just gave up on talking to guys at high school. Obviously, I have found 3/4 guys that were nice but they felt the need to be """"""popular"""""" so I have lost contact with them. Forthermore, I got into college and I went to an IT course (that is full of guys) I have made some friends. I actually felt really happy when at the beggining, everything was new. I was in a new city, I was depending on myself, I wanted to participate on those college ritualls and stuff I REALLY WANTED but my social anxiety just stopped me from doing it and fucked me from doing those things. I litterally wanted to talk and have a good time with everybody at my classroom because they seemed nice but my shyness and previous experience came back again, I though I was getting less shy but yeah i wasn't. My old me came back to my ""new"" me. Then, I started to isolate myself at my home, I started to skip classes, my mum got unemployed and I was really worried because she is a single mom and she is taking care of my little brother and I just want that nothing bad happened to her because she already suffered a lot in her life. I stayed like 1 month without going to classes, I was being thoughfull all the time, I wanted to help my mum, finish asap my course so I could financially help her but I couldn't. I barely eated, I barely had energy to get out of my bed and go to classes. Once I sayed: enough is enough. I went to the classes for about one week. Everybody were talking to each other, I felt really appart and I lost the subjects so i was completly dumb staring at the board. And yeah I lost interest, I litterally had nobody to talk. It was all my fault. I know. My mum doesn't know I am about to fail this year, if she knows that, she might get in depression again and I really disapointed her. I feel really bad for failing this year and I am constantly crying, I feel lonely, I have never went to a party, never had a girlfriend, I am a virgin, I just feel useless and I can't even play videogames anymore (i used to play a lot). I already lost interest in almost everything. This is the second time I am opening to someone like this. The first one was a girl that was keen on me but she was a complete b**ch and talked to her friends about what I sayed to her and was making fun of my insecurities. My self esteem was always a problem to me, I have a really low self-esteem since I left 9th grade. I was the smallest in the class, my mum was always pushing me down and comparing me to other guys at my age, that I looked like a children (i think she didn't meant telling that intencionally but yeah I am still worried about my height because of that and i always compare myself to other guys and when I see a taller guy my self esteem and mood just drops. I started to slowly accept my height - even who everybody says i am average). I am just a wreck, I wish I could have the strenght to overcome this but I am really weak. I was never good at anything. I just feel useless and i want to just shut down myself. But i know I can't, and I really want to improve myself but I have no forces anymore. This was very summed up, I have had a bad childhood but i know that there are much worst cases than mine but everybody has problems, I don't know what to do I think I have too many mental problems, everybody can say: ""Its all in your head"" but I can't delete that ""monkeys in my head"" my mum was always supportive and she always wants to talk with me but i just can't (i always say that its all good) because I don't want her to get worried about me.. she already has her problems and they aren't little. I want to improve I already tryed but something STOPS me from trying idk what it is i am just tired of this. Of feeling like this. I am crying for about 3 days long, I am just hid a really low. I have gained 3kg in this last couple of days because i am eating really bad. I am just tired of my social anxiety, i want to be a normal person, i want to be confident, i want to look at every person's eyes, I am tired of looking at the ground, I'm tired of feeling shy and I'm not living my life. I already lost my teenhood, i am about to make 20 I'm becoming an adult and i don't want to miss my young adult life. I don't know if i need help or if i just need new friends. I just need motivation. Thanks for reading this and I hope I can help you if you need to talk about anything and hope you have a nice day.",24Jun2018,1,
13,"I'm a straight male, but I rarely find myself attracted to anyone, and once I actually find someone, I almost immediately become obsessive, with them being the only thing on my mind. Although this obsessive thinking rarely gets in the way of flirting or actually getting dates, it's caused a lot of problems for me on top of the anxiety that comes with the thought spirals, the biggest being that once I actually get reciprocation of some sort (in my case, a ""yes"" to a date, or if they come on to me, sexually or not) I quickly loose interest and can sometimes even develop a hostile attitude towards them. Does this make me a bad person? I really want to understand myself better and try to fix this so I can develop some meaningful relationships. Thank you in advance

16,"I'm a 20 year old male I grew up mostly happy and care free until some bad happened to me at about 12. It's hard and it hurts to say it even anonymously I was molested I've never told anyone not even my parents. I didnt understand at the time how bad it was and just continued with life. I was also bullied by some ""friends"" and my brother for a few years. Note that i dont like hurting people but im a larger strong guy. One day i had enoight and let all my anger out on my brother. We have been close ever since then... I guess fighting made us bond in someway. But I also realized I'm abnormally strong and since then ive been scared if hurting anyone else. My personality is really laid back and I've always just gone with the flow of things but ever since I turned 15 I've been getting more and more depressed and I think it's because I've bottled up so much and kept it to myself. Even normal emotions joy, anger and sadness i bottle up now. I am someone who cares about everyone else a lot more then myself. Last year I started thinking about suicide the only reason I haven't done it is because so don't want to put my family through that after they have given me so much. But that doesn't keep the thoughts away. I don't self harm but also don't take care of myself when I should. I'm always up or down with my mood. If I'm alone I'm depressed and if I'm with a friend or family I'm normal. I've recently started getting really scared right before I fall asleep and when I close my eyes I see disturbing faces pop up. I'm under a lot of stress all the time, and I always feel that way even when things are easy going. I didn't do well in school and I'm dealing with the heat for that now. I'm asamhed of almost every aspect of myself other then how I treat other people. Needless to say I'm not confident at all especially if it comes to girls. I can put on a act and act normal but usually will just avoid talking to them. My brother just got married and I can't even talk to his wife normaly yet I still consider her a close family member though. I've had 4 girlfriends but never made a real move on any of them. I'm also addicted to porn it's almost a daily thing for me to do. I'm also ashamed of that. My parents just got divorced and I'm worried what's going to happen to my younger sister as she isn't old enough to understand what's going on. I was raised in a Christian house hold my dad was a Preacher for years and I believe however I feel like everyday I get closer to hell then I get closer to God and I'm scared. I pray every night asking for forgiveness for what I am. Please don't contact anybody about this. I don't think I'm ready to face any of it. I'm just seeking advice tight now.

17,"Sorry for the paragraphs, I'm trying to be as thorough as I can here. 

An old friend of mine that I haven't seen in months (but have still kept in touch with through social media) seemed to be having a tough time in life lately. Her grandpa was diagnosed with a tumor, her father recently put her into a psych ward after she'd opened up to him about how she felt about the way he treated her. (He seems like the manipulative type from what I've heard, has never held a relationship down for more than a few months, which she said effected her ability to get into romantic relationships out of fear of inevitably losing somebody close to her over small arguments, among other things she's said that I can't recall atm) I asked her what was going on and said that she could vent to me if she wanted, not expecting what she'd said next at all. I'm lost for words right now and want to help but don't know how. 

After I'd asked what was wrong, she sent me a photo of her thigh with cuts all along it. I knew she'd self harmed before and that she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, (the depression diagnosis was about a month prior, I'm not sure about her anxiety, though) and I'd assumed if she was in a bad place she would talk to me or one of her friends about it. I'm not an expert on these types of things though, I've never been one to self harm although I've obviously been depressed like any other teenager out there, so helping with this isn't my strong suit to begin with. 

She followed the photo up with telling me that she ""just can't think sometimes and I lose time and then I'm back"" in her own words. I replied asking for clarification to make sure I understood what she meant, wondering if she meant that she blacks out and comes to with cuts on her leg. She said ""pretty much, but other stuff too. like I don't know what I did in the last 3 days""

Right after I asked about what else happened to her in the past couple days, she said she had to go and messaged me again saying that she can't let her dad see her with her phone and that if she doesn't reply by 11 (it's 10:47 right now) that she would talk to me tomorrow. 

To put it bluntly, I'm terrified. I looked up memory loss and self harm and all I could find were drug and alcohol-induced blackouts. She doesn't drink or do any drugs, the most she does is smoke cigarettes. She lives a city away and I don't have a car. I can't check in on her and have no idea what the hell just happened. Please help me.

(I posted this in a different sub a while ago but wanted to see if any of you had any different advice)

So here's the deal, I'm a full-time college student really struggling with depression, and I really think getting long-term therapy could really help me out. I've been to my university's counseling services, and while helpful, they operate on a short-term basis and you are technically only allowed to get six free sessions (which I have used up already) before you're booted out.

I'm also under my parents' health insurance, which probably covers at least some cost of therapy, but my parents also have ass-backwards views on mental health stemming from the culture they come from, to the point that they threatened to disown my sister when she asked if she could see a therapist for her depression.

Do any of you have any advice on what my potential options are? Unfortunately I'm fully financially dependent on my parents and have not a cent to my name, and don't have a job to be able to pay for anything.

Please help, I'm really desperate and starting to lose hope. Thanks.

24,"I recently reconnected with high school friends that I havent seen in about 7 years (I'll be 22 in a few days.) I just started smoking weed about 2 years ago and was smoking daily for about 2 months before I moved away and only acquired weed periodically. I would always make comments about how I seemed to be the highest one in every situation no matter how much weed I'd smoked. My father has Schizophrenia along with other mental illnesses, pretty much everyone on my moms side has something going on as well (OCD, Depression, Anxiety, Paranoia, etc.) and I myself am officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Social/Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

I smoked some weed at a party with my friends I was reconnecting with and ended up freaking out after only 2 hits. I couldn't function at all I felt just like a baby. No one could talk to me for more than 30 seconds without me forgetting what was going on. I didn't know what I'd said, I'd lost all comprehension ability, and could do nothing on my own. I kept apologizing and crying and confessing my insecurities about reconnecting with them. I thought the weed had been laced with cocaine or something harder than weed because I was utterly out of control of my body and mind (and have never done any other drugs.) 

Fast forward to 2 nights ago, I was at another party with the same people, determined to redeem myself from the last time. I initially decided I wouldn't smoke weed, but when presented with the opportunity I rationalized it by ""well the last one was laced, this is from a person I can trust."" I took one hit and minutes later I dwindled down into the same feeling as last time, only much much worse. I only realized what was happening to me when all of a sudden I recognized that people were talking to me like a baby. One of the girls was showing me her birth control implant cause I was super intrigued by it for some reason. I realized the issue and immediately felt shame. I told everyone I was going to my car to sleep and they followed me out there. I don't remember most of the night, just bits and pieces that stuck with me because they made me feel so upset. I was crying uncontrollably and apologizing, asking if people were mad at me, obsessing over my parents finding out, obsessing over the idea that I might reveal something secret and continually asking them ""what have I told you?"" ""have I said anything bad?"" etc., asking if anyone was going to call the police on me or call my parents. I actually had an auditory hallucination that my grandpa showing up with my dog and calling everyone ""Assholes."" Then I saw my mom, step dad, and my young siblings come up to my car in my peripheral vision. I wouldn't look at them directly and started freaking out harder, crying and refusing to open my car door. A few minutes later a different person comes out to check on me and I opened the door, talking about how my mom and my family came up to my car and she tells me ""Your mom was never here that was x and x.""

When they finally got me to come inside I laid on someones bed to try and sleep it off, they were all talking shit about me outside of the room but I'm positive they were actually doing so cause they had been reprimanding me the whole night for smoking weed (when I  was sure that this would not happen again, obviously not sure enough.) I woke up hours later and drove myself home without much said to the people in the house and slept for about 16 hours when i got there. Of course I'll never smoke weed again, that much I'm sure of. I have a friend that's got psychosis and when I told him about this he mentioned to me that it seemed like more than a simple anxiety attack, and mirrored a lot of his psychotic episodes. I ended up doing a google search and there's apparently something called Cannabis-Induced Psychosis. Since that night even though I'm not high any longer, I've been paranoid that they're going to find my online accounts and make fun of me. I'll also have moments where I'll scroll youtube and happen upon a face and think ""they know what    happened to me"" or that they hate me because of what happened but they don't even know me? 

At this point I'm just embarrassed and am having irrational thoughts that my life is now over because this happened. I have friends outside of these people I was reconnecting with, it's not like losing them is consequential to my life, I just can't shake these thoughts. I guess, along with asking if this is CIP, how can I recover from thoughts that I /can'/ ever recover from this lasting feeling? I just feel like garbage.

25,"I have this terrible form of OCD, where I get intrusive thoughts all the time, and they're just me designing stuff to embarrass myself. I tried going to a psychiatrist and taking some meds she prescribed, but I've discovered that all they do is turn me into a dim-witted mannequin, I'm not able to think much at all when I take these.

But my biggest fear, and another obsession I guess, is that I speak these thoughts out loud around other people. This is pretty nonsensical, as I passed the psychological test to go into army training somehow, and I've had tons of friends, family, and my psychiatrist, tell me point blank that I am not 'mumbling anything', and my father's side of the family thinks I am making my mental illness up.

But as dumb as it is, the constant fear is still there. It takes one sideways look from a person in public to drive me scared shitless that oh no, I just said to their face that they look like a worthless abused piece of shit that crawled out from the homeless shelter.

I'm not considering any more medication, I'm not a hopeless case, despite it all, I'm a functioning person. I'd just like to know how to stop this.",24Jun2018,5,
26,"So for the past few years (I'm 17) I've found myself seemingly randomly have times where I feel great and times where I feel incredibly depressed, borderline suicidal, everything is worthless etc etc. I've had two counsellors through my school now and both were useless -- the most recent one was about 2 years ago and for the first two sessions she required my mum was with me. I don't talk about these things around my mum so I had to pretend I was mostly fine, so the counsellor determined I didn't need her help and didn't see me any more even though I desperately needed help.

A couple months ago me and my girlfriend broke up and the depression was worse than I ever felt it, so I finally got the courage to see my school nurse. She gave me a sheet for the week where I had to write down how I was feeling from 1-10 and what I was doing at the time or what was on my mind.

Strangely, the extreme mood swings which I thought were random actually seem to be caused by social withdrawal. Every time my mood was really high, it was because I was with people or texting someone (literally anyone -- doesn't matter who). Every time my mood was really low it was because I wasn't with anyone in person or everyone was offline, etc.

My nurse said it's normal to feel like this as a teenager but I really don't think so. My mood gets so incredibly low that it makes me fear for my future and sometimes it's a bit scary when I feel really high from it, too.

I can link this back to when I was around 12, and moved to a new school. I had no friends moving to the school with me and I had quite bad social anxiety so it was tough for me. However, I made a nice group of friends, and they all lived  together in a village \~30 minutes' drive away from me. As a result I couldn't see them very often outside of school, which upset me quite a bit. One of these 'friends' started texting me every time they hung out together or did anything fun together (without me, due to the distance). This often made me cry, hurt myself, etc. but I would always \*ask\* if they had done stuff together without me because all I would think about is how I bet they're having loads of fun without me. This went on for around a year I think, then I finally accepted it. In the past couple of years the same depression has come back but it's completely on myself -- whenever someone doesn't reply to a message or says they're busy so can't hang out I start overthinking the absolute shit out of it, thinking they're probably with other people having loads of fun without me. And it's like consciously I don't care but it makes me incredibly upset.

This feels really childish to write out but I hope it makes enough sense.

Anyone help with this would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you.",24Jun2018,12,

30,"I’m almost at the end of my first semester of university. I also have general anxiety and occasional bouts of depression (for which I see a psychologist every month). After 13 weeks I haven’t made any new friends and am becoming slowly dissatisfied with my old friends from high school as I either don’t really talk to them or dislike the people they’re becoming. Being an only child I’m fairly comfortable being on my own and usually spend my days with headphones in listening or watching something. So I never really feel the lack of friendship until I talk with my friends or see their posts on social media and see the disparity. Another factor that has probably been the fact that I don’t drink alcohol (I’m predisposed to addiction and liver illness so I don’t want to risk it) so I don’t really feel comfortable at uni parties (this is only worse due to my anxiety and lack of people to go with).

34,"Hey,

So I am now 20 years old and I was very heavily bullied in school for 6 years and as a consequence completely isolated myself and distanced myself from family and friends. I went days without speaking a single word for years. I was clinically depressed and pretty much constantly dissociated. Developed a bit of a drinking problem but got over it for the most part.

But all of this is over now and I only rarely get bouts of mild depression luckily. I started studying and I’m in a course with absolutely gorgeous people. They’re super kind, endearing and just the kind of people I wish I had known as a child. They’re also around 23-30 so they’re quite mature (compared to people my age haha.) 

But here’s the problem: I feel so insecure. All I did when I was younger was staying at home and studying. I feel so inexperienced which bluntly I am. Honestly I don’t think others really notice it that much or necessarily see it as a bad thing but I feel as if I’m not good enough, they’re secretly judging me for not knowing the type of things when you like umm.. leave the house? I get super nervous in bars, I want to run away from dance floors (nice fight or flight). The people I’m with love these things and it makes me just feel as if something‘s wrong with me. I have to learn so much when it comes to social skills. As I said I don’t think others find me awkward but I sure do. I can conceal it well but all I do is try to be prepared and act normal in situations I should’ve first witnessed when I was about 14. This also makes me feel really boring, which honestly I was. Others have so much to say about them, they lived and all I ever did was sit in my room and sleep. The funny thing is on the surface it looks as if I can blend in just fine but I feel so unprepared, behind and inadequate.

39,"i’m a 16 year old girl in high school. abt half a year ago, i had gotten into a massive fight w two of my friends, one I was extremely close to and the other, not so much. i had done some things that they considered selfish, and it caused a rip in my entire friend group. i took the blame for everything and apologized, but the two had cut me off and made my friends stop talking to me too. In the same day I got into an awful fight w my boyfriend after I told him what had happened with my friends and he also accused me of being selfish and guilted me. I had also taken the blame for that too.

from that day forward i have grown some type of resentment towards myself. i have questioned the definition of what it means to be selfish and constantly analyze what i do at all times to make sure i don’t hurt anyone. but at the same time i do this, it always feels selfish. am i doing this because i genuinely care about not hurting anyone, or am i doing it because i can’t stand to put myself in this situation again? these are the kind of questions i ask myself every time i do something that is considered selfless. sometimes i can’t look at myself in the mirror and i think about all the mistakes i have made in my life and how i can’t fix them. talking to people that don’t know what happened, i get so scared of saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong thing. if i do something that seems selfish i start to go into a panic. i am so scared to hurt other ppl like i had hurt my friends and boyfriend. over time, i have felt more comfortable when i’m around ppl, but whenever i’m alone to myself now i feel like my mind thinks away and eats my brain up alive. there’s this pressure on my head when im alone constantly and it never seems to go unless i’m around other ppl. if i know i dont have anything to do for a day or anything involved with school to occupy my time, i get so frightened because i know i’m abt to have such an awful fking time to myself.

over time, the situation with my friends and bf got better. my friends ended up talking to me again and thought the situation was dramatic, the friend i fought w and was closest to forgave me. the one im not close to hasnt but she threatened me w another chance. my boyfriend has told me that i had only really done two things that were bad and everything else was dramatized. he has said that his fight w me was derived from his insecurities and he doesn’t think im a bad person at all. everyone that has heard the story has told me that it wasn’t a big deal to fight about and pull all this “cutting off” bs.

but i feel so much worse. the problem has been resolved but i feel shittier, how does that even make fking sense. in the past month or two, i have started doing weed which momentarily gives me a sense of happiness, but i had this scary high once and now the feelings i get when im alone are even more magnified. sometimes it feels like life isn’t even real, like everything is just something through a screen. these feelings are so unreal. i fking hate being alone, i can’t stress it enough. it feels like my mind is my worse enemy. school is out now and i have so much time to myself, it seems like i have developed this dependency on others, knowing that company will give me a good time and i can make fond memories so i can stay distracted and not deal with myself. and how selfish does that seem!! it seems like i am using people.

i feel like i am going crazy. i have never felt this way before about anything. i have had a tendency to be emotional in the past but it never felt this uncontrollable. i have never thought of suicide as a getaway until all of this started happening. i feel like i cant tell anyone this because it makes no sense and it sounds so dramatic since i’m so young, like maybe i just have a hard time getting over the situation. but i still don’t understand what the fk is happening to me. if anyone has gone through something like this please offer advice.",24Jun2018,5,

I just vaguely held that belief until yesterday while I was staring at an empty chair I felt like God just showed up on it and I started speaking to it, asking it if things would be fine and if I'm doing the right things and it said yes and just generally comforted me. I had done drugs but they had worn off by the time this happened and they were just thc oil capsules. Besides that, I haven't ate at all in around 3 days as well but have been sleeping fine. I almost don't want it to go away at all because its comfort, but believe this might be something of concern. I believe that if I clear off an unoccupied chair thats in the same room as me, it'll sit there and be able to speak to me if I speak to it.

My sleeping habits are horrible. I think there are plenty of reasons because of this.

47,"Hey :) 

I’m a 23 year old man living in Romania. I have a job and am about to graduate from college. I am stressed, sad, and out of ideas, due to not being able to come up with a decent solution for a problem in my family. I’ll try to be as descriptive as possible. 

Difficulties:
1) My father has just been diagnosed with a mental disorder that is causing him to lose his train of thought, behave erratically, walk and drive by himself with no destination, lie to his family, and drink a lot. Two years ago he had been put in a neurologic treatment facility (for alcoholics), due to my mom thinking it’s just the drinking that makes him act like he does. Since then, he’s been in and out of that facility every two months or so. He’s being given medication that makes him mellow and sad, but before we can see any real progress with his condition, he starts drinking again and the loop continues- drinks-&gt;is not himself-&gt;hospital-&gt;medication-&gt;drinks-&gt;etc
My mom has most to suffer because of this, since she’s the one living with him. She heavily relies on me to keep her sane, and I think I’m not dealing well with it. About two years ago, when this all started, I too have thought it’s just a drinking problem, and I’ve made a conscious decision to not let myself and my life affected by it, therefore I’ve been passive towards the issue, only helping my mom and being there for her when she needed to vent. I am realising now that I should act on it somehow. Should I look for a different facility for more specific neurologic treatment? Should I also try getting my mom to a psychologist to help her out (she’s a religious person and always finds a way to keep it together via belief) 

What’s even more important than anyone giving solutions, is me actually describing my problem to someone. The fact that someone might read this and maybe partly understand what I’m going through is enough for me to feel a bit less stressed, because I don’t talk about this enough and it makes me sad. 

Thank you for your time!",24Jun2018,13,
48,"To note, this is kind of a rant and kind of an 'I don't know why this is happening' situation, this may or may not be the best place to post this. 

I feel extremely jumpy and tense around strangers/acquaintances, and by this, I mean freaking out if they look at me, get near me, or god-forbid talk to me, almost causing me to run out of shops and restaurants due to fear. 

I am also very uncomfortable with anyone touching me, anywhere, for any reason, leading to a few awkward situations where I nearly screamed when someone bumped into me since I was already on edge.

To further add fuel to the fire, I have major trust issues, not much more to add to that. I don't have a reason for any of these behaviors that I can find, I've never been betrayed by a friend, I've never been grabbed or assaulted... you get the point. It doesn't help that I trust family much more than a friend every time, leading me to sort of curl in on myself socially.

This might not be an issue at all, but I feel like it's hampering my ability to grow and live a normal(ish) life since I'm always terrified of something happening. That's all, thanks for reading.

I call him names, say really personal things etc etc. I deep down have a heart of gold but he’s starting to feel like I don’t love him and he threatens to leave all the time, the last argument leading to him packing his stuff. He came back in the end but it was a scare and now I’m worried that I can’t contain my issues and that he will leave. I need help with my anger I just don’t know what to do, along with the depression I’m so demotivated to do anything about it despite knowing I need to! ",24Jun2018,2,

Most of the time, im not sure what or why its happening so i cant respond accordingly. I dont know what to do about this situation. For some reason i have not developed the skills to counteract this. Can anyone give insight as to whats going on and offer tips.",24Jun2018,4,

57,"So basically I'll say this in terms of video games since that's where it best applies(kinda). So basically whenever I play a game I always feel it's pointless to play it if it doesn't have some online comparison system or something, I feel like I HAVE to be known in that game or get good at it to impress other people in the same server perhaps which is a little more realistic. Just to validate me playing the game. Sometimes I won't play a game that I'd otherwise like because of this and that's paired with lack of motivation so I can never achieve those things so it just hurts and wears on me, this extends to other things too, for example I do art, I have such a weak motivation for a lot of things to the point where I can do just 1 art piece a week or less, because the slightest amount of stress puts me off of it, I hate the feeling of failure when it comes to something I do put time and effort into, anyway that's tracking a bit off topic, basically I feel the absoloute need to be known in some way in a community I'm taking part in which is bad enough but along with that I have a lack of motivation to do so, so it just completely wears at me 24/7 and is making me feel worse and worse, nothing can usually help that motivation issue either, I try to find solace in personal activities, just stuff that keeps me entertained while telling myself it's okay not everyone gets to be like that but then I can't do that either cause I basically find no games or video content interesting whatsoever so I'm stuck just being worn down on 24/7 and I want to stop it, how do I fix this situation? 

(Extra note: So yeah when it comes to gaming specifically I find the need for something to have a comparitive or competitive system that I need to get good at for me to justify playing the game and I also take on so many of those at once I can't do any of those specific things, and I give up quickly cause of lack of motivation)

Also a second thing I want to solve is me finding nothing entertaining or interesting cause that is REALLY wearing down on me.

Btw if it helps I have autism.

58,"I'm totally broke and looking for some advice on how to move forward and be a better me.

Brief backstory, a long term relationship I had with a someone I was due to marry ended. I found out she was cheating on me with someone else. There were many signals, being secretive with phones, odd messages, being strangely absent at times and like a new appearance that was out of the ordinary. For quite awhile after finding out about the other person, we worked on the relationship and tried many new things. Part of that was some experimentation with substances, which led to me having complete psychological detachment. For about 6-8 months I suffered with severe depression and suicidal. Starting to get better I realised what effect my mental state was having on my other half, so decided to end what was thought to be a once again steady relationship. That was all in a effort to give myself a safe and clean space to end my life without guilt. Unfortunately it didn't take and I'm still here (obviously).

Moving forward I'm in a new relationship and I'm worried she's doing the same thing. I'm noticing several of the same details. I've tried to be open and discuss it, but I know it upset her comparing her to the old girl. We end up arguing and that causes issues. I think its mainly paranoia in my head. I trust her, but I just can't help but second guessing the things that I see. I think in part of my stupid youth I ended up messing around when I had a serious girlfriend. I know how it feels to be on both sides of things. Its difficult to trust myself knowing what I've done, so I can't help but think everyone else will do the same. I don't think the trust issue is with her per se, but myself. 

So... I get upset and don't know how to effectively cope with it. This in turn upset her because she doesn't know how to help me. We make up, but something else occurs and the cycle repeats. I'm really struggling to help myself get over myself and be a better person.

Anyone have any pearls of wisdom?",24Jun2018,3,
59,"I'm in an emotionally liable and volatile state at the mo. Have a tendency to fall hard and fast into a very black pit without much warning. 

I've passed the stage where I actually actively want to kms but I'm now deathly afraid (pun intended) that since I've got the plan and means including a dry run that when I fall and the balance of my mind is disturbed  (a thing that I now see is an actual thing not just a phrase coroners use) I'll be off to jump.

So my GP says if distressed seek help. I'm like ok will come to surgery and see you and you talk me down and if you not there will see another doc (reluctant) and sit in the garden to decompress. So he puts this in my notes. 

So I go this morning. Bitch of a nurse acting as receptionist is like no appointment no doctor. Am like ok make appointment. She like nope not an emergency surgery. Go away. 

We go back and forth. I stay calm, softly spoken  yet firm. She stays obstructive as all hell. Goes off on a polite rant about how people just can't come into the surgery whenever etc etc.

Am like I can. Would you just look at my notes and verify what am saying. 

So bitch face finally finally does. Looks taken aback. Looks at me again as if I was an alien. Says to her mate look at her notes, just look at her notes. They then have an argy bargy about who will get off their arse and get the doc. Finally doc is got and I get what I need. 

Point of this is that I had to be calm yet forceful. I really had to push. The woman was a bloody nurse - meant to be in a caring profession. Well care ffs. 

Many won't be able to be calm yet forceful. I haven't been able in the past. Then they don't get the help their bloody doc has told them to get.

Recently my therapist said she suspected I have OCD, but that didn’t last long as my dad said I no longer needed therapy and that I was fine. Fuck him. He also pulled me out of my first therapists office Bc she suggested that I needed to be on some form of medication. The thing is I’ve jus had to keep on, without my therapy. Which has been really hard, I attempted suicide once and almost died. Lately I haven’t been able to sleep at all, I’m usually up until 5 in the morning trying to fall asleep. Every time I fall asleep I’ve been having extremely disturbing dreams. I’ve also been growing increasingly paranoid of the government, my family, someone watching me, etc. which I know isn’t rational. I’ve also been experiencing some visual hallucinations and auditory hallucinations. I really don’t know how to tell my parents without getting yelled at or whatever.

Am I not correct in thinking that I paid for counselling? And to refer me to a ""liscenced councellor"" means that I paid to speak to someone who wasn't actually qualified?

Basically unless you're dealing with day to day shit and just need someone to talk to, dont bother wasting your money.
It's not ""real"" counselling and they're not able to help with actual mental health problems.",24Jun2018,1,

66,"I’ve had Major Depression, anxiety and tentative PTSD diagnosis for multiple years now, and have barely seen any relief. Any relief I do see is only because a certain drug decides to work that week. Therapy has not helped but I continue nonetheless. I’ve been on three SSRIs, bupropion, Adderall, Ativan and Trintillix with no avail. I get in spells where I just sit and worry and get scared. That’s when I’m supposed to take the Ativan, but then I google stuff and get worried because I find the odd article that says it causes cancer or damages your brain. I have one friend who I’ve known for 8 years and I always call her and feel better but I want to be able to feel better on my own. I’ve been reading up on ketamine and am going to ask my doctor tomorrow. To add to all this I suffer from a crippling fear of revolution, communism, and extremism, despite living in the US. It’s something I worry about every single day. It’s so stupid. I know. I went to a very liberal school and I live in a liberal major city. I’m moderate myself but I get the irrational fear that people are gonna put me under the Soviet Union. I can’t stop though and I don’t know what to do.  To add to this I’m also struggling with identity issues at the moment, but I feel like a freak. I’m sick of hiding and laying in my closet or bedroom alone, wasting my life over delusions.

68,"I’m a 24 year old female. I’ve been working a new job the past few months basically as a children’s case manager. I’m going to grad school in the fall to study clinical mental health counseling. The same time I started my job, I moved back home to my moms to save some money. I lived on my own for 5 years prior.

I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling so down right now. I started seeing this guy I use to casually date last year. Things have been a lot better this time. I’m starting to feel like we’re actually having feelings for each other. I feel really happy when I’m with him.

Just in general I feel really alone. Im already stressed from this job. I don’t have many friends, and it feels like my best friend is drifting out of my life due to her own struggles.

I’m having a hard time doing what I used to love. Yoga, hiking, writing, reading, painting. I don’t feel interested in most tv shows anymore. I’ve just been busy, and trying to get out of my moms most days. However, I have been going to gym classes. I’m feeling more fit than I ever have before. I lost 30 lbs last year, and I kinda got stuck with losing more weight. It feels good to have those classes, and to feel stronger.

I just feel like I shouldn’t be having feelings like this. I’m lucky in many ways. I feel embarrassed for going to school to be a counselor when I’m already struggling myself.

Just any general thoughts or support would be appreciated&lt;3

I don't know if I should call this anxiety or whatever it is. I feel very tired of it. I want everything to just be alright, so I can continue with my life normally and fix the other million problems that I have.

I feel like it was the worst I've ever had it so far. That might be due to me being partially alone at home. The only person with me currently is my drunk father that's most likely very deep in his sleep right now.

It started with me feeling a thump in my chest. This has happened many times before and I'm not sure if it's something I should be concerned about. The first time it happened, I went to a doctor, they checked my heart and told me that nothing was wrong. I feel like it has gotten worse since and it has happened multiple times. Either way, after that, I start feeling very anxious. I feel like I was going to die of a heart attack or something. I have one person that I care about the most and I'm afraid that I will die and leave them in a bad time. I don't want them feeling like they lost someone.
