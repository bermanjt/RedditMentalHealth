7,"I posted this in one other sub but I'm loosing hope. My citalopram isn't working, I have to ignore my delusions and it's making me sad because he keeps communicating with me through  my lightbulb but I don't respond, my walls keep moving and breathing, I keep having peripheral and corner of my eye visions of light or shadows. My memory is getting really bad, and I'm scared to go outside because they could be watching me. My psychiatrist appointment isn't for another few weeks, I'm just loosing hope. I'm not going to kill myself, that's out of the option but I just don't care if I relapse anymore. Nothing is getting better. ",01Jan2018,2
8,"Okay, I've fully concluded that suicide hotline/crisis centers are not gonna help me. 

I have been fluctuating between full on suicidality and ""just"" ideation, which they've had trouble with, and I'm fully terrified of what in-patient care looks like. (This is from personal perspectives - I'm on neuro meds where if I don't get them correctly can fuck with my head as well as my body [psych ER today delayed them by 2 hrs which... isn't a welcoming sign], I'm trans and gay without gender marker changes - and practicalities - they said they don't know where I'd be or how long I'd be locked up, which is a problem as a working adult who just lost my entire support system when my husband died. (The caseworker ""kindly"" told me the hospital would send a letter to my landlord if I was kept long enough to get evicted.) None of this warms the cockles of my heart nor does it make me feel like anyone has my best interests at heart.

I'm a recent widow (less than two weeks) and they made me hand over my husband's items that I've been carrying with me, including his wedding ring, and I couldn't do any of the activities I do to manage my anxiety/flashbacks (a great new addition to the PTSD are flashbacks to my husband's death so managing this is REALLY important). I couldn't have music or books or writing materials. I knew I couldn't bring my knitting (pointy sticks + string) but it was shockingly upsetting to hand over EVERYTHING including his wedding ring and religious items. They made it clear, too, that if I went in-patient I wouldn't get them back until I got out. (Given, too, that I've been performing religious rites and that's helped me manage, not having access long term to ritual items would be a bit of an issue.)

(I am also very open to the idea that they may well have my best interests at heart and that I am a very anxious person with a history full of a lot of trauma, including medical trauma, and I am very very shy after being burned. I don't enter into much without full disclosure and without my husband, I am... hyperaware that I don't have an advocate who has the legal right to step in for me.)

I have been... severely ill before and was sent to a psych ER by my then-therapist. I was allowed to talk to a mental health professional, assess what I needed to do to stay safe, and connected to a psychiatrist/out patient treatment I could access within the week. (My safety plan went to shit when I was summarily kicked out of the house by my parents, but I liked that.) Today when I went to a psych ER, I was told that either I could tell them I was safe or I could go in-patient without any information about what that looked like. I told them I was safe because... well, I don't particularly want to be on a locked ward. But I do want to get help?

Are there resources to get fairly-quick-help - like I mentioned about the previous psych ER I went to, where I got a pretty solid PTSD diagnosis, psych meds to carry me until I saw the psychiatrist, and was mostly treated well - and not just ""Are you safe or in patient material?"" 

tl;dr? 
My local psych resources are either months from availability OR only oriented to checking if I need to be in-patient in a locked ward. I would like to figure out a disability-oriented plan centered around keeping me in my community and safe. Does such a thing exist?

(I am in Philadelphia PA USA but am willing/happy to use online resources etc)",01Jan2018,2
9,"I just saw this subbreddit and maybe you guys can help. Please excuse my bad wording. I have a friend which is going through some hard time since 2 years i would say. Let me start by giving you some insight on him; he is 21, a good person, he is bipolar in my opinion, and has some really bad attitudes towards everything. He has some problems in his house but nothing hars like abuse or something like that. His girlfriend left him which made him kinda hate women, and over the last months we all noticed his agressive comments over women and how he just tries to fuck them. I cant hear him tall like that anymore, but he isnt ok. He started cutting himself a little  a couple of  months ago. He cant keep a job, he feels overwhelmed and doesnt really like being in an office. He is impulsive, and doesnt listen to anyone, he believes he is alone and wont really tell no one about what he thinks. This year he had 3 episodes, one in which he cut himself ln the leg, he says he wasnt aware until he called his father for help. On another one, he cut his arms, sideways, and last month he had a very agressive discusion with his mother, saying he would ""kill her if you call the doctor o the police"". Her mother asked for our help, his friends, but we dont know what to do. To make things worst, he smoke weed every day, i do to but im ok with it, but i dont smoke him out anymore. He started doing harder drugs while in medication. I hope i was clear enough. Today, he left his house with his car, which he shouldnt drive as his license was suspended over drunk driving. He blocked everyone in his phone and told her sister that he was ok in another province. Some hours ago his mother and sister notified the police. Im really scare of what he might do today in night years eve. And thats it, let me know any question or any piece of advice. Talking with him isnt very possible as he believes he is ok and everyone is exagerating.",01Jan2018,2

12,"I never got to live with my mother until June,2017. 
Before moving in with her I used to be sad all of the time. All of the stress of a tough upbringing, narcissists father and bully step-mom left me destroyed. I was unable to smile, socialize and even get a date.  I am 25 years old.

 After I started living with my mom my life started to stabilize. My stress levels plummeted. I starting smiling at people at work, gym, and on the streets. I forgot about all of the times my father hit my stepmom and me.  Everything was ""alright"" but then my sister got pregnant by some illegal deadbeat. My mom's best idea was to let my sister's boyfriend move in with us. Long story short, I got home from the library and saw two patrols. Two police officers were standing at the front door. My mom had to call the cops because my sister and her boyfriend got into an argument. 

After that day I started to feel just like I used to feel before I started living with my mother. I am feeling anxious, depress, and very angry.  All of those memories of childhood abuse came back. I threatened my mom with killing myself. She is trying to kick the couple out now. My new year resolution is to crawl back to ""normal.""

14,"Hello,

I'm looking for an answer to a problem that has troubled me most in my 20 years: my life. I don't know exactly what my problem is, but I know something is wrong. My entire life I have felt a combination of fear, extreme confusion and hyperactivity. I come from a very loving family. My parents are kind and support me unconditionally. I've never been abused. I've been to multiple professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists) who have been unable to diagnose anything or give me any insight into my problem. I have never experienced depression in my life (at the worst it's a kind of melancholy) which, according to the last psychologist I spoke to, is extremely unusual if a person has been anxious for such a length of time, he says almost always a severely anxious person become depressed. I did well enough in school, though I definitely believe I have some kind of minor cognitive problems relating to memory and processing information. (Thankfully) I've never self-harmed, or become addicted to substances. Up until my nineteenth birthday I was a very active person who socialised and as a kid was very physically active. But I know something is wrong. Despite my consistent socialising, I know the way I feel around people is not normal. I do not know if it would be sufficient to describe it as anxiety, there is definitely some aspects of anxiety, but I feel it is more like a sense of extreme discomfort and confusion that I am very good at masking. Despite my parents being very loving I feel awful around them and have done since I was a kid, even though I love them too. Sometimes when my parents enter a room I'll feel a jolt of discomfort. However this feeling is prevalent around all people I interact with, I'm only describing it with my parents because I think it is highly unusual.

I never gave any signs of a troubled person. I'm going for an MRI scan to see if I have any undetected brain damage (possibly from birth).

If anyone has any ideas, I would be happy to hear from you. Please, try not to throw any random, unhelpful diagnoses, only what you think may be relevant to my situation.

I wish you all a Happy New Year, and all the best for whatever struggles you may be going through.

Love,

H",01Jan2018,2
15,"When I try to do something new with my body, like an exercise or dance move I've never tried before, I get so freaked out that I'm doing it wrong that I'll start to feel extreme dread and panic and just need to stop. I usually will become very depressed immediately after and start to cry and just want to curl up into a ball. 

I almost never do new things around other people for that reason. I've never broken down and cried in front of someone over it, but I've wanted to. I have to excuse myself, or tell them I'm tired or make up some reason for why I don't want to do the thing, *without* saying that I feel awkward or I feel like I'm doing it wrong. The feeling is so strong that if I articulated it I *would* cry, so I just need to act like it's no big deal.

But it seems like it is. Even by myself I can't even work out or do stretches without bringing on a break down. Which of course means, I just sit in a ball on the couch all day.

17,"I was diagnosed with ptsd and drug induced psychosis about three months ago.

I caught pneumonia two weeks ago and for some reason it triggered an episode of the same feeling I had when I was high. First episode too. I was sitting down and I saw a chair shake. This freaked me out and I immediately didn't have any control of my body.
My head was throbbing and I felt a shooting pain and thought I was witnessing my own death. 

While I had pneumonia I had dizzy spells and just yesterday it got really bad. 

When I'm walking it feels like I'm on a boat and I see things move. 

Today it's even worse and I'm bed ridden because of how much everything is spinning. Sadly I still feel the spinning while I'm laying down. 

What could this be? 
Regardless this is overwhelming me

23,"Since I was a child, I remember having moments where I suddenly and randomly start having this horrible very odd feeling inside, it's gonna be so difficult to try to explain, no one has recognized themselves in it when I try to describe how it feels before. I could never pinpoint why this feeling only happened to me, but recently I got the feeling that perhaps it's a sexual trauma from a past life?

I'm gonna try to describe it, out of nowhere I start feeling some type of disgust, a very different and deep sort of disgust.  In this moment I don't want any human contact, I feel disgusted with them in relation to me somehow, like I don't want anybody to look at me, i just feel so extremely disgusted in the most unique and uncomfortable way. All I do is stay quiet and wait till it goes away, which usually last maybe 15 to 60 seconds. When I was a child this feeling washed over me very often, like maybe 3 times week, can't remember, and the ""episodes"" lasted longer, maybe more on the 60 second mark, and I dealt with it same back then, I just knew all I had to do was stay quiet and suffer it out until it goes away on its own. I don't want any type of contact in this moment. Now I get it perhaps about once a month. I think it is related to something sexual, before I could kind of create this feeling by pinching my nipple, and this huge wash of disgust and uncomfortableness came over me, when I got a boyfriend that stopped happening pretty quickly somehow.

So long story short, my mum is an alcoholic and it has caused me a lot of trauma in the past. I’ve had my own issues with alcohol, not abuse but it’s taken me a long time to be able to enjoy it in a healthy way without the negative connotations. 
I want to have a small get together for my birthday this year (which would actually be joined with my grandpas birthday as well) and invite some friends and have a few drinks. The problem is, it would be at my parents home, and all of my family would be there.

I have experienced over the years many episodes of what I'm gonna call ""castration anxiety"" by lack of better words. These usually happen whenever I hear anything about male genital pain or mutilation, wether it is fictionnal or real. 

As an example, during new years eve, I heard a girl talking about how her dad who's a doctor once had to deal with a guy who got his testicle seriously damaged by misusing a firecracker. This instantly  got me shivers, my limbs got tense, and my tongue felt heavy to me in my mouth.

What I highly despise even more is how some people (especially my gf) can laugh about these sort of things. And I hate to have sometimes this irrationnal fear of something of this genre happening to me or someone else, and having people around casually laughing about it.

Speaking about my gf, she studies medicine, so penises are something she'll most likely encounter many times in her carreer. I accept that (for myself, I know I have absolutely nothing to decide for her, no word to say about it), but I also have that fear to have my penis being somewhat compared to a stranger or whatnot.

39,"Hi guys. I write as I feel like I’ve exhausted all other options and I don’t know what to do to make this situation any better.

My father broke his calneus (heel bone) over two years ago and was misdiagnosed by our local hospital for almost two weeks, to the point that the bone had worn through the tissue and skin and infection set in to the bone. This is further complicated by my father being a long term type one diabetic which has caused vascular problems and neuropathy in his legs which has severely hindered his recovery. It has been a long recovery process and doctors cannot give any guarantee as to how long it will take the leg to heal and to what degree This will heal. This has left him with debilitating pain to the point that he is now no longer able to walk, and due to ongoing kidney issues he is extremely limited to the use of painkilling medications. The wound is still healing, 2.5 years down the line, and he is having weekly wound clinic, physiotherapist and podiatry appointments to try and yet we are still no closer to coming to an end of what is becoming a living nightmare.

My father was forced in to early retirement at the age of 55 due to ill health caused by what has happened, and my mother has been forced to cut her hours by half to care for him. My mother is at breaking point emotionally, and financially this whole experience has placed a great strain on my family. I work full time as a nurse for our local ambulance service, and have chosen to move in with my family in order to support when I’m not working and to support financially.

In my opinion my fathers depression has been spiralling recently and having spoken to our family doctor is concerned about offering antidepressants due to risks of further damage to his kidneys, and although he has been offered and has attended counselling sessions he has found this useless as talking about his issues does not solve any of them, regardless of what ever he talks about, his pain is still constant, his mobility is restricted to a wheelchair, his life has been greatly impacted and he cannot mentally cope.

Last night (New Years eve), I was working the night shift, however the rest of my family had a party. My father was having a particularly bad night pain wise and was very snappy due to this. He was apparently unable to eat because the pain was making him so nauseous and he had a diabetic hypo, this caused him to become weak while manoeuvring from his wheelchair and he ended up collapsed in an armchair that was pushed under him as he was collapsing to break his fall. He ended up staying at our relatives over night due to being in so much pain that he could not be elevated out of the chair, and so at the end of my 12 hour shift on the worst night of the year for the ambulance service, I was called to drive down to my relatives house at 6:30am, with the support of my older brother who came from his house, to lift my father out of the chair and get him safely in to the car to get him home.

My father broke down today, horrified that he had ruined everyones Christmas and New Year... that he was destroying the life he and my mother had worked so hard together to build, and that he was destroying my life in the process. Today my father declared in front of everyone that he has been suicidal for months, and that he has on several occasions thought of overdosing on his insulin as well has overdosing on his other medications around the house. Unfortunately only my father knows his doses that he needs with regards to his insulin so I am unable to take over his insulin care, however I have taken care of his other medications along side my mother, in an attempt to make it more difficult for him to access the medications to take an overdose.

I feel like my family is coming to breaking point, my father has specifically said he’d rather die than live another day, and although my mother is a strong woman, she is now at breaking point. I am having to hold down a tough full time mentally draining job to supplement the family income while paying off my own debts, as well as come home and help care for my father, and all while trying to hold everything together.

I feel like I need help but I also need to get my father help. I just don’t know where else to turn and I feel like I am starting to mentally suffocate

I'm going to go from hating myself to becoming the greatest freind to myself that has ever been. ,01Jan2018,1
45,"I've been in a long distance relationship with this girl for a lil while now. It's been amazing so far, she's always been very supportive and loving. We talk all day most days and have similar interests and get along really well.

5 days ago everything changed... We were watching series together while on voicechat and the mood was kinda off for both of us all of a sudden (lately she's lost interest in some things we used to do). She decided to go to bed early, and i felt something was incredibly off and asked her ""Is everything ok?"" she said ""Yes"" and that hurt me a bit, cause i knew it wasn't.

The next 2 days she was clearly avoiding me, and it hurt so much cause i thought i was losing her. When i finally got to talk to her again, i explained how she made me feel and asked what the issue was. She said she was abit mentally drained and thought we had spent abit too much time together, so we decided to still talk and spend a little less time together so she gets her alone time.

Over the next few days things got worse, she admits that she is going through a weird phase she has sometimes where she shuts everyone out. She confirms that she still loves me, but she's not able to talk to me. She went from being the warmest most loving person i ever met to being ice cold and distant.

Right now we agreed that she'd come talk to me when she's able to.. This was one of the messages she sent during that convo:

""I dont know how to fix that, how to make you understand that im here, (Name) I wouldnt abandon you even if im like this right now. But it feels like you are being suffocated by it... I dont know what to do, what I can say so that you know that I will be back. I know im cold as fuck right now and I cant really switch over to how i normally am even though i really wish to. I dont want you to be in pain or miserable, yet im causing you that. I am honestly so sorry, so sorry that you're feeling so horrible right now, so sorry that im like this when im normally completely different. Please, I beg you. Try to do anything you can that you think will help a little. I love you so much and its the worst feeling not being able to convey it properly to you.""

I might be completely off on this, but we talked about it and both me and her thinks she might be bipolar (She has it in her close family). Anyone have any experience with someone that is bipolar etc.? I just wanna do everything i can to help her and support her through this. ",01Jan2018,1
46,"This will probably be a long post, I apologize. 
Since mid summer 2017, I've felt in a way I can only describe as less than alive. My feelings are taking a toll on my mind, since I've started breaking down, throwing fits like a child, and having no recollection or memory of almost anything (though I blame this on substance abuse). 
Feeling this way isn't new; I've been sad for as long as I can remember. I have a memory of being in the 4th or 5th grade, talking to myself about how I'm feeling and knowing that I probably wouldn't die from natural causes or old age, but because I wanted to kill myselg.
Growing up wasn't hard, it just wasn't fun. I have an awesome mom who taught me to be myself no matter what, and always accepted me. My dad was a hardcore, workaholic muslim, enough said.
I was sexually abused as a kid, and I hold no grudge against anyone in my family for the way they dealt with it (or didnt), but I'm upset I was never allowed to find answers and now that I can, I'm just too sad to care.
In school, I was mad fun of a lot for anything you can think of. Whatever, kids are mean. Eventually I hit puberty and mean jokes just became manipulation from boys I was naive enough to fall for. In college, I never met anyone good and my only friend slept with my boyfriend for some drugs. I also had a respected professor offer me some coke to sleep witb him in his office. Sounds like college, right?
Since I was in the 8th grade, I've been self harming. As I grew and began to socialize, it became self harm+ drugs+ sex. All of this  messes with a developing girl's mind.
I'm 21 now, moved out, highly depressed, and living with my boyfriend. Things should be fine but I can find no motivation for anything but laying in bed. He doesn't seem to understand how I feel at all, but I know our life experiences are very different. I can't expect him to understand my reality if even I dont.
I know the answer waiting to be fired is ""go get some help"". I don't believe there is help for me. In the 8th grade, I tried. I wrote a note to a teacher about what I was dealing with and the school called my parents and I had to talk to all these counselors, etc. Long story short, the doctor at the facility told me I was lying about how I was feeling and told me to take a sick day. Late in college, I went to see the counselors who told me I was at a severe turning point, it's now or never, but they simply didn't have the means to help me. Me being poor, all I had was the money I was giving them anyways to go to school there and use their facilities.
I can't write about all my experiences here obviously, but where do i begin to cope? How do i start getting better with what seems like no hope? I don't feel like myself or I would even recognize myself if she came out. How do i get to that point?",01Jan2018,1
47,"Okay, i am a 15-year-old girl from the US, but this happened over 2 years ago. One night, my parents thought i was asleep but they were very much mistaken. I naturally woke up to go the bathroom, when i heard muffling and rustling in the room next door. I didnt want it to be what i thought it was, but me being utterly dumb, i walked out into the hallway, and their door wasnt shut so i could clearly make out soft moaning and talking. I immediately ran back in my room and turned on the tv and kind of laughed, but then i started hearing it through the tv volume. It was so disturbing to even think of the thought. I waited about 2 weeks to tell my mom and she completely understood, after I was crying on her lap telling her what I heard. I felt like she thought I was dumb. She said she would make sure I was asleep and always shut her door, most importantly be quiet. Every night since then, I feel like they are doing it when I know for a hundred percent they arent, especially because I peek outside my room and on the wall i see the reflection of their tv, meaning their door wasn't shut. That was one sign, then if I kept having thoughts, I would go in there to ""get some water""really I would be checking to see if they were asleep or not. I know this sounds really ridiculous, but I think they might have given me PTSD? At night I turn on my tv and I wear noise canceling ear muffs to ensure I don't hear anything. I even purposely breathe heavily or grind my teeth to drown out any imagined sounds. It hurts so bad that it had to happen to me, I hate going to bed every night. I've begged my mom for sleeping pills, I even said she could lock them up and give them to me so she doesn't think I'm popping them. She said no. Inside, I do want to talk to a therapist, ive only had this thought one time and it lasted for about a minute, but I thought about cutting my wrists with the sharp edge of a tape dispenser. I've never had that thought since. But if I did see a therapist, my mom would have to quit her job and id have to quit cheerleading which I love more than anything. Ugh, it is so hard to think about. And the thing is, I don't even have a problem with anybody else doing it, just my parents. I'm not scared of it, I am ready to lose it but my parents doing it is so ew. Please please please if anybody has any solutions or advice can you tell me. I need help.",01Jan2018,0
48,"If one uses beta blockers for agression. Will this recondition his brain to cure his aggresion or will he just treating the symptons? I can't find any researches on that.  So I don't know. 

And if it cures. How long will it need to be taken? ",01Jan2018,3
49,"I've been getting so easily enraged lately.

(I suffer from untreated ptsd, (SEVERE-like worst case)anxiety, depression and agoraphobia as well as medical conditions causing me pain. Rely on marijuana for a LOT of relief regardless of if doctors think it helps or not, it does).

I've been catching myself in these fits of rage over the smallest things. While driving, talking to my boyfriend, playing video games, talking on reddit even... The smallest things are just absolutely setting me off. I know I have a lot I'm dealing with but I feel like I've been pretty decent in life lately. I don't understand why I'm so easily agitated and why it's getting worse.

I spend a lot of my time online and at one point I was literally holding a fight on like 7 different websites in messages with people while playing online competitive games and tearing people apart on mic. 

Reason would have me think something is wrong that I'm not understanding is upsetting me? I have a lot of small things I'm working through but for this anger to just have festered up... It's like I've never been heard my whole life and I almost see red and want to **make** people hear me.

Idk. Just thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has any clues.

Seeking a new therapist, insurance changes are fun. About to turn 26 and lose me great insurance as well so swap again in a few months...

50,So I came here for awnsers not to be judged. So everybody who knows me thinks I’m a normal person that nothings wrong with me but I think something happened. So about last year I took a bunch of antidepressants cause I was bored and had nothing else to do and had to go to the hospital because of an overdose. Then later next month I took 3 tabs of lsd and I think it did something to my brain like my brain had enough. I feel like I’m still not the same for that trip also from when I od on antidepressants I didn’t feel the same either. My impulsive side is more powerful now like it is hard for me to hold them back like when I used to life with my family we had a dog and i would abuse it and do it just cause and feel nothing when I would do it. I have feelings but I can dull them when I do bad things. I used to go to a private school in my childhood but I had to leave when I threw a rock at a kid. My friends see me as normal but I’m acting when I’m around them normally my friends think I have a lazy attitude and that everything is boring for me. Does anyone know what this is I’m intrigued to know?,01Jan2018,1
