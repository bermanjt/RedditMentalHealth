0,"I've read a little about possible causes and the most likely one seem to be that me as a kid hated being a kid and felt useless (still do) and that I didn't get along much with other kids, mostly adults and basically that other kids treated like shit (I was fat, 100% socially and ugly).

I truly truly hate them. If I someone says the word hate I think of children. I find them disgusting and repulsive, I can't even touch or be near a kid without feeling extremely uncomfortable. Pregnant women's bellies are disgusting to me. I despise children with all my heart.
My gf gets pissed off whenever we talk about kids bc I hate them so much and she loves them, even though I try not to say the horrible things I think about children in front of her.

Anyway, I know this isn't normal and that there's something definitely wrong with me. Any help?

1,I’m not mentally stable and I recently got a job. I thought it would be good for mental health by having a healthy routine and getting out the house but I don’t feel well and I think my colleagues notice it. They can sense my mental health. Like I’m awkward and weird. Quiet and a bit withdrawn. Don’t talk to them much or laugh and joke with them. I’m 27 and I look immature and act immature cause I don’t have much social skills or experience. Not sure what to do to fake it. It’s like talking doesn’t come naturally. ,17Jan2018,11
2,"I don't know if there are any feminist psychologists on here...but I have been doing some really deep soul searching and I think I suffer from ""entitled love""...I know rationally that for someone to love you that it is a privilege. They don't have to love you or even like you but for some reason when I have this realization I have an irrational emotional response.  It's like rage or anger or something...like just because that individual has autonomy and doesn't owe me anything, that somehow they're wrong and that I deserve that love.  I don't know where that attitude came from.  Perhaps I had this idea that everyone should have an Agape love style and we all owe each other love, which wouldn't really be agape at all.  I want to figure this out, I really do because it's important.  I want to also add, that when I do realize the love is conditional, that there might be something about me or something I did that makes this person love me, that somehow the love is tainted and wrong and not genuine. I don't know why I feel this way.",17Jan2018,1

6,"I just wanna be done. 

I can barely get myself to take care of myself now days. 

I don't change my clothes, I stay in my pajamas all day. 

It's hard to get myself to shower, or even brush my teeth. 

I drink a lot just to kind of check out for a bit. 

I dissociate all the time and I can't stand it. 

That might be one of the only things keeping me alive tbh. 

I don't notice because I'm always just out of it. 

I just wish things would just be done. 

I feel probably 90/10 when it comes to wanting to live. 

But drinking causes the inevitable to be delayed I guess. 

I'm probably not going to off myself any time soon, unless I get a certain object. Which is doubtful. 

I just always feel like this. Probably since I was 12. 

Nothing has helped and it feels like nothing ever will help. 


Edit: I just want to be done. 

I'm so tired of being tired. 

I'm tired of having this anxiety that causes me not to want to do anything. 

Even though that's there, I don't want to do anything.

Her situation is very unsettling for me and my other roommate since she's getting progressively worse about the stories she tells us about people messing with her and coming after her, and she's showing it by physically by screaming and crying.

13,"I used to be over emotional. But somewhere along the way that got switched off. I can't feel happiness, sadness, disgust, nothing. I just am... numb, monotone, dull. I used to have interests, but over the years, my routine has stabilized to basically eat, computer, and occasionally friends all day (as things I'm supposed to ""enjoy""). Everything that I do is my way of trying to get some excitement out of life, but I can't. 

I don't think I'm depressed, because I did have depression once - I was constantly sad and pessimistic. But right now I feel like I just don't care because nothing good could ever happen to me, and therefore I will stay in this state. I just need some excitement, but everything bores me. I have tried the classic ""try new hobbies!"" and ""hang out with friends!"" outlooks on life but they're not working (maybe I'm doing them wrong). 

I feel like I am living in sort of a ""dream state"" where stuff just happens and you don't feel anything. is this depersonalize or something? can I cure it?

16,"I'm 19 and I have serious problems focusing on one thing. I've dealt with this basically my whole life. A lot of things contribute to it, including my hypersensitivity to sound and constant overthinking. When I was in the third grade, my teachers had to put headphones on me while we took tests so I could stay focused. I've always had problems with school and only ended up coasting through all twelve years through memorizing, taking lots of extra time to complete homework assignments, and a lot of luck. 

Now, I know I'm not an idiot. I've gotten the job done so it certainly isn't laziness. I just have trouble meeting demands fast enough, and I fear that's certainly going to become a problem for me heading into college. Is there a way for me to train myself without having to take any drugs?

18,"  I am an 18 year old female from Canada that just needs a place to vent. I've had these feelings just slowly building over the past few months and it has gotten to the point that I am not eating much, not sleeping, and I feel physical pain due to all of this. I have not been to see a professional yet, but I know that I need to because it has gotten to such a bad point.

  I started to go through more difficult emotions dating back to October of 2016. My then boyfriend was always wanting me to perform sexual acts that I was not wanting to really do. I can remember a total of 3 times that I was in tears. He did not quite realize what was happening and I do not blame him for this. I do remember saying no but always being persuaded into doing it anyways. I finally decided to call it quits in January of 2017. We still spoke after but it got to the point that he would just want to talk to me so he could make me cry because it ""brought him joy to see me upset"". He then started rumours about me through school that were absolutely not true which just made me feel a lot worse. During this time, I just continued to hold my head high and try to focus on myself and my health. I really took to running because it relieved my stress immediately.

  Everything was going well up until a few weeks before grad. I got into a fairly large argument with my mom because she felt that I was doing nothing with my life. During this time I was finishing grade 12, just finished a half marathon, was playing guitar and dancing, working part time, and taking a dual-credit university course. I had a pretty big meltdown because I feel like I am always trying so hard but she did not see that. I ended up moving out for a week because I just needed my own space to process what had happened. I moved back, graduated, and my life was a lot better.

  Fast forward to around October and that is when things got worse. My biggest fear in life is disappointing the people I love. I ALWAYS put other's needs and feelings above my own. I've tried to focus and love myself first, but I always end up putting someone else's feelings in front of mine. Which is why I think I am felling the way I am right now. In October, I moved into my aunts house and started a relationship with someone that I have had feelings for, for a very long time. We had a previous ""relationship"" for a very short period of time, but timing just was not quite right. But I never stopped having feelings for him. I could not really even try to have feelings for someone else because I just had this gut feeling that I wanted to be with him. We were happily dating until last week when he decided that he needed a break because he is not is a good mental place at the moment which I completely understood. He said he does not want to try and make someone else happy if he can't be happy himself, which I totally get. But man did it ever hurt like a motherfucker. And it still does. I am going to come back to him in a moment, but I must explain another part of my story now.

  I have recently moved back home because, well to put it simply, my aunt was way too insane to live with. I am not going to go into full detail, but she falsely accused me of some things and told them to my parents. Thankfully they know that I would not do what she was accusing me of and they knew to take what she said with a grain of salt. She is also quite judgemental and I knew it was best for me to leave the situation to prevent further family damage. But I know I have disappointed my dad tremendously by doing so. He is the person I look up to the most and it absolutely crushed me to find out how disappointed he is. My family is also disappointed with my schooling. At this point in my life, I do not know what I want to be in school for. Originally, I wanted to take a year off, work, and maybe travel and then hopefully I would have a better mindset before heading to university. But I had such a big pressure to go to school right away that now I am just taking classes so everyone won't be so disappointed. I am for some unknown reason held to such a high standard in my family and it sucks.

  Back to the ""boyfriend"". I am at a complete loss right now. I have been eating 1 meal a day, I have no appetite, I've only been able to sleep for a few hours a time, and my chest feels painful because I feel so sad. I am mostly worried that he is going to do something hurtful to himself. I just want things to be better I want to be there supporting him. I truly love him with everything I have in me and it kills me inside to know he's in a bad place. I just want things to be better. 

  With all of this being said, (apologies on the long read) I do not know what to do. I feel so numb. There have been times where I have just wanted to drive my car off the road and I have had to physically stop myself. I just want to stop hurting. I want to feel like I am good enough for someone. I just want to be happy. ",17Jan2018,2

23,"I told her about some of the things I’ve written about here. She knew I didn’t eat a lot, but not that it was this bad. I told her how I haven’t had a day were I’ve eaten properly since sometime in 2016, how I eat one meal per day, and how I sometimes get so worried about my teeth and/or stressed out about brushing them that I will eat only one meal every other day. I, of course, also specifically told her about how I got so worried after my last visit to the dentist that I reduced the meal I ate once per day to only a few sandwiches, instead of one proper meal once per day. Oh, and that I had to back to eating once every other day; meaning that I only ate a few sandwiches every other day. I told her that it got so bad earlier this year that I attempted to start going two days without eating, but I gave up because I became dizzy and just felt bad. I informed her that I have gone back to one proper meal every day.

I think this was very unexpected to hear. I think she even told me that she never knew it was this bad. This is also the first time she has told me that she is worried about me. 

A few things also happened before I went. As I was about to open the door, I told her how I was bummed out for several days after the last session because of the whole group therapy thing. She then walked back to her chair and told me to sit down. We ended up talking for a few more minutes (I’m thankful she took the time to do this). She explained that when she said what she said during our last session, it wasn’t because she didn’t think I wanted help. She believes I am motivated and that I really want help, but that it’s difficult for me to trust other people. She told me that she’s worried that, if I go back to the OCD team, that I will meet up, feel uncomfortable, and then give up. She advised me instead to try and talk to them about what they say or do that makes me so uncomfortable.

Anyway, I told her how I badly want help, and that I felt so sad during those days because I realized that I will only get more and more depressed as time goes by, because: no matter how bad things gets, I won’t seek help because I cannot see myself participating in a group therapy. And I will not be able to work out things on my own. 
She told me that I looked really sad (I cried), and eventually went on to explain and tell me about group therapy. The way she put it... I am actually considering it. We also talked more about friends and how the idea of having a girlfriend only gets more and more frightening. Oh and I also told her (after she explained more about group therapy) that, even if I do end up making new friends there, I am moving away next year, and I’ll go back to being alone again regardless of what I do now.

Hm... maybe it was more than just a few minutes?

P.S.

Before I left (for real this time), I asked her if she thinks my teeth are yellow. She told me that I have very white teeth. I told her she only saw me from a distant and probably didn’t get a good look, but she said she didn’t need to get any closer. My teeth are white and, in her opinion, whiter than most people’s teeth - even hers! (I told her her teeth are a lot white than my teeth).

I’m sorry for just typing whatever came to my mind and not thinking about how well written the post is. I just felt like writing whatever came to my mind. 

P.S.S.

I am more worried about my teeth than what is normal. This is not the first time I have asked her what she thinks about my teeth. I’ve also asked my dentist a lot. ",17Jan2018,6
25,"Essentially I've always had issues with memory, attention, fatigue, insomnia and social interaction growing up. I've been told by teachers to see a doc for ADHD but my parents never bothered. I'm an adult now and done some psychoanalysis a couple months back and realized that some of the ways I think and behave might be as a consequence of childhood issues/trauma.

Anyway, my main concern is my education since I have screwed it up so many times and this is my last chance. I've been seeing several GP's and been referred to IAPT 3 times and discharged twice since they say they primarily work with depression and anxiety.

I've kinda been left in the wind, they just said talk to your school and call up mind.org.uk. I honestly think I would respond really well to CBT (which is what they offered me initially) for anxiety, but discharged me as I don't think I have depression and don't think all of my issues stem from anxiety (though it still seems to be present in all aspects of life)

I don't think I can refer myself to IAPT again and the last time I spoke to my GP he essentially dismissed me and said everyone has some issues.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I honestly think there is an issue here related to anxiety and/or ADHD, I just want to speak to a professional but its so hard and I'm quickly falling behind at school (even though I try so hard every day) which is making me progressively unhappy.

27,"Both of us have our share of experiences in life that not only made us dependent on substances but also verbally/physically abusive to each other and others. We have been off and on until september, when we moved in together. We decided rather than giving up to help each other get better.
Except no one supports this, saying that neither of us sh piiuld be happy and leave each other. But when we aren't together, that's when we become worse. We have a safe place between us that allows to communicate how we feel and the abuse ( both substance and other) has dropped immensely.
The only people who seen to support us are those who know nothing. Is this a stigma that we just have to learn to live with or is everyone else right?
Either way, we are staying together. We have both been doing much better since living together and have been much happier. I'd just like to see some support, not only for our love but also our recovery. How would anyone get better if you remind them how wrong and worthless they are?",17Jan2018,1

My doctor scares me, I had brought my issues to him earlier in 2017 and he told me to ""Get my shit together."" which really made me reluctant to seek further help. (I'm glad I eventually did)

I have no friends who i can properly talk to about this, nor do i have any family members who have experience dealing with mental illness (at least ones who wouldn't give me hell for it). 

My issues include:

* Depression (officially diagnosed)
* Severe inability to stay focused
* Inability to feel emotions except anger, anxiety, and sadness
* Social fatigue
* Constantly suicidal (never done anything, though i've been close before)
* No drive to do anything, to the point where it feels like i **CAN'T** do anything. Even making this post took a lot of mental effort.
* Inability to enjoy anything, even the things that used to relax me
* irritability
* Triggered (why do people think its funny to use this word as a joke) by the idea that i could be a disappointment, to the point where i have severe anxiety for the rest of the day and can't calm down.
* Brain fog

I've been seeing my doctor about this for a year, but nothing is getting done and he seems to not care.

*They say I act effeminate but nerdy

*I say weird things

*I seem stressed out

*I'm shy

*I'm socially awkward

*When people get to know me, they talk to me less, fake laugh at my jokes

*I genuinely enjoy spending time alone, and always have

*I only enjoy spending time with other people if they seem to be genuinely enjoying my company. BUT when they do seem genuinely happy with me, it's one of my favourite things to do

*I need to spend time alone doing nothing after a long night of socialising

*I either get really talkative or have nothing to say when I know someone well.


I could go on, but I'm going to stop there for now. Is this autism? Online autism tests seem to always diagnose me as not autistic. Am I socially anxious? These two mental health disorders have been my focus so far but I am just not sure.

both my parents are opiate addicts so i have gotten through severe neglect and doing everything for myself. both my brothers were emancipated youth when i was young so they were never around. i was always alone. my communication skills are terrible, i cant help but burst into tears if something is expected of me that i might not be able to fulfill, i cant hold friendships or relationships because i cannot do what they want of me (communicating, flirting, expressing feelings), if i cant find something i've misplaced i have to sit down and breathe so i dont cry...

ive been going to CBT for a year and i am starting personalized recovery oriented services classes in a few weeks because i am not able to hold a job how i am right now, and id like to of course.

we've discussed one of the bipolar disorders in the past but i put it on hold because i needed to find out if the ups and downs are linked to my menstrual cycle or not. i know now that they arent, i'm up for 5-7 days and i'm down for 10-14 days. they're very distinct in that when i'm up i take all my medications with timeliness, eat responsibly, make phone calls... when im down i dont do anything and eat everything in sight and spottily take my medication. even if something is expected of me immediately. i just dont do it.

we wanted to discuss ocd too, but i don't really understand ocd. i pick my skin whenever i'm stressed and doing things i don't want to do, so im covered in acne scarring and stuff, and i have like 30 raw spots open on my face right now lol. but i don't see the link between obsession --&gt; compulsion. so i don't really understand. there isn't anything else i do that would be a compulsion.

i am EXTREMELY forgetful. i have to write down Everything i have to do as soon as i hear it or i'll forget it within less than a minute. even right now as i write this, i have to go out in ten minutes, shit, but i haven't gotten ready yet. i take showers twice, i make food and then abandon it on the counter for a few hours, leave my laundry in the wash for a week before realizing..

other than that i really don't know what to say to her when i go on monday. i feel like this is too many things to bring up within an hour lol. what do you think? it would help me very much if i could hear from someone who currently has dual diagnosis. i'm thinking maybe some links to some websites with those online screening tests might help a lot but i don't even know what i would search. my current boyfriend has asperger's and he's also told me he feels like i should really look into autism's spectrum as well, because it seems like i have a significant bit of that too. i do do a lot of happy and unhappy stimming that isnt acceptable in public, but i know that's helpful for anxiety too hehe.

I know these things aren't meant to hurt me, but  I feel them deeply. While I don't fault other people, what actions should I be taking when I am feeling this way? ",17Jan2018,2
48,"I do believe I have anxiety, but I know for a fact that's not the only thing that's wrong with me. 

I always see things in a negative way. I see religion as some sort of system where it strips individuality from people and I also see that as a business to gain profit from mentally ill people. 

I see politicians as just a bunch of liars trying to gain votes from ignorant people, and how saying the pledge out loud was and still is brainwash throughout high school. 

How America's culture is wrong due to greed and how we waste so many resources on breeding and killing animals just to feed on them.

How war is just followers who volunteer or are forced to join are trained to kill other innocent people who are also blinded by propaganda.

How corrupted laws are, the war on drugs is ruining more lives rather than helping lives. 

How everyone, including me, are just followers of marketing, corporations, materialism, and so on. 

I'm not sure if I'm seeing the world in a realistic way, or what. I see some positive things but the negatives outweigh everything. I know there are positive sides to each of the things I've said, and may way of thinking seems to be irrational sometimes, but I'm not sure if something's wrong with me.

50,"I have never posted here, and just recently started reading this subreddit, so please let me know if this is not appropriate. I need help, though. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II in 2011. Over the years I have gotten to a point where I've felt like I had a handle on my mental illness. I wasn't constantly checking in on how I feel, having ups and downs, or even thinking much about it.  

However, in the past couple months, for seemingly no reason at all, it's as if I'm back to square one. Some days I spend my time alone crying, or more accurately, sobbing. Other days I am bouncing off the walls, talking much too quickly, to the point where my coworkers comment on it. Now, today, my husband had to unexpectedly go into work and the thought of being alone all day sent me into a tailspin. I was sobbing, thinking of how pathetic I am, how much I dislike myself for being so weak, just an overall mess. I took a xanax (prescribed) and it helped me calm down. This is not rare for me anymore, unfortunately. The smallest things are setting me off.  

I have been to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me a couple medications for worrying and for depression, but it has not been long enough to determine if they are effective. How do you deal with constantly cycling between moods? Most importantly, what do you do when you can tell you're having a meltdown but can't seem to do anything to stop it? I can't afford therapy right now, but I would appreciate if anyone had any tips.",17Jan2018,3
51,"Hi,

I have no idea if I should post this here or somewhere else, but I am too curious not to try.

I was hospitalized last month after a suicide attempt. For a few years, my GP has been prescribing me Effexor for depression. She recently started prescribing me Vyvanse for binge eating disorder.

After leaving the hospital, I went to see a therapist. I knew I would need to see a psychiatrist too, so I got a list from my insurance and started making calls.

At three different offices, I had the same conversation with the person on the phone: I say I’d like an appointment, they ask what medications I’m on, I tell them I’m on Vyvanse and Effexor, and they tell me the doctor won’t see me on those medications and hang up.

I’m so confused. Why won’t they see me because of the medications I’m on? I don’t even want to be on Effexor anymore, I want to taper off of it which is why I need a psychiatrist. Can anyone explain this to me?

Thanks!",17Jan2018,5
52,"I’ve been to a psychiatrist before but I don’t remember preparing for sessions or deciding what I should ask. What should my expectations be for the  initial appointment and any subsequent appointments? I think my expectations of what a psychiatrist does wasn’t the reality last time. 

How long should the initial consultation last? Do they have a set idea of time (NHS psychiatrist). 

I’m going to ask for more out of the ordinary therapies, proper diagnoses beyond what a GP can provide, any awareness of the different conditions and if they are different to what I have been initially diagnosed with and I’m asking for a medicine review as well as access to other types of medication (mood stabiliser &amp; long term sleeping tablets)

I’m in the UK if that helps. 

Thanks in advance!",17Jan2018,2
55,"I’ve always been a pretty nervous kid. Scared of talking to teachers, other kids, etc, but as I grew up the fear of socializing went away and now I have friends. The issue is that I’m always worried if they are actually my friends or not, I would have these thoughts and wonder why they liked me or considered me a friend. I’m not sure why I do this, and if I think too much, I think of evidence that proves my friends don’t actually like me.

Does this sound like a mental health issue?",17Jan2018,3
56,"So I've been doing some soul searching lately and I've realized that there are some very odd things about me. I'm not sure what they might mean though.
Since it may be important to know, I'm about 12.

* I tend to fixate on things. Only one thing at a time. If I like, say, photography? I won't have any other interests. This has happened for my entire life.

* Often times I'll flap my hands or put my hands into fists and apply pressure to my face, using every ounce of muscle I can.

* In some sort of relation to the last one, I usually have my hands raised up and my elbows bent in front of me as opposed to my hands being down by my side when I'm standing normally.

* I've always felt a need to fidget with things.

* I always like things to be very orderly. If something doesn't look quite right, maybe I'll move it a little. Sometimes I'll even just stack things without really realizing.

* Making eye contact has always been a difficulty for me. Ever since I was young, I'd get my fair share of ""look at me when I'm talking to you"".

* I tend to word things weirdly sometimes.

* In contrast to the last one, sometimes it'll be hard for me to understand a sentence if it's worded oddly to me.

* Sometimes small things will agitate me to the point of screaming and crying like a toddler. For example, one time I was playing Splatoon and my brother just kept staring at me. This normally wouldn't upset me, but that day it just felt off for one reason and I ended up lashing out at him when he wouldn't stop.

I'm not sure if these things are normal or not, but I'd love if I could hear someone's input on it. Thanks in advance.",17Jan2018,3
57,"Hello!

    I'm working with a group of people for an Ohio highschool campus to find new ways for them to utilize their resources to reach out to those students and youth in the area who are struggling with mental wellness. If we're able to offer innovative ideas it may have an influence on the region and hopefully spread to a wider audience.

    I'm here, of course, looking for suggestions. We're focusing currently on how we can educate students on identifying symptoms and how to provide care for their friends.

Thank you! Any input welcome.

60,"94% of my day I'm stuck in deep thought. It's torture, I am literally being tortured. One thought leading to another, Daydreaming, questioning my existence, thinking about the past and future. Yeah I know everybody does it, but it's much worse than it sounds. I'm stuck in such deep thought that I lose track of time. Sometimes I completely forget where I am. Even my memory has suffered because of it. I'm stuck in my head and can't see reality for what it is. Every once in a while I'll escape. The room will get dark and quiet and I'll realize I'm completely alone. I'll celebrate and walk around and it's like I'm seeing the world for the first time. If I'm really lucky I'll escape for half an hour at most ""omg I've woken up everything's going to be okay now"" then 🤔 I wonder if......agonizing cycle repeats",17Jan2018,12

I don't understand why I do it. A year ago if I watched one of these videos, I would have been horrified. It would have probably upset me so much I would think about it for a week. Now it doesn't bother me at all. I still can't watch an animal die though and rarely eat meat. But I'm worried my compassion for human beings is leaving me.

67,"I think that mainstream psychiatric approaches are more concerned with controlling  ""crazy"" and socially unacceptable people and making them non-issue for larger society of instead of their rehabilitation. This includes brain-damaged approaches like chronic drug usage, convincing people that their illness is chronic and will never remit, etc.

I've took over /r/criticalpsychiatry with help of reddit admins to provide a space to constructively discuss current problems with mainstream psychiatric treatment.

Full disclosure: while I feel that psychiatry has huge problems and I participated in antipsychiatry movement, I realized that antipsychiatry is not constructive, because they sometimes venture in denying not only diagnostic labels but also existence of very real mental health problems we all know too much about. So while I participate in r/antipsychiatry, I don't consider myself belonging to antipsychiatry movement. I'm not against drug treatment either, though I do think that it should be minimized. I agree with Thomas Szasz on this point: https://www.amazon.com/Antipsychiatry-Quackery-Squared-Thomas-Szasz/dp/0815609434

I want to create a space for constructive discussion which is critical of psychiatry, but which is not throwing out baby with bathwater. ",17Jan2018,2
68,"Idk if this goes here but fuck it I've got mental health issues anyway.

I just copy other people or keep some of their traits for a period of time

Also hi",17Jan2018,1
69,"I've always felt that there is something not quite right with me. Like most of the time my mind wanders and thinks back to something I did/said that I felt was really embarrassing or ashaming or just plain stupid or pointless. Then I can't stop thinking about that and I keep hitting myself in the face lightly or saying something under my breath inaudibly to others like ""f***"" or ""I'm stupid"" or something like that. When I'm alone I think about those thoughts and then I say those things more audibly enough for me to hear it louder but not for anyone else in the house to hear. And I always pull my head down or hit myself slightly harder or on a table at a moderate severity. Not too hard and not too soft. Also sometimes in class I think, ""What if I said something really stupid like someone's name in the class or a swear word or something related to the topic that's just stupid?"" and then I somewhat have to strain myself to prevent myself from saying said thought out loud. Then I hit myself lightly or swear under my breath like the other mentioned situation.

Another thing I want to talk about is my constant worrying. I am always worried about forgetting to do something or something I have to do that's coming up. Like I am always freaking out thinking about everything happening in the day and if I forgot to do homework the day before or if there is a test that day I forgot about even though my teachers never mentioned one before. At the same, recently I did everything that day that I had to remind myself to do. Yet at lunch after I completed everything I still felt worried that I needed to do something.

To keep going, I have this really bad habit going on that deals with me eating away the skin around my fingers and biting my nails. I have tried to stop myself but I always end up doing it when I am not paying attention to what I am doing. It's caused me to have my fingers looking pretty rough. They recover decently quick, which causes me to stop for a little bit. Then I do it again.

One more thing I want to talk about is me in social situations. I feel like I am extremely socially awkward. I have a decent amount of friends and people do find me pretty cool on the outside I'm pretty sure, but I personally feel really awkward. Like for example, if someone makes eye contact with me for more than a few seconds I always look away then look back at them. Also, I can not bring myself to try to approach people to talk to them because I'm constantly worried about how they'll judge me and if they'll find me stupid or a loser or something similar. It's weird for me. Like this year I'm trying to open up and approach people more often and try to talk to initiate conversation more often. But often times I try to start one and then feel like they don't find me interesting to talk to. Also I'm awful at keeping conversation going. Like others can talk for hours to other people. When I talk to people either they keep it going or I try to keep it going but make remarks that are not interesting, or there are decent moments of silence. When I'm with my friends I am more comfortable but a lot of times I'm not sure if I should talk to them because I'm like, ""do my friends actually want to talk to me right now/do they find me interesting enough to talk to me right now or only if they don't see anyone else to talk to?"" Also texting is a whole other issue. When I send a text I'm always looking to see if people respond. If they don't the whole day I think, ""shoot. Am I interrupting their alone time? Am I being annoying?"" Also I always put much thought into what I text even if it is my closest friend who is comfortable with me and who I'm comfortable with for the most part.

Sorry one more thing. I have a really weird memory. Some things I just forget extremely quickly, whether it's a random piece of trivia or something from class or something like that. Other times I can recall details of it really well. Details others would forget about. There doesn't seem to be much of an in between for me. I do remember situations of people I recognize really well. Like if it is a person I talked to only once or twice I can remember the conversations we had because there was not much. Those people are often like, ""how'd you remember that?"" or would forget those details or something along those lines. I can do the same most of the time for people I'm comfortable with but a few things I would forget.

Really I bring myself down too much. I am really pessimistic and really hate myself. And this is the first ever time I'm opening up about it. I just saw a couple of said symptoms above on askreddit and it made me realize that this may be my problem. Like others I know do not realize I have these problems. They just see me as quiet and gets good grades and is chill and someone who they can talk to if they recognize me somewhere or if there are not many people in the room. They don't know this very negative side of me.

Thanks for the help. I really want to figure myself out and I feel this is the first step.",17Jan2018,1
