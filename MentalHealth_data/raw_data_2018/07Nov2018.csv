0,"My brain feels like it is screaming. But at the same time it feels numb and like their is white noise. It's like a constant throbbing echo of nothing yet pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually fight with depression but this is a fun new stage in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its amazing how after over 2 decades fighting depression it can find new and clever ways to make you suffer and feel horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

The screaming yet silence and the numb yet something like anguish and despair are creating a white noise where its hard to focus on anything.   


I'm not suicidal or anything at the moment beyond the occasional thought of the world would be better without me and I'll die alone that have popped up today, but I thought I knew all the weapons my depression had to throw at me since I've been dealing with it since I was 11... But apparently it can still surprise me sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Well thanks for listening to my vent.

Don't worry about me I'll be okay I just needed to put this into words somewhere somehow.",07Nov2018,1
1,So I was watching porn and accidentally clicked on a sissy hypnosis video entitled “I am a brainwashed hypnoslave * sissy hypnosis dumb *”. I heard a loud female voice that sounded trance and my head started pounding. I only listened to once second of it and it said “I am-“ and then I turned it off. I’m super scared. The video also had a spiral. I also keep imagining the feeling of my head hurting. I’m just wondering if it’s gonna affect me because I’m imagining the exact feeling in my mind. Is it possible this video affected me at all? I’m super scared please please help!,07Nov2018,1
2,"I'm currently in CBT for depression and anxiety, I get 50 minutes per week for a maximum of 16 weeks - after this time I'd have to wait 6 months to return to therapy, where the waiting list is around 6 months.   


Today was session 7, we decided last week to stop pursuing interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and instead switch to Mindfulness - my therapist printed off a few sheet of information on Mindfulness, including two very basic exercises.   


I didn't get around to reading this sheet, as such my therapist decided not to go ahead with the therapy session - his argument was he needs to know I can do my 'homework' with Mindfulness, which is reasonable, but telling me I lose this therapy session because I didn't do exercises I didn't know I was supposed to do feels unfair and detrimental to me.   


I kept trying to ask him why I couldn't do these exercises in session, or why we couldn't go on without my having done these exercises at home as they were only small exercises, but he wasn't able to give me a reasonable reason. He said 'sorry you feel I'm not explaining this to you' which jut frustrated me further.  We went around in circles, it was like we were talking different languages and I really struggle with confrontation so I was finding it difficult to explain myself.  


He also brought up that during IPT he seemed to keep pushing me into lame social community groups with other depressed people rather than recognizing I could find my own social groups, it felt patronizing to me and I didn't feel him doing this was helping me at all (thus why we discussed changing to Mindfulness). That plus this issue with the exercises means I feel like he believes I'm non-compliant, not true...I simply didn't know I was supposed to do these exercises!   


He fixated on this idea that I wouldn't be able to do 'homework' and if I couldn't there's no alternative aka therapy would have to end, he also said if we can't work this out that he'd have to stop being my therapist - this isn't the first time it's been hinted at and it REALLY bothers me, rather than working with me to deal with issues there's an ultimatum. To me it's like a romantic partner constantly threatening to break-up with you, it doesn't build trust or make for a good relationship.      


I don't want to ask for a new therapist half way through my sessions and I worry if I do it'll further add to this idea of non-compliance - I've had to ask for a new therapist in the past, about two years ago when last with this service, so it'll end-up looking like I'm the one at fault. I don't think the exercise issue is a big deal but if he's threatening to stop being my therapist over something so little I'm not sure how he's going to help me at all. I'm not sure how to proceed.

3,"When distressed, why do we choose self-destruction over healthier coping strategies? I know I should be doing such and such, but I would much rather do something that is not good for. In fact, it gives me a rush to treat myself like shit.  I'm sure I'm by far not the only one.

4,"I started seeing a new psychiatrist back in June and he’s helped me tremendously up until today. When I went to stand up and leave, he came over to where I was sitting and started grasping my arm up and down and then did the same thing to my other arm before letting me stand up. I felt taken aback as he did it without asking consent, and out of the few mental health professionals I’ve seen none have ever touched me.

I felt sort of violated afterward even though he just grasped my arms. He told me it was to “check for a side effect” which I know has to be total bullshit, I’ve been on psychiatric medications for years and no doctor has ever done this before. 

I’ve been trying to rationalize it and the only thing I can come up with is that he was trying to feel track marks or something, even though I’ve never used intravenous drugs in my life and have no history of that. I was sorta loopy during the appointment, but only because I needed my morning coffee. 

Has anyone else ever been touched/examined like this by their psychiatrist? ",07Nov2018,1
5,"I'm in my late 20's and I've had problems for over half of my  life, my childhood was fine and I was happy, I was a lot less sociable  than most of my peers but still I had a small group of friends, I loved  video games, cartoons and reading and I was quite sedentary and not very  physically active, late in my childhood my friends begun to bully me a  lot in school with physical violence,  humiliation and exclusion, all the kids cared about were sports, fighting and showing dominance.

One day when I  was 13 I was attacked with such violence by my closest friends I was  lucky to not have been seriously injured, it was the very worst day of  my life and slowly I began to isolate myself because I figured out there  was a social ladder and I was at its very bottom and it terrified me, I  was still bullied for a few years after that but it was much  milder, maybe it was all because I never liked sports, I was too sweet  and obedient, I loathed dominance and violence and I was weak, I was  constantly feeling scared for my safety back then.

By  the time I was 16 and I had  no friends anymore and I began to think about suicide, but I never acted   on it, I started to become less interested in the world  and focusing even more on music, the internet and video games, this  should be the age when you are meant to be always thinking about sex  but I wasn't, I'm able to feel aroused but I never felt the drive to  have sex, in fact the sexual behavior of both sexes make no sense to me  and I can't relate to either of them, maybe it could be nice to have a  parter but nobody ever showed any interest in me and I'm fine with that.

When  I was 18 I became extremely depressed and I found my first job in my  early 20's, it was very fast paced and I couldn't keep up because it  confused my mind and left me emotionally overwhelmed, soon I found  another job and it was very slow paced and I still work there, my  depression was weakened and even suicidal thoughts are now only  background noise, since then I  kind of forgot how to express how I feel, but maybe that's  not bad because expressing emotions was one of the reasons that made me  a target in my  childhood.

I think I still have some depression because  I have little energy so I can't do  much, I take longer than most people to do simple tasks and I find it  quite hard to feel interested in anything, it's like I don't have much  of a drive to  accomplish anything, I'd like to learn new things but the energy just  isn't there, I often feel sleepy, my concentration and short term memory  are quite poor, maybe it's because I've been daydreamy and out of tune  with my surroundings since my childhood, my mind feels foggy sometimes.

I  started to open myself  to people slowly last year but then I ran into more problems, I  don't like the activities most people do and my views on politics,  religion and other important subjects are different of what people of my  area think and I don't like the music most of them do, I'm actually  scared of talking about these subjects because I fear I could be  persecuted, since I was a teen I have this fear that if I express myself  as I truly am I will be the target of violence.

I know  people don't accept me as I am and I'm not willing or even able to  change my personality to please them, I think most people are boring and  uninteresting and I have little interest in finding out about them or  sharing ideas or activities, I feel we have little in common and I know I  don't fit in, often I feel an urge to be alone when I'm around them for  too long, I find much of their normal behavior puzzling and I don't  like social media and parties.

Even the world feels  boring and uninteresting, music, video games and the internet are the  very few things that make me feel some pleasure, I can only find people  who share my views and interests online and I love internet forums, it  would be nice if I could move to another city and meet people sharing  my interests and have a small circle of quiet friends, indeed it would  be good if I knew some people who accepted me as I am and din't treat  treat me with aggression or contempt.

My free  time is usually spend on doing house chores, listening to music, playing  solo video games and browsing the internet, I feel very uncomfortable  around people, it's like there's an alarm in my brain telling me to run  away and I can only feel truly relaxed and safe when I'm alone, my only  close friends are my parents and siblings, I don't trust people and  their intentions very much and very often I feel persecuted and  vulnerable, sometimes I'm even scared of being watched online or that  people know what I'm thinking

For many years I've  always been worried about everything, specially about the future, money  and my safety, I feel all I have could be lost at any time, my chest  feels heavy and I find it hard to breathe when I  worry too much, sometimes I feel my heart beating very fast., I've felt  like this since I was teen and these physical  symptoms are crippling, I feel easily stressed out so I need to stay in  calm and relaxing environments just to remain sane.

What  scares me is that many relatives on my mother's family are loners who  never married  or seldom dated and some killed themselves, my mother herself is often  depressed and anxious, it makes me feel unsure whether my brain was  wrong from birth and it got further  damaged due to bullying or if it was fine before and the bullying  stunted my mind, it could be all the result of trauma, sometimes I feel  like I had a real personality but it was lost when I was young and I'd  like to find it again, it feels like part of my brain was shut down.

Forgive  me if my rant is too long and boring, I'm going to seek a psychiatrist  soon, hopefully before the end of this year, but I fear I won't be able  to make myself understood, I have no experience with mental health  professionals and my knowledge about mental health is rather shallow, I  really want to get better and at least put an end to the physical  symptons of anxiety and the low energy, I've been slowly getting better  by myself since I got my second job and now I finally have the mindset  to seek help.",07Nov2018,1
6,"My friend today was considering hospitalizing himself willingly because he needs more help than one weekly therapy visit, although being hospitalized would be probably very harmful to his mental health as well. is there a middle ground?",07Nov2018,1
7,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve ever only had nightmares. I hadn’t really thought about it much until I heard someone say it was abnormal. I’ve always had an issue with being tired all day and feeling like I need a nap. It affects my attention span and focus. I just now started thinking about how this is probably because of the nightmares. 

Even the dreams that start out great end up turning into something horrible, terrifying, or just plain stressful. I don’t really wake up crying as much as I used to. But nearly every time I get up in the morning, I feel exhausted.

I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder since grade school. I also suffer from PTSD (not super serious). I am now in college and I have learned how to better handle both of these issues. But the nightmares won’t stop. Will I just have to live with them for the rest of my life?

8,"I've been out of work for the past 2 months due to mental health issues. I have bipolar depression and I have problems working. I have to go back tomorrow to the job that I hate and honestly I just want to kill myself. I'm tired of doing something I hate for money that I don't even enjoy spending. I've lost all interest in things I used to care about, I feel suicidal because this is never going to end. I turned 27 on Saturday and I have 26 more years of this bullshit. I think I'm gonna do it. I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to give this world. And it has nothing to give me. I've fought a good fight but maybe it's time to call it in. 

Adult life is extremely difficult. Nothing can prepare you for the grind that is life, and I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze. Not under the current circumstances it's not. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just want to put my feelings out there. Maybe someone feels the same way as me, maybe not. But my parents are going to be very sad one day when I muster the courage to end it. Because I think about it every day. It's going to happen at some point, I know it is. ",07Nov2018,1
9,"Hi guys, I’ve been wanting to ask this sub this for awhile now but was too nervous. 

So I have recently joined an extracurricular and was excited to start, and work with my team to create an awesome skit, and just have fun, but was sad to see that my team has no one that I’m comfortable with. I very much prefer being alone which is why I was excited to see my reaction to this. My big question is if I should leave? I’m extremely uncomfortable at practices, and in order to do this, we also have to do research. Which doesn’t help because i already have enough homework. Plus having to rely on other people is also something that I’m not a huge fan of. I feel like I’d be much happier if i quit and had more free time.

10,"Hello all - I am seeking some advice and guidance for this crazy life I lead.  


I am an individual who struggles with depersonalizing. I regularly, whenever stressed, upset, or other moods seem to trigger it seem to completely become a different person. When looking back on the events, I will either not remember most of it or I will remember and not be able to explain any of my behaviour. I have had the love of my live look at me and ask me ""Who are you right now?"". It's a terrible feeling. Not only do I feel like I do not know who I am, I commonly feel that I am not in control of my self.  I make mistakes and do some extremely stupid stuff when I depersonalize, including make things up that are just trivial lies for no reason at all.

My love believes I suffer from either Multiple Personality Disorder or Dis-associative Personality Disorder. It's something I have tried to seek help for before and still am, but the mental health system is terrible. I am reaching out here wanting to know if anyone has similar experiences and if there is any advice for working through this. Are there exercises I can do?",07Nov2018,1
11,"Lately I've felt stressed as shit for no apparent reason, i feel like the smallest things are giving me full on adrenaline buzzes, i don't feel anxious mentally when i get this but it does make it quite hard to think, it started out with a nice little kick of adrenaline that actually helped me do work and like, in general increase/lift my mental health in general, but now these sometimes four hour long rushes of adrenaline feel like pure adrenaline surging through my veins, i'm fairly sure there's some sort of psychological aspect to it , i wouldn't call them full panic attacks but their getting close to panic attacks, and more common, my mind will feel mildly agitated but my body will feel like red hot flaming adrenaline is surging through my veins, often resulting in muscle tension in the solar plexus and shoulders, and agitated behavior, then i'll have a full adrenaline come down, where i feel a sense of relief and minor fatigue for no reason, then once the minor fatigue is gone something will start the processes all over again, it started around the same time my depression/numbness/near suicidal low self esteem started to get fade, if it helps to know i have adhd, ocd, anxiety, and depression, is there any explanation for this, i keep having adrenaline fueled mental breakdown type experiences.",07Nov2018,1
12,"I hope this is an ok place to post. I'll preface this by saying that I've been on a medication that has been known to cause depression since June and have to continue it until December. I'm 21F and in my last year of college. I'm currently doing pretty badly in all of my classes, whereas I had almost straight As up until this year. 

In July, my (now ex) boyfriend of 6 years attempted suicide during an argument. He is an alcoholic, now recovering. He jumped off of our third floor balcony and I had a pretty traumatic experience trying to help him and then spent a month sleeping by his side in a hospital while he recovered.

 I started working right around the time he got out of the hospital, and I felt really good about myself for the first time in a long time because I was independent. I went out with a guy from work one night about a month ago and slept with him. I didn't feel bad about cheating at all, and dumped my boyfriend the next time I saw him. I didn't feel anything when I broke up with him, and I still don't really. I've seen him a couple times since when he moved his stuff out of my apartment, but didn't feel any emotions at all. It's weird because he is not a bad person and he was my best and only friend. 

The coworker and I now have a casual but exclusive relationship where we hang out a few times a week. In my previous relationship, I hated sex. I only did it to appease my ex, and as infrequently as possible. I didn't feel any desire. Now, I want to have sex all the time. It's really the only thing I want, and my new partner's drive isn't as high as mine, though still healthy. I think this might be my way of seeking validation? I want to feel wanted, but I am rejected regularly. I feel sad when he is too tired or not in the mood because it feels like I am not good enough. 

I feel indifferent about most of the things I thought I really enjoyed. The other day, I was excited because a TV show I liked was starting a new season, but I couldn't even make it through the episode because I didn't care and couldn't pay attention. My partner wants me to go out and do things with him, but I can't think of a single thing I want to do. I feel no interest in anything. I am constantly bored, but don't want to do anything. I need to study for exams, but instead I spend hours doing absolutely nothing. I skip class most days, and now I feel like I'm too far behind to ever catch up or do well. Today, I had half a bottle of wine about an hour after I woke up and skipped 2 very important classes that I don't usually miss. My partner was here because he had slept over last night, and we hung out and played video games all day. He was a little worried because I was drinking (he didn't have any), but I didn't get any more alcohol after I finished the half bottle so it was ok I think. He was having so much fun playing the video game (which was always one of my favorite pastimes) but I was just going along with it. After he left, I felt really sad, though I don't know why. I started crying and then I thought about everything I am writing now. I feel like my life is out of control and I don't know how to fix it. I want to drink more, but I am trying to convince myself to study for my exam tomorrow morning. 

I wonder if all of my actions over the past couple of months have been mistakes. I feel detached from myself, and I am worried that I will suddenly feel clarity and regret everything I have done. I feel alone and I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to scare away my partner by telling him any of this. I kind of want to call my ex because he is the only person I have ever been close to, but I can't because we're not together anymore and I was horrible to him. I feel like I am floating through life with no control, like I'm on a raft with no paddles and no way of stopping, kind of like I am just watching it all take place from an outside perspective.

13,"The girl is only a few weeks old. She needs her diaper changed. Her father gets up from the bed, presumably to change her, but instead he puts her on the balcony in the middle of winter to stop her screaming. She only survived because her mother woke up.

The girl was 3 years old when she first asked her mother when she was leaving father. Leaving someone who is abusive is hard, especially when they are the parent that makes money. My dad could have been a goddamn millionare, if he didn’t love casinos, poker and alcohol. 

She is in kindergarten. Her big brother happens to be an intern and one day, she falls through a deep hole in the snow, and ends up with a black eye. She is ashamed. She does not want her big brother to see she messed up. She does not like when her pride is hurt. Her father would have laughed at her. Would her brother do the same? The golden-haired boy is at the same kindergarten.

She is 5 years old, standing in the shower and staring at the green Fructis schampoo. The year is 2005. She decides that this exact moment, she will remember forever as one of her earliest memories.

She does not know how old she is, but as a ”prank”, her father used to lift her up by her feet and walk around with her until all her blood rushed to her brain. He also yelled at her every single day, more if mother was not home. He hit her, lift her by her arm and threw her on the floor. ”I’m older than you, so you have to respect me.” To this day, she has a problem with authority.

Before turning 12 years old, the girl decides she wants a hamster. She has always loved animals. Probably more than humans. She is a little socially awkward, but animals surprisingly like her a lot. Fast forward half a year or so and now she has multiple hamsters. Her father starts placing mouse traps around the house while laughing. She is afraid. She loves her hamsters.

She turns 12 years old and by this time she has been a horseback rider for 5 years already. She experiences isolation and bullying, but she hides it because she is ashamed. Hiding in the bathrooms for hours because she is too proud to admit to the public that she is not exactly surrounded by people that love her. Shame is the worst feeling there is. It makes her skin scrawl. Sometimes, when her mother’s schedule allows it, she picks her daughter up and just drives around with her for hours until it’s time to return to the stable in time for the riding lesson. Just so she will feel less lonely. In this family, the words ”I love you” were never said. They were expressed. When the horse she had taken care of for a year had to be put down, she swears not to set foot in that stable ever again. She was the one who found him in the pasture. She immediately knew something was horribly wrong. The memory haunts her.

When she turns 14, the fights between her and her father turned so bad she ignored him for half a year. She pretended like he didn’t exist at all. She had never been a problem child. Raised as an only child, she was mostly quiet. She still didn’t understand why her father seemed to loathe her so much. She starts hoping he’ll die in an accident. Please. Please.

Boys always ignored her. She was no beauty, really. You could never find an actress or a singer with quite the same face as her. I’ll call her.. unique-looking.
 Until the day she began seventh grade. She slowly fell in love with a golden-haired boy with a wicked smile. In the beginning it was good. It was mostly the girl’s family drama. When the girl was 15, her mother was diagnosed with a tumor. Her father was supposed to pick her mother up from the hospital, but instead he showed up drunk in a taxi. They fought. When they got home, he punched her hard in the stomach and the police were called. Her dad was finally in the process of moving out. 12 years after the girl had asked for it for the first time.

It was her, and the golden-haired boys first love. They were each other’s firsts in everything. They had a lot of good moments, but she trashed it and was way too controlling because she was jealous, immature and unexperienced in relationships. She needed more than he could give her. She loved him with all her heart, but he loved the music more. And that is okay. After time of the break-up, though, she wasn’t eating. She was destroyed for along time. She weighed 42kg. Her ribs were very visible. One day, she looked at herself in the mirror for a long time and she decided she deserved better. She started eating. She got better. Sometimes. She kissed boys and girls, playing them like pieces on a chess board. She wasn’t living no matter where she was and what she was doing, for months and months and months. He was still on her mind. It took her a long time to recover and she is still glue-ing back the pieces, hoping to return to the person she once was. Before all the heartbreak. Before all the emotional damage. You see, she became terribly afraid of falling in love. Giving your absolute everything to a person, and they end up leaving you in the end, even if they have reasons why, it still broke her. 

After she turned 15, mother was in the hospital almost all the time for a year straight. Cancer. Doctors couldn’t do anything. The girl visited her mom for the last time a tuesday. Friday morning, the day the girl was supposed to sleep over at the hospital and watch Finding Dory since her mother had told her she’d love to watch it but seemed sad since she couldn’t get out of the hospital and see it. The last time, that tuesday, the girl saw her mother smile was when her mother told her that she finally had been able to brush her teeth by herself that morning. It almost made the girl cry right on the spot. She had to go home. She couldn’t take it anymore. She cried the whole bus ride home.

On friday, in the middle of maths class, the school nurse comes into the room and the girl is called down to her office. There, she meets her aunt and the aunt’s husband. They are both bawling their eyes out.
   ”She’s dead! Your mother passed away last night” the girl’s aunt shrieks. The girl silently comforts her, and returns to the maths class. Stone cold. Ice walls. She tells not a single one of her friends, except for one. The golden-haired boy, whom she still held close to heart. She had imagined she’d have more time with her mother, her closest friend who had always been there for her. She would never have believed this future when she was seven. She finished the rest of the school day, took the bus home, got to the apartment door, opened it, closed it. The girl lost it. She screamed. Cried. Cursed. She asked if the golden-haired boy could come over. He said no. She, in a fit of rage unlike any other, blocked him everywhere and called her other female friend, who had a fever and was really sick. That friend showed up at the girl’s doorstep with candy, ice cream, hugs and everything you can imagine. She saved the girl’s life and she didn’t even know it. That weekend, they partied hard, even though her friend had a fever, but somehow she had become friends again with the golden-haired boy during the weekend. No idea how.

Around this time, the girl met a new guy. The second boyfriend kind of popped up in her life randomly. They started speaking to each other in October, one month after her mom had passed away. She got a taste of being with someone older and, after only 5 months, decided he was too goddamn immature for her. He ended up cheating on her with a girl he had known for 4 days while on a trip abroad, a couple months after his real girlfriend’s aunt (and mother) suddenly died.

The girl cried exactly once over the cheating boyfriend, and then she was fine. Over time, she realized she couldn’t possibly have loved him. He told her, after they broke up, that he had never loved her and that she had been love a hobby to him. Her heart froze for the second time. Ice walls. Ice walls.

No. She went out into the world, wanting to know what she was capable of. It turned out, that she was capable of terrible things. She got involved with every drug you could ever imagine, she homewrecked, she cheated, the police, she out-manouvered a psychopath, fought through a psychosis, she lost a kitten that meant the world to her, she lost her best friend of 5 years abruptly, possibly losing her entire family.. and oh, she died. She died in every room in her apartment. She died in a car. She died on the street where that old lady got mowed down by a truck. That same night, she saw the old lady in the mirror. Sometimes she wonders if she is stuck in a place somewhere between and death, but nowadays she has mostly learned to recognize those as delusions.

The third boyfriend took care of her. He loved her, but she could not possibly love him back. Not in the beginning. She had her eyes elsewhere for a while, until she made a choice. She chose him. He was her eyes and her ears after the psychosis, since she didn’t trust her own senses. He was always patient with her, and without him, she would be lost, still. 

Above all, yet, here she is. Still living. Still breathing. Still fighting. Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in. Never run, never chase. Without hope, without witness, without reward. Be good. Just keep on going. It is what mother would have wanted the most. She was afraid of leaving her girl alone, she was not afraid of dying. Aunt too. Remember to put flowers on their graves when able to. Maybe the girl will meet them one day, when it is her turn to leave Earth. Here’s to the hope of a peaceful afterlife.",07Nov2018,1

16,"I don’t typically use reddit, but I made this account specifically for this because I don’t want it traced back to me. 

I’m going to try to make this quick. I am not going to identify how I am related to this family member. We will call him Tim. But nobody in the family has spoken to him in over ten years due to his instability and complete lack of awareness for anybody other than himself. His brother tried for many years to get him help for his mental health, but Tim always refused and lashed out at any family member who suggested he may be mentally ill. Tim was very attached to his mother, living with her for nearly his whole life until she passed, or bouncing around to friends’ couches. Tim was to unstable to be on his own for to long. 

Tim was insufferable to be around; always nitpicking everybody, being very sarcastic and rude, a “know it all”. If his absurdly high expectations were not met, the whole family would have to deal with the extreme verbal abuse. Tim’s brother got a divorce, and yet Tim continued to seek a familial relationship with Tim’s brothers ex wife. She entertained this so that Tim could see his nephew, however she would constantly be a receiver of the emotional abuse, simple threats (like threatening to tell her mother that she smoked marijuana occasionally), and insane demands which nobody would fulfill, let alone an ex sister-in-law. He is very much one of those who takes a lightyear when you give an inch.

The family put up with Tim at the insistence of his mother, who pleaded for everyone to keep the peace. She was his enabler and he relied on her for everything. Tim was emotionally and financially abusive to his elderly mother. This escalated to physical abuse, which was the final straw for most of the family. Tim nearly killed his mother in an attack against her because she would not give him x amount of money. Many family members (including the parents of Tim’s brothers, *second* ex wife... so ex in-laws) continued to hear from Tim after this attack, where they were told they were pathetic for turning their back on him in what was an “emotional break” and he had finally been diagnosed with anxiety and depression (a diagnosis that came from a mandatory medical consultation after the arrest). 

Flash forward two years after this attack, two years of not speaking to Tim, and two years of constant badgering, Tim’s mother died. The family came together for the funeral, where it was found out that Tim had manipulated his mother to leave all assets to him- where major assets were originally to be left to her 4 grandchildren. The family maintained that this death would not change the relationship anybody had with Tim.

This was the last any of the family saw Tim in person. Tim has continued to harass his family members (brother, ex sister in laws and their parents, cousins, nieces and nephew) via phone calls, email, and letters. It is a constant badgering where he puts everyone down, calling them stupid, pathetic, etc., for “abandoning” a family member with mental illness. He begs for family to contact him in the same letters where he calls them stupid. 

A cousin caved and had some contact with him, where he once again attempted to take much more from him emotionally, financially, etc., than he ever offered, and the backlash from being turned down was even worse than the initial badgering. 

The latest news is that he has now been further diagnosed with BPD. He is still maintaining that we do not speak to him due to the fact that we are all ignorant and afraid of mental illness. That we are all stupid because we won’t educate ourselves about mental illness. What he doesn’t know is that two of his nieces struggle with depression, and one of them attempted to kill herself, twice. His nephew now has a masters degree in psychology. We all know and understand mental illness, but we also all know and understand that it is best for *our* mental health to not engage in a relationship with him as it will just result in us bending over backwards to accommodate him, and receiving intense emotional abuse (and maybe even physical given what he did to his mother) when we are unable to meet even the smallest of requests. He is clearly still unstable given the content of his letters, and we simply do not feel comfortable being in contact. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for from this. A place to vent, an ear to listen.. maybe even someone to help me rationalize with the rest of the family if we are still making the best decision. We wish we could reach out to him and explain, but we know it would not go over well in the slightest..

17,"I'm a 20 year old college student and I don't know what's wrong with me. Growing up, I had a verbally and mentally abusive home and I don't know how to handle emotions. I'm going through an ""episode"" right now and I have just typed up what I'm feeling, as I'm feeling it. It might not make perfect sense but it's what I'm feeling and I don't know what to do. 

Life's been really good lately but I still find it hard to get out of bed. I've been dating this guy for about 6 months and he's great and I'm totally in love and I'm pretty sure he's going to be the man I marry.

I've been away from home and I feel like it helped for a little bit because whenever I go home all I do is sit in my room and it just makes everything worse but now I'm back in a funk.

Me and my best friend have a set routine and we eat lunch and dinner at same time everyday and one day she missed dinner and I kind of freaked out and it was weird. She had a reason for missing and it was logical but I still freaked after felt like she didn't like me anymore. 

So I can logically think through things but it doesn't change the way I feel. 

I'm stressed about school not because it's hard or that my grades are bad but just because I find it hard to get out of bed in the morning and I've tapped out on all my absences and because I miss so much school my grades are suffering. So I wouldn't be stressed about school if I can get out of bed in the morning but I can't get myself out of bed like it's physically possible. It's not even that I don't want to go to class I do want to go to class I just can't bring myself to go.

Some days I'm fine and I have kind of high-energy and I can joke and I can laugh and smile and it's not that big a deal. The other days it's so hard to laugh, get out of bed, or crack a joke. I mean it's.. I don't know what to do.

The bad weeks drag and the good months fly. I don't know what to do and I hate feeling like this because growing up my parents taught me that you shouldn't feel this way and that life could be so much worse so why complain. 

To cope with my homelife I just turned to shutting down and now I don't know what to do with the emotions I feel. 

The only person I was able to talk to growing up was my sister but she would always discredit my feelings. She would say that her feelings were worse and more intense and that I wasn't feeling what I was feeling. 

Sometimes I'll cry for a minute and then the tears will just stop and I'll be empty. 

I've always felt that suicide is selfish because I know I have people who care about me who would be sad if I died. When I told my sister that thought she got super mad and defensive as if I've never lost anyone to suicide. 

When is say suicide is selfish, I don't mean the person is being actively selfish, they just don't know who they're hurting or they don't care because the struggle is so bad. 

I know I have people who love me and would be sad if I died so suicide has only crossed my mind handful of times. ",07Nov2018,1

22,"I’ve been dealing with dissociation/depersonalization/derealization on and off for the past few months. 

The initial episode was brought on by a very very small amount of marijuana and lasted an entire week. It got so intense that it brought on panic attacks. 

Since then, only a few episodes have happened, twice from waking up from a nap and another time while I was making macaroni and cheese. (Literally no clue what could have triggered it). These more recent episodes only last a few hours, but I’ve had three for the past three night and I don’t know why. 

I want to understand why and how this is happening and I want people to be as concerned as I am. I’m scared and it’s giving me more anxiety which probably isn’t helping the episodes. Anytime I try to talk about it, people kind of just brush it aside. It’s probably because they don’t know how to react, but neither do I!

My mom came home that night and was yelling at me for not cleaning up my mess that I was just about to clean up before she came in.

But I have a really great friend who can't go a day without a panic attack or two, and has never done any of this. She's probably the best person I know. Woke at 5 am to hang out with a friend who's lonely on his morning shifts. Are these symptoms of anxiety? If they are I'd probably see them differently. I've never had clinical anxiety, just very introverted and on edge in social situations, I guess. And how do you tell the difference between genuine anxiety and saying you have it? Please don't flame me if I'm ignorant on the subject, I'm trying to learn and haven't found anything on the internet. ",07Nov2018,1
25,"To my mother's abuse and neglect. My father's drug abuse and indifference to my mother's abuse (he only said hey stop or hold her back while she hit us). Him getting arrested for his drug habits and being an absent father. To their divorce and my realization (I was 14) that made me see how horrible my mother is, and how pathetic my father is. And the realization of how lonely I was, which may have came about when I was 15. 


That's about the time my father came crawling back. The dude told me at least he never hit me, I don't remember how I felt about this. But the first time I meant him after a year or maybe more I felt nothing, even when I looked into his eyes It felt as if I was looking at a stranger. 


At this point every few times I meet up with my dad (I was pretty much forced to go) it always ended the same. By the time it's 2017 (I'm 17 at this point) it's the first time I've ever felt this darkness. I felt completely black, I can't even describe the dread or whatever it was that came over me, but I was so bad I griped my face (with my nails) to stop it. I don't know what triggered it. The second time this happened was because of my brother. He was already becoming in the process of being a stranger to me, he talked a lot of shit and he was a constant pain in the ass. But he was a decent venting tool. We were arguing and he used my deepest issues against me, issues I've only told him and my sister about, and told me to kill myself. After that I went to the bathroom and took a shower to think, in my head I thought of the ""people in my life"" and that's it. After that I cried a bit and just blacked out in the shower, when I eventually got out of the bathroom my legs hurt so I must have been standing there for a while. So I tired to tell this to my consoler (that I got because my pediatrician was recommending I get one) and it ended up me scratching my neck and just trying to leave. 


But these days I feel like those memories were dreams. It's like it never actually happened, but lately I keep feeling fake. Whenever I talk to my sister, who is the only excuse to why I'm not killing myself, I don't feel any sort of love too. When I talk to her or anyone it's all like I'm not even me, I'm not saying these words when I talk to them. When somehow cry it feels fake, and it stops on its own without me doing anything. 


This is all I can think of, most of the time I stop writing altogether because i can't remember what I'm writing. I'm going to sleep so my response time is going to be long.

28,"I know panic attacks are a very well documented and discussed mental health phenomenon, but once in a blue moon (just had one), I get what can only be described as a depression attack. I'll just be laying in bed for example, and then I'll get this random, but deep feeling of despair. It's not the typical everyday, mild, but all-encompassing depression that I dealt with over a decade ago, but just this remarkably intense feeling of complete despair, disconnect, and isolation like I'm not connected to anything, and everything is meaningless. When I had major depression about 12-14 years ago, I also had panic attacks which were different than these, so I'm not sure if it's a panic attack variant or something that deserves it's own categorization.

29,"For a little bit of background information: I’m bipolar and taking one such medication fluoxetine. Apparently this is an SSRI or something like that. I’m also on Trileptal, Concerta, and Abilify.

So, I decided to start smoking weed a month or so ago, all was well up until the last few days. I feel really strange and have lots of different symptoms. I’m just starting to feel these strange symptoms and it’s been about a week since I smoked last. It honestly sounds like Serotonin Syndrome, but then again, that hits you within the first few hours. So I’m not really sure what is wrong.

So, for one, my memory has been awful for the past month, I guess. I can’t think straight, can’t hold a thought, and like I said, my memory isn’t working correctly. For the past day, maybe, I have seen small dark objects in the corner of my vision, just dart away. When I look, there’s nothing there. That doesn’t happen too often, but still, nonetheless. My head also has the feeling like I’m drunk, like my vision seems slow and if I jerk my head too fast, it hurts and such. I’m also super paranoid. I walked downstairs for a little bit and had to keep my back to the wall because I was just creeped out. And when it wasn’t to the wall, I would constantly look behind me. I think I’m also suffering from a bit of psychosis, also.

This is coming from a person that has been really overworked and disrespected in their previous job.  I have issues with my work situation. I don't have any coworkers, my only coworker is my boss. My other coworker quit shortly after I joined. She was nice...sigh. My boss walks by my office every morning to get to our working area and doesn't say hi. I feel so isolated and lonely. This sucks because I moved away from my friends and family and so it is a priority for me to find new friends. My boss is a highly technical expert in his field, so he doesn't trust me to do a lot of the work. Which is fine. But he doesn't teach me either. I've shadowed him but he doesn't explain anything he does; he would just have me watch... in complete silence.  He doesn't give clear direction. On several occasions he's told me to wait 5 minutes so he can show me something. I waited an hour before I said I had to leave (it was 6pm! and i was twiddling my thumbs standing by). There's no meetings. He never introduced me to other people at the company. Because we are a department (of two people) tucked away in a secluded corner, I never see other people. I didn't think this would happen because it is a big company but there is no opportunity for interaction. Basically I feel like an on call assistant who does very menial tasks. He regularly expresses his frustration at this job and the company's inefficiency. In general he is a very monotone, negative person, who can't bring himself to talk to me unless he absolutely has to. I am losing my mind having nothing to do and no one to talk to. I've resorted to taking online classes from MIT opencourseware. I am a person who likes to keep busy and getting things done. I get a lot of satisfaction from that. But I only get 3 easy tasks a week (1hour each). One day one of those tasks involved me identifying certain personnel to getting something done, to which he warned me not to pester them afterwards. They were very happy to help me, so his statement confused me, and it sucked to hear that I had to isolate myself from them too. After several months here, I've realized that he hired me so that he can do the important work while do the work he doesn't want to do that's so easy you can't mess it up. Because of that, he doesn't have time for me because his workload is sooo important. I clearly annoy him, but I care about getting my work done, so I ask my questions anyways, fully knowing that he'll like me less. For the record, I maybe only take up 5 minutes of his time in talking a day. I pop in at various times in the day checking in asking if I can lend a hand. To which he replies no. He works by himself too, doesn't he want people to talk to? I guess I'm realizing that I'm angry. I'm angry that this is a sucky situation and that I'm going to have to be here until I get a new position. I'm angry at myself for being blindsided and not recognizing an issue during the interview.

38,"Hello. I’m an 18 year old college freshman who has been struggling with poor mental health for many years now. I am not diagnosed with anything specific and I do not claim to have any mental illnesses, but what I am feeling on a daily basis is very much real.

Ever since I was a young teenager, I have suffered from self-depreciating thoughts and low self-confidence. I used to be overweight, I had and still have acne that cannot be cured by any medication. Makeup does not improve my looks  and neither do the dressy clothes I wear. And, to top it all off, I have a crippling fear of talking to people and being involved in social situations. I have no true friends, only a few acquaintances, one which was caught by another person talking about me behind my back. I have never dated or kissed anybody and I am convinced it will stay this way for the rest of my life. 

Every morning when I wake up and before I go to sleep, I am forced to look in the mirror and I am always mortified by what I see. I am vividly aware of every little imperfection on my face and my body. Some days I cannot stand it and break down into tears, sliding down to the floor and holding my head in my shaking hands. I think, “how could anyone stand to look at me?” and “why was I born this way?” and sink into a state of pathetic self-loathing. 

However, it is not only my physical appearance that I despise. My personality is lackluster at best, I am not funny in any way, and I have no talents or skills whatsoever. The only things that I even remotely enjoy doing anymore are reading, writing, and drawing. Not only that, but my grades have always been average. I had a class rank of 11 out of 21 in high school with a 3.5 GPA. This has made me believe that B’s and A-‘s are not good enough, even though my are parents constantly insisting that they are proud of me. In the back of my mind I know that I am doing well, but my insecurity tells me otherwise. College is making me even more distressed than I usually am because of these high standards that I place upon myself. I feel like nothing but a disappointment who is wasting my parent’s hard-earned money. I have frequent meltdowns about my grades which only makes my parents frustrated, resulting in them yelling at me and making me even more upset.

Although I have vaguely thought about committing suicide before, I have never attempted it. The closest I have ever come to that point was bookmarking a site that sells cyanide pills. I never did buy them. Tonight was different though. I thought about going upstairs and opening the gun safe in my room. I thought about taking one of my dad’s hunting guns and quietly loading it. I thought about pressing the metal to my skin and pulling the trigger. I thought about how happy everyone would be without somebody as worthless as me plaguing their lives. But I know I am too much of a coward to do it. I can’t even bring myself to self-harm. The only time I did so was a couple of months ago when I made two small cuts in my thigh with a cheap razor. They hurt like hell and left me feeling sore for a day or two but both healed within a few days.

So my dilemma is this: am I doomed to keep suffering my entire life like this or is there a way I can muster up enough courage to finally end it all? And before it is suggested, therapy is not an option because of how expensive it is. I cannot even afford to get diagnosed, let alone afford therapy sessions. Even if I was to go to therapy, I doubt it would make much of a difference. So what am I supposed to do when I trapped on all four sides and there are no openings in sight?

Saying that this person is not me and it would say I do no deserve to be loved and that it ruined all its planned of killing myself because I have met my wife. and if someone walks into the room it would act like me and pretend to be like me and tell my wife that if I behave like everything is normal it would go back to sleep and give the real me back to my wife?..

My very best friend “Mark” has always had a tough life, he’s delt with so much due to his family and he has never had any long term relationships. He has no children either. 

I have been friends with mark since high school but in the last year we hang out daily (if we have time) mark has always acted a little different but nothing hugely out of the ordinary. The more that I have been hanging out with him the more odd things I start to notice. He lies so much, and when I say that he doesn’t do it for any purpose. It’s almost like he’s delusional. Like this one time he was talking about his ex wife that he misses so much and how their daughter passed away in a car wreck when she was seven, the crazy thing is I know for a fact that he has never been married or had any children. When he talks about it he get very upset almost like it did happen. He even pointed out to me what cemetery she was buried at and exactly where at in the cemetery. I went there one day alone and never found her grave which bothered me tremendously. He also claims he was in the army but he never was. 
We are from the same town and our town isn’t very big, we did lose touch of each other for a good 6 years but all these things he is saying happened never did. 

A few months back he called me crying saying he’s about to lose his place because he’s broke (he did go broke) and when I got back home he was totally fine and extremely happy like the fact that he was about to lose his house didn’t even matter. 

Just a few weeks ago he told me one day that I would be better off not being friends with someone like him and cut contact with me but he’s now texting me like nothing happened. I’m extremely worried about his mental health and I have no idea what to do, his family acts like they don’t care and everything is fine. 
He’s such a good hearted man and I hate to see him going through all these problems.

I am very, very lucky that the bite was not worst considering the kind of dog it was. I now have 3 scars on my face. Its only been a month so i keep telling myself they will fade and get better eventually. But i feel so disfigured, especially because i work customer service and i interact with strangers all day long and i feel like they are secretly judging me. My husband, coworkers, friends haven't treated me differently but I feel broken and ugly and it reminds me of my crappy youth getting bullied. I'm trying to to keep things in perspective but i haven't been able to find the motivation to workout or take care of my skin. I been eating like crap instead of cooking because i feel like it doesnt matter, my scar will make me ugly anyways. I put on makeup once to cover the scar when i went to see my parents and i ended up crying because no amount of makeup will cover it, that there will always be a mark on my face. Sometimes ill just sit and cry for a few minutes. Also Ive always been an anxious person but ever since i got bit, my stomach churns everytime something stressful happens. I worked hard in the last few years to get my anxiety out of control and i am scared im going to spiral downwards. 

I know it seems like im shallow for caring about how i look. I know that it doesn't really matter, that who i am as a person matters more. I dont spend hours putting on makeup every day, only special occasions but now all pictures in the future will have this ugly scar, a scar i see in the mirror every day, a scar my husband has to see for the rest of his life.

51,"-trigger warning-

Before I start, I just wanna say this post is long as shit I don't blame you if you don't read, and sorry if I do anything wrong it's my first time posting.

So, I'm so sick of all these adverts and posts about how these organisations are here to help with mental health. 
For the last 5 years I have desperately been trying to get help, but I've never been taken seriously, or I've been chucked aside and cast away..

It started when I was 14, I was always severely depressed and struggling with self harm, so my friends practically chucked me in the door of a charity that could help because they were worried. It was during that assessment I first came to terms with the fact that I had been abused by my father. Previously, I had pushed these memories deep within myself (I no longer visited my father, him and my mother split before I was born), but now I was realising what had happened- he had molested, raped and mentally abused me for 8 years, since the age of 5. I was distraught and blamed myself and felt sick.

I spoke to this counsellor for many months before being told I was too attached to him and must be referred to someone else. This new counsellor was shocking to say the least.. didn't care about anything I said and was too busy telling me how she cheated on her husband at the weekends..

Fast forward a while, I land myself in hospital for self harming. They conduct an assessment and upon finding out about my childhood abuse, called social services and the police. This opened up an investigation and 2 days before my birthday my father was arrested for questioning. 

This led to a referral to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services). Here, my counsellor never listened and solution to any anxiety I had was to 'stop worrying'. I only saw her for 2 appointments as she cancelled week after week, providing a different excuse each time. I disengaged with CAMHS after this.

Over time I grew more numb, engaging in unstable relationships in which I was stricken with fear over being left, self harming didn't stop and I found myself in hospital a bunch more times whether it be from injuring myself or having outbursts. 

Two years on from the initial hospital visit my court case against my father was happening. It went to shit. Despite having somewhat solid evidence -screenshots of filthy messages he had sent me- the jury found him not guilty. Part of me believes this was due to the age of a lot of the jurers.. They were elderly and scoffed at such a thing happening.. To make matters worse my own brothers went against my case and were witnesses for my father, and my grandad stood in the gallery and made dismissive noises and tutted the whole time I gave evidence. My detective was just as shocked as I was at the verdict, the night before the we found out the judge had discussed with her and I was told pre prepared papers for his arrest as he was so sure of the result... but no.

From then on my memory is mostly blank, I somehow managed to uphold good GCSE grades and my first year of sixth form went great. But overtime this changed. I became OBSESSED with the boy I was dating, catastophizing small problems like not being able to see him when he said I would, anxious that he would leave and heartbroken when I came to find out he was cheating on me the whole time.

I had a pattern of a couple more relationships like this. Thinking the world revolved around them and never leaving no matter how unstable it got.

As time goes on I seem to grow more numb, feeling less and less, every few months I would have outbursts and sometimes heavily dissociate. I was referred to MIND the mental health charity this year, but after finding out I had been using drugs (Weed, Cocaine, MDMA, LSD, Mushrooms..) they would not help me.
 
So now I'm 19 and still trying to persue help and something I can call a life despite it being the most monumental fucking task ever, I'm so close to just giving up. I barely feel a thing, except anger. I'm sort of just dwelling in my shittiness, and I don't know what to do. Anxiety is also at an all time high which is just wonderful...


Sorry for the shit read. Thanks if you made it this far.

54,"My entire life I've felt that something was different about me. Ive struggled with insomnia all throughout my childhood and even to this day ive never had a working sleep schedule. I feel that i experience emotions that are more intense,  in other words i suppose im just really dramatic with my emotions. However ive never felt any emotion as strong as ive felt pure sadness and hatred. I know you're not supposed to self diagnose, but at what point do you know you need help. I feel that ive been suffering from depression for years and have done nothing about it because of the fear of speaking up and saying that I need help.

Growing up, I used to come home from school and just sleep my childhood away. I used to rush to finish homework so I could sleep the day away. When high school came I slept once I came home and figured out what homework I had the morning it was due. My first year of college I transferred out. I failed a few of my classes, dropped others, and barely passed the rest. I didn't care about anything and I still don't now in my second year. I still sleep through classes, hardly understand the material, and procrastinate all of my work until the day before it's due.

The thing is I just don't care. I only care about the things that I enjoy being video games and music. And yet I find myself having no energy or will power to pursue the things I enjoy. I'm a long term procrastinator and it's dangerous. When things in life have deadlines, I can get them done the day before. But when it comes to the things in life that have no concrete deadline, at what point do I sit down and get to work? I don't, i never do.

Asside from all of this, I have an ego about me, which I didn't know until about my high school years. The thing is I never thought this before. Ive always thought of myself as a introverted person who is always open to help and listen to others if they need help. Ive always been that person people come to when they need advice or something. Yet as I got older I started to realize something about life, that its revolved around you.

Each person spends the most time with themselves and naturally has to worry about their own needs before others to survive. We find things to be more intersting when they involve ourselves in some way. And because of this truth I've been constantly torn between thinking that im the most narcissistic, self-centered, instant gratifying person ever or just a normal individual who has really overanalyzed his own abnormal thoughts. Yet sometimes I think that I am this great person, like I'm really proud of who I am and I remain unsure if its a healthy amount of self appreciation or its an inflated ego.

Lastly, I have trouble with commitment and responsibility. I have a girlfriend of almost four years now, and every problem that we've ever had was due to my impulsive and destructive nature. I make decisions without regard for the consequences. I act and say things without thinking and I don't know how to change. I look back on fights and moments where im clearly just being arrogant in the moment, and I can see just how blatantly wrong I am, but it's so hard to admit.

Thank you for reading my ramblings. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here. If you could share similar experiences or anything that you think may be helpful to hear, please share.

Tldr: I have many unanswered issues with myself and was wondering what others could share from an outside prospective.",07Nov2018,1
55,"TW: Self harm, suicidal thoughts.
I have anxiety, depression, and PTSD with dissociative tendencies. I am unmedicated, but mostly manage. Recently, however, I had a panic attack so bad that I ripped out a good portion of my hair. I had to shave my entire head.

56,"Not sure about how to go about asking for advise on this but here it goes...

I have a friend that I've known for about 15 years now. He's a genuinely nice guy and is extremely intelligent but in the past has had some difficulty with certain social situations. This mostly involves coming off as awkward or a bit strange to some people. This wasn't much of a problem though as he had overcome this by being an incredibly confident and fun guy to be around. We'd go out in town on weekends and he'd happily go up to random strangers and chat away all night and have a fantastic time. Occasionally he'd have the odd mood swing and get a bit funny but we didn't think much of it as we mostly put it down to drinking too much or him just being a bit down (as we all feel sometimes).

This was all until a few years ago when he met his most recent long term girlfriend. In short, she was horrible and treated him like dirt but being that he is extremely loyal, he stayed with her for two years. I think this took a huge toll on his mental health. After it all ended his personality changed and he flip flopped between being very aggressive, to extremely depressed, to out right odd. He has lost all ability to communicate with people in a normal manner and takes insult to even the most lighthearted of jokes. It all came to a head when he was out with another friend of mine in a night club and was thrown out for groping a women. When asked why he did it by the bouncer, he replied with 'how else am I supposed to meet women?' He got very distressed about it and blamed my other friend who was with him at the time.

He is now pursuing a friend of mine that he met at a fireworks night we invited them both to. We did not intend to set them up but she seemed to be really into him. After talking for a few days shes now really worried and confused as he's already told her he loves her despite the fact he has told me he doesn't trust her and isn't sure. I'm no behavioral expert but this sort of thing doesn't seem like the actions of someone who is in their right mind.

I'm really worried about him but have no idea how to approach the subject. His family are aware that he has some sort of undiagnosed mental health issue but don't seem to be doing anything about it. In fact his parents do the opposite by treating him like a child and confiscating his Xbox etc. (he is 28 yo and lives at home still). I fear he is getting worse and worse to the point were he's going to lose all sense of normal human interaction and maybe more. He's already lost jobs due to getting in fights and arguments out of nowhere.

Any ideas on how I can approach him and get him to seek help? At the moment I feel like anything I say will upset him and make him angry.",07Nov2018,1
57,"I’m 19 and I still live with my parents, we don’t have a good relationship, we have different views on everything and we argue a lot.

They did talk to my psychologist and she tried to explain them that mental health illnesses are real and what’s happening to me but they still don’t get it, they still think that it’s my fault that I have mental health issues.

58,"Just for context I am diagnosed with OCD and have started therapy for it. There is a person in my family tree who does have what I believe schizophrenia or something like it. I’m not sure if that really qualifies as “history” of that type of mental illness in the family. 

Despite the fact that OCD does my fucking head in I can honestly say I don’t hear voices. The only voice I hear is my inner speech, like when I’m reading things or thinking to myself. I’m always aware that that voice is me, that those are my own thoughts. 

Today something pretty scary happened. My brother was in the shower and I was in my room, while our other sibling was in their room not far away but not particularly close either. Now this is where it gets hazy. I’m not sure exactly what I was doing or if I went out to check whether brother had come out yet when I heard the voice. Brother was in shower and then came out, and I opened my door to check where he was at one point so I could use the bathroom. At some point during all of this while I was in my room with the door closed, I seemed to hear a voice hiss “get dressed” in a really sarcastic way. It wasn’t directed at me, as in, I didn’t feel like it was telling ME to get dressed, but it was telling my brother to. I freaked out and now cannot stop thinking about it.

For those of you who are going to ask if it’s possible other sibling was the one who said it, I’m going to say no. They were in their room at the time as far as I could tell, seeing as I would have heard a door open and also footsteps if they had come out to say such a thing. The voice also didn’t sound anything like theirs, or anything that they would be capable of producing.

Obviously I’m beyond scared. My OCD is beginning to run wild with intrusive thoughts that are really frightening and I’m wondering if this means I’m developing a more severe mental illness. I want to bring this up to someone before I see my therapist next but I’m so afraid of being looked at as crazy. I’ve always been so relieved to not hear voices and yet I’m hearing them now apparently, and my OCD is creeping in telling me, “What if the sound was real, though, and you’re trying to write it off as mental illness?” Amongst other horrible intrusive thoughts I can’t seem to get rid of.

I guess now thinking back there has been another instance in which I may have heard voices. About 6 years ago I heard what sounded like hordes of people chanting my name, but this seemed much more internalised, like it was occurring in my head and not something I was hearing aloud like today. There were no other instances of voices between that time and today.

I don’t have therapy for a few days and I don’t want to freak out my family, so I’m hoping someone could offer an opinion. Has anyone gone through something similar? Does anyone have any advice on how to tell my family this without coming across as completely crazy? I’m a little freaked and just trying to remain calm before I can see my therapist next.

60,"After smoking Weed almost daily for around a year (which worked fine almost all the time) I had a few ""challenging"" experiences, like anxiety attacks and racing thoughts, to the point where my inner voice started discussions with itself. Like constantly contradicting itself (or myself?) and so on. This led to me smoking way less and basically stopping by now. I'm now more depressed than ever before and beginning to question my mental health. Like questioning what I see and experience. ""Is this real or is my mind just making it up?"" I get this thought with the most basic and daily stuff, like people acting kind of weird in public or noises I hear from the street in front of my house.

61," Hey, I have a question about chemical anti-depressants... I am suffering from anxiety and depression since my early teens caused through C-PTSD. Since I found yoga and meditation, went to therapy etc. many things got much better. I developed as a person. But my issues are still strong enough to lower my life quality drastically. I can not travel without intense panic attacks and when depression sets in I am not able to study and work, which leads to a negative loop. My therapist recommended me to take Citalopram. However, there are many reasons for why I am afraid of it. One is I am working in a creative field and I am scared, that if something in my brain chemistry changes I am not able to create anymore. Does anyone have experience with that? Plus I found out that my abusive mother takes it as well... A very high dose. She is a person without any empathy and is totally numbed. When I was a child she was not able to connect to my needs in any way...  And I wonder if the medicals play a part in that at least about the ""numbed"" kind of thing. The third major reason I am afraid of it is: one of my strongest fears during intense anxiety periods was ""going crazy"" and losing control over myself. I never did, but I am afraid if something in my brain chemistry changes I might will in bad periods... 

But I do want to finally turn my life around and medication could be another key to it.

At first I was fine and thought it could help lessen my anxiousness if I get used to it but the opposite is happening and every time we have meetings, I always felt so dumb and overly anxious. I end up not saying anything at all and when they ask for my input, I stutter. I couldn't articulate myself. I feel useless and doesn't deserve the job. My already low self-esteem lowers even more and every day I wish something bad happens so I can excuse myself from not going to work. I know this is toxic and I badly want to get better.

Where I currently live my options are either go for a walk or go for a longer walk, and I don't drive which really isn't helping anything. You can't out-hike your demons apparently. I've tried.

I'm so tired of being who I am. I literally just think about ending it all even in my happiest moments now a days. My best friend and I had/have a really toxic relationship but he's going to counselling and I'm currently looking for a therapist. But I've tried the therapist route before and although I'm hopeful, I dont think itll help. Ive dealt with depression since I was 8 years old (I'm 20 now) it runs in my family, but I was always very good at hiding it. But ever since coming to college I've struggled more and more with my mental health, resulting in two attempted suicides last year, one landed me in the hospital the other my friend stopped me. 
I'm so tired of having this brain, I'm so sick of being in this body. I dont ever feel motivated to do things. Im so fucking lonely but I know I have a semi good support system. I have family that loves me and accepts me as a queer person, I have friends who love me and try to help me with my mental health issues, and I'm a part of groups in school, even in charge of one, but holy hell I'm so depressed sometimes that I'll walk across a bridge and hesitate half way because I just want to jump. I want to stop this pain of a constant loneliness. 
I know it stems my insecurities. My insecurities mostly come from having an extremely depressed mother as a child and a mostly absent military father, all the while getting molested by my uncle. When my parents divorced at age 7 and I told my mother what happened she disclosed to me a time when she tried to kill herself, a time I remember. I was 5 and I remember panicking when she wouldnt wake up and the firemen had to take her away. Then I learned ny father also tried to kill himself while he was on deployment. Both my parents almost left me. Anyway while divorcing my father, she already had a new man, for a few months before actually. When she moved out this new guy began to sexually harrass me. Masturbating while I was in the room, downloading porn on to my mp3, etc. My mother knew and never did anything about it. I should also mention I had began masturbating at a really young age and my mother knew about that. The new man, who eventually became my step-father, stopped once I threatend to kill him several times and came at him with a knife. I fear for my sister who still lives at home. I should mention that my father has never stopped bringing me around this uncle, even after I got the retraining order. 
My entire life has been fucked up by sex and I'm addicted to it. All I want is a partner to hold me and love me. But a cruel fate is that I'm on the aromantic spectrum, still want the love but romance makes me so uncomfortable(yet I love rom coms). Ive never had anyone ever be interested in me romantically or sexually unless I say I take pictures of myself and post them online. I have huge insecurities about my weight and breasts so even doing the things that gives me the most vaildation ive ever felt, doesnt even help. I'm so lonely. I just want to end it all. I really do.

66,"For most of my life, i have battled with addictions. Thats coz i never felt my mood was normal. 

My drug of choice (DOC) was alcohol. I couldnt get enough of it. By the time i quit in 2004, i had jaundice and was fold by my family doctor that i would be lucky to live another 5 years, if i kept drinking at the rate i was going. Thats 14 years ago now. The biggest challenge i ever faced in my life was getting sober and i still work on my recovery to stay sober. 

I think this is very common for ppl with mental illness. I dont have stats for how much ppl with mental illness have substance abuse problems or problems with other addictions like eating and gambling and excessive shopping. All things harmful to us. 

Also, if you are drinking, it will affect the effectiveness of your medication. Many pill bottles state, “Not to be taken with alcohol”, yet many of us ignore the label and drink anyway. Ppl who complain of being depressed and drink, i remind them that alcohol is a depressant. ",07Nov2018,1

It was so extremely realistic that I had to turn on the lights and make sure an intruder wasn't molesting me in my sleep. I literally felt his physical presence in my dream, which never happened before.

It left me a bit shaken, both because I really miss him, and also because it was so physically realistic that I questioned my mental health. I read schizophrenic people's life stories before and I suddenly realized how easy it is to lose touch with reality in one moment. It's two days later now, and I feel ""funny"". I feel anxious and dissociated. I'm constantly watching my own behavior and thoughts and trying to make sure everything is normal and I'm not going insane, but this behavior itself is really absurd and is making me even more scared.

I don’t feel that much. My boyfriend and I had a conversation about how I don’t contribute to the relationship at all. I didn’t feel angry or sad during that time and I seemed so peppy and positive about it like I didn’t really realize I should not be feeling so content with the situation. I didn’t feel anything until a couple of hours later into the conversation when he started talking about our sex life and my mood went downhill immediately and I kept quiet, but for once I maintained my composure and didn’t flip my shit on it like I normally would do. I really liked how I reacted but was I too okay with it? I was pretty sad later that night, but I was alone and probably processed the conversation to it’s full extent.

73,"For almost 2 years now I have struggled with anxiety, and it has affected me in more ways than one.
When it started I couldn't go to school and that was all, I could cope pretty well and I was going in 2 to 3 days a week. It just got worse. After the summer holidays I couldn't go in and I missed half of the school year without going in even once. After Christmas I managed to go in 1 or 2 days a week and I thought I was getting better, I was not.
I started to hate myself and I told myself that it was my fault and that I don't have a reason to feel like this. I was going in a little more and it was this time that I found out we needed to move house, although I didn't need to move school. It basically continued this way for a few months until we moved. I hated and still hate the new house.
I moved up a year and then I couldn't go in. The summer passed and I couldn't go in, much like the previous year. I started to not trust my family or myself, my medication stopped and I started to feel worse. The summer before the one that just happened I started therapy that helped a bit. But it stopped a year after it started.
I got worse. I started to doubt that my gf really liked me and soon after broke up with me, it destroyed me.
I have always been a night owl but now I can't even get tired until like 1am and it still takes me like two hours to actually get asleep. I started not telling my family everything because I didn't and still don't really trust them, I think they are trying to kill me even though I know it's dumb, I started thinking about killing my mum or dad. I started hitting my head against the door of my room when no one was looking, I started feeling not real and luckily I only feel that a little now. I only have one good friend now as me and my gf shared all of our friends and as I didn't go in I don't think I'm very good friends with them. My best friend goes to a different school and his parents hare my for stuff that happened over a year ago.

When I found out from my therapist that I couldn't get the evidence from here I had a meltdown which I don't think I've recovered from. In fact I know I haven't. 

I feel hopeless, I don't have any hopes for the future. I have a loving partner of 5 years and I do want that to continue for the rest of my life but.....small part of me is scared that if we ever had kids together that I would be an awful mother just like I'm terrible at being a functional human being. I had my first mental breakdown going into my 3rd year of University, and I feel like my ambitions ended at university which was something I had always wanted to do. I feel like I have nothing in my future except my own disappointment at how I've amounted to nothing. The things that usually distract me don't have the same effect the past few weeks and they are doing less and less for me. 

I had an awful thought this morning. I've been preparing and planning to get christmas gifts for friends even online ones from overseas I have known for a long time and spoken over video chats to. But this morning it felt like all of this was kind of my final send off. Like my subconscious is planning for this to be my last christmas. Even though I had no plans to kill myself but that thought hurt me really deeply. 

And during the day today I kept thinking about cutting myself with a knife. I'm so terrified that I'm getting worse again. I don't wanna be this way forever but I can't seem to pull myself out. I want to write sometimes I get ideas but I can never get them down. I wanna do calligraphy which I liked but I can never concentrate for long enough to do anything meaningful.

Sometimes I even stay awake the whole night because I can't bring myself to get ready for bed and to go to sleep.

79,"Posted this somewhere else but got comments from insensitive close minded people. I feel people on this sub will be more understanding. 

I have been having a hard time with my depression lately and have been thinking about a lot of things. What led to me discovering emotional neglect was trying to figure out why it is so difficult for me to ask for help instead of self sabotaging myself. I feel weak if I ask for help but in turn I end up making things worse which makes me angry at myself. I'm quick to help others through their problems and put their needs first. I don't like seeing other people in pain especially those I care about. 

My childhood wasn't bad per say. I did go through a lot with issues with my mom, father, and losing people I love starting at a young age. I was raised by my mom. She struggled but did her best to provide for my brother and I. What I'm realizing now is that she wasn't there for us emotionally. I grew up in a family that would fight and argue a lot. No one really ever showed affection. My mom was very strict on us. She was especially critical of me if I made mistakes. She always said that I was the smart one and held me to a high standard. 

I never talked to my mom about how I was feeling or if I was upset. I never felt that I could. It never crossed my mind growing up to talk about emotions. I honestly can't remember the last time she told me she loved me. If I ever brought this stuff up to her in the future she'd probably call me dramatic and ask why I was complaining

Then the next day I'm a flamboyant gay transgender person. Like, what the actual hell.

81,"Throughout my childhood, I always struggled quite a lot socially. As a scrawny, nerdy Asian kid, I was desperate to find a girl and it made me bitter as hell even by middle school. I was constantly a jealous scumbag and would go out of my way to try and screw over people who I felt were making fun of me or dating the girls I liked.

Things picked up towards the end of high school, as I found personal development materials online (Tony Robbins, Real Social Dynamics, etc.) I started having very little trouble with girls as my blind, self-development fueled confidence carried me through to college where I was fortunate enough to get into an Ivy League. I felt invincible. 

College had its ups and downs, but was overall a successful time. Got myself a high paying job right out of college, found true friends that are with me to this day. (Something I had never experienced before)

The problems really started senior year when I ended the best relationship I ever had. I realized that throughout my successful 3 years, I had become very complacent. Why go talk to other girls when I have the perfect girl right here? Why do all this social dynamics wizardry when I had all my best friends right here? Why continue stressing myself out with work when I already had a dream job?

It all came crashing down after the relationship ended and I graduated. Now, my friends are all in relationships (started around the time of my aforementioned one, but they continued), so no one wants to go out. Being in NY with a 80-90 hour work week leaves little room/energy to go out and little opportunity to easily meet people. I talk to a few girls but my social ineptness has returned and I no longer have the courage/energy to scheme like I used to.

 I’m sinking deeper and deeper into a depression that I shouldn’t have because objectively, my life is fucking great. But personal development material feels stale now. I’ve become bitter and cynical again, and I can’t foresee the next time I would feel okay again. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to get out of this rut.",07Nov2018,1

(eg: i'm a TA at my university and yesterday i couldn't talk without cursing every sentence in front of my section. like an extensive amount where it was getting humiliating but i just couldnt control it). i'm also usually pretty reserved and like to stay at home but every night lately i have been wanting to be social and see friends or even acquaintances every night. (more examples of things ive done that are out of character: last week i drove 2 hours to see an older guy who i havent seen in \~3 years, just to see him for a few hours and drive back the next morning. and last night i was offered cocaine, which i havent done in about two years, but i just couldnt say no. i normally would not do this. a few hours later after coming down all i wanted to do was clean and do laundry and shower and start my day. at 3 am.) also random but i dont know if its relevant: ive always HATED making any kind of art, or doing anything creative. i have never voluntarily created art unless it was school related. but the other day i had such a strong urge to paint and do that so i just went to the store and spent $50 on canvases and paint and brushes. idk why i just felt like i needed to do it and kept getting so excited thinking about it. which normally gives me the opposite reaction.

ive always had mild anxiety (part of the reason for the prozac prescription) but only recently have i started noticing physical problems related to it. the main problems are i am constantly sweating. (i had to take three showers yesterday because i am constantly worried my sweat will be seen or smelt). ive also never been very shaky, but lately i'll be doing something simple like writing notes, but my hand will start shaking so hard i cant hold the pencil or write anything. i'm embarrassed to reach for something in front of other people because i'm scared they'll see me shaking and say something.

I have bad PTSD because of my childhood. I'm 24 and am on disability due to PTSD, Bi-Polar, Psoriatic Arthritis, and some other crap. I met my wife online and two years ago she moved across the US to move in with me. I was shooting heroin and amphetamine and drinking a couple gallons of vodka/gin a week. She choked me until I was unconscious and then slammed my head into a SOLID solid wood door. Came to with a concussion and lied about what happened to my Dr... She helped me off drugs and alcohol, only marijuana for PTSD and arthritis.... but now she rapes me. And I hate when I tell people online ""my wife raped me"" and they respond with ""she is your wife, how can she rape you?"" and it just makes me feel like shit. She rapes me just like anyone else rapes anyone else. I said no several times and get up, she won't stop, I'm forced into sex, she says shit like ""I bet you are going to be mad at me for this"" while she is doing it. I told her to pack up and leave, I gave her a month (I don't know why) and then she went to my mom's house (since she isn't from here) for what was going to be a week and then her leaving...

Well the first night my wife was at my mom's house I was fine until I woke up at 12:30am, I was covered in sweat, shaking, feeling like I was 110 degrees, my body hurt, full of fear a fear coming from nowhere. I then got freezing cold, shaking, hurting, then back to heat over and over. I was scared the whole time, I couldn't think straight, I couldn't reason, all I had was fear, discomfort, and pain. I called her and she came back at 5am...

Now its been 3 days and things aren't good. I talked to my therapist and psych and they were saying while my conscious mind is ready for her to leave, my subconscious/bodily instincts are not.

I have been trying to make the best out of it, trying to build up myself and her since it seems like I will be with her for a while but... she doesn't even apologize for raping me or choking me. When I brought it up 30 minutes ago, I was told ""sue me"". I told her to leave, to get out of the house, but she won't. So I am going to go with my grandma for a while today...

I don't want to live anymore. Its between my body torturing me or me living in an environment where I am just waiting to be beaten/raped... I just want to die. Thing is I am scared of failing, so that rules out bridges/water/jumping/cutting/ODing...

97,"I'm not diagnosed with depression, though I believe I've been suffering with it for at least 5 years now. I'm 22. I don't have suicidal thoughts. I have self harmed before, though that was a long while ago and I see how pointless it was now.

I just wish something bad would happen to me.

These thoughts make me feel extremely selfish and like a bad person. I want someone close to me to die, or my girlfriend to dump me, or someone to crash into me badly whilst driving... or just anything to push me over the edge and make me feel anything other than empty despair. Something, too, that I could use as a reason to take some pressure off me for a while.

98,"I've been in therapy on and off since I was around 10. I'm 20 now, and I haven't seen a therapist in several years. I guess I just gave up on it. It always tended to end up as a ""rent-a-friend"" situation rather than proper CBT or whatever. They all asked the standard suicide questions, where ""having a plan"" was the big red flag. I always said I didn't. That's a lie, but I've been suicidal long enough to know that I have the strength to not do it. I always just assumed that if I was honest they'd try to hospitalize me or whatever. That is not an option for various reasons. I'm considering getting back into therapy (need to figure out insurance situation first) but obviously being honest with them would be beneficial. So my question is, what happens when I say those magic words to them? Do they snap into action and call the white coats, or can I just decline inpatient treatment? I'm in the US.",07Nov2018,1
99,"Okay, so premise: i have polycistic ovaries and longstanding depression and anxiety.

I take the POP pill to stop me menstruating (cause otherwise it literally doesnt stop) and for maybe a month or two ive been taking Sertraline.

Now i had breakthrough bleeding, which i accounted for the antidepdessant to be counteracting the birthcontrol but when i spoke to my doctor she said that shouldnt be the case but to wait it out and that it should stop. The only other time whilst taking the birthcontrol that i experienced breakthrough bleeding was when i lost weight... but as far as i was aware at the time i was pretty much the same weight.

Now. Everything online says that PCOS, virrhcontrol and antudepressants can cause weight gain. (I am already 200+lbs and this was something i was very worried about) however when i had recently been weighing myself it had not been in the same place as before (the bathroom had been decorated so i had moved to another spot) however when i put everything back in its original orientation i found that i was around 15-20lbs lighter. And since then have noticed a fairly steady downward trend without the bleeding... im now down from 274(ish) to 246.4 in literally the space of a month. 

Now all my previous attempts to loose weight were only marginally sucsessful and i had to be very strict with myself and would maybe loose 1-2lbs a week... however i have made literally no concious effort to loose weight and yet its falling off.

Dont get me wrong i am in no way complaining! The only thing i can think of to warrant this is the fact that i am sleeping an adequate amount, experiencing zero stress (for literally the first time in my life) and this coupled with the relief of the depression has made me less likely to binge eat/snack and drink alcohol. Thats not to say i dont still overeat, i mean i didnt get this fat purely by chance... im just putting this out there to see if anyone else had the same experience at all?",07Nov2018,1

101,"Title.

So over the last few days my best friend (a girl) has started to act in a way which can only be described as manic. We don´t really know what to do. 

One thing which makes it also a bit more difficult is the fact that she´s always been kinda ""manic""- By which i mean all the things i describe below existed before, but by far not this extreme. This makes it difficult to judge whether she is just really happy and herself, or manic. But all who know her agree that she´s acting different and 4 people independently came to the conclusion that she is maniacal. (I don´t know which term is applicable here.)

Examples:

She will tart up conversations with people all the time. Even when we are in a group/walking somewhere, she will take quite often a chance to walk up and approach a stranger. (She was always outgoing and would soemtimes do this, but not to this extent and only i a person looked really interesting/special.)

She has an insatiable sexual drive. She constanly hungers for sex which results in her going to fetish clubs and fucking several people or picking up somebody random and bringing him home. Her general behavior is also quite sex driven. (She always liked sex and also the concepts of polyamory and stuff. I´d say she had an elevated but healthy sex drive, but this just seems extreme.)

Numbers became very important to her. She associates numbers with everything, her friends, people, events. Will paint them and assign meaning to them and places them in conversations. For example her number is 8 and she met a woman who was 44, 4+4 is 8 so she is her soul mate, because of something something numbers she has aids etc. 

She parties a lot and sleeps little, while still having a tremendous amount of energy. As far as we know drugs are not involved apart from a little alcohol and weed. (Which we try to keep from her.) She partied till the early hours (around 6-8) on thursday, friday, saturday, worked sunday, stayed home on monday and partied yesterday again. She always comes home, sleeps for 3-4 Hours and then gets up again. (Usually after a night of dancing and drinking she´d sleep around 8 hours at the least and also nap during the day.)

She is convinced that she can do anything, and reacts badly/dismissive if somebody tells her to the contrary- Even in abstract ways; like, she says: Nothing is impossible! And i say: Well, filling the void in the universe with sand might be. She insults me.

She started treating me, her bestfriend, like total shit. She is acting cold and dismissive towards me and insults me. This is uncharacteristic for her, usually she is the nicest person in the world. We had our issues at the moment, but her way of dealing with it is far out.

Her Generiosity increased. She gifted me 800€, a homeless guy who brought back her stolen passport was offered to sleep here as often as he wants to, without calling and a bike and stuff. (She is really generous and would often make people gifts; like giving a  homeless guy 20€, or something, but this is far more than usual.)

She also plans and thinks about far more projects than usual.

And she is very happy, of course.

So this sounds manic, doesn´t it?

This all started around thursday/friday, but it could be argued that in the time before it slowly increased to this levels. Before this she was on a long and nice holiday with a friend and before this she broke up with her boyfriend and now is the first real time being single and back at home.

But what to do? It´s so exhausting with her, it´s tearing me apart and annoying the others greatly. It´s also a shitty situation because she seems so happy and fullfilled; You know, kinda like she always wanted to be, but it´s so sudden, so much and so strange that there have to be some issues there.  Its also shitty cause, you know, to a lesser extent she has been wild and like this all her life, so it´s hard to judge.

But what could we do? We live in germany, btw. Right now we are planning a conversation where two of her best friends will tell her our concerns in a quiet and safe situation. But we also heard/know that it´s very hard to convince manic people that something is wrong-",07Nov2018,1
102,"It went okay, actually. It took a few minutes but I was comfortable with the therapist and we bagan with her asking about my new tattoo. That kind of opened it up since he (The Pyro) is a direct representation of myself...and I explained everything to her. I totally spilled my guts and heart out to her. I opened my mouth to tell her only that I like this character from a game online...and it all just started tumbling out. Everything--why I do what I do, what it feels like before, during and after, my intense love for it...even how I have long suspected that I am High Functioning Autistic (she thinks so too)...and how our 3 boys have the same thing and our 2 girls don't. It was fascinating talking to her.  


I asked her what was written in my chart now, and she said "" Disruptive Impulse Control and Conduct Disorder""...that is the LONG name for it. I looked her straight in the eyes and said ""Well, is this exactly what I am THINKING it is?"" She looked back at me and said ""Pyromania."" Yep. Confirmed (again). She had spelled it out too before that...and that hurt for some reason, as it also did when she said it. I got that pit of the stomach drop thing, even though I have long been writing it here. To actually hear it is another story I guess. She doesn't have a CLUE about this disorder. I could tell. I hope she does some research. Of course, I can tell her whatever she needs to know about this, but that wouldn't be any fun, right? I know the DSM-V Criteria by heart (and I fit every single one of them to a T) and I know exactly the behaviors typical of it. The only thing that I have problems expressing well are the actual feelings. I tried to tell her the best I could, and I couldn't stop myself from smiling when I told her how I feel when I see the flames and smell the smoke and feel the heat. I am sure my eyes were shining then. I get so excited from just thinking about it, though right now, the feeling is dampened from talking so much about it. My urges are very quiet so I am going to go rest.  


I just wanted to come here and tell y'all how it went. I made another appointment with her for Dec. 6th so yeah, I am going back. I am actually exhausted from walking twice this morning, and then from talking for an hour.   


FML...never thought this would be happening to me. This is something straight out of Stephen King (my favie author btw)...or out of a horror flick. Why me? \* Sigh \* I am going to rest now. Bye!!",07Nov2018,1
103,"My reactions when anything goes wrong in my life are so over the top and extreme. I just spent an hour screaming at the top of my lungs because my phone won’t charge. I heard one of my neighbors in my apartment open their door just to see what the fuck was going on with me. This happens to me so often and I know my anxiety can turn into anger but why is it a full blown rage?? I shriek, scream at myself, throw things, slam the walls. Why the fuck am I like this???? I just can’t control it I’ve been like this since I was kid and it hasn’t improved at all. Is this a sign of a more serious disorder? Does anyone else have insane anger issues like me?",07Nov2018,1

So in conclusion I've slept another day away and gotten nothing done. I have to many assignments to count. They are all due this or next month and I've barely started. I keep worrying but never actually do anything about it. The thing is that I can confidently say that I'd rather die than do badly in school. It's the one chance I have in life and I refuse to fuck it up. I'm gonna get out of this godforsaken place and study chemistry or math or something and I'm gonna get really fucking good at it. Then I can get a shitton of money and do whatever I want, move to Australia or Kuala Lumpur or buy my own bouncy castle or whatever I want to do. I won't bother with that romance shit, it's not worth it. And then maybe I can see what everybody else sees in life.

There's also...something else bothering me. I can't say it here because I'm gonna get downvoted into oblivion if I do. I'm just wondering if my, uhm...old habbits...are coming back.

105,"I went to the hospital because I was going to commit suicide but I called my mom last second and went to the ER.

106,"I’ve dealt with a lot of memory issues throughout my life (22F) but I’m not sure if some of it is just normal/standard problems most people have, or indicative of larger mental health issues. I’m just going to list a few items and I would appreciate it if anyone would chime in answering whether or not they experience the same thing.

1. Is it normal to often experience a sort of emotional disconnect from your memories, after they’re more than a few days old? Like I can remember the facts regarding my mindset and feelings, and even my first person sensory experience of many things (what I was seeing, hearing, tasting, etc. as if I was there again) but I can’t ever connect with what I was actually feeling. It’s like I was a Sim or something. I just remember the logic behind my actions and the way things played out.

2. Is it normal to not remember pretty much anything before age 12 or so? I remember facts of experiences, but have no actuall recall of the events.

3. Is it normal to feel disconnected/unrelated to younger versions of yourself. When I look at a photo of me, even from just two or three years ago, I feel like I’m looking at a stranger. I know it’s me, but I can’t relate to the person in the photo at all or recall what it was like to look in the mirror and see that person looking back. It’s even worse with childhood photos.

4. Is it normal to feel like who you are at your core is completely different than who you were just a year or two ago, and to have this experience repeatedly every one-two years?

5. Is it normal to feel as though there are two “you”s. One that does everything in the moment, and one that analyzes it all later and understands the logic and reasoning behind the in-the-moment one’s actions. And to feel like that in-the-moment you is who everyone thinks is you, but the analyzing you is the real you?

Also, this one is optional but semi-related and mainly aimed at people who don’t have an inner monologue (I don’t either.)

1. Is it normal for you to only experience internal monologue when you’re high (weed), and otherwise experience no monologue or pictures when thinking but instead just an instantenous knowledge/sense/understanding that lacks form?",07Nov2018,1
107,"I've (19M) always felt something was a bit off with my emotions. I've always found them hard to describe, so I'll try my best.   

First, I feel like I'm not empathetic. Can't talk to people when they vent or cry because I never know how to respond other than ""that sucks"". Sad stories can bring down my mood, but that's about it. I don't show an emotional response to these things. I was recently hospitalized, almost died (a stretch depending how you look at it), and diagnosed with Crohn's. I was able to shrug everything off, no problem. Wasn't thrilled with the Crohn's diagnosis and that even made me a little angry/frustrated, but that didn't last long. Crying? Out of the question. I would say I haven't cried in years (at least 4 or 5), but I had a stress breakdown during a colonoscopy prep at the hospital. Haven't experienced a feeling like that in years.  

Regarding other emotions, everything sort of feels numbed. I don't really laugh. I wouldn't say I'm ever really happy (I feel like I have to fake happiness when I get gifts. I'm thankful but you won't get much of a response.) I don't get sad. I feel like I do experience a normal amount of anger though. I'm great at containing it, so I can't say I remember the last time I've had a meltdown, but getting pissed from continuous frustration is no problem. Overall I'm just content with everything. It's hard for something to really bother me. I either like it or shrug it off. I would be interesting see a psychiatrist about this, but it doesn't seem significant enough to warrant a visit given I'm fine with it.   

There's a set of things in the past that seem to directly relate to this, so I wonder how much of an effect they've had: When I was younger, I was pretty sensitive. Family members would always bust my balls (which since I was younger, felt like picking on me) for crying. And one event has always seemed to stick with me since high school: During one of the stranger drills where everyone had to stay silent, classmates were able to make me giggle and laugh while their actions were silent, resulting in me getting in trouble and separated. This sits in the back of my mind apparently since I'm able to remember it. Also in high school I suppressed all feelings I had for crushes. Never told my friends, never told my crushes. Kept my mouth shut. Years later, you have where I am now. 

**Do you guys think this is along the lines of depression? Or is this something else resulting from constantly bottling *every* emotion?**  

Kind of related, but I've always felt like being under the influence of drugs makes a more ideal me, since certain drugs fix this. On alcohol, I'm quite empathetic. Love talking to people, I get more touchy (not sexually, more of a friendship/happy sort of response I guess.), stuff you'd never see me do sober. Psychedelics like 2C-B and LSD make me more empathetic too. Of course it gets difficult to communicate properly in those states, but I could definitely open up while on those substances.

108,"I just kinda need to rant for a minute here...

I'm 26. I've had mental health issues for over a decade. I've taken (still do) meds, done therapy (currently trying EMDR), seen countless doctors.

I honestly don't know what I'm currently diagnosed with. In the past it was simply vague depression, and anxiety. 

I'm absolutely sick of having no pleasure in life. I used to do all forms of art and eager to pursue higher education and work hard. All of that has completely shit the bed for the most part. Rarely I get really into a project or a hobby or even furthering my education. It doesn't last though and I end up completely crashing after sleepless nights, hardly eating, and just going non-stop. I honestly like it, I feel like I'm actually experiencing emotion and I usually accomplish quite a bit. 
Now sometimes I'm a complete fool whilst going about on my merry way, I've fucked some shit up big time and put myself in debt and my relationship with my s/o has had such strain.

But mostly I'm numb. I'm not happy. Not sad. Just meh. I will literally just sit and stare at the walls. I don't enjoy socializing. I don't enjoy being touched nor desire intimacy. I just wanna hang out and pet my dogs. One of which I had to say goodbye to and it was the first time I've cried in idk how long. But even that was brief. And not feeling the grief has me really frustrated with myself.

I don't work. I fuck up every opportunity when I do. I'm terrible and awkward around people. I've tried working jobs that didn't require as much human interaction but I usually get in one of these 'moods' and quit. I once left a steady reliable retail job to go be an exotic dancer. And because my people skills are so ridiculous I got fired for not bringing in the fat stacks.

So yeah. Anhedonia. It's a real bitch. I see my doctor sometime this month and I know I need to go full disclosure on some shit with him I've held back from, it's a lot to cram in our 15 minute visits. 

I just needed somewhere to put this. Maybe someone can relate. Share your struggles, share your success, tell me about getting a pill stuck on the back of your tongue and the ridiculous faces you make, tell me about your dogs-- it's a lonely feeling world sometimes&lt;3",07Nov2018,1
109,"I have chronic depression and I’ve been dealing with an episode since September. I’m a sophomore in community college and I’m only taking one class this semester.

115,"  

I apologize in advance for this being such a long post, but I feel like there was some background needed.

About two years ago, I injured myself and my sister in a car accident. I was a new driver and I had exited off the highway in a panic and gave myself no time to slow down, so that when I hit the breaks the car spun out of control and I smashed into the guard-rail, totaling the car. I fractured my nose, suffered extreme whiplash and a severe concussion, and my sister severely sprained her ankle and had a small crack in her chest bone. I now know that depression is a symptom for those recovering from a concussion, but at the time I had no idea and I didn’t bother to tell my doctor about any of the feelings I was experiencing… mostly because I had felt very similar to that even before the accident.

I had/have no friends and I felt/feel that my family is unsupportive of me. At the time of the accident, I was inconsolable. I blamed myself, and still do, for injuring my little sister. I remember thinking that I probably didn’t deserve friends and that maybe, since I looked like shit, it was probably a good thing my boyfriend hadn’t really been visiting at all. I remember thinking, during my isolation that I should have just died in the accident and I was a little frustrated that I didn’t. 

There was something about my accident that just triggered excessive feelings of anxiety and depression that I can’t seem to shake. Mind you, it was hard enough before that, but I feel as though I am overwhelmed regularly these days and that maybe I don’t know how to deal with it as I had before.

More recently, I’ve been butting heads with my youngest sister (not the one who was in the accident with me) and she has been extremely ruthless. I have since learned (via my spiteful younger sister) that my family members actively avoid interacting with me and that no one likes me. I’ve always had a poor relationship with them, to begin with, but I have been actively trying to change that for the past year. 

I feel like my negative interactions with my family just bleed into all my relationships and are probably the reason that I have no friends. I am so scared of interacting with anyone because I feel like I always say the wrong thing and that people always take what I say some other way than what I intended. Everyone in my family always labels me as rude and mean, even though I try very hard not to be those things. I feel like I should maybe just isolate myself from everyone and just be alone, where I won't be able to offend anyone. I have even started avoiding people at work so that I don't have to talk to anyone, if possible.

I can’t help but think that if their default reaction is to say that I am mean and rude, that I must be a terrible person and I don’t know how to fix that. I don’t know where to go or what to do and I have no confidence in myself or my abilities and I just don’t see the point in anything anymore. I just wish that a truck would run me over or something.",07Nov2018,1
116,"I'm going to try to pour my heart out here, so thank you so much if you stick with it through to the end. Anyway...

I’m a 19-year-old male. I’m lucky enough to live in a first world country, in a good town surrounded by friends and family who love me. But life’s had this weird feeling of pointlessness to it since around my 18th birthday.

Let me preface this by saying that I would never, **ever** kill myself. One of my old friends from school did so last month and it hit me hard, and continues to do so. I can’t imagine how the people closest to him will feel for the rest of their lives. It would be so selfish of me to do that to the people I love. I should also say that I often think this negative thinking is merely a symptom of something else, and believing I have an illness is a way to continue my laziness and is insulting to people who have to deal with this sort of struggle. I apologise if so.

That being said, I don’t know if I’d be all that bothered if I knew I was going to die tomorrow. I don’t know if I’m depressed either. I just have no aspirations or fulfilling responsibilities in my life, at least I don’t think so.

I was the youngest of my class in school, and got reasonable grades. In my high school, you were more or less expected to apply to University if you did. It was just the done thing. Being 16 at the time, I didn’t think about it much and figured University would be a good way to continue to not think about my future, and what my goals were in life. I didn’t know what I wanted as a career then and I still don’t. Nothing “sensible”, anyway. I just had a few basic, short jobs before University.

The subjects I applied for were simply the ones I found easiest in school, the ones I could pass with little to no studying. The majority of my first year I was under the age of 18 so I couldn’t go out or do things with my dorm mates most of the time, although I didn’t really mesh with them well so that probably didn’t matter. I stayed in my room, on the computer. My sleep schedule got completely messed up. I spent so much time glued to the news during 2016, which may have been a factor in my mental state. About halfway through the year, I started skipping lectures because I knew I could half-ass it and get away with a C or a B since it was first year. As the year went by, I started getting more and more concerned that I was locking myself down a path I hadn’t thought out. My tuition fees would be wasted. One of my courses required me to spend a year living in a foreign country, away from home. That terrified me. This was the lowest point I’d been in my life mentally. So I ran away. My parents, as always, were concerned but supportive. I’ve been in their house since.

I’ve spent the year and a bit since going through various creative media ventures online, earning several hundred pounds but not nearly enough to sustain a living. It’s the one thing I am certain I can do good at, not half-ass, be enthusiastic about and see to the end. But it’s not safe, it’s not realistic, and it’s not inspiring confidence in the people that care about me.

I’ve talked to a family friend about career choices, and have settled on a college course that feels like an improvement to my previous choice, but not something I’m sure I’ll be inspired by. It just had to be something. I fear I’m doing the wrong thing again, but I also know I’ll be sitting on my ass and just doing creative stuff if I don’t make a choice quickly. I have a big problem with apathy and feeling sleepy all the time, but I don’t know why. My sleep schedule is still messed up.

I feel like I’m taking advantage of my parents, but at the same time I can’t muster up the conviction to do something about my situation. I don’t want to have a family because of the amount of money and dedication required, as well as the world’s growing overpopulation issue. I’m not desperate for my own house, a room is just fine for me and my year in university dorms was the loneliest of my life. I have no career path I want to aspire to other than to entertain people and interact with them. I’m pretty sure my ideal partner doesn’t exist. I don’t have much to offer to the world beyond being a person that exists and will talk and listen to you. My current view on life is that everyone’s memory will fade eventually, so it’s best to coast along for as far as you can, avoiding stress for as long as you can, until you pass on to whatever’s after death. (I like to think it’s something positive.) I know it’s not healthy.

I probably didn’t have to write all of that, but I’ve not summarised everything to myself in writing before. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. If you made it through all of it, thank you sincerely. It takes a certain kind of person to read through a total stranger’s problems in an attempt to help. I’ll try and summarise my questions here:

1. Do I need to see a doctor?

2. How do I motivate myself to care about my future?

3. Am I a selfish person? (I personally think so) If so, how do I improve this mindset?

Thanks again. :)",07Nov2018,1
117,"For example, I will overthink on if I should include 1 exercise (out of 4) for arms for example in the gym to the point where I stress so much I cant think of anything else. If its not that its what is the perfect breakfast to eat  or weather I should be drinking milk or not.

I have always been this way, it is just little things for example when I used to play call of duty I would spend most of the time obsessing over what class to make instead of enjoying the game or in work instead of being productive I am searching for some magic perfectly efficient way to do things.

My whole life weather it be food, work, gym, relationships.. I latch on to something little and it consumes me and stresses me out how can I fix this?",07Nov2018,1

119,"Hi everyone. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. I’m a 23 year old male, recently had my first panic attack. I went to the hospital because I thought I was dying. Ever since then, my anxiety has gotten worse and worse, and while I don’t have “physical” panic attacks often, I still experience the mental side effects. I’m scared that I’m losing my mind and it’s ruining every aspect of my life. I don’t go out anymore, I’m normally an A student (my grades have gone to shit) and I have trouble even working. I feel like I can’t get a grip on my thoughts, and I often have an intense “Deja-Vu” like feeling. A general sense that something is very, very wrong. I feel detached from myself and terrified. I’m stuck taking Xanax prescribed to me by my family doctor until I’m able to see a psychiatrist (about a month from now.) 

Losing my mind is my biggest fear/phobia, and it feels like it’s happening. This just doesn’t FEEL like anxiety. I’m so scared. Anyone have any words that may help? Don’t know what else to do. ",07Nov2018,1

123,"I love my dad very much but I also have so much anger towards him for how he treated me when I was a teenager. I don't want to be angry any more. I want to forgive him. It's hard because he doesn't recognise that he was in the wrong. I think I blame him for mental health issues that I have, whether that is fair of me or not I don't know. I constantly feel that if he hadn't done what he did and behaved the way he did towards me then I wouldn't have anything to be this unhappy and angry over. He introduced a lot of negative emotions into my life that I shouldn't have to feel. That said, I know he loves me and he helps me so much in other ways. It's such a hard and draining feeling to feel so torn about someone. He's my dad and I want to be able to forgive him and I don't want to be angry, but it's hard when he will not verbally accept what he did was wrong and apologise. Any suggestions?

124,I am 192 lb 16 year old girl ( ik im rlly fat lol) and my weight and body always stood out to me ever since i was eight even when i wasnt fat. 5th grade to 7th grade i even started working out excessively checking out the mirror and everytime i ate a meal a wave of guilt consumed me. There was a day in 6th grade where i felt this huge stabbing pain in my stomach because i was trying to lose weight by not eating By 7th grade my depression and anxiety took over and i started over eating and binging   i gained so much weight i always kept an eye on this and felt terrible about it. And the times i tried to do something about it i never really wanted to do healthy eating i just wanted to deprive myself of food altogether and feel hunger. I know i need to lose weight but i feel like i cant because i might go down the wrong road. Words cant explain how much anxiety i get when i am on a diet My mind is always fixated on what i ate the whole entire day to the point where i cant concentrate on anything i am daydreaming of exercises i want to do when i go home and guilt and shame consumes me for putting something in my mouth i want to lose weight so bad but if my mind and my feelings will be like this all the time in the process then id rather just be obese lol i am kinda scared to post bc i feel like someone here will be mean to me but i have no one to talk about this to idk what to do about it really :/ ,07Nov2018,1
125,"I am 25 years old and currently doing a Master’s degree in Computer Science. I am at a point where I like my program and my supervisor (most days), however, sometimes I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt, shame, and a feeling that I don’t belong here and messed up my life by choosing to study in another city.

About 8 months before moving, I fell in love with my current boyfriend in my hometown. I was clear about my plans to move and we had decided to try long distance. We have now been dating for 2 years. So far, we are great at long distance. We make time for regular visits and we skype lots.

The original plan was for him to move to be with me after one year. But that didn’t happen. One night, we were lying in bed, and he told me that he couldn’t picture his life not living close to his grandparents and parents, because family is the most important thing in the world to him. I told him it was okay and that he didn’t have to move if he wasn’t ready, besides, he didn’t have a job lined up in my city or anything. I don’t want to make him do something he doesn’t want to do. And I don’t think he genuinely wants to move.

To make him happy I would basically have to move back to my home city. And my hometown isn’t a bad place, but it doesn’t have nearly the career opportunities that I have in my current city. No where close. And my career is important to me.

Sometimes I feel like my decision to go back to school put me ‘behind’ in life. My baby brother recently got engaged and my sister, who is only a year older, bought a house and has been married for 2 years. Most of my friends are financially successful. Meanwhile, I can barely make rent. I’ve been in 2 serious relationships but have never lived with a significant other, and even though I feel like I’m ready and it’s time, circumstances as they are, it’s not a possibility. My boyfriend is 2 years younger than me and I'm not totally sure he feels the same way, a lot of his friends have actually never had a girlfriend.

Anther issue is that there are a lot of stressed out, angry, isolated and depressed students in my program and I feel like somehow I have become the person they talk to about their problems. Most times it’s fine, I was always the person to listen to others problems in my own friend group, but nowadays I find myself staying home from the uni so that I can avoid being supportive to my peers. I just can’t deal with their problems alongside my own feelings. Staying home makes me feel guilty, like I’m not working hard enough, even when I AM actually doing research work at home. It’s a vicious cycle.

This stuff has been eating me alive for about a year and a half now. I can't picture the future of my life and have lost a lot of motivation. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy. I also don't really know if my issues are serious enough for therapy and what a therapist could do to help me.",07Nov2018,1

127,"So, I have social anxiety and somedays I'm okay while other days I struggle.When things get really bad I always try my best to calm down and not panic immediately.However, at work I felt the most intense fear I have ever felt in my life.I tired to calm myself down by taking some breaths but it wasn't working so I decided to let the feeling pass like it would sometimes do.It wasn't passing and I was starting to  losing feeling in my limbs so I decided that maybe I needed to go home.I checked the time and noticed a whole hour passed since that bout of intense fear. I freaked out even more because it felt like  minutes.What was even more terrifying is that I ringing up any customers without any memory of doing so and the store all of a sudden was crowded.After I was finished I immediately told my supervisor I was feeling sick and went home.Now I scared that what happened wasn't normal.I know my explanation is shitty but I don't remember what happened during that hour all I remember was the fear.",07Nov2018,1
128,"this is a weird post to write compared to my other ones because I'm not entirely sure this has to do with mental health even though I do have depression/anxiety.

but I tend to get bored of things easily and then I get discouraged when i feel like I have nothing. I've done more things in a day than most people get to do in their entire lives and while I am grateful i wish I could find a career that I want to stick with.

I went to school for acting and did that for a few years and it was fun but I got bored of it so I then moved on to be a writer and even self published a book and had a few of my own blog websites and made some good money as a freelance writer but once again i got bored of it so i shut down my shop and stopped writing. I hosted a radio show and a few podcasts which I loved but again got bored of them and stopped doing those. I have worked with musicians for many years and took an adventure in the music business which I still do currently but I'm once again starting to get bored of it.

I love doing things for awhile but then get bored of them. The passion never really goes away but I no longer want to keep doing them consistently and because I live alone I need to make extra money somehow. it's hard for someone who lives alone to just quit their only job and leave themselves broke.

I'm just wondering if there's a way I can not get bored of things so easily or is it just because even though those were my hobbies I haven't truly found my career passion yet? Also, no I will not post any of my old work because this post is not about me trying to self promote my stuff.",07Nov2018,1

135,"Im not sure where to start. Ill talk about my situation right at this moment.

The past 3 years i was with a man who abused me. It was pretty bad i think. It was physical and mental and I became a shell of myself I'm not sure what happened or why i stayed. I am 23 and he was my first official and sincere bf i guess. We always stayed friends and i tried to help him with his mental health even after we broke up. This summer we didn't talk for 2 months (he ignored me it was messed up. he had said he wanted to be with me and try to change..but then we got in a small fight over my blood test results; i was upset i may be pre-diabetic but he congratulated me for it, saying its good its nothing worse, i can exercise it away. Mind you im very thin, athletic, and eat healthy. I said idk what to do since i already did all the things he suggested. He kept pushing and i said he wasn't a doctor and right away he ignored me again for 2 months without saying bye or anything).

Well we became friends again when he moved back to town, and eventually started dating again. No one knows because Im scared that ppl will be disappointed in me. He has been kind, like he has changed, caring for me when i was really sick last week. I feel as if i am the abusive one now. Something bad happened last night; we were studying late at a coffee shop and we were ready to leave but i still had some of my drink left. I told him wed leave after i was done since he was ready. Well i was drinking it and he asked for ""are we gonna go soon?"" And he said i snapped because maybe i did. I had replied, ""Dude, let me finish my beer"" or something like that. I didnt think i said it too loud but he got upset i snapped and i said sorry but we got in a fight over it because he said that hes being soo nice to me lately why i cant i work harder to do the same. And thats when i got upset. I said im glad you are nice to me NOW. Then said sorry. He dropped me off at home and was upset with me. After that i FREAKED OUT. I mean i havent done this in so long, years, but i kicked his car and when i got home i kicked my door in anger and i had a panic attack really bad i couldnt stop so i cut myself and i havent done that in so long either. I mean I couldnt even control myself. I told him how i felt and what i did and he said to see a therapist again since i reacted to something so trivial. I was freaking out so bad i couldnt breath so i had to drive to him to sleep there since i couldnt be alone. (i dont really have anyone else in this town)

THEN, today he kept talking politics with me. He kept saying my stepdad said this and i believe him type thin. (stepdad is super conservative and doesnt even like black ppl lol). And i said that his stepdad was full of bs and i dont like the stuff he says it makes no sense, that i had to stop talking becuse i have an 8 page essay due tomorrow. He just got up, left, and texted me that i needed to work on myself because he couldnt be around me. All i said was ok, i understand. B/c i do, im not ok and i wouldnt want to be snapped at or whatever either. 

I feel like i abused him. and im scared, i cant think or function, i just want to drink because my panic attack was so bad, i hate myself for cutting, and i cant tell anyone about this. I feel so guilty for snapping or hurting this man. Can you please tell me what im doing wrong so i know for sure i need to fix myself. I feel like i cant do this alone but i dont know where to go. I cant go to another therapist until next week, but i think that should be my next step?",07Nov2018,1
