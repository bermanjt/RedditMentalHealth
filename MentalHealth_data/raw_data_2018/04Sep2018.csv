1,"Tl;Dr: Me: 28yo, veteran, ADHD, anger issues. I got angry with my wife. Broke a chair in frustration. Had an epiphany, told her how I've just been angry, and completely irrational the last few weeks. Told her to just leave me alone, act like I don't exist. What is wrong with me? What can I do?

Long Story: I've been full of pent up anger and frustration the last few months. To my knowledge, I am not experiencing PTSD, after 8 years of military service (no combat). But I've been nothing but contained rage the last few months. 

I punched a fridge at work after a particularly ungrateful customer proceeded to verbally eviscerate me. 

I was fixing pipes under my sink, and I just lost my shit when I realized that the people who set up the sink, didn't line up the sink with the drain pipes. Just raged for about a minute. Kicked my toolbox. Ranted about laziness for about 10 minutes.

I accidentally dropped my wife's phone on her foot today, and she was getting ready to bitch me out (she wasn't wrong; I deserved it), but I basically beat her to the punch and just went off on her. Broke a chair, and stormed off. She follows me, and I proceed to bitch at her for being a victim. There is a bit of history there, where she would blow things out of proportion, but this wasn't the same. I fucked up and tried to make it her fault. 

But that was the breaking point. She's crying outside my door, and it dawns on me that this isn't normal\reasonable. And then my mind just unloads, and I proceed to explain to her all my feelings. The deep emotional swamp just drains, and I tell her about how I hate my family, am annoyed by her mother, disgusted by her sister. Every negative thought I've ever had came spilling out of me. I tell her how I resented her behavior when she made 3 suicide attempts early in our marriage. I mean, every single thing comes out. I'm angry at the world, I hate greedy people, I hate thieves, murderers, criminals, etc.

When I'm done, Im just a shell. I tell her to fuck off, and just leave me alone. I love her, but I'm just too angry to love right now. It's been about an hour since we spoke and I don't know how I feel.

Please of you have any mental health advice, maybe even some insight, I need you.",04Sep2018,4,
2,"Okay, uh, howdy- I guess first I’ll start with some background information so this makes a bit more sense. I am a full time theatre and high school student and the head of my theatre’s makeup department, AKA the costume shop soccer mom. Basically I sit on the counters and comfort people (there’s a lot of crying...) and talk about what’s going on in the other departments. I’m also chronically ill and struggle with mobility, on top of the fact that I have nasty mental health issues. 

As of late, both my mental and physical health have been spiraling out of control with no sign of stopping. But I’m here to talk about my mental health so I’ll try to focus on that. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression as of now and have been since 4th grade. Yes, really. I’ve noticed my depression worsening along with my physical state. I wonder why I’m even still here, why I didn’t just end it years ago when I had the chance. I’ve been clean of self harm for two years but I’ve been struggling to avoid it again. The worst part is that I’m hallucinating more then I ever have. As a child I would see things often, but I ignored it. This continued through middle school but I never really mentioned it to my therapist for some reason??? For the past year I’ve been seeing absolutely horrific and just plain weird beings. They just watch and wait, like they’re waiting for the right moment to strike. They never do. I also hear voices a lot. They just scream at me and tell me to do destructive things. I don’t usually comply unless it’s mostly harmless though, but it’s hard to resist.
“Put your hand in the fire. No one can stop you.”
“Burn it... burn it... you can do it.”
“Revenge. They deserve it. Ruin them.”
“Bleed. You need to bleed.”
“Get in the fish tank. You gotta.”
I’ve looked in mirrors and have been completely distorted and foreign. I know it’s not real but it’s always terrifying. I’ve been wanting to tell my therapist but I’m scared and don’t know how to bring it up. Only my mom and my best friend know I hallucinate. 
It’s absolutely fucking exhausting to be both physically and mentally troubled, and have to run a whole department and be a source of support for more than 80 people for 15 hours a day every single day including weekends. I have to hide and pretend it’s okay to take care of everyone else but I can’t do it anymore. I’m afraid I’ll become destructive in some way if I don’t stop but I don’t know how to step down. I rarely share my personal life with others so how would I explain it? It’s heartbreaking but I’m so tired and afraid and lost. If you made it this far I’m impressed. If you’ve any advice I’d love to hear it, or maybe if you have an idea of what’s going on. I suspect I may be schizophrenic, which would cover all of my symptoms but I’ve not officially been diagnosed yet. I see my therapist again next week. Please give me the strength to be honest with her. Thank you all.

3,"I have a question that is very concerning to me. I was admitted into voluntary hospitalization for suicidal thoughts and depression. I stayed there about a week and was released about two weeks ago. I have a follow up with a local behavioral health institute tomorrow and the paperwork says the intake might take up to 6 hours. 

As of now. I have been taking my antidepressants that I was prescribed and I feel much better. But I am concerned that if I am “evaluated” tomorrow I’ll be put back into an impatient program. This all happened in NJ while I was and currently am staying with my gf. I currently live in PA. 

Is there a possibility that this might happen? I was severely scared and depressed that I was put in the unit and barred from leaving. I was only expecting to be there a couple days - not a whole week. 

I’m scared that if I go to the intake evaluation tomorrow they will do the same and this time put me as involuntary (I was explained the difference between voluntary and involuntary at the original point of hospitalization). 

For anyone curious, it’s the Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care Center ",04Sep2018,1,
4,"Growing up as a little kid I never understood why my life was so confusing. I would sit in the car and my dad would go on and on. Money, power, food,relationships, not trusting ppl,etc. ranting on and on. Remind you I was 4,5,6 etc

My dads world revolves around him. I never knew how to enjoy life. Or be a normal kid. I was constantly being yelled at. For stuff I didn’t do. Or critiqued about how I should act/dress etc. You’re the oldest. Acting and modeling you will make money. Fighting in martial arts this is how you defend yourself. I did all that and more at a young age. I was so mentally exhausted growing up. When I told ppl Iv been working since 6 they would be like wtf.

When my father gets drunk it got a lot worse. Yelling at my mom or brothers. He’d throw kicks and punches at us. He would try to put us in submissions. He almost broken my wrist. It’s not funny at all growing up daily doing that shit. 

Anyone that understands mania or bipolar. This is not typical verbal abuse. It’s tangents that did not make any sense. I moved out around 7th grade. I’m 27 now moving back in.


It’s funny I was re adjusting getting comfortable. Reading a book. My dad kicks the door and yells” why aren’t you responding to me!” Pacing back and forth yelling in my face. I had to took a walk for about 5 hours before I threw my head in the wall. It’s been 4 months since I’ve been back to the house.

 I’ll be in the house and my dad will tell me to keep the windows up. I’ll say the windows are up. He’ll yell I meant the car windows!!!! Shit like that!!! 

His ADHD and OCD is fucking bad also. Sleeps at 9pm up at 4am. Running around and won’t stop talking or stretching, washing cloths,etc. Everyday. With a lot of energy 

OCD everything is organized in a certain way. We can’t use the stove because we might burn down the house. Only he can cook. All the knobs are taken off so we are not able to turn on the burner ......... let me remind you I’m 27. 

He also suffers from grandiosity disorder. My father is a only child of lawyers. You see my father grew up with a silver fucking spoon. Cooks/servers,Huge house, nice cloths huge 200 guest parties at the house, etc. The whole 9 yards

His child hood with his grandiosity disorder. He wants to buy property, open a restaurant, open up a shrimp farm, told me to sell my 401k and buy a house, sell my art and start a T-shirt company. This will go on in one car ride.I mean all his fucking ideas in one car ride...Remind you my dad does not work. He depends on my mom for money. Pathetic

I seen someone commit suicide on the freeway. Told my dad. Next week I’m the car a motorcycle flies by. My dad yells “ if he fucking crashes, are you going to save his fucking life also” . Shit like that.....

He’s 5’11 around 200 pounds muscle. so you see where I’m coming from
 
Now that I’m older. I can see I didn’t have a normal child hood. Unnecessary shit.... because of this I suffer from crippling depression. I hope I’m not bipolar because I’ve gotten episodes of euphoric feelings/ high energy and low lows. Thanks for reading

6,"Hi - this is similar to a previous post. 

Lost story short I am a mother of 4 beautiful children and am married to a wonderful man. 

Problem is he became sick three years ago and that threw me down a huge rabbit hole. I told him I resented him being sick having just dealt with the passing of my mother  six years prior. Yes very very b****y  move. 8 months ago the depression got so back that I was yelling at my kids which lead to an investigation by cps. In addition we were having financial issues which I never shared with my husband due to me being afraid of his reaction,even though he asked me to be open with him, and we were being evicted, partially due to the fact that I was so traumatized by my landlord that I didn’t want to tell her there was something wrong with our house. 

10 weeks ago I was hospitalized after having gotten very angry at one of my kids. Cps came in. Cops scared my kids. 
Finally we forced to leave and move to a new city for my husband to get treatment. Husband is disabled and had to manage the move and take care of 4 kids. I wasn’t allowed near the house. 

That being said - I need encouragement here. I am in another city while my husband and kids are in the new home. Hubby and I agreed that I won’t be involved with the kids for another 4 weeks until I am stabilized. This. Is. Torture. I am practicing radical acceptance and respecting his boundaries. 

I’d like to have feedback on anyone in a similar situation or who has had a mentally ill parent(who was working her/his ass off to get better) on how they managed. It’s so hard. I am not giving up. It’s so damn hard and I’m scared that I might crash again (I have a psychiatrist and therapist).

I guess what gets me the most is when people make your mental problem (anxiety,  paranoia,  depression, bpd, schizophrenia)  about them.

A friend gets constantly mad cause ""I'm not around or Available"" and even when I've had fully explain to him my condition, he keeps acting mad or asking me ""why don't you talk to me anymore?"".  I get is hard for people around you to get used to it, and maybe they don't have to get you if they don't want, but when you have explained at least 3 times what's going on in your head..it becomes annoying.

FTP; on mobile; throwaway.

I've been in the worst kind of haze. I can't focus on anything I need to for more than a few moments, and trying to retain any information is extremely difficult. 

For example: I'm studying for an exam and can't remember details of what I've studied the day after, even though I can clearly explain what I've learned after the lesson. It doesn't stick. After a week, I have to relearn it completely. It's getting to the point where sitting down to study and take notes is fruitless, I can't follow along. The best I can explain it is that there's a cloud in my brain. I can't focus worth a darn.

I used to be on Lexapro and Ativan, but I stopped a couple years back. This has been going on for a while and I obviously do need to see a doctor. 

My question is if I go back on the antidepressants will the concentration/memory issues stop? Or is this a separate issue? I have an urgent care where I can get the Lexapro this weekend (earliest available appointment, because I work), but if it's something else it'll take me at least 2 months to see a doctor (their earliest appointment). 

This is really affecting my quality of life, I can't remember conversations unless I write the details down or have some kind of proof. I do fine at work for this exact reason, but I'm starting to spiral.

Sorry if this is long/incoherent. If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

13,"First post here, but I figured it’d be the best place to come. For about a week now I’ve just felt “off”. Very depressed but not really anxious. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to feel normal around people. Usually my depression doesn’t hit me this hard so I wonder if it’s something more? I’ve done this a few times in my life. I’d just like to get to the bottom of this so I can hopefully get ahead of it or get myself out of this headspace quicker.

14,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  I don't know who to turn to, or if I should be worried for my safety but I wanted to ask here in hopes that someone with more experience might be able to help.  I will try and sum up as best I can, but there is a lot, I am confused, and I don't know what is relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend for the last 20 years is now making me fear for the safety of my family.  He's been a part of my life since we were 15 and was the best man at my wedding and I was his.  He's always told me he considers my family his family and we've treated him as such.  About 5 years ago he had major back problems and needed surgery, at this time he got many tattoos and his facebook posts became personal and sometimes hostile.  He was forced to take a leave of absence from his job, he attributed this to a hostile work environment (he is extremely progressive and he lives in a small very rural very republican area).  The week of his surgery his wife decided to leave him, he had no one else to take him so I took the week off of work and let him stay with me.  She claimed he was abusive but she was always kind of strange and a known exaggerator and I just couldn't believe it, I'd known him my whole life.  When he stayed with me he was verbally abusive to me and told me several times that ""he could take me, we aren't kids anymore"".  We've never come to blows in our entire friendship, but I should mention I am 6'5"" and was a bouncer for many years.  I put up with the abuse long enough to get his surgery and help him recover.  A short time later after he called me an apologized profusely.  He said the adrenaline/pain/drugs mixture has made him lose it for a while.  He also told me that he had been diagnosed bipolar, he said the diagnosis came because some drug they put him on for his back made him manic and that is a known side effect if you are bipolar.  Fast forward a couple years and everything is back to normal, and I feel like I have my friend back.  He gets married again, gives me a days notice and I drop everything to be at his wedding.  Him and his wife seem happy and they seem well matched.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 months ago he told me he had been fired from his job and was suing.  About a month ago he calls me from the bar and says he has something important to tell me but he doesn't want it to change the way I think of him.  I tell him he is like a brother and I am here for him but he doesn't want to continue the call.  A few days after that he calls me sober and tells me that him and his wife are bisexual and that they are poly amorous, I told him I was happy for him and I don't know why he was worried.  Everything seems fine.  Fast forward to two weeks ago and him and his wife are getting a divorce.  

&amp;#x200B;

He visited my family on their camping trip (I was away), they were happy to support him and his new lifestyle and be there for him but when he was there he was talking a mile a minute, and had delusions of grandeur.  He again insisted he  ""could take"" my brother-in-law who is the most physically powerful person I have ever met in my life.  My family called me worried.  I called him and he was extremely scattered.  Believes he is a genius who has manipulated events in his life to give him freedom.  Claimed to save a young person from suicide.  Claimed he was going to be a professional in esports.  And a few other things, honestly I was having a hard time following.  He also claimed his ex had people who wanted to hurt him because of lies she had told them.  He said he needed a place to stay and asked if he could stay with my mother (she lives much closer to him).  I told that I care about him and I want to be there for him but that he seems very different and it was scaring me a little, and that I was scared for him.  I told him I was not comfortable with him staying with my mother.  He asked if he could stay with me and that was not possible because (thankfully) my in-laws were visiting.  I told him I was worried about him and would drive to see him next week.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from my mother today that he went to her house and asked to stay with her.  She let him but she was scared, for all the same reasons as have already been mentioned.  Nothing happened but she told him he has to leave tomorrow.  She told me she is worried for me because he keeps comparing our lives (we both had difficult childhoods financially and otherwise) and he said that I have everything he wants and people should share what they have.  I have been successful and live a fairly comfortable life with my wife and young children. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do.  I want to help him but I am also worried he might lose it and hurt me or my family.  Am I overreacting?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

16,"Just want to apologise in advance for formatting as im on my phone. 

For some background, i have experienced a depressive episode roughly 6-7 years ago and struggle regularly with anxiety and stress still.

This year ive begun questioning my career choices as the professors at uni are demotivating and bullies, this means i could have wasted 5 years of study for nothing, ive started a huge research project and feel like im drowning in it. My mum was diagnosed with cancer and cries about not being around to see the birth of her grandchildren (her prognosis is positive but its obviously scary regardless) and my partner of 5 years and i have hit a horribly rough patch. He did a lot of lying and neglecting until recently which really hurt. He moved out after 4 years last week and has been trying to make this a positive growth experience for us. 

Because of what he did i think i decided he was the villain in this story and it was ok for me to take everything out on him as i saw him as the reason i couldnt cope with everything else. 

Ive been on uni holidays now for like 2 weeks and have cried and spent the day in bed almost everyday. 

Yesterday my partner told me he didnt know if he would be gone for 1 week or 4 on an international work trip as they were booking one way tickets and buying return over there. This flipped me out, i felt like as usual he was just leaving me behind and neglecting me (i have a whole bunch of abandonment issues so this is a real hot button). I cried and cried when he didnt understand why this felt shitty to me and told him im exhausted and i just feel like he would be better if i wasnt here, so would my mum. I told him i just want to give up, that i dont want to be dead but im just so tired i want to hibernate. As i have a history of self harm (not since ive been with him) he said he doesnt know if he wants to be with me now because the way i feel is so intense. I feel wrong for telling him that but ive felt this way since january now and it was honest, i just wanted him to understand how fragile and broken i feel. He stayed with me last night but it was very cold and quiet and i dont know if he is still thinking of breaking up with me. 

I know i should get up and try to do things but if youve ever lived with depression you know how much harder this is than it sounds. 
I know our fight yesterday was trivial and i overreacted but i cant help it, ive been in the 'he hurt you so he deserves your anger' mindset for so long i only just realised last night he has changed and is trying and has shown he wants to be with me but i think after telling him how i really feel its too late. I texted him to see if he wants to see me tomorrow or the day after and he hasnt repsonded, i know hes at work so he probably cant but it still makes me panic hes just ignoring me. 

I feel like a big ol' p.o.s cause i feel like im letting mum down who needs me, it hurts her that im upset anyway let alone at this time of her life.
Im scared because ive been here before and im having the self harm fantasies and genuine beliefs that the people i love will be better off without me which i do somewhere deep down know is wrong. 
I have an appointment booked with my psych in 3 weeks as shes sick atm and i start placement next week so scheduling is really hard (cant risk bringing home germs while mum is on chemo). 

Theres no one close to me in my life that understands the true depths of how deep depression can go and i feel i have no one to talk to. I just need someone to get it.

17,"The title says it all. I’ve been cyberbullied by a person on Discord and almost nobody supported me until I came across another server after being banned from the server I was cyberbullied in. Basically, this person wanted to kill my family, torture me, etc. The guy was my friend, and it was pretty traumatic when I saw those posts. He’s been doing that for months even before he posted the torture post. He was a bisexual dude and he usually joked about straight people being bad, betraying and killing people, it’s all dark. He showed off his body and bragged about people wanting to fuck him. That then became a main problem in trying to find support. I’ll just get white knights instead of what I wanted in the first place.

I told my online friends about it (they’re the mods of the server) and they defended him, saying that he never really bullied me and I bullied him back. They then went against me. Even bullying me because I bullied someone who bullied me. 

This is really upsetting, because I was diagnosed with Autism when I was 2, and they made fun of it saying “BE PATIENT I HAVE AUTISM”. Since we are talking disorders now, the bully had ADHD. I don’t think that’ll excuse him from bullying someone, or anyone. 

His first account got banned for sending child porn (he was underage) to random people, and he made a second account which he doesn’t send nudes in anymore. Banning his second account wouldn’t matter though, because a few months his mom found out what he was doing on Discord and took away his phone for years. 

That didn’t stop my friends from making fun of me though, they keep mocking me saying stupid shit I said, saying that I’m pulling the victim card, and even calling me delusional. People also bullied me with the support of mods, and even the owner.

I also put a plead of help on my Steam bio a few months after that, and the owner harassed me saying that he now hates me. Which also led him to ban me from that server.

And now, he’s not even referencing his mistakes he made and won’t allow me to comment on his steam profile (he has a gaming pc and it’s monitored). He puts ironic statements like “Love everyone” or “Be kind” when he called me a asshole a few weeks ago. I commented saying that he’s a “eh” friend and not a good one and that made him delete my comment, which got me to think that he wanted to hide the truth. I told him that and we started a argument.

What happened after that is that I now feel worse than what I was and now I can’t get it out of my mind. It’s a strange thing, having your friends harass you instead of helping you like they’re supposed to do.

I then went to another server in my server list (the one I’m most active in) and told them about what happened. They supported me (which was good for what happened the last few months) and got my back. I told them more about him and decided to post about it here to tell more people about it because I’ve been venting for months about this now.

22,"I don't know if I'm biploar, but it would make a lot of sense. I've made a point not to self diagnose myself, however, that's my therapists job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm trans, I'm like definitely not a guy with a dick, I thought I was a girl until like a month ago, then I just said I was non-binary, but I stare in the mirror and just know that my reflection isn't me. If I stare at my reflection for too long I get scared, in fact, I don't think it's dysphoria, I just get incredibly anxious and have to look away if I stare into a mirror for too long, but I guess that's another story. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post is that I've been happy for a few weeks, ever since I finally managed to get over my ex. I'd been grappling with my feelings for her for over seven months and my gf of three months at the time got fed up with it, and made my ex (who hadn't talked to me since February) tell me to get my shit together, after that what I had been holding on to kind of left and I really looked at my life and decided I was non-binary. I've been feeling good since then... until tonight. Everything was fine until I let myself look really deep into how I felt and I realized that since I split up with my ex I really haven't loved anyone like I did her. We were close friends for months before I asked her out, we would spend hours a day playing video games together, she's the only reason I got back into gaming after a year or so of not being really into it. When we split up I stopped. I have two partners now, and I barely interact with either of them. I don't talk in voice chats with them, and I don't actively seek to meet up with them in real life. I see one of them everyday at school and the other I get to see once or twice a week when our friend group gets together for big parties. I just feel like I really loved my ex and now because she's gone I'm not feeling that love I had for her... and now I'm questioning who I am again and I don't know anything. I don't know if I love my partners, I don't know if I love my ex, and I don't know who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that's why I think I might be bipolar, I was sad for months, then after a single conversation I was happy for a few weeks, and now after thinking a few thoughts I've destroyed my mood and I feel like I'm not going to be happy for a long time.. I'm not looking for a diagnoses, I just need to vent in a place I'm anon.",04Sep2018,2,
23,"I just don't know what to do anymore. I have a big problem with coming to terms with my schizoaffective disorder/bipolar disorder and I need some help. 

First off, the worst part about this is watching myself slowly descend into madness from a dissociated point of perspective. I'm still quite ""there"" and ""with it"" I know who I am and I know what is happening to me over time. It's extremely heartbreaking. I just thought I had so much potential as a person. 

I see things, I hear things, and I obsess over delusional ideas and thoughts. 

I barely function as a member of society. I'm 21 and not even allowed to drive as the psychosis has greatly affected my cognitive function. This was evaluated by my neuropsychologist early this summer. 

These are my medications. If the dosages seem low, it's because I'm a very small female. 5'00"" and a little over 100lbs. 
Lithium - 600mg
Propranolol - 40 mg
Latuda - 60 mg 

I just started latuda so there are high hopes for that. I'm just so tired of the disappointments. My pdoc is very responsive and understanding when it comes to my treatment and I believe he takes me seriously. I just wish I could get motivated and feel better. Sometimes I wish I could end it all but I don't have those kinds of balls. 

My long time therapist is retiring which is a big blow. I don't know how I'm going to deal with all of this without him around. 

Can anyone share their experience with schizophreniform disorders and psychosis? Is anyone living a normal life with these conditions? I'd love some motivation and perspective other than my own.

Anyway... It takes me a very long time to write out a post like this given my condition. I hope it's not too disorganized to understand. And I know things may feel a bit out of order. I am very self conscious of this and the way I communicate. 


TL;DR - I have schizoaffective disorder and I'm having a lot of trouble coping with my reality. Can anyone share their experiences or help me? ",04Sep2018,1,

26,"Sometimes I go through these episodes where I feel triggered by old conversations. That's the only way I know how to describe it. 

It's hard to classify as social anxiety, because I don't feel anxious. Growing up I was pretty shy and nervous, but these days, I have no hesitation walking into a room of people I don't know and introducing myself. I can speak in front of crowds. I can broach emotional and uncomfortable topics with someone one on one. My job often requires me to go into people's homes and ask them serious questions, which is pretty invasive and uncomfortable, and yet I can do that easily. 

In these moments of human interaction, I usually enjoy it. I like connecting with people. But it's after the fact where it really gets to me. I'll lie in bed at night and suddenly remember a completely mundane conversation with someone and have a visceral negative feeling about it, and it almost feels like a flashback. It will get triggered out of nowhere. Like tonight, I saw a Reddit post about horror movies. Suddenly I could see the face of one of my kid clients in my head, probably connected because I know she likes horror movies, and for some reason I'm remembering our conversation about how she wants to be a doctor when she grows up. As I'm remembering this, I feel so stressed and freaked out. I don't know why, nothing stressful happened in that conversation. I just talked to an 11 year old about her dream of being a doctor. 

This happens a lot. Often before bed, but throughout the day as well. I'll hear something or see something, and it will send me into remembering a random social interaction, and I'll suddenly feel really bad about that interaction. It even causes physical symptoms, like a fast heart rate and a tightening of my throat. 

What is causing this and what can I do about it?

27,"First off, I’d like to make it known that I am young, and what I’m feeling may be teen angst, but I want to see if any of what I’m feeling may point to any mental illnesses.


BACKGROUND 

I’m 16 years old, and I’ve been feeling really bad the last few years, getting worse in the last 6 months. When I was younger I had a pretty stable home life but I grew up quick because of my area and friends. My dad was around maybe once or twice a week but then I didn’t see him for a few years. He’s back now but I still only see him a few days a week. I also had a traumatic experience back in 2016, my best friend was shot and killed and it really hit me hard at first, but I remember not really feeling much after the immediate shock. I remember standing in the hospital when they said he was dead but I didn’t cry or let my pain out. I just felt empty. I’ve had that feeling for a while. Sort of a lack of emotions, and empathy. I didn’t want help with it I just wanted to move on and ignore it. I’ve also been held up at gunpoint, but I really wasn’t scared or anything (possibly concerning?) so maybe that experience may have damaged me.

RECENT

In the past 6 months, I’ve been feeling really intense anger and sadness in bursts, especially at night. Other than that I feel really emotionless. Again, that emptiness but a few of my closest friends abandoned me and straight up broke my heart (I don’t know how else to describe it). I don’t really feel good anymore except on rare occasions. I just feel like everyone else is ok and I’m not, even though I know it’s not true that I’m not the only one hurting. The closest feeling I can give to this is a sense of drowning. I also feel lonely a fair bit even when I’m with people cause I don’t really fit in, it’s not that I have a lack of friends or lack the ability to make friends, I just don’t feel I belong in any groups.

I’ve been withdrawing from friends and it seems like no one has noticed, I’ve had sleeping issues (nightmares, unable to fall asleep, oversleeping when I do), and my appetite has decreased to eating once or twice a day.  

At night I get in really bad shape just reflecting on bad things that have happened to me and I’ll think about how much better my life and others would be if I killed myself  would be. I do not think that I’m likely to commit suicide or self harm but I don’t think these thoughts are normal. 

I’d just like for you guys to help me figure out what may be wrong with me if anything is. I’d also like to know how I can get help if I can. I’m not sure how to tell someone I know I feel this way and ask for help. Thanks for your consideration. 

I’m a really bright kid (not egotistical) and have always had real easy time understanding concepts and grades have been straight As my whole life but I get really bored quickly because of the lack of challenges in classes. I don’t really think my school life is effected other than I could probably do even better but I’m fine with where I am there. (Not sure if this is relevant but I thought I should include how my school activities are effected) I also used to really enjoy playing basketball but I don’t enjoy that as much anymore. 

Important Notes:

•Traumatic experience few years ago 
•Feel really empty except for outbursts of sadness and anger
•Can’t sleep, nightmares, sleep excessively when I can
•Lack of appetite 
•Withdrawal from friends/family 
•Suicidal thoughts
•Loss of enjoyment in things I used to enjoy

Most of the time during the day, I feel kind of low. I have a lot of things to do but my drive and willpower are stuck at 0 and it really kills me. But sometimes, I will have a little bust of happinness and motivation. It will probably last 30mins to an hour, and then disappear.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

During those moments, I will be happy with where I am in life, what I have achieved, the friends I have, my family, etc. I will say to myself ""it's all going to be ok"" and believe it.

To be brief, I am a 20 year old college junior who was diagnosed with anxiety and depression two years ago after a crisis that occurred in my personal life. I went in to college without having any friends because my high school friends and I had a massive fallout (a lot of verbal bullying and fights going on) a few days before high school graduation and till this day we haven’t spoken to eachother. It took me a long time to move on from that because I was friends with them since we were 4 years old. I’ve never been divorced since I’ve never been married but what I went through is probably similar to that of a divorce. I went to community college for my first year and struggled to make friends. The people that I’d try to initiate a friendship with never put in the effort in return so I just let them go...I transferred into a university two semester ago and although I’ve been doing well in my classes and I have a part time job, I still feel unhappy and bitter. I feel regret, shame, and sadness all at the same time because my college experience so far has been anything but the “best years of my life.” I just joined a sorority to at least try and meet new people but I’m having a hard time connecting with others because of everything I’ve been through over the last two years. I have a hard time trusting/opening up to others because everyone I’ve met up to this point only cares about themselves...My mom has always told me that it is better to be alone than in bad company but I get so lonely at times that it hurts.

Yesterday was going pretty okay - felt like I was getting through the day without too many obstacles and a general sense of progress and positivity. Then a friend reached out to me to try to support me and it unfortunately backfired and sent me into a really bad spiral. Ended up feeling worse than I have all week (maybe longer, hard to tell).

I slept relatively well, better than usual, but as soon as I woke up it hit me right away. In fact it didn't feel like it had left at all, was just a realisation that it was still there. Immediately felt suicidal and couldn't think of anything else. Was making plans to end it, trying to think of how I might go about it, how to let people know without giving them a chance to prevent it, etc. It just got worse and worse, making me feel like I would never get better.

I was fighting it the whole time - reminding myself of the advice I've given here repeatedly: no matter how bad you feel, get through your checklist anyway. Feel as bad as you want while you do it, but get through that list and then the rest of the day is fair game.

I did my meditation. It barely did anything. I couldn't focus on it properly, but I did it. I wallowed for a bit but forced myself to take the next step.

I did my yoga. Started a new YouTube course yesterday so this session was much lighter than usual (this helped me get through it). Distracted me a bit and got me moving but still felt the same.

I got my running shoes on and did my morning run. This made the difference. I still feel like crap, still have so much to deal with and work through, but I feel like today I am safe.

Just want to say that I put my money where my mouth is and followed my own advice and it may have saved my life today. Thank you to everyone who posts in any of these mental health subreddits - whether you're sharing your good or bad news, giving advice, responding positively to advice given by myself or others: you all helped keep me alive today.

I hope this helps someone to find the strength to get through their routine when things get really tough. Go through your checklist no matter what and weigh everything up afterwards. It only takes an hour, and even five minutes can be enough.

Also he will stomp he's feet back and forth and generally be a loud annoyance. It only ever happens at night though. 

His wife is another story. She makes up lies and she believes them. Claims she went to school to be a programmer but knows nothing of computers. Didn't know what a OS is or what malware is (constantly getting it on her husband's phone downloading apps to give her free wifi) and claims downloading an app is hacking. ""Look I hacked the phone to get rid of the viruses my enemies (her) hacked onto the phone"" and it's a free antivirus app that's really just malware. Even though it's proven she doesn't know anything she *still* says she can fix every problem even tho she has a 0% success rate. Claims to be a Harvard lawyer but didn't know plessy vs ferguson (said she doesn't keep up w new cases) or haebeus corpus is or even what a non disclosure agreement is or what it does. After I taught her what it is she was talking to some1 about their lawsuit and I heard her call it a ""closure agreement"".
             She claims to be the smartest richest person alive. Says she's a trillionaire and owns banks but she can't get into her accounts bc she doesn't have the account #. Says she has a ""perfect IQ and 300% brain function"". She is always talking down to everyone even tho she's a complete idiot who doesn't even have a dollar to her name. The list of claims goes on so much more. For instance she says she's the head of the CIA and shit.
          Says she can see people's souls. She always says her husband has a monkey soul and that's why he goes all crazy at night. I think she hears voices bc me and someone else will be talking and she'll come in saying ""oh so you're going to stab me?!"" even tho we said nothing like that. She claims her soul is ""the speed of light"". She'll sometimes cut ppl down by saying ""you're no one I own banks and have a speed of light soul and you just have an ants soul"".
            She is very mean and hard to be around. She acts like a child. Very immature and throws fits often and will never admit wrong doing.  Lately she's been threatening her husband saying if he doesn't do exactly what she says when she says she's going to have him arrested for beating her tho he doesn't. The list of her crappiness goes on and on. Yesterday she said if he doesn't get her takeout then she would kill and eat his cat. She won't eat food made at home it has to be from a restaurant. We've all begged him to get a restraining order or get her committed but he won't. She's going to get him locked up best case scenario.

This may be a long text post, so if you're not into reading a long, and thought out post, or just have a short attention span, please don't go any further.

The author does ask that if you do read the post in its entirety, and plan on sharing your own answers &amp; thoughts on the problems that the author is expressing, please be civil, polite, &amp; thoughtful.  If you're planning on anything less than that in your response, it would be best if you just didn't respond at all.  Remember the old rule, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it at all"" still applies.

With that in mind, please read at your own risk!  Remember, though, one important thing.  Not everybody has the skills that some other people have in dealing with life.  I would assume, as the author of this text post, that the reason for this subreddit is to provide on a basic level some helpful support to those who either are having a mental health issue, or know someone who does.  As the author of this post, I admit that I'm the one who NEEDS support, especially on how to ask friends of mine for help &amp; assistance, because no one is born knowing all there is to know about every topic imaginable.

Lastly, I welcome all polite &amp; civilized suggestions.  None of that, ""Man the f*k up!"" bullshit.  Or, ""You haven't already tried [whatever it is that may seem easy to someone else, but is still being critical of my life &amp; how I've dealt with it so far!]""  I hate when someone says something that I should've done like I should've already known how, even though my life &amp; my family situations were not exactly a ""nurturing"" environment.  If you need any kind of reference about what my family life was like, think of ""The Simpsons"", ""Married... with Children"", and both ""Family Guy"" &amp; ""American Dad!"", and roll them up into one big Jerry Springer show, and that would have been my dysfunctional, and highly abusive, family members &amp; family structure.

Anyway, I'm ranting, and that is also one of my many shortcomings.  But please, do respond with helpful advice, tips, suggestions, etc.  Even if you think I should've already tried what you may have suggested for someone else, suggest it anyway.  I admit that I haven't tried a lot of things due to multiple disabilities in my life.

Hi all,

So, I wanted to get some helpful information about tips, tricks, suggestions, advice, etc when dealing with multiple health &amp; mental health problems while going to college.

First, let me just give some background information about me.  I just celebrated my 39th birthday last week, and I have multiple disabilities including total blindness in one of my eyes, and I've had some 30+ surgeries on that blind eye in my lifetime.  Seriously, no joke.  I lost count after 15 when I was a senior in high school.  All of that stems from a birth defect caused by Congenital Rubella Syndrome.  I won't go into details how that happened, but if you'd like to know, please private message me, and I'll be delighted to explain.

Due to that birth defect, and having blindness in one of my eyes, I was harassed a lot in grade/elementary school, middle/junior high schools, and high school.  It was a daily thing, with the noted exception of the weekends both with &amp; without the occasional holidays.  It became intolerable, but I also had issues with the home front having been abused in every way possible, including sexual harassment &amp; assault.  Yes, men can have a past with sexual abuse &amp; assault.  It's not a fun topic to talk about, and I dare not mention my abuser, because he or she is still alive, and I'd rather not have retaliation for it.  Needless to say, I had very few outlets.  Even less so with respect to my sometimes abusive parents who didn't want me to participate in certain situations, sports, etc.  And we moved around a lot, but neither of my parents were military members.

I ended up becoming highly introverted, seclusive/reclusive, plus having depression, bipolar disorder II, symptoms of PTSD (or so says my therapist when I mentioned what happens when my living parent brings up a certain other family member(s)), etc.  I don't have a lot of friends, and the friends I do have, I never call them to ask if we can just ""hang out"", and mostly because I place high value on being alone in my own apartment, and not letting anyone in unless I don't have a choice.  Plus, I have some personal things that I don't wish for friends of mine to know about, for fear that they wouldn't understand.  And I don't intend on mentioning what those private things are on this post, for another fear of someone I know coming across this Reddit post and putting together some pieces of information I've so far mentioned.

So, for me, it's really hard to break old habits.  I recently broke ties with a former best friend, because he was always trying to get me to do things to his own benefit, and not benefiting me anything.  So, I've blocked him out of my life.  I don't talk about him, nor do I have his phone number anymore.  That's how bad it's been with our ""best friend"" relationship.  It was a 20yr friendship that should have never existed at all.  He became almost as bad as the bullies I had to deal with in school.  

Other than that former best friend, I have other friends that have taken his place.  Friends who have given me their emotional support for times when I needed it, especially after having lived with my surviving parent for almost 10 yrs.  And that parent was also being manipulative, sometimes verbally abusive, etc.  I only tolerated them because they had a lot of problems with their medical &amp; mental health issues.  They don't even want to continue counseling, because this person thinks that they know all of the answers already, and don't need help.

I have an older sibling who had also been highly manipulative, abusive, hurtful, &amp; determined to see me fail so that they can claim victory watching me fall down hard.  The only family members/relatives I respected were my late cousin who was killed last year due to a then-17yr old kid making the poor choice to 1) drive without a valid license, 2) drive a car he was not authorized to drive at all, and 3) participated in an illegal street race that resulted in my dear cousin's untimely death.  She was killed instantly, I'm told, and didn't suffer much in the last moments of her life.

She was the closest I had to a sister in my life.  In fact, both her and her stepsister were both the only real female presence I had in my life growing up.  So, when the one was killed last year, I was devastated beyond belief.  I had also felt bad that her two daughters were going to be hit the hardest emotionally.  They won't have their mom around for the remainder of their lives, for the life milestones like when they get married, go to college, have babies of their own (they're both VERY ""baby crazy"", especially the oldest daughter, my sweetheart 2nd cousin), or when they graduate high school or college.

But, losing that ""sister from another mister"" was hard for me, and although my friends said I could always call within reasonable times throughout the day, I've not taken advantage of that because I don't wish to be an annoyance or irritant to them.  They've got their own life, and I don't think I should be calling &amp; having a ""poor me"" phone call, you know?

Anyway, after all of this, I really want to attempt going back to college after a 2yr leave of absence.  I was going for an Associate of Applied Science degree for computer support technician, but then I had realized that due to all of my own disabilities, medical problems, mental health issues, etc, that there'd be no ""9 to 5"" type job, part or full time that I would be able to tolerate.  So, I changed my declared major to Associate of Arts Music degree with designation (AA Music DwD), and I'm now taking two online courses plus a private instruction course for piano on campus.

I really want to do well this semester, but already I'm having difficulty with being motivated to do my class assignments, i.e. the reading &amp; making a research project for my English II Comp (ENG 122), my political science course POS 105, &amp; practicing my private piano lessons, especially when I get a migraine attack that lasts upwards of 12 to 24 hours or more, and then I'm feeling heavily fatigued, depressed, etc.  When I feel good (relatively speaking), I find that I don't want to be productive, because then it consumes every minute of my free time in between painful migraine attacks.  And then when I do get another attack after being productive, it makes me feel like the stress of that productivity makes me less likely to want to be productive and work the next time I feel better.

So, what I'm hoping to get from this subreddit is how I can achieve success, or get helpful advice, suggestions, tips, etc on dealing with the demands of everyday life, being enrolled in college courses, and achieving my goals of being a musician.  My main goal is to be able to play both piano, and the drums, like my music hero Phil Collins.  I know, he may not be the best musician alive, but I like to think that he's achieved a strongly successful career as a performer.  Plus, I kind of play the drums like him by setting up the drums for a left handed drummer.  You may be asking what the difference is, right?  If you've ever watched PC play, you'll notice that the hi-hat cymbal is to his right.  While right handed drummers have the hi-hat to their left.  To be fair, and honest, I took private lessons for the drums in high school, and started out as a right handed drummer, having my hi-hat to my left.  I would still like to do that, and become an ambidextrous drummer, i.e. some songs I play left handed, and some I play the opposite for.

I want to be able to do my class assignments, and still have plenty of free time to be ""unproductive"", i.e. play my music or video games, watch TV and/or movies, tinker around with my computers, etc.  But like I said, when a migraine attack hits me hard, I don't feel like being at all productive, much less do my class assignments from my college courses, much less practice my piano lessons.

What could help me stay motivated, despite being severely depressed and/or fatigued from those painful days of migraine headaches from nerve damage?  I'm already on strong medications, and I'm supposed to be getting a referral to a neurologist, as well as an orthopedic podiatrist for my feet problems too.  Side note, I have flat feet &amp; plantar fasciitis.  Oh, what fun!  I got all kinds of ""NOT FUN"" disabilities &amp; chronic health problems &amp; mental health disorders.

Sorry, I tend to put emotional emphasis on the seriousness of my personal health issues.  They are quite bothersome, and impact my life significantly.  I've even decided that it's better for me to remain single, so that my medical &amp; mental health chronic pain &amp; other problems do not become someone else's life.  I don't wish what I'm going through on anyone.  Well, maybe one asshat who occupies a political office, but I won't get into that here.  

What also doesn't help is that I've got family members who are less than supportive.  My older sibling has major narcissism.  My surviving parent is also a narcissist in some ways.  They're also highly depressing to talk to.  While I'd love to talk to friends more often, I hate using a phone to call them, and I hate making phone calls.  After working in call centers for some of my adult life, I'd rather avoid making phone calls, and just talk to friends or family in person.  I feel that nothing quite compares to having a ""face-to-face"" meeting with them.

That's also sometimes hard, especially when I don't feel well, and even more especially when I'm in GAWD-awful pain.",04Sep2018,1,
40,"So I’m a 16 year old with a few important exams this year and again in about 2 years time. I’ve recently started studying really hard (about 5ish hours a day including school) and I’ve realised that studying is just something I use to keep my mind off my other problems

Generally, on days when I’ve been utterly emotionally drained, I delve into tons of emotional problems. 

As a result, I tend to just focus on studying for the next few weeks to avoid thinking about everything. It works and it’s effective. But i fear myself becoming over-dependent on studying (it’s better than drugs or alcohol i guess). I’m also scared that after school ends, i’ll have no means of distraction from my thoughts. 

Does anyone else feel like they use things like this as a means of ‘escape’?

41,"Hello. I am a 19-year-old female in college. I  live in Nebraska, in the United States. I have struggled on and off with depression and anxiety throughout my life but I have managed this long without going on medication or sending red flags to worry my parents. 

I cannot lie. I have self diagnosed myself with these. I have always been able to keep this stuff off everyone’s radar. However, lately my anxiety has been really bad and I don’t feel like I am in control of managing it anymore. 

I am personally not a big fan of taking medications, like when I am sick I typically let my body sort it out on it’s own. My boyfriend takes medication for his depression and he says that it takes time to find the right one, but right now it has helped him so much. I think medication can be great in that sense, but I have always stood by not taking medication for myself and letting things resolve naturally. I don’t know how to overcome this wall I have built. What do I do? 

I just want to feel normal again. But this is this invisible wall in front of me where I can’t vocalize to my parents, or even my boyfriend, that I need help. I feel like part of the problem is I feel like if I get medication, I am admitting to everyone close to me that I actually have a problem. I don’t want them to worry about me. I don’t want to be dependent on a medication to feel normal but I don’t know how to deal with my anxiety anymore. 

Any advice or words would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",04Sep2018,12,
42,"I feel as if I'm living a duel life, sometimes I'm one person and other times I feel I act like self destructive.

My other side is being self destructive towards myself, I self loathe myself in things I enjoy doing/looking at. I push myself away from everyone and just feel pure anger or sadness, it's only one or the other. I feel shut in and that I can't trust anyone, I start to get very anxious and paranoid about stuff I do. I do suffer from OCD, autism, anxiety and depression disorders. I'm not sure if this is just it talking or I just can't accept myself and live with myself. I always feel I have to put on a fake person whenever I'm out in the real world, but when I go online I feel as if I'm someone different and somewhat relaxed at times. Internet has always been my safe space to go when I struggle everyday, recently it has been getting worse and starting to wear off of escapism. I just don't get why I can't accept myself for what I like and how I am. Also to stop being so envious and feel of hatred to others because I can't stop but compare myself to them in every way and how much of a failure I am. I feel my family doesn't even care for me, me having low self-esteem and depression would make you think that your family would be more nice to you. But no I just get made fun of because of obsessive and uncontrollable thing I do with myself. I'm sure if I was living in a better environment that I'd be able to actually see myself going somewhere or at least being able to be happy.

I'm recently engaged, a recent university graduate, work pretty much my dream job, have two dogs that usually bring me great joy, have been able to manage my mental health in a healthy way without medication for about a year, but recently I've started to feel like I'm sliding back into depression.  I wish that it was just a bad week, but the spiral has been going on for several months.  I can't take pleasure in the things I used to, I can't sleep, I no longer want to go to work, or volunteer, I actually dread the thought of both.  I dread leaving the house.  I hate having to talk to people- doesn't matter if it's friends, family, coworkers.  And by the end of the day I'm exhausted because I feel like I have to put up a false front.

I have no one really to turn to, which is another problem I think.  I moved to his hometown and have no friends outside his exclusively male friend group.  I feel very isolated and hopeless.

59,"My only friend (26M) might commit suicide this week, because I don't want to be with him romantically. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I should call the police to have him committed. The mental health hospital in my area is horrendous, and I want it to be a last resort. I've contacted another one of his friends to try to take him out and do something to get his mind off of things, but I don't think it will be enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so stuck and sucked into his black hole of emotion. He's not a bad person at all. He's been really great to me unlike the majority of people, and has positively impacted my mental health up until this point. He said that my not wanting to be with him is the last straw, because without me he has nothing to live for. That ""soulmates are bullshit, except when it comes to \[me\]."" The whole thing is so fucked up! We were taking a trip that was 2 hours away from where we live, so I was trapped in a car with him while he kept asking me if I would miss him. He asked this question repeatedly to me, so I just put my earphones in and tried to ignore him. He kept talking about how he could never watch me date someone else who's probably a piece of shit, but not give him a shot. I understand where he's coming from, because I felt the same way about someone else. It's fucking painful to watch it happen, but it's not something to kill yourself over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't wrap my head around the fact that even if I try to save him, his death is likely inevitable and I'm a reason why. Even if I call the police on him and he's committed, it still won't be enough to save him. He'll just commit suicide afterwards.

I guess I was depressed. I can be wrong. I couldn't do anything and was very apathetic. I can't even remember if I felt anything in particular. Sometimes I thought about committing suicide, but I wasn't too serious about it. I cried every day for now reason. I felt ambiguously bad, but whenever I tried to figure my emotions out, I couldn't find anything. I've never felt that shallow. I stayed at home until it got better after a year and a half.

68,"Hey everyone, thanks for reading until the end if you do. I'll try to keep this concise.

Probably since 8th grade I've noticed odd mental issues that only increased in severity as time went on. I'm now 22 years old, out of college, and working a full-time job in a creative field. Career wise, I know what I want and often push to get where I want to be. I consider myself very career oriented, even during those late middle school days.

I didn't have a very active social life and stayed inside playing video-games online with friends (of which I made online). I did have a small handful of friends that I would hangout with every few months later in high school. Once I went to college, life seemed so vibrant and full of life and opportunity. I made lots of friends and rarely played games anymore. I was always out and about and loving life (most of the time).

So what have I come to realize even with my life being generally simple? I seem to battle my inner self and things that seemingly afflict me, and I have no idea what it is or why it's here.

Every day I'm sluggish, unfocused, I feel like i'm not in my own body, I get irritable and snap quickly, I'll have random cry spells or emotional spells for no reason.... And then for a week out of a month or two I'll be up on my feet and cranking out optimism instead of the usual pessimism. I'm active and looking about life improvements... and then it all falls back to the dark grip again. I never really feel anything, but I put on a face. Everyone knows me as the jokester, the actor, the funny guy, but I myself feel more like an empty shell of a man who lost himself somewhere in the last 10 years.

I'm living with a girlfriend of 2 years and counting, things are great! But somehow I still seem to hate myself and feel constant tugging and struggling.

I have no idea what's been wrong with me for these last many years, but i'm starting to take some real steps on figuring this out. I would speak to a professional, but finances aren't and haven't been easy as far as that goes.

70,"From my experience, the problem with mental health is not external factors as ""Stigma"", ""Acceptance"", or things alike.

The problem to me seems like how the clients experience the mental health care from *within*.

In my case, I have experienced no least than once, sessions of antagonizing from the client's side. I was antagonizing the therapists because every one I ever met had signs against me. I never ever intended in arguing with them since I saw no point. I saw no point arguing with someone who was supposed to do their job as properly as possible.

Which brings me to the following point - the mental health field seems to want to suck up compassion from the environment. It seems that the mental health field is extremely defensive - saying they do not mean to cause harm, and that they should be just and do well to the client. However, this is not really the case. It seems numerous sources claim to say that therapists are ""only human"". Well so what? We are all ""only human"", what makes the therapists ""only human"" from the rest of the folks? Well in fact, if they are ""only human"" and nothing more than that, then I really REALLY worry for the future of the mental health field. Because if you have a professional who is ""only human"" and not ""only a professional"", then they are not a professional, but rather someone who wants to garnish mercy and compassion for their flaws and projected innocence, which in action gives them the given and unjustified privilege to expediently hurt the client, damage them, cause destruction and move on with their lives as planned by them and the mental health field.

* I met a psychiatrist, who lives through their clients' familial dysfunctions - the psychiatrist literally thrives from familial dysfuctions! I am not just talking about the professional sense - his own human self thrives from this, so it seems he *enjoys* causing familial dysfunction towards clients so they stay longer and believe in the psychiatrist rather than in themselves. The psychiatrist is also against religious patriarchies, and fights mercilessly against them.

For me, therapy is about making you better, NOT flaw-seeking. Right now, it seems therapy is like a waste of body-scans - you want to focus on ONE part of your body, but instead they just go ALL through the ENTIRE body. And not only that, but focus on issues the client does NOT want to focus on, and instead choose mostly to focus not only on issues, but also on PERCEIVED issues, which means that those perceived issues can also be ***nonexistent****!*

I had this b\*\*\*h therapist, who told me that because **THEY-!** see signs of Autism in me, then I should not trust my intuition. What fucking gives?! And that is after I talked fluently about how much I put my focus on my intuition in life to guide me and how much I have been using it to potentially help myself. Instead, the therapist chose to put a ""bad"" stain on it by saying how ""dangerous"" it is to follow your intuition and what not bulls\*\*\*, excuse my language.

So it seems the therapists only give me much and so many more reasons to leave the ordeal, rather than ""deal with my problems"". Because really, I don't live my life so someone will told me ""HALT! You have problems"". I want someone to give me that fuel and say ""Hey, here's some magic in you, let's fuel it up and see if any problems arise in the process"".

JFC, **F\*\*\*** the mental health field!

That's it, I am done venting. I hope anyone can relate to all I wrote. Good luck to you all, and may we see a brighter future for all, even if it means it NOT being with the help of the mental health field, through whichever sources it has.",04Sep2018,0,
71,"So we all have stresses, and I've just finished my first year of uni, which was very stressful - mostly because I found myself in friendship groups with a lot of drama, and my group at home doesn't really have drama. I was really looking forward to coming home for summer and seeing my close friends. The thing is, if I go for more than a couple of days without some decent social event with people I like, I just start unravelling mentally. It's like I need people to recharge my batteries. Sometimes it just helps to do something as simple as going to a bar and getting a drink (non-alcoholic if I'm on my own), then walk back. I just need people, and without them I feel worthless and empty. I've thought about killing myself a fair bit, and sometimes tried to think of actually workable, not-too-unpleasant ways of doing it, but I think that was more of a 'just-in-case-it-gets-really-bad' than me actually intending to do it. 

But it's got to the point that even at a significant social event, I'm now starting to get really worried about the day-long dopamine low that will hit when I leave the people behind, so that causes me to not enjoy the night as much. Being drunk helps, but I'm very conscious of not drinking to get rid of my problems, because we all know where that leads. 

Yesterday we had a big night out planned, the first one the whole group's gone on in years, and I was so excited for it. After pre-drinks, one of my friends collapsed outside the pub we were drinking in, and started throwing up. I've always been known as a nice/supportive person in the group, but this guy had overdone it twice in the last few weeks, I felt like he should have known better and he'd ruined the night, so I said some really nasty things in conversation with another friend while it was happening, I think I said I'd still go out even if he died of alcohol poisoning. I deeply regret saying it and have apologised profusely, and he said it was cool and just put it down to drunkenness, but I don't want to end up a horrible person because of this. ",04Sep2018,1,
72,"It seems to me that the mental health field is no less than a garnishing of many individuals with selected problems, which non-hesitantly puts them in ""careful"" cages so they either be safe or not go rabid in accordance to the mental health field's protocols.

The caging of such individuals is one of the explicit examples of how the mental health field *fails* its duty, and removes the client's ability to judge for themselves and live a life full of opportunities and welcoming attributes from the life beyond the mental health fields. Some times, it seems to me that the mental health field is like a hamster cage - you give them all the healthy food and necessities they need. However, you never give them their sense of deserved freedom on this very planet, and instead cage them for the rest of their potential eternity, in personal mind babbles created intentionally by psychiatrists and therapists, to disable so many great and wonderful individuals, for the sake of making their points and earning their profits, and NOT AT ALL for the sake of their patients and their wondrous and well-intended clients.

That is all that I have to say for now. I do hope that you continue to contribute greatly to this cause and meaning from whatever is happening around the globe when it comes to the specific mental health field. I hope we can all learn from this experience so that we may learn to garnish more explicitly from it, and ensure that it actually provides us with the necessary tools for survival and life-fulfillment, rather than what it seems to me as a garnishing of resources from the clients (money alike for sure), and the fulfillment of their written prophecies in the form of mental health diagnoses.",04Sep2018,0,

74,"I’m 16 and I’ve had a girlfriend for 9 months. Before I was with her I felt very depressed and lonely. It caused me to have a breakdown in the middle of my boxing club. However since I’ve been with her I’ve been a lot happier, until about 4 months into the relationship. I started feeling ridiculously jealous and I was very very over protected, this was when we were in the same school. For about 2 months it felt like my issues with trust and jealousy disappeared, it was brilliant , but she has now started collage and I came home from my aprentiship to see her today and I walked in and she was wearing jeans and a crop top and had her collage ID card around her neck. Overall it made me very upset and annoyed because I know how boys can be. But the part that doesn’t really make me feel good is the fact that I know that wearing jeans is acceptable but I don’t understand why I have an issue with it. I left and I was very mad and annoyed and yes I understand that I have no reason to be but I just was. I know it sounds silly but it truly made me sad and what made me a little bit worse was the fact I tried to talk to my mother about it and she just kind of made fun of how rediculous It was but I know that. it doesnt change the way I felt and to honest it was a little heart breaking to see her do that cos I know she doesn’t know how I feel. 

Reading through that it doesn’t seem very clear I know I’m sorry , I don’t know I guess I just feel I have no control over what I feel even tho subconsciously I know what I feel is wrong but I can’t change it ",04Sep2018,1,
75,"[Trigger warning - describes a panic attack]

I was lying in bed this evening, just on my phone doing nothing in particular and then I started feeling funny, my heart sped up, i spaced out and begin to fear that i was going to have a seizure (a prominent fear in my life and i genuinely have no idea why, i think it’s the idea of losing control) I was panicking like mad it was probably the worst panic attack i’d had in a few months. 

My breathing was getting off and all the techniques i’d tried to distract or try and logic with myself were being overwhelmed by the panic and then while completely composed on the outside I started shouting at myself in my head every time i started thinking about everything bad. It distracted me so much that everything returned to normal quite quickly! 

A very proud moment for myself and it came at a time where it was really needed! It’s the little things that count the most 😌

TLDR: I managed to calmly stop a particularly bad panic attack very quickly and i’m pretty happy about it",04Sep2018,1,

I am already working 3 jobs to take care of us and I cannot afford to take time off to take him to appointments, so I have started looking into virtual therapy to give him better access.  I am home with them between school letting out and bedtime and I don't want to give that time up.  The only problem is, I can't find any in the US that work with kids.

I have clinical depression and general anxiety disorder, which has been gradually getting worse recently.
I go to my girlfriend for help most of the time, when I'm stressed out or depressed. The problem is that when she gives advice, I don't normally use it. It's very upsetting to her, and it stresses her out now to where she told me she won't do it anymore because it's starting to affect her.
I don't normally take advice when I'm stressed and I feel bad about it. I don't know how to fix this part of me. It's good advice, I just can't seem to follow it or I'll dispute it.

79,What are your opinions/thoughts of how a person with depression might changes his/her mindset to want “help”? Do you think it is possible?

81,"Don't get me wrong there are things out there that scare the shit out of me (idk if it's real), but in my everyday life , I'll willingly put myself in situations that most people would avoid or stay away from because of the rush. I have a job, I have good money for my age and i'm not poor, but I still lie, cheat, and break the law every single day. It's funny to me, people are starting to catch on. I can't stop it. Do you know how good it feels to make money off vulnerable people? No? Ya you probably don't. I think my emotions are like reversed. I was watching this movie when I was a child that involved a teenage girl getting into a car accident. She was rushed to the hospital and put on life support but she never woke up. She was in a coma. Eventually her parents just put her out of her misery. I still think about this scene almost daily. Its fucking gold to me. That's the only way I can describe it. I like to imagine the look on the parents face as they pull the plug on their daughter. Fucked up right? Well that's the honest truth. Don't blame me though, if I could never think about this stuff ever again and just live a normal life, I would do that in a heartbeat. But that will never happen, so im never going to change. and don't you motherfuckers say that there are mental health people or services out there to help me you have no idea what they fucking did to me , they probably the reason I'm like this .

I only get one day off a week and one 30 minute break (11:00-11:30) per 13 hours shift because I am the only person operating the space beside two hairstylists.

Since I can't eat during the day I have been hardly able to eat meals or more than once a day on my days off even. I am back down to a size 0, a weight I don't feel healthy at.

88,"It almost feels like I have a compulsion to constantly hate on transgender people. In person, if I see someone who is visibly trans, I stare at them with a disgusted expression until they notice, and I try to make them uncomfortable. Sometimes I pretend to take pictures or laugh about them. I generally talk badly about transgender people and argue against bathroom choices for transgender people. I call transgender people ""its"", ""trannies"" and other offensive terms in everyday conversation. I frequently troll transgender online forums and trans support chats, making mean comments. I don't feel particularly bad for saying those things, but when I get booted or banned for my inappropriate remarks it makes me irrationally angry and I usually end up crying and it is one of the worst feelings ever. Even though I knew I was going to get banned I feel incredibly upset when it happens. Even though I know I am being a jerk and that what I am doing am wrong, I can't bring myself to stop doing it. I have been doing this for years now about transgenderism. Thing is, I don't really hate transgender people, and I do think that they should have equal rights and access to care. I was even diagnosed with gender dysphoria in the past when I was convinced I was transgender myself before deciding otherwise. 

I am so sad and depressed and I think about killing myself most of the time. I cut myself to try and feel better- it doesn't work, but I keep dong it anyways. I feel stuck like this. Its been 5 years and I haven't gotten anywhere in my life, I just keep coming back to this again and again. I've gone to a psychologist but they told me I don't meet the criteria for depression. I went to a counsellor who didn't think that I had any issues even when I explained what was going on. Nobody takes me seriously, and I feel like it's because I look normal and have a happy demeanour in person. I'm dying on the inside and nobody can help me.
