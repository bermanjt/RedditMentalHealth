1,"I’ve done a few tests which suggest that I am likely to display it and had counselling this year which confirmed that I have high paranoia and anxiety, being prone to depression too however nothing like a formal diagnosis.  I can barely bare to be alone and when bad thoughts enter my mind they eat me up, I feel exhausted all the time through the effort of keeping up with myself if that makes sense. I’ve also noticed behaviour that I never second guessed like keeping pictures sent to me and saving screenshots of conversations from mainly those I am romantically involved with at some point.

2,"Hiya. I'm 22,  male,  born very prematurely. I have some learning disabilities.

 My childhood sucked, suffered physical and verbal abuse for years at the expense of my mother and sister. suicidal at 10, self harmed at 13. Saw a few therapists but never got anywhere with it. Always felt lost and horrible growing up.

Lost my brother 2 years ago to suicide. I found a good therapist but don't see him often since he isn't always available. I never get to talk about the loss of my brother and its been like this for 2 years.

I've moved away and living with much better people now. But im still depressed. I've always been wishy\-washy, can't commit to anything, adopting other people's personalities, \(not completely of course. but little habits like how they talk etc\), am very impulsive with money and sex \(though only been with 3 people in the last 4 years\). I have periods of hyper confidence and high sex drive.

I've quit 2 jobs \(fast food\) because this depression and self doubt keeps haunting me. I see everything negatively. I often feel like the world is falling down around me, and explain my feelings to people and they just say I'm over reacting as always, so i tend to either a\)take it out on myself or b\) not tell anyone anything because they're probably right and I'm just a sensitive b\*tch.

My therapist says I'm very self critical and not take things so personally. And for a minute it works but time goes on and its a vicious cycle. Ive noticed I get into these moody mood swings every couple weeks. I will have a very motivated point\-\- working out, eating better, feeling generally happier\-\- then a slower point\- lazing around, starting to feel blah\- and a very low point\-\- sleeping so much it leads to insomnia eventually, becoming angry faster, being disgusted by certain people, even close friends for no reason, not wanting to talk to anyone, just feeling like a complete goblin. Lol.

Its not funny, really. It f\-ing sucks. I feel like I'm a rollercoaster, i have so much going through my mind all the time, trying to think through the past and why things are the way they are that I actually become tired.

Psychiatrists aren't easy to come by here in Seattle, not on state insurance anyway. And now I'm out of work.

I can't work right now because of depression, but I may need to pay for therapy.

Bipolar, depression, inflated ego and actual psychosis run in my family. \(cousins, mostly\).

I guess I'm asking how possible it seems for me to be bipolar, or have some other disorder. I already know I have depression and anxiety. If i do, what should I do?

TL;DR\- suspected mood or personality disorder based on impulsive behavior, mood swings with depression, anxiety and anger.",03May2018,3
3,"A condensed version of my story to begin with:
Since November last year, I've felt myself fall in a downward spiral of depression and anxiety that lead to the worst states I've ever experienced in my life. I've self harmed, had very strong thoughts about ending my life and felt like nothing would get better. I had low intensity CBT sessions that helped a small amount, but upon being discharged I realised the techniques given really didn't help me. Around a month ago I fell into what I believed to be a major depressive episode, losing all affection and empathy for anyone and hating spending prolonged periods of time around people. Around a week ago, I woke up one day after a very intense day of arguments and discovering some bad shit and felt very optimistic. I felt just as I had before everything went down the toilet and I was (and still am) terrified its only temporary.

So, working on ensuring this positive mood is permanent and avoiding relapsing, I was wondering if anyone has any self help tips or techniques I could try? I've began following mindfulness and meditation today and have felt a massive flourish of positive energy within that has withstood some highly anxious thoughts. If anyone has anything to go down that path or a new path to introduce me to (not necessarily to do with meditation) I'd be really interested in trying.

7,"(I know that trigger warnings might seem silly here, but I mention DID, depression, cutting, and anxiety.)

Hello, I am Grae, I live in Ohio, and I am kind of at a loss.

So I am 13, and I live with my mom. I have been showing signs of having DID for a while, but just recently my cat passed away and it has gotten increasingly worse.

So, two alters have showed up so far. One is Jamie, and the other is Null.

Jamie is a protector of the system, he makes sure that Null isn’t messing with me. He just showed up a few weeks ago. He mentioned his name a few days ago.

Null however, has been here since August. 

In August I was incredibly depressed, and anxious, so I picked up the habit of cutting.

As soon as the first time I cut into my arm I felt instant relief, like a huge wave of static just passed. 

But shortly after, it would be back again. 

I never knew what the foggy noise was, but around October, I could hear a clear voice. 

I was alone that night, so I cut. After I did and sat down on my bed, I saw this figure sitting in my chair.

Null is not a protector, he has harassed me, and he’s the one telling me to cut, and pushing my depression further and further.

Jamie has already helped so much over the few past days, because he has already developed high trust and respect for me.

I really don’t want to say that I am self diagnosed, but I’m scared to bring this up to anyone. I don’t want to be taken away.

I have asked my mom before if I could go to therapy once a month, she said she would look, but it’s been 7 months.

I want help and she wants to help but she doesn’t know how.

What do I do for people to believe me when I say that I have DID? They think I’m too young to know anything, but old enough that I can be alone and figure it out by myself. 

Any advice helps, an encouraging comment helps, anything at this point. I’m so close to ending it all.

I’m having a hard time with whether or not I’m having delusional thinking or if I’m genuinely curious?

11,"I'm really new to therapy.  I started out with a TalkSpace account, and was matched with an awesome therapist.  Unfortunately, I had tons of billing and account issues that typically took support close to a week to respond to.  I can handle bugs in a growing platform, but please hire enough support people to help take care of them.

I said my good byes and switched to BetterHelp.  It's a lot cheaper since they operate on a sliding scale, but I'm not sure I like my new therapist.  We've been messaging for a week and had our first video session today.  She has some annoying mannerisms (way too peppy,) but wouldn't normally hold that against her.  What does bug me is her grammar is terrible.  I can barely decode her messages sometimes, and have to keep asking for clarifications.  I dropped some subtle hints to no avail, so finally just asked her to take 2 seconds to proofread before hitting send.

I'm sure part of my problem is I bonded really well with the first therapist and I'm comparing them.  On the other hand, I've seen better grammar from several Nigerian princes and Indian tech support.  We're talking forgetting the verbs in sentences, etc. not just messing up homophones or spelling.  I want to give her a chance, but I'd also like to waste as little time as possible since every switch is starting over.

12,"I was seeing a psychiatrist at my university health center, but I had to take a break from college for financial reasons, and now I am no longer eligible to use the services at the health center because I am not a current student. At the health center, I was able to receive low\-cost services without using insurance, so my parents never had to find out.

But now, I really need to find a psychiatrist so I can get a new prescription for my medication before it runs out. I'm still on my parents' insurance, so in theory, I would only have to pay the co\-pay and everything would be fine, but the problem is that I don't want them to know that I'm seeing a psychiatrist. And I definitely can't afford to pay a psychiatrist hundreds of dollars out of pocket, so I'm at a loss for what to do.

19,"IDK where to start, sorry if this is just one incoherent wall of text.

So lately, and by lately I mean the past month. I have been angry, angry is too soft of a word, but furious is too strong. Usually. Over the last month(ish) I've been generally pissed off, not at anyone or anything in particular. Just angry. I generally have been feeling empty for the last almost year now. Anger, I guess, is a welcomed change to that. But I still feel empty overall. I put up a facade in public and around loved ones, because my parents will give me the ""grow up already"" spiel and none of my friends take anything seriously. I get furious at times, usually I am alone, and I slam my fist on my desk. Repeatedly. I also throw pens and rapidly click my pens too. When I am around people, I just clench my fists and my teeth till I calm down a bit. I feel like a robot, day in and day out the same school work. The same lake of emotion throughout most of the day. The genuine anger at home and in the halls. I also feel like I don't have privacy anymore, I've had people go through my backpack and my computer. I feel like I'm constantly being monitored by my parents. I don't even get joy out of most things in my day to day. Video games are a distraction and an escapism, but slowly they're starting to become more of the daily struggle and less of a way to hide from my problems. Important milestones in my life have come and gone and I didn't even get excited for them. Things that normally would be exciting have had no change on me.

On top of all that, I've started talking to myself. I have a discord chat, that only has me and a music bot in it. I rant into the void of the chat when I need to. I used to only say ""I think..."" and ""Why cant I..."" but the last couple day's its been more ""why can't you..."" and ""why cant we..."" with the you and we taking the place of I. I also started having a conversation, on a few occasions in today's rant, with me and myself. I just ranted and let it talk. I've also been pretty cynical over the last few weeks, courtesy of my fiends pointing it out to me, along with me saying increasingly dark things, compared to my usual dark sense of humor.

I’m in need of some pretty immediate advice. I got a panicked call from a friend (28M) of mine’s parents last night. I’ve known this friend for years and know that  over the course of the last couple years his mental state has deteriorated (conspiracy theories, people following him online, doesn’t sleep at night, social withdrawal). That said, when I’ve spent time with him recently he seemed completely lucid, just a little depressed.

Anyway, so his dad calls me in a panic. Apparently he flew across country looking for an answer from God. Claimed his mother was the devil (he has a really good relationship with her so that was surprising) and that he was in Hell. I called him numerous times throughout the night and got through to him once - he seemed pretty agitated and reiterated that he was in Hell and wanted to go home to Heaven. 

I have a bunch of questions, but I guess the most pressing are:

What’s the best way to help him while he’s in the midst of this episode? If he thinks we’re all demons, how can anyone find and talk to him?

How long could the episode last?

Should I keep trying to contact him or will that exacerbate the situation?

Is there anything I can do in the immediate  to help?

Local law enforcement located him but can’t do anything since he hasn’t done anything wrong.

Anyways, I've never been diagnosed with anything. Never seen a doctor, never taken a proper test. Nothing. Now, this is what I want to talk about. I've never taken a proper test before but I want to. Why? Because I always feel like I have something. All my life I've been treated like an outsider and I've always been able to make friends with people who have anxiety, depression, autism, PTSD etc. which makes me wonder if I've got something? It's just speculation and I consider myself to be mentally healthy most of the time (although exams are getting pretty close and I'm getting pretty stressed).

So, what I'm kinda asking is, how do I know? Idk how I would go about it which is probably one of the problems. I know I could talk to my parents about it but I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my life in general, let alone about mental health. Nor do I trust them much.

37,"I have been having EMDR with a local charity specialising in sexual abuse. I found it very helpful, I could be open with the therapist with what happened to me \(something I had never done before!\) and felt like I was really progressing. Sadly, I have been struggling with my physical health since before I started therapy with her and told her in my first appointment. I had to cancel two sessions before \(about 6 weeks apart from each other\) because I physically was not able to leave the house. I always let her know first thing in the morning \(our appts were usually late afternoon\) and she always replied very nicely, and asked me at the next appointment how I felt now, and how my medical tests were going. This morning I had to email her as I felt extremely unwell again. I told her how sorry I was to have to cancel again. She has now replied saying that she is closing my case with immediate effect as she feels like now is not a good time for me to do treatment. She NEVER gave me any warning, was always SO understanding with me having to cancel \(she just used the spare time for admin for the general service, which she desperately needed anyway\).

I feel SO vulnerable right now. I don't have an issue with this generally, I understand services have to run efficiently etc but she never gave me any kind of warning, never even mentioned the possibility of stopping.

38,"Hi everyone,


A short introduction: I'm a 26 years old man and have suffered from a pretty severe form of OCD for a long time now. With the help of a psychiatrist and medication I have managed to mostly get a grip on my mind and my mental disorder. I have been using SSRI's for the past 5,5 years now. I use the antidepressant Venlafaxine (previously known as Effexor) in a dosis of 150mg a day.


I started using Venlafaxine, because my OCD was taking over my life. I was failing in college and I was overall depressed and had no energy. Fast forward to now, 5,5 years later, and my life could not be better! I've had a girlfriend for 2+ years (I broke it up, but that's a different story). I've joined a very fun student fraternity and I have gained a lot of new friends and do a lot of fun things. I have a new amazing girlfriend, so I am feeling very stable and happy. I do need to finish my thesis, but there's always *something* to do.


The side effects of Venlafaxine are not huge: I feel nauseous when I don't take in my medicine and get 'brainzaps', but as long as I invariably take in my medicine there is no problem. I do have a bit of a foggy memory and I 'feel' less, meaning that the frames of my emotions are sort of restricted in the highs and lows, if that makes sense. I don't have any weight gain nor any sexual problems. Osteoporosis is apparently a side-effect of the medicine, but I'm not sure in what degree this is true and whether I'm affected by it so far.


**The pro's**
A benefit of Venlafaxine obviously is the decreased amount of depressing thoughts/feelings and the massively lowered amount of my OCD. I also became more of an extrovert. I identify as someone in the balance of introversion and extroversion, but because of the Venlafaxine I definitely got the idea that I became more of an extrovert.

The main reason why I want to quit is the fact that I don't like my brain being fuzzy at times. I have more trouble concentrating and recalling memories and like I said earlier, I think I'm ready to feel all my emotions again, instead of the slightly walled amount of emotions I experience now.


**The problem**
My main fear is that if I decrease and ultimately quit the use of Venlafaxine, I will become less outgoing and less extroverted than I was before. To be frank, I like myself better now than how I was before and fear of losing my friends and contacts when I lower my medication, because they will like me less. I have no doubt that I have developed myself on a social level in the last few years, but I have this anxiety that it might mostly because of the medication that 'changed' me.


Has anyone experienced this or something similar? Has anyone succesfully lowered Venlafaxine/Effexor?

39,"I'm posting on behalf of my girlfriend, who does not reddit. Before I begin, this is not a ""what should we do?"" post, because the answer is *seek professional help,* which she does. This is me asking if anyone has any similar experiences.

Basically, my gf suffers from ADD, persistent depressive disorder\(?\), and anxiety. She takes concerta and Paxil. A while ago, she was on clomipramine, but it nixed her ability to orgasm, but not sex drive. Paxil has pretty much eliminated sex drive. The clomipramine was more effective at treating the anxiety, and Paxil isn't great, but she's still on a lowish dose \(I thought these were antidepressants but I guess they help with anxiety too?\)

She gets a lot of intrusive thoughts, mainly about hurting loved ones. I know she'd never do it, because she doesn't have it in her. But a lot of times, especially late at night, these intrusive thoughts come at her relentlessly, and makes her anxiety levels skyrocket. Last night was such an episode; she was afraid to go to sleep because she felt like she was going to ""lose herself"" in her sleep and do something to hurt me or the cat. 

Let it be said that she does **not** have any disorders that would cause that, nothing like BPD or schizoaffective disorder \(sorry if I got those wrong, I'm no expert\). At the height of her anxiety attacks, she feels like she's losing her mind. Eventually, it'll die down and she'll be incredibly tired, then she can sleep.

Has anyone here experienced anything like this? Maybe some suggestions of what meds may help? I know medication is different for everyone but some pointers might be good. She has an appointment with her psychiatrist soon but she isn't particularly hopeful about it.

Background: I have depression with anxiety.  My husband has bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, degenerative disc disease, bilateral nerve damage, and \(thanks to pain and the opioids prescribed and then taken away\) is recovering from a heroin addiction.

He can be verbally abusive at times and seems to genuinely not remember or realize what he is saying or how he phrases it.

My dad most of the cases due to work didn't see all the episodes of her dangerous behaviour,but for those he saw,he blindfoldedly has forgoten and foegiven. I took all the anxieties and binge eating into my teenage&amp; adult life. Perhams due to binge eating (she was usually buying me tons of sweets so I wouldn't be angry that shes drinking again) I became overweight, food was always a comfort. In the last few years I have managed to get rid of my binge eating cult...I am still quite heavily overweight,but my weight has dropped and my relationship with food has changed. ... why am I writing all this you wonder. In my teens I spent a lot of time outside..after highschool I started developing depressive mood.. I got into uni hoping it will change evrything,but I was still spending all of my time in school and home. I didnt feel like going anywhere. My mother gave me a lot crap about me not working etc. When she was drunk ofcourse. I graduated feeling more than miserable. After 5 months with no job I finally got a job and everything seemed fine. There were several drinking episodes trough past years but for a while it seemed all fine. My emotional state seemed to stay the same. I hatw myself for beeing this way. I feel like what I experienced all trough my life made me like this,but at the same time I feel like I am just a wining bitch that doesn't know how to handle life. Today my mother got drunk and I heared her having conversation on phone with her godmother. She was telling her how shes annoyed with me, annoyed with the fact that I don't go anywhere besides work,that she doesn""t know what to do with this. I recently got diagnosed with pcos(polycystic ovarian syndrome) turns out that she had told that to her as well. A couple years ago while drinking with one of her friends she told her that she thinks I am abnormally fat and probably a lesbian , cause I dont have a boyfriend.

52,"What if depression is making you think negatively? Like it makes you think and feel worthless but when its not there you are not thinkiny that way because you are feeling normal. 

So therefore FEELINGS are CAUSING THOUGHTS in this scenario, contrary to the usual explanations.

I cannot stop thinking about how I am feeling unless and until the feeling of flatness goes away. My constant thought is ""How long will this last"". Its there for no reason and while this feeling is there I tend to think thoughts like ""Why do I feel like shit"", ""im not as good as I used to be,"" ""I suck,"" etc. These feelings DIRECTLY affect me at school and in exams and productivity and social life. 

So because of that I get the thoughts that I am shit etc. Now in therapy it would try to get me yo question those thoughts. However, its the FEELINGS causing the thinking. 

When the feelings resolve, those thoughts also resolve. And then I have good self esteem, confidence, etc for school.

So why is it suggested to ""manage stress and negative thinking"" when actually the feelings are immensely stressful and are the actual issue since they are what disrupt quality of life/productivity/exam scores/social life. Then in turn cause the negative thinking due to all the disruptions. ",03May2018,78

55,"Hi All:  My BIL is suffering a mental health crisis and we aren't sure what to do or how to get him the help he needs but is refusing.    **tl;dr suicidal behavior, refusing to go to hospital**

**Backstory**:

My BIL is an active alcoholic and is spiraling out of control.  We have known for some time that he had a drinking problem but he had it under ""control"".  Over the past 8\-10 months, things have escalated significantly.  In January, we brought our young son over to his family's home for a playdate in the late morning.   He was intoxicated when we arrived and claimed to have been grocery shopping; he shot a gun that we didn't know he even had right next to my husband's ear, blowing the ear drum; he then attempted to go sledding with the kids and hurt himself pretty badly \- cut face, bruising; then, he passed out at the kitchen table at 2 PM.    We had made an offer to his wife to bring her somewhere the following day, to which she responded ""I can't trust him here with the kids alone"".  That was our first real sign that his drinking had escalated. 

Fast forward to March.  He is involved in a single\-vehicle accident in the middle of the afternoon with his young child in the car.  No one was phyisically injured, but obviously this is not a small problem.  

Since the accident, while a participant in Intensive Out Patient care for his alcoholism, there have been 6 major incidents involving his drinking, leading to arrest for violation of his conditions of release or hospitalization.

His wife decided that she needed a break and told him that she was leaving on a vacation with their small children.  They were leaving today.

Last night, BIL went back to the bottle and called some friends out of state.  Those friends were so concerned by his behavior that they called the police to do a wellness check.  The  police arrived and found BIL passed out drunk outside, so they booked him again for violation. 

**However**  \- they also found a noose that he had made lying next to him.  He has been asking over and over again today for his gun \(which we took after the car accident because of his erratic behavior\) back. 

We are scared that he is going to harm himself or someone else.  He is refusing any treatment.

What options do we have to help him so that he doesn't end up hurting or killing himself?  Can we get him involuntarily committed?  Is the noose sufficient evidence of threatening self harm? 

Please help.  We honestly do not know what to do.  ",03May2018,3

62,"Alright, so....Where to start

My mother has always had a problem with anger- I can recall literally thousands of incidents that I feared for my life, and for her life. During these moments I can't recognize her, the shouting and aggression consumes her and it's like she's somewhere you can't reach her. She has been physically abusive, but only to some extent, and its only directed at me (the oldest sibling) and for background I'm 16, I have a little sister who's 11 and two toddler/ infant brothers. None of us have the same dads.

So clearly with this many children I fear for their overall safety, and witnessing one of her episodes is honestly traumatic to this day- and I've seen them for 16 years. The reason I'm reaching out NOW is because it's getting worse. I'll list the behavior she expresses during these episodes: shouting/ screaming so loudly and violently that its incoherent, heaving for breath between each sentence, punches herself in the head until it bleeds, smashes her head into walls and floors, uses her nails to rip her skin open on her face, crying while rocking back and forth on the floor, when she was pregnant with my youngest brother she would punch herself in the stomach over and over again to make my stepdad upset (he was then born with a crooked foot that is still being corrected with a cast), my mother also runs around the house throwing things and trying to break all of the dishes, pushing furniture over like the tv, the couch, the babies changetable and cot.

I'm positive she does more but at the time it's so scary that all you want to do is pretend it isnt happening. I also want to clarify that these episodes occur while shes arguing with my stepdad. For background- she is extremely paranoid. Although my stepdad has been nothing but supportive and a good husband, provides for the family and cares for ALL of her children despite only one of them being his biologically. What I'm saying is he's a really good guy and he treats me like a son. My mother MAKES arguments. She accuses him of cheating and verbally abuses him for HOURS after he gets home from working 12 hours a day. She waits for him to get home so she can go absolutely ballistic at him, and the funny thing is that she provokes him into becoming angry and then cries saying he's abusing her. Really? He has never layed a hand on her, and even when he gets mad he just says a few insults along the lines of ""you're a crazy bitch i work all day for you and the kids and this is what you do""

I've confronted my mum about her episodes but she responds by saying its my stepdads fault for provoking her... but shes the one who starts the argument and she needs to recognize that her behaviour is extremely concerning and abnormal... I really could use some help/ advice, because everytime I try to make her see what she's doing is wrong she attacks me and says everything thats wrong with me, or she just goes on and on about how we're disgusting children and spoilt brats and she wishes she was dead etc etc etc

Does anyone have any idea what she could be suffering from? I have a few ideas myself, but I'm just a 16 year old boy. I want her to see a therapist and get as much help as possible because I love her more than anything in the world, but its getting harder and harder to stand the abuse and I hate that my siblings still have to grow up in the same harsh environment I did.

(Also, I know drugs can really mess someone up- My mum also did meth from 15 years old to her mid twenties.. and through her pregnancy with me when she was 17....EXCESSIVELY. She only smokes weed now, but I thought I'd include this)

65,"TL;DR Was functioning depressed/anxiety-ridden person with migraines and gastrointestinal issues, Doctor gave me Lexapro, am now a normal but somewhat blah person without health problems but with weight problems. Feel like my doctor should have prepared me better. Don't know if I want to stay on or not.


I'm feeling really conflicted right now. I've always been an extremely emotional person and struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a pre-teen, but I didn't ever talk to anyone about it then because my family was really freaked out by the stigma of mental illness. I started getting very severe migraines around this time as well, and my neurologist suspected a serotinin imbalance and said that it often went hand in hand with depression and asked if I had any feelings of depression/anxiety, but I denied having them because my mom was in the room with me.

In college I went to the counseling center which helped a little.

Then, about two years ago I started going to a new doctor (general practitioner) because of severe gastrointestinal issues. I was also having an abnormally high heart rate when I went to the doctor but was fine when I self tested.

We tried several different diets and did some blood tests but nothing helped. Then my doctor said the she noticed that I seemed very anxious when I was there and asked if I was anxious in other situations as well. The truth was I definitely was anxious and sometimes depressed pretty frequently, but I have always been very ""functional"". It felt really good that someone noticed something might be wrong. She suggested that my gastrointestinal issues could be a symptom of this and prescribed me Lexapro.

In a lot of ways it has been a miracle drug. My anxiety is about 1/10th what it once was. I used to have to take sleeping pills to sleep because I would think of horrible things, imaging people in my life dying in vivid detail etc and that completely stopped. I became much more confident and didn't cry at work anymore which had been something I did every time something went wrong no matter how hard I tried not to.

My gastrointestinal issues went away almost completely and so did my migraines. I don't even get them when I have caffeine anymore most of the time which is really amazing as it was my worst trigger other than stress.

But at the same time, I gained so much weight so quickly. I've never had issues maintaining a healthy weight and it felt like this happened overnight. Additionally, sometimes I feel like I am TOO chill. It's not that I don't have fun or am completely apathetic, but I'm less excitable than I used to be, and much less creative. I've been trying to improve my diet but while I haven't gained any further weight I have been unable to lose what I have already gained.

I've tried to go off of the Lexapro twice and it was horrible. I had the most debilitating migraines I have had in years and suicidal thoughts. I went back to my doctor and found out I hadn't been going about quitting in the safest way, but she dissuaded me from trying again, instead prescribing me another drug that usually causes weight loss on top of the Lexapro to balance it out and telling me that I should work harder to exercise if I want to lose weight since it is such a miracle drug for me and that anyway I ""wear it well."" 

I feel like the addition of the second medication hasn't made any difference except make it more difficult to sleep, and bring some of my anxiety back.

I know I should have looked up more information before starting this, but at the time I felt so miserable and desperate. I really wish my doctor had taken some time to explain the risks of the medication, and how difficult it would be if I wanted to stop taking it. Or maybe even referred me to a psychologist or something first. I feel like the only way I can stop is if I take like 3 weeks off work so I can stay in bed through the worst of it. 

Part of me is really wanting to go off these pills. I hate the weight gain, I feel more and more self conscious which is negating some of the helpful effects of the drug. But on the other hand, I feel like I'm being very shallow and I should be thankful for the benefits. I'm also afraid that when I go off of it, I will not be seen as competent at my job, or be as well-liked. I suddenly have the most friends I've ever had in my life, and I've had two people from the job I recently left tell me how I always seemed so confident and not worried about anything even when big issues came up, I'm sure before the drug, no one would ever say that about me. Plus, I know it's easy to forget how bad things were before with my physical symptoms as well. Some days I would rather be thin than be able to eat like a normal person at a restaurant, and be able to drink coffee, etc and other times I'm so disgusted with myself for thinking those things. And I know I judge myself very harshly even though I do not do the same to others.

70,"My friends at university were invited to a party by people I very vaguely know through other friends. I wouldn't expect to be invited (I wouldn't be surprised either) because the hosts are basically acquaintances/friends of friends who I speak to every now and then, but I still feel anxious that I haven't been.

I get worried like ""girls always get invited to parties so if you weren't it's because you're ugly"" but the person hosting it is gay and I know many attractive girls that don't get invited to stuff, and I am attractive.

I get worried that I have a reputation for being a 'psycho' because I acted quite manic in my first year, but almost everyone at my university has some sort of mental health problem and I doubt they spend much time thinking about me.

Also it's one party. I've been invited to many, some of which my friends haven't been invited to, some of which they have.

And I barely know anyone on my course (through choice) so I can't exactly be surprised if they don't invite me to stuff.
