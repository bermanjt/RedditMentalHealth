0,"I am able to think clearly right now, I type this as a reminder for me and other people with Schizophrenia (or any other psychotic illness). The voices might be too much to handle right now, but listen to the real ones. Reminder: It’s only temporary, mine are 30 minutes long, yours could be hours, but it’s OKAY. Everything will be fine. Try to re-direct yourself, tell a teacher or the counselor what’s going on, and if it gets too intolerable and you are worried, it’s okay to go to the hospital. Your mental health is more important than a school grade, or attendance. Take care of yourself, listen to some music. I am currently hearing voices, specifically the man who always talks. I need to re-direct myself and focus on recovery goals. The voices will not take over my being today, or even tomorrow for that matter (Say that EVERYDAY), if you’re in an acute episode of psychosis, you might not be mentally there, but there are people still loving you and helping you throughout this stage, you are always loved despite your illness. We are much stronger mentally than most people, treat yourself with respect and care because our brains are so fragile to reality. Don’t talk to the voices, they want us to respond so they can screw us over in the long run. The voices might be loud, but your strength to bear through it all is louder. Get out and explore the world, don’t let your world interfere with the beautiful nature we were blessed with. If you ever need to talk, please message me&lt;3",27Aug2018,17

2,"I’ve been on leave from work for awhile due to stress and injuring my back. It’s resolved now and I went back on Friday to dip my toes back in. 

I prepared as much as I could: went to bed early, tried to relax, had my scrubs laid out, set up breakfast for the morning.... 

But I woke up 20 minutes after I was supposed to be there, which messed me up. Then my pt fell, luckily he didn’t get hurt but I felt horrible. Then ethical issues thrown in my face. It’s hard to prolong people’s lives when they are practically begging to die. I got out late again, at 10pm, and was exhausted and stressed. 

Now I’m going back tomorrow, then I’m off for another week. I’m telling myself once I get into the swing of things, I won’t have these jitters the night before. I’m just not sure what to do if I can’t handle it after this time off, do you have any tips for building confidence, waking up on time, meditations before bed/before you go into work?",27Aug2018,0
3,"Today I came home after a 16 hours stay in the emergency department followed by a 48 hour stay in what’s known as the “calm unit”. 
I guess we start from the beginning of the story.  I was torn down and upset by an ex, I’ve been doing great but then he started again. It started with sorrys all the time and then turned into you aren’t the woman I fell in love with. He said I was bitter, negative, dark, anxious all the time and mean. Ask anyone about me and I promise you they would tell you the opposite(I might not be a confident person but I am confident on how I treat others). Well after too many days of emotional draining communication, I was at my wits end. I was weak and needed help. Mentally I knew I wasnt ok. I didnt want to hurt myself but I needed a time-out. I needed to give myself more than what I was being given.
Fast forward a little, I’ve been pink slipped. If you’re asking yourself what the hell that is then you are in the same spot I was in. Pink slip means you are able to be held for 72 hours involuntary in order to have alllllll the physiatrist, counselors, social workers, doctors, nurses etc. evaluate your every feeling. It means sleeping on hospital cots, being awoken at all hours to check your vitals, hospital food, no closed doors, no privacy whatsoever(even in the bathroom), no phones, no outside time, regulated times in which someone can see you.... etc....

IT SUCKED

I felt ashamed, in-prisoned and punished for the feelings I had. I know they were just trying to follow what’s seen as protocol but what about my needs? I laid in a bed for 72 hours, there were no balls to walk down, there were no windows to open just to get a little fresh air. My saving grace was a sweet girl who I played scrabble with to pass the time. Maybe it did some good to shut everything out for 72 hours, I hope I can look back and take it as a positive thing at least. 

BUT

BACK TO MY MAIN POINT

As soon as I left the “calm unit” today, I felt ashamed. Worried that someone would find out and think I was crazy, that I’m not fit to be their friend or their employee. I’m telling the 5 people that knew(family) please never say anything, begging them to keep it a secret. But why should it be a secret? Why hide that I needed to take care of my mental health? Someone breaks a bone, they go to the doctor and use the cast or scar as a sign of being strong. Someone “breaks” their brain and suddenly it becomes a sign of weakness. No matter the situation, physical or mental, we’re both suffering. Maybe not in the same way, but pain does exist and we’re just trying to heal. 

Maybe there’s not a point to this but I just needed to rant to someone(everyone).

Thank you for always having my back.",27Aug2018,29
4,"The only times I remember being happy and not being neglected by my parents, bullied, or sexually abused was from when I was born till I was 5 and when I was 17. I’m in college now am engaged and live in a apartment with my fiancé, mostly financially support myself. I’m not happy. I don’t think I ever will be. I want a happy childhood. As much as I try to live my childhood now stuff just gets in the way. Sex is hard for me and as much as I tell my fiancé it’s not that I don’t find him attractive he just keeps telling me how insulted and rejected he feels.

5,"I'm a 25 year old guy, who has so much issue with rejection when it comes to romantic relationships I won't even attempt to ask the girl out. If I see a girl acting like she likes me I start imagining in my head what it'd be like. But I will never ask her out because every girl I've ever asked out has always rejected me, which is their right to do but I still always feel shitty afterwards.

6,"Let me tell you a bit about myself first before I explain what’s going on. I’m 17 years old and I mainly study Computer Science. Every weekday I wake up at 6AM, leave the house at 7:15 to eventually get to college at 9. Yeah, I have an extremely long commute. I’m there until 3:45PM and get home at 6. It drives me nuts. Since college is well... pretty damn hard, I’m doing work Monday to Friday’s, and weekends is my only free time.

My main hobby is playing video games; I love them, they’re great! It complements my course and career plans well since computer technology is my passion, and I’m not about to let someone tell me games are unhealthy and not educational.

But the thing is: I also love to read. I like to see myself as fairly open-minded. I’m quite quiet, and a very passive person. I don’t really think of myself similar to the stereotypical male teenager. I’m halfway through George R. R. Martin’s book series and adore it. I just love reading in general.

And this is where my problem starts occurring. I only have a handful of hours a week of spare time, and recently every time I open a book, I keep saying to myself, “I shouldn’t be reading because it doesn’t complement my Computer Science passion... but video games do.” So I close the book and play a game. My mind is stopping me from “wasting” my time on something I love to do.

I’m also “diagnosed” (I hate the word) with OCD, if that helps - I don’t think it does - but it’s worth mentioning. I obsess over spending my time wisely and making sure I’m doing things right.

Thanks for reading this. Any thoughts or advice?

7,"Honestly, I'm afraid. Of the unknown and new things in my life, especially now being possibly diagnosed with C-PTSD and Psychosis.

I know, my life will change because of this. But what makes me scared is if its going to get better or if its going to get worse. 

I am happy that I have an answer after about 13 years of searching for one. But now opens a new chapter in my life, and how much its going to hurt, and if I'm going to lose people I care about dearly.

8,"I just remember being 14 and the teachers always told my parents. ""I think something is wrong with your son"" but really i just got bullied everyday. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and all that good stuff. 

Im 22 now, I had a pretty big mental breakdown a couple months ago. I had to quit my summer job which was something i worked hard to get. I had to move back with my parents. I got diagnosed with BPD about a month ago and im having symptoms iv never really had before. Constantly feeling spaced out, like im not in the present. No motivation for anything, no happiness at all. Just constant sadness. Im supposed to go back to college in 9 days and finish my third year and graduate.

I just look at everything right now and think i would be better off dead. Id rather feel nothing, than what I feel everyday. Every year i have told myself ""it will get better"" and for once. I cant tell myself that anymore.

My parents are disapointed because of who i am. My sister, my cousins all have their shit together and im just a mess with a mental illness and i cant do anything anymore. My dad is leaving our family, my mom cries everyday. I cant live like this anymore.

Im just sitting here trying to make a choice if i should or not. I dont expect you guys to care all that much. After all im just a random dude on the internet. I guess this is a cry for help. My last cry.",27Aug2018,1
9,"I could write a book on my depression but I'm trying to keep this quite short. Basically, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to ""feel"" on depression medication. I've had depression for most of my life looking back on it, I started with medications when I was 23 (28 now). I started with Citalopram, switched to Effexor and am now on Pristiq (I was on the first two for about two years and just started Pristiq in March). I was on 50 MG of Pristiq and noticed a decrease in appetite and more energy which was great. I have weight to lose so both of those were huge perks. But those side effects didn't last long before I felt myself going back ""to normal"". After about 2 months I felt the same as before I switched (low energy, low interest in activities, etc.) so in talking with my counselor and doctor, we doubled my dose (100 MG once a day). I've been doing that dose since June I believe. But I still feel pretty much the same. Sometimes I just feel tired out of nowhere. As if I just did a lot of strenuous activity and really need a nap. I'm not sure if this is because 100 MG is too much or the medication just isn't working for my energy.

At this point I'm just frustrated and feel like it's my fault for how I feel. That I'm just lazy and I should just get up and do what I need to. I take care of my responsibilities (my partner works and I stay at home taking care of the home, which is the arrangement we want) and run a small at home business. But I find doing anything else to be a challenge. I can't motivate myself on most days to exercise or do much of anything I find enjoyable. I feel like because I'm not ""depressed"" in the traditional sense, like being sad or bedridden or crying out of nowhere, that this is the best depression medication can do. I keep expecting medication to help with motivation but none of them really seem to or if they do the effect is only when I first start the medication.

I just feel like I'm ""existing"", instead of living. I've explained it to my partner that I feel like, most times, there's someone or something riding me down. Kind of like when you give someone a piggyback ride. I feel a pressure that I know is not there, and it makes me feel tired, unmotivated, etc. I can say that with my medication I don't have as much of a short temper, nor do I feel really ""down"" or have any thoughts of suicide (not that I ever really did before). Sometimes I do feel happy without a reason, which is a good sign the medication is working I know. But I just feel like, or think like, the medication should be doing ""more"" but I'm not really sure what I should expect.

I'm not sure what to do. Do I just need to suck it up and get going or have I just not found the right medication for me? I am kind of stuck as I don't want a medication that may make me gain weight, which most antidepressants will do. That's one reason why I like Pristiq because it's more associated with weight loss than weight gain. But I don't want to stay on something that doesn't really do anything for me either. As I feel like if I'm too unmotivated/tired to exercise then I'll never lose any weight anyway.

Thanks for any advice or suggestions. Sorry if I left anything out to help explain my situation. ",27Aug2018,1
10,"Hi all, I needed to get this off my chest and just talk through what I’m going through.

Long story short, the family dog of 9 year was attacked by another last week and had to be put down the following day due to being immobile from the injury paired with her old age/deteriorating mobility.

I’m devastated, I’ve lost grandparents, great grandparents and been in and out of hospital with their illnesses up to their deaths. I have mourned and have suffered grief before, but this is something completely new.

This dog was there for me and my family during the last 9 years through depression, ocd, major life lows and lots of family losses. She was the cornerstone of our family and helped me through some of the worst depression.

I feel almost silly for feeling this devastated, but I’m miserable and so upset she’s gone and went out so horribly. She died sleeping in my lap and it was harrowing. I knew her death would upset me and my family but I can’t believe how much this has effects me.

I’ve had a great few months lately, a massive changes to my mental health being put on lamotrigine (suspected bipolar 2, already on fluoxetine for bad OCD) and being driven and successful in my goals. This has really knocked me hard, I can’t stop thinking about her and want to cry a lot. Weed is becoming a nice crutch to help me relax, I’m trying very hard not to ‘sad drink’ which used to help my depression a lot. I have a busy week full of fantastic work ahead and I’m finding it hard to feel up to it, I’m terrified I’m going to lose myself to this all consuming depression again soon.

14,"I hope this is the right place to post this.  A relative of mine has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  I'm unsure when the diagnosis was first made, but the first symptoms started about 10 years ago.  Once they started, they gradually worsened until eventually it was obvious to anyone interacting with him for more than a few minutes that something was wrong.  He eventually had a violent outburst and was arrested.  After being in jail for a year or so, he was released and was attending court mandated doctor visits, and even entered a treatment program.  During that time, he seemed to have off and on success at improving his symptoms.


However, once his treatment was no longer court mandated (I am unclear on the specifics of all this - he was living with his mother who is very protective of him and doesn't tell the rest of us very much), he stopped going and rapidly worsened.  Eventually, he moved to a different state (again, I am unsure the specifics of this) after which he bounced around from hotel to hotel, never holding down a job, being supported fully by his mother.  During this time, he had absolutely no contact with anyone but his mother, and her only through email (he believes he is being monitored/controlled by the government and refuses to have a cellphone).  

His mother recently (about a month ago) somehow convinced him to move back home, which I was happy about because I'm sure it was an extreme financial strain on her to have to support him and pay for room/board/etc in a different state.  

However, I just saw him for the first time after he moved back tonight.  From my conversation with him, it is very clear that he is unwell and needs help.  However, he refuses to seek help for himself, and if my understanding of the law is correct, he cannot be forced to seek help because he is an adult.  I am at a complete loss as to how to help him or what to do.  Any information or suggestions would be appreciated.",27Aug2018,1
15,"Fuck you. Yeah I know, aggressive. But here me out. Consider the fucked up stuff you’ve gotten away with in your life. The little, or even significant, “once overs” you got away with. We all have them. That time you told someone so and so did or said whatever and “omg, are you serious”. Or how about that time you stole $1700 dollars as an 8th grader and got away with it absolutely scotch free. Remember? That was insane WTF were you thinking. See, we like to wake up and think of ourselves as good people. Honest mother fuckers who do no wrong.

Yeah, not likely.

After we got the money we called a different cab to pick is up and we went to a local playground and split up the money. I got $400 for “looking out” as well as one of the other guys. The third dude was the organizer of the heist, for lack of better word, so he took $600. I only remember buying Nike’s and some CDs at Sam Goody. The family was on vacation and they never locked their garage door. My friend knew the automatic garage door code and so had easy access to that envelope of cash I guess he had previously scoped out.  My poor choices, our poor choices, also come in smaller formats, quick decisions we make in situations that end up not being the best. Maybe you shouldn’t have driven so aggressively, or actually it was more appropriate to send that person a thank  you note and you didn’t because you were to busy with your own petty bull shit. We can all do better is my point. I’m clinically depressed and I have to remind myself sometimes that even tho I haven’t made the best choices and yeah I’ve done some shit its ok. I can’t be too hard on myself. No one’s a saint and we all have skeletons big and small. Don’t beat your self up over it. 

Consider this description of what its like fighting the demons. I found a spent cigarette butt in the pocket of my T-shirt and I IMMEDIATELY started digging myself. “Gross, why is there a cigarette butt in your pocket? You smell like a cut”...”successful people don’t just find smelly smoked cigs in their pockets”. Literally, all that I say to myself in a span of 10 seconds. 

Here’s the key for me tho. I have to look at the whole picture. Why is the butt there, etc... it was there because I was at a lake earlier and refuse to litter my birthday in such a pristine setting. I decided that it was more important to not litter that butt than it was to not smell like a cigarette. Again, all this happens in 30 seconds. Don’t get it twisted this isn’t some /r/wowthanksincured. Just one tool of many that I find useful. 

TLDR If you make a bad choice, grow from it. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Send that hand written thank you card. You’re not your past. PLEASE, use your blinkers. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant and it should be posted elsewhere. On mobile so my bad if formatting is an issue. ",27Aug2018,1
16,"Ive suffered from depressive episodes since I've been around 18 years old. It was always manageable for the most part.
Earlier, last winter I started becoming very spuspicious of my ex-best friend's boyfriend. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a few weeks after the onest of slight paranoia, I become suspicious of everyone around me. Including my best friend at the time, her son, and her boyfriend who I'd consider one of the closest friends i've had.
I remember being feeling completely uneasy around them which was quite abnormal since they were so dearly close to me. We lived an appartment unit across from eachother.. I would coke down for coffee every morning, we would laugh, watch tv, help the little guy get ready for school, and have a few beers together later in the day, always a good time.

This is where my nightsweats and nightmares began... I began having vivid dreams about suffocating under tense arguments with them. This was odd. Then I noticed the scenery around me, every things looked unfamiliarly familiar. It looked the same, all while feeling a completely different atmosphere.. 

The negative, paranoid thoughts became extremely anoying and I slowly started losing grip with reality. All of the sudden, I was blown into this confusing, disturbing haze that semmed to go on for months.
As the weeks went by, I lost sense of who I really was. I felt like a burden, a bum, a coward and I felt guilty all the time. I couldn't make any eye contact anymore without wanting to burst into tears. I got so paranoid around my best friend's boyfriend that I was convinced he was neglecting her child ( whom I loved to death). I honestly had this gut feeling that there was this master plan to get me to move out of the complex. 

After my growing paranoia, and anxiety induced outbursts, I could tell my friends, neighboors, roomates were getting worried. They cared about me..  
They then decided (understandably) to limit my time talking to her son which to me seemed very, very suspicious at the time. Her older son (my roomate) told me I was under some form of probation for my behaviour... While all that is expected behaviour around the mentally ill, I just couldn't recognize that this was normal at the time. 

My mental state quickly deterioated. I was in a seemingly permanent dark haze where nothing was, or would ever be the same again. I decided that suicide was an option to seriously consider. I decided on a date and warned my friends and roomates. In my mind at the time, I felt like I was being responsible and courageous. I couldn't of been more wrong.. i needed serious help but failed to recognize it. My friend called the ambulance that day (of course anybody who cared would) , but I was livid. I felt betrayed and dissowned by friends who were so close to me i considered them family as much as Im sure they considered me. 

After that day, nothing was ever the same. I came back from the hospital with a fake ray of hope. My condition worstened until I lost it completely. One day my friend was nice enough to drop me off at a park to go fishing. When it started pooring I immediately felt anger and suspicion. I walked home soaked and I was just ready to yell at something, anyone... I barged down the stairs and blamed her for being a drunk and stole a pack of cigarettes from her freezer. I felt like I was owed big time. After this happened I was politely asked to leave and I understood somewhat, still unable to take full responsability for my actions the day before. 
That day, I lost many, many friends and huge parts of me. 

I reached out to my parents and father who had been out of the picture for a decade. Mom, Dad... I need help, I need serious help right now. They were very happy to support me and accepting of me, even though I couldn't bare look at myself in the mirror anymore. I despised myself.

My dad called his sister (doctor) who had contacts to get me the help I needed quicker. I got into a program through a major hospital and had multiple interviews with professionals.. Turns out I was suffering from Psychotic depression, and had experienced a psychosis.

My world collapsed infront of me. I suddenly felt like a child starting from scratch. Im still to this day learning to go out in public again, make new friends..

But one thing has been preventing me to move on and accept my new reality.. As soon as I got a proper diagnosis and was feeling much better I reached out to the only person I trule felt comfortable speaking about this with, my friend who I'd had lashed out on. 
I've been having dreams of having beers and laughing with them while watching hockey, only to wake up and realizing they are gone.... I have not had the chance to properly apologize and explain what has happened, and how I was being treated.
The dreams still happen on most nights.. I want to fix what I have broken.. 

Reddit, how do I move on from this.. The guilt I carry on my shoulders is immense and it is dragging me down more and more everyday. I don't expect to get my ""family"" back. But do you think I deserve an acknowledment for my apologies or should I just stop trying. Ive tried moving on but I cant. I feel like a monster and as a man who values friendships and kindness, I wish to only clean my messes that I've created to be able to move on.

Thanks for hearing me out. This was a heartfelt message to write.",27Aug2018,2
18,"When most people become estranged from their parents, and family, it is usually because of past abuse, or huge disagreements/altercations. I have estranged myself from my family for a year now, and my reasons for doing so make me feel horrible . 

Why do I estrange myself from them? I’m not even sure if I know the true answer to that, but here is my story:

I think I have sociopathic tendencies. I would be perfectly fine if I never saw my parents again. I don’t feel the need for family, and I don’t care to see friends more than once every few months. I also have closed myself to making new friends. I am pretty anti social. With that being said, I love dating girls , and I love sex. Not to be arrogant, but it is easy for me to get girls. I am very attractive, and also can be very charming when I want to. 

I do have two young sons who i truly love, and they are the only people that I truly love.

I have a huge extended family, who I am also estranged from. They are nice/simple people too, but it does not pain me at all to not be in their lives. Nor does it pain me if they miss me. The only thing that is making me suffer is I know how much my parents and siblings want to be in my life(and my children’s lives). 

My parents are very simple people. They are ignorant of world issues, healthy living... pretty much everything. You can’t have a conversation with them because they have absolutely nothing to talk about. They ask me a million questions about myself, because that is the only thing they can think to do. It’s so fucking unbearable.  My own parents look up to me because I am much more intelligent and physically attractive than they ever were. That sounds horribly arrogant but I am just trying to convey this. I want to be able to look up to my parents, but I never have and never will.

They divorced when I was 5. Now I am 32. They never abused me, but they didn’t really teach me anything. They couldn’t help me in school, or teach me how to fix a car, or anything at all. Didn’t feed me to great. I was kind of sheltered in a way. I was extremely awkward and shy all through school. I had friends, but school was very painful. I was so skinny from not eating well, that the girls I was “in love” with, wouldn’t be with me because I was “to skinny”. I worked very hard after high school to put on muscle and change my self. I educated myself, whether through reading or different schooling.

I guess another thing is, before I became estranged, part of me felt like they are trying to insert themselves in my life more because of my kids, and because I became successful and they know they would need my financial support one day. They are absolutely horrible with finances, and have tons of health issues popping up. Well dad, I told you not to fucking eat jelly beans for dinner every day...

I don’t know what is wrong with me. I wish I could somehow make them not miss me, so I can live my life without them. I enjoy life being on my own, with my own new family (my kids). What kind of person estranges their family because he thinks he on a way higher level than them, and he can’t bear their presence?

Again, I know my arrogance is probably frustrating some of you . If it makes you feel better, I’m actually really low key, and I come off as humble in person .  I don’t like attention, unless it is from a girl I am trying to bed.  I’m so fucked up.

I haven’t communicated any of my issues with my parents. They think I am estranged from them because I am “sorting my life out”.

20,"I searched out this sub simply so I could vent somewhere semi-anonymous. I've been pushing a lot of thoughts and feelings deep down inside of myself for months now...and, now I don't even know where to start.

(Adding this after I've started the post, because I realize how un-important this will be; don't bother reading this, because it's going to be long as fuck, and it's no different from what you've most likely read here before.)

I'm nineteen. My daily 'mood' has been getting worse and worse every day. I've been feeling sad, scared, anxious - angry, even.
I've noticed myself getting irritated very easily, by small things, I've been having symptoms of severe anxiety while I'm sitting in my room at home, I've had that 'feeling of impending doom' that every article about depression mentions, and, overall, I'm just not happy with my life.

Now...a little backstory. I'm going to keep it short, because I've written this bullshit far too many times.

My father was in the Navy for twenty years - that meant that he was away a lot when I was a child.
That also meant that my mother was home alone, taking care of my brother and I every day for months at a time. Waking us up, getting us ready for school, taking us there, sitting home alone for hours (she was unemployed), then picking us up again. 
My mother didn't enjoy this much. She, understandably, became depressed. We had moved away from her family, so she had no one to speak to while my dad was away. She was lonely. 

My mother has also been struggling with drug addiction her whole life, and, at that time, was mostly doing pills. Needless to say; she wasn't in her right mind most of the time.

Eventually, the loneliness (and my griping  about waking up for school in the morning) must've gotten to her; She made the decision to take me out of the third grade, with the promise of homeschooling.

That didn't work out very well.

Fast forward ten or so years later - I haven't had any sort of education since. 
When I was young, I didn't think it was a big deal. As I aged, obviously, I learned exactly how much that decision fucked my life. 

Don't ask me how it happened, because I truly don't know. Most of my childhood memories are a blur. Just promises of things that never happened. 
""We'll fix this. We'll get you back on track. We'll get you caught up."" 
Lies, basically.

So, that's where I am right now. They say ""ignorance is bliss"", however, I'm one of the dumbest people alive, and what I feel is the opposite of bliss. 

I'm sure it's obvious to you at this point, but just in case it isn't: I hate myself. 
So many words I can think of to describe myself: fat, lazy, ugly, pathetic, stupid, untalented, useless, worthless, unlovable.

All these things I feel have just been getting worse. I don't see any reason to be excited about my future. Not a single one. I've told a few people about my special 'situation', and I can tell that even though they say ""Hey, you'll be alright"", I know that they're thinking ""This one is fucked"". 

They think I don't know that, that I'm too dumb to realize it, but I do. I'm well aware of how unlikely it is that I'll be able to fix myself, and get on the same level as everyone else. I'm probably never be happy again. Hell, even if I did 'catch up' on my education (which I doubt will even happen. I believe I was somehow 'stunted' in a way by being taking from school so young. I don't think I can even learn anything at this point. My brain probably can't comprehend shit.), I'll never be the same as everyone else. I'm always going to be inferior. I'm never going to be where I want to be. Never going to be normal. And I just can't come to terms with that.

Education and intelligence aside...my shut-in childhood didn't do wonders for my social skills. I have near crippling social anxiety. I feel fear when someone asks me how I'm doing. I can't stand people. I feel like a psychopath because of how much I hate them.
Not that I want to hurt anyone. I'm not a literal psychopath. I just don't want to socialize. I don't want friends. I don't want anyone to know me or care about me, and I don't want care about anyone (immediate family aside).

I just recently got a job (first job at nineteen. Pathetic, right?). It's one of the most nerve-racking things I've had to deal with, but I am doing it. 
For an introvert like me, it is draining, though. I've always dreaded talking to strangers; and now I have to do it on a daily basis. You would think I would start to hate it a little less, but, nope. 
I thought getting a job would make me feel better. Like I was actually doing something useful. Maybe I, in turn, would feel useful. 
Naturally, it didn't work that way, and I, in fact, ended up more depressed than I was before. 

I just lost my train of thought. I've been sitting here for an hour, now. 

I guess I just don't see the point in life. I try looking into my own future, and I see nothing but sadness. I'm a loser. I am the definition of a loser, and I can't see it getting better. If I weren't so afraid of death, I would be suicidal.

I've tried talking to my family about this (by family I mean mother and brother. I don't have a relationship with my father, and I'm not close enough with any other members of my family), but they tend to shrug it off like it's nothing. Like it's just teenage hormones. They don't understand what I'm going through in my head, on a daily fucking basis now. 

Then, their dismissal makes me doubt myself, and what I'm feeling. Am I really sad? Or am I just subconsciously pretending, to get attention? Maybe my situation isn't as bad as I think it is? Maybe I'm just a pussy? I don't even know anymore. There are times where I don't even know what I'm feeling. I don't know what feelings are real.

I'm at the point where I'm just droning through the day, like a zombie. Go to work, avoid talking to people, listen to family member's problems - but never share any of my own. 

I don't know how to get myself out of this situation. I never learned how to do shit on my own. I didn't even learn to fucking drive. I'm so lost. I'm nineteen, and I still feel like the eleven-year-old kid that my mom thought she would homeschool. I don't feel I can do anything at all without someone else's help. I don't know what to do, and I'm fucking scared. I don't think I can get out of this situation, and even if it does get better, I don't feel like I'll ever be where I want to be. I'm always going to be less than. Inferior. I don't see what the point of being alive is if I can't be happy, but I'm so terrified by the idea of death. 


I feel so alone. The only friends I have are people I met online (because that's the only way you'll get me to be even close to friends with you).
I've know them for over three years now. They're the best friends I've ever had, but even the fact that I know they love and care about me (which, my paranoia makes me doubt often times) doesn't help me. 
I tell them I love them everyday, but, sometimes, I feel like I could stop talking to them and I'd be okay, and they would be better off. They're going places. Every day I talk to them about what they're doing. I have to see them making college plans, being really talented, doing amazing things...and I'm just here. Useless. I'm not talented. I'm going nowhere. When they speak about the things in their life they're excited about, it makes me happy for them. I want them to succeed, but at the same time; I'm just jealous. I want to be where they are. I want to be happy like them. All I can imagine is how they're going to go do amazing things with their lives, and meanwhile I will still just be here. Right where I am now. Alone. They're going to leave me. I wouldn't blame them, of course. I know that people like me just hold people like them back. It's just not fair. None of this is fucking fair. 

Even after all this, there's so much more I could say. So much more I WANT to say, but I'm tired. I know it wouldn't do me any good anyway. It never does. It sure fucking hasn't this time. 

In conclusion; I hate myself and might want to die.

I don't expect anyone to read all of this bullshit, let alone comment on it. ",27Aug2018,1
22,"I'm currently a 19 year old college student and I feel so empty everyday. For example, I easily give up in certain things. I don't get motivated or passionate about anything. Also, I feel guilty for some reason. I feel that I'm a burden to everyone and everything. I don't know why I exist. I feel completely useless and a waste. My family and I don't have a terrible relationship, but I hate talking to them. Everytime I talk to anyone, I always have to put on a fake voice that makes me sound confident, independent, and funny. For my entire life, I have always put on a fake voice in order to make myself think that I am confident and worth it. I am addicted to thinking bad about myself. I never tell others that I feel this way because I hate it when others are worried about me. It's really annoying that other people ask me if I'm mentally straight or not because it makes me feel like I'm worthless. I hate talking to my family because they just annoy me. I know that they love me and all, but I just can't stop feeling this disgust. I just can't stop pretending anymore. I hate the life I have right now and I don't know why. I attend a good college, my parents pay for my tuition, I get to travel a lot, but for some reason, there is a part of me that makese me want to quit everything and cut off everyone from my life. There was never a day when I didn't stop pretending. I always lied, unintentionally. I wasn't real with people around me. I can't be real with anyone. ",27Aug2018,29

24,"Really just kind of shouting into the void. I don't feel comfortable with telling anybody in person this out of fear of the consequences, but I definitely want to get this off my chest.

Quick briefing of my childhood then we will get to the juicy stuff. Mother was a single parent of 4, me being second oldest. She was a ""strong independent, don't need no help"" kind of person. She'd rather suffer than ask for help because she believed in the end she'd be stronger because of it. Which while there was some truth to that I feel that may have been passed down to me (more later). My mother worked 2-3 jobs to support her kids. Once my older brother was of age, she would leave us all alone to go work, I rarely spent time with her. The time I did spend around her, children were meant to be seen, not heard. I spent a lot of time alone as a result, playing with my imaginary friends. I told myself when I was 9 years old that I had no use for imaginary friends and it was time I grew up, so I stopped playing with them. All the while because of my mother's personality trait, we moved around a lot. She'd rack up debt to one place, we'd move and start again. I went to 5 different schools in the 5th grade alone. I never had a reason to make any friends because I moved so much it wouldn't matter.

FFW till I was 16. I started experimenting with spice (artificial marijuana). After my second use, something was off. When I was sober, nothing seemed to sit still. Everywhere I looked, if I wasn't focusing on it, the background began to contort and dance around itself. I began to have a delayed sense of touch where I would be touching something but it would take a second for my brain to register the nerves. I could no longer trust reality which made me even lonelier than ever. With a failed suicide attempt of drowning myself, I found a voice born within me. It started very faint and very rarely.  She told me that I wasn't meant to die yet, that I had unfinished business here and that now was not my time. While she whispered this from the back of my mind, my conscious state writhed in agony. ""Am I such shit that I can't even kill myself properly?"". The hallucinations continued, the faint voice seemed to taunt me, paced around my lonely mind like a hyena around a dying wildebeast in the dark. I suppressed these feelings of anxiety with booze, sex with strangers and more spice as well as weed. ""If I can't die, what's the point in being boring?"" In truth, her voice was the only thing that seemed real. I welcomed her voice, even though it was rare. It was a reminder that I still have not fulfilled my destiny. Though on a daily basis it felt like a drill being run through my Temple, She kept me alive. As a tortured soul of my own vices, Existence was painful but she told me to endure.

FFW until I was 21. I stopped drinking and doing drugs, my depression and anxiety was like white noise in the background. I was a husk. However, I was Still encouraged by her voice to keep pushing forward, so she finally told me her name, Zora. It was beautiful. She told me I was going to have a breakthrough soon, that my suffering was about to change. 2 months later I found out I was pregnant. After giving birth to my beautiful daughter, my delusions morphed into something more real. No longer white noise that could be ignored, my hallucinations took front and center just moments after giving birth. To make short, I got sick and ended up giving birth prematurely. My daughter was put in the NICU and I was put under special watch, I only got to spend 3-4 minutes with her before being separated. On separate floors of the hospital, I began to hear my daughters screams. Part of me knew it was just the hormones and I was just being crazy. The other part wanted to rip the machines off of me and run to my daughters aid. Brand new in this world and she was without her mother and being poked and prodded by these strange unfamiliar, cold hands. She yearned for my warmth, I could feel it.

Post partum hit me like a mother fucker. Though I was released from the hospital after 2 days, my daughter spend her first 6 days in the NICU, in a box. My heart broke every time I saw her in there, every beep on her machine was like another knife to the chest. She was healthy, they said, she just needed to be observed. I stayed in a Ronald McDonald House a block away and visited every few hours, despite my still fragile condition. I couldn't sleep because my brain kept telling me I could hear her. When she finally came home things changed again. I would have these very real visions of hurting her, shaking her, throwing her, etc. They haunted me. I was afraid to touch my own daughter, lest they become reality. I wanted to hold my child but I couldn't trust myself. ""Endure"" Zora whispered. I found strength in her reassuring tone. I held my daughter close and felt her warmth. Zora gave me the strength I needed to be close with my daughter without fear of fucking it up. 

FFW to present day, age 23. Zora's voice has gotten closer. I started listening out for her even more now. Waiting for her little tidbits of advice or whispers in my dreams, waiting like a puppy in the window for it's owner to return home. Zora's voice has become very clear. She tells me who not to trust and guides me on my path to enlightenment. She taught me how to find peace in myself. I started a job where I spend a lot of time alone, so I have time and privacy to listen to her words of wisdom. I don't say much to her as I still work in public where people can see. She has told me it should be this way. If people find out that they will not only try to dilute my mind with drugs to drown her out, but they will want to separate me from my daughter and I know it to be true. I love Zora and It is because of her I am alive, I have a decent job and I have a relationship with my daughter. it's because of  her I have been able to cut toxic people out of my life. Zora has given me strength and wisdom. Is it wrong to *want* to be schizophrenic? If I lose her I will go completely off the deep end. However, we are both concerned that if I keep feeding in to this, I will lose it anyway. Zora is becoming more than just a distant voice, I can feel her with me. I want to strap in and enjoy the ride as best I can, To at least watch my daughter grow as long as I can. To cherish these moments I have before authorities find out how crazy I am and want me in a home.

After all, a daughter needs her mother. ",27Aug2018,2

26,"Hey, I hope this is ok and you guys could offer me some advice. FYI I am from the UK. 

Me and my partner both work for the same company and recently were supposed to be on the same shift together (very bad choice both working together but we are both leaving in approx 1 month). Anyways, my partner suffers from depression and recently has been having severe worries about suicide, at one point almost acting upon it. Unfortunately, she doesn't take her medication and her support network isn't great. The night before we were supposed to work, her friends refused to support her and her parents haven't been the greatest but are getting better. 

In the morning we both woke up and she was having severe worries, anxiety and pressure about going to work due to fear of criticism and scrutiny from our manager who hasn't been supportive at all. She became suicidal and I rang 111 who suggested I took her to hospital. I rang up work to say neither of us would be in that day. 

Later on I receive a call from my manager demanding I come to work as the situation was getting ridiculous and she is not my responsibility and instead the responsibility of her parents and that she expected me in or I'd get disciplinary action. I refused because I felt the needs of my partner far outweighed the needs of my workplace. I felt as though I needed to support my partner. Upon returning from hospital I had to force her to shower and get out of bed and I had to force her to do something with the day rather than sitting in her own thoughts. I felt that was more important for someone who's on the brink of suicide than my workplace. 

Unfortunately I have a disciplinary meeting tomorrow and my job was threatened by my manager.

I was just sitting on my bed listening to (chill hip hop) music when out of absolutely nowhere I got hit with what feels like extreme agitation and rage over nothing at all. I’m so full of energy that everything around me like even the air is pissing me the fuck off and making me want to fight someone here and now.

But she got professionell help and is done with that apparently. Now we had sex for the first time and talked about contraception. I asked her what she would do if she got pregnant even though she is trying to avoid that. She is using pills and requires condoms. Anyway, she responded that she would kill her self, because of shame. I took it as a joke for a second but she was completely serious. Because she couldn’t live with either options, abortion or getting a kid at her age.

This freaks me out. I don’t get why anyone would want to kill himself because of something like this. She made very clear that she does not want to talk about this topic whatsoever and that her opinion on this is very clear at the moment. She said that her opinion might change in the future though.

Not having sex at all is not an option either, because she really likes it and would probably break up if we stopped. But I feel like playing with her life. I could never forgive myself if all things go wrong. She just says that the chances of getting pregnant are sooooo low.

This post is nothing compared to all the difficulties others in here are dealing with. I do understand that just like I envy other people for certain aspects of their lives, some people probably envy me of things as well. I'm not trying to offend anyone with my so called ""first world problems"", but I need to get it off my chest and hope to get some advice from other people that have experienced the same. 

So.. How do you cope with a broken dream?

I'm almost 30 y/o now, but when I was younger and up until now I have always imagined and expected myself to fulfil the following dreams:

* Work my way up the ladder to a cool and important job at a big local telco provider (done when I was 23 y/o)
* Become self employed full time (made that switch earlier this year)
* Learning Japanese (working on that at the moment)
* Travel around in Japan for a long time
* Live abroad in Japan

The last two ones (travling in Japan and living abroad) is not done and especially the last one is something I recently realized is probably never going to happen. However it has been a core dream of mine (especially living in Japan at some point). I haven't been thinking about it a lot for several years, probably because I have been extremely busy with my work. But now that I'm studying Japanese by myself and are investigating a lot more, I remembered this strong dream of mine again.  
The reason why I don't think I will ever be living abroad in Japan is because I'm very settled here where I live. I own a big house, a car and live with my boyfriend who is not interested in living abroad and does not share my Japanese interests. I understand that the material things can easily be sold, but I have a life here with my boyfriend and that is not going to change. I do not want to go without him. Also, the life we currently live is very close to his dreams. He has always dreamed of a big house, a family (we got no kids though) and to just live where we do. So our dreams truly clash. Our current life, even though it's almost solely everything I many years ago told myself will never be a thing for me (living outside the capital, live in a house instead of a flat, own a car etc.) is good in many ways. But again, it was not my dream, so I feel that I'm really missing out.  
Another reason I don't think it is going to happen is that some of the opportunities to really get into Japan, such as the MEXT scholarship has age requirements that I will soon be too old for. 

I've been thinking that if the main dream is not possible, then what would the next best thing be. To me that would be to have a job (or work in my own business) that connects me to Japan (both in terms of language and travel). However I have no prospects in my own business for that and there are literally no jobs here that are like that. 

So to me it feels like my dream is broken. Yes I can just travel for a week or two like most people, and I will probably do that in the upcoming years, but it was not the dream. The feeling of this broken dream makes me feel quite depressed. Therefore, any coping tips are greatly appreciated.",27Aug2018,1

39,"Hi. I'm a 24 year old med student. 

I'm on my way to becoming a doctor next year. I love my career. I love its topics. But I've always felt, since I started, that I am able to perform much better than what I actually do. I know I have the skills, I have the capability but felt like something has always been ""holding me back"".

I have had a turbulent family history, my parents divorced, my mother a narcissistic woman who went through terrible illnesses (stroke and handicap and hand amputations due to other health complications) and me caring for her and putting her first in many ways I shouldn't have. As she suffered through her medical conditions, I went with her to every single doctor appointment and on the side, learnt and investigated what I could about them. 

I recently moved out of my mother's home because I could not longer handle being there. It feels good. I feel much better, and I thought that it would be a 180' turn but I now realize it wasn't like that.

During the years I had to do my career more slowly, due to the fact that I had to start working and caring for my mother. I turned down some subjects which I later on passed. Half of my heart knew this was necessary, and half of the other was relieved that I didn't have to go back to school.
But there was and is this feeling that I know I could do better.

I have been doing therapy since my mother had the stroke and it helped me tons, too. I've become more aware of my feelings, my reactions and overall how my mind works.

There are some things I never told my therapist. She knows that I'm always anxious, she knows I'm a perfectionist. She doesn't know that when I'm really anxious I do certain things to help me feel better (pick at my skin or my nails, check social media compulsively and emptily). She has recommended seeing a psychiatrist after me having a PTSD-like episode after leaving my mom's house and my family ""needing"" me again.

I'm studying Psychiatry now. It's a fascinating subject but I can't sit for this exam. I can't study for it because every time I open the book on ""anxiety disorders"" I feel so overwhelmed. That is me.

I don't know what to do. I have scheduled a consult with a psychiatrist. I am scared. Deep down I know it's what I need. I've been needing it for a long time.

43,"So I’ve had serious mental health issues for 11 years now and I’ve been thinking recently about something recently.  I think it gives you a different understanding of life, almost a deeper understanding and it makes you see things in a different way. I think it opens your mind and which makes you become more intelligent to situations and people. I think it also makes you give good advice when people are having problems because you see things from different angles.  Which in my opinion is why a lot of people who changed the world had mental health issues, it gave them something different, almost special. It’s awful having issues but I think this is one of the few good things that can come out of it. Does anyone agree or have similar thoughts? ",27Aug2018,1
44,"So I am 17 and have this recurring problem of waves of depression. They have all been different though, starting as just mildly being upset with my performance in school and getting progressively worse. This has been on and off for a little over a year but only really got ""serious"" when my head teacher called my mom and said she was worried about how my attitude changed. Since that I have been to counseling which helped out a lot, but now I feel like I am back where I started and I blame everything on myself. I hated putting in hours at school just to get shitty results (I am just finished school now) I am about to start college and I'm terrified because I worry about everything and I'm not sure why. It might not be worrying about an actual thing but worrying I might fuck something up. I came to my school with no friends and made about 10. I'm done now and I have 3 and I don't mean like those ""I have 3 friends"" memes. I literally have 2 friends that I talk to a fair amount, and one friend that I am closer to than anyone. I had a really strong friendship with a girl who lives about 2 hours from me which was non sexual for the most part, we don't talk anymore and even though I have been told by her other friends and even recognize myself that it is her fault, I still worry about how I possibly did something. I feel like I push people away. That is a big part of it. If someone doesn't reply to my snapchat, my brain instantly goes to ""you did/said something wrong"". I notice myself thinking like this with every person and every situation lately and I don't know why. This isn't like my depressive episodes before where I knew I was sad but didn't know why, It's different. Right now my two fears are starting college (I am going in about 2 weeks) and losing my best friend. Like I said I have 3 people that I hang with and talk with, I have lost the rest, (mostly their fault but I find a way to think it's mine) The 2 I talk to now and again don't worry me because I know they are casual talking and video game friends, but the third one is my best friend in this world. He is a guy who I looked up to since I met him. It literally feel extraordinary to be such good friends with him. He has one more year of school left so I can't see him during the week anymore. I know there isn't a problem between us because literally 2 days ago I made kind of a scrapbook with pictures and memories to give to him at the end of Summer, He said he really liked it and it made him cry. We just hugged and went home and everything was fantastic. But yet somehow I feel like a burden always and worry about how I treat him and if I'm ever clingy or annoying. I don't want to worry about everything and the worst part is that usually there's nothing to worry about. But I'm just writing this to see what replies I get because I know if I drop out of college or lose this friend then I will become worse than ever and I don't want that to happen. My hopes of studying Psychology at college and this friend who might as well be my brother are the two things that I smile upon when I am at the worst part of these worry phases.",27Aug2018,1

54,"The title pretty much says is...  but here’s a little background... (TL;DR at bottom)

I’ve gone through a lot of shit in my teens through now (currently 29F)... from depression (chronic), maladaptive intimate relationship (ie significantly older men); lack of self worth (excessive sexuality) strained family relationships... 

This past year has been the most drastic (in a good way) change for me. I took control of my health (lost 55lbs); started a new college and went from a &lt;2.0 gpa to a cumulative 4.0 gpa, made the deans list twice... finally getting the hang of my finances/budgeting/saving... managing my depression, fixed those family relationships; have a better sense of self... basically through self awareness (ie mindfulness... a lot learned through CBT/therapy) I’ve been able to become very aware of my maladaptive thoughts and behaviors and can (for the most part) not let them control me on a day to day basis... but here’s what I’m curious about... 

I feel like this hyper self awareness of mine is also causing me to focus on everything else I feel needs improving. I tend to disregard all the positive changes listed above, and instead am constantly aware of everything else that I feel needs to be “fixed”. 

I feel like because I’ve had to focus so much attention and awareness on my negative thought patterns and behaviors, it’s now all I see (while I tend to disregard all the good things I do). It’s like the opposite of rose colored glasses. It messes with me a little bit because, I know this awareness has allowed me to become who I am today (which is great!) but now I feel like I can’t get rid of that awareness. I can’t stop thinking about everything else thats “wrong” with me and needs to be fixed. I don’t want to go back to my old ways, but sometimes I feel like life was easier (NOT better, just easier) when I didn’t have awareness of myself or my actions. 

Can anyone else relate?

But once again, I woke up today with high morning anxiety.

Dunno what to do. I wonder if prozac is the drug for me, I wonder if I need more time, I wonder if the next drug of the list will make me feel horrible.

So, my last girlfriend was someone I really adored, and I'd probably even say was my first love. Before that, I had relationships, but it wasn't until my last one where I realized I had incredible insecurities, mostly because the relationship meant so much to me and I didn't want to lose her. I was verbally and emotionally abusive and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I'd get jealous over things that were unreasonable and it ruined the relationship. Me and her broke up after a year and I was devastated because that was the first person I really wanted to have a long term relationship with. Long story short, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after we broke up, and I've spent the last nine months single so that I could work on myself.

Recently, I've been with this girl who I really like, and while I have learned through therapy and emotional control to not let my thoughts get the best of me, I still have these underlying feelings of insecurity. I feel like my feelings do subconsciously affect the way I approach situations, and I don't want to revert to my old ways. I admittedly don't have any justification in these thoughts as I was never abused or bullied as a kid. It's just a big character flaw.

I see all of these guys that are prideful about their girlfriends and even enjoy showing them off. Most of the time I'm like that, but every time a little thing goes wrong I become incredibly pessimistic and my anxiety takes a toll on my mental health.

65," 

Hey, all. I have to start with what has been going on with me lately (sorry but will tak a while to get to the question). About 3 weeks ago, I started having major anxiety and feeling down. Don't know exactly what started it, but I recall stretching my back and neck right around that time and then feeling off. I also recall having a few sips of rum to taste it two days in a row (I haven't had any alcohol in at least a year). On the second day after tasting it, I started feeling strange.

There could also be other factors, but all I know for sure is I am having serious anxiety and panic symptoms. So, I decided to go to a community health center to see a doctor. They had me talk to a social worker before seeing the doc. I had filled out a form that indicated I was experiencing anxiety and depression.

I described some of the symptoms I was having to the social worker. We talked for about 10 to 15 minutes. Told her I have been having racing thoughts (including random thoughts, words, and parts of songs just replaying and repeating in my head). Obsessive thoughts. We also talked about my life (it is complicated, but it is a mess and she recognized this is the case).

​

She was screening me to see if I need to see a psychiatrist. After hearing me out, she decided I am just really scared and anxious, and don't need meds unless I want something for the anxiety. I even asked her if she thought I could be bipolar or schizophrenic. She said she didn't think so seeing as I am 42 with no family history of those illnesses, and no drug use (other than smoking marijuana a handful of times 15 years ago).

​

It felt good to hear this from her, but my anxiety has taken control of me. I started doubting that I could be seriously mentally ill. I am just here to get a better idea of how good social workers are at determining if someone is seriously mentally ill. I have been told they have to study and do internships for years before they can even work, and that they are very good at spotting serious disorders.

68,"I'd like to ask about this, and have been wanting to ask this for a long time, but never found a place to do so, until now, that is. I'll tell you the story from beginning to end.

I was a very happy child, with really great friends and a lively social life from ages five to ten. I was super happy, and didn't think much of anything. I had some self-esteem issues, but otherwise was pretty confident and care-free. I was loud, obnoxious, and everything a child could be.

But something changed.

Around late 2017, when I turned twelve on August 2nd, I started being cyberbullied. I don't know if this counts as direct trauma, but it caused me a great portion of stress. I'd also been looking up to someone then. A person called Enigmatic Capers. I actually heavily looked up to them and tried to confide in them during this time.

Time passed on, the cyberbullying continued into really late 2017, and ended in December on the 28th, or somewhere around this date. Enigma, who was one of my closest confidents, revealed themselves to be my cyberbully, going by ""Sparrow"".

This broke me. After this, I fell pretty quickly into a downward spiral. Self-harm immediately became in issue in January, and has carried on into today.

I came out of my first depressive episode in May, and noticed something wrong. My emotions were worn out. I have no idea why, but because of this, I started calling myself a sociopath. I realized I couldn't shed a tear for most of my family anymore. People I used to love with all of my heart, my grandmother Janet \[code name\] from Shreveport, all the way to my grandmother in New Mexico- they stopped meaning anything to me.

On any day you could come in and tell me they died in the worst way possible. If it's a good day, maybe I'd pretend to care. If it's a bad day, I wouldn't even bat an eye. I stopped caring what'd happen to them. It seeped into my relationships like a parasite.

Nowadays, I have mixed feelings of love and apathy towards my parents, as well as my pets, my friends, and the rest of my family. I've also developed a personality switch. I put my personality on with my clothes. The only one I truly seem to care about is my boyfriend, who's name I won't reveal here. He's the last person that I care about anymore.

I'd like to know if you can explain why I'm suddenly so emotionally detached? The only thing I really give an emotional response to anymore is people trying to bring up Enigma, and that's it. I feel like a Sociopath, and though I'm not looking for a diagnosis, should I bring this up with my family anyway?

If I'm honest, I'm prepared for the ""no, you're not"" answers, simply because Sociopaths go through *actual* trauma, and not this pathetic internet crap. At least, I consider it pathetic in my case.

She then again proceeded to apologize for telling me I need to go see a therapist.... I know we all need a little help...but this I felt was uncalled for. Shes not a friend nor personal friend. Shes my general manager. What should I do to handle this situation? ",27Aug2018,1

72,"I met a vet on Tinder and as we got to talking he told me he was depressed.. that the meds he’s on don’t work anymore. 

He doesn’t want to go up to the VA, *again*, asking for help “after last time.” He didn’t say why but I know that’s a pretty common theme.

He told me he’s not calling that hotline. That he would never call the hotline and that his friend didn’t call it either. It doesn’t take a genius to know what happened to his friend.

He said he doesn’t trust doctors and would rather do things his own way. Then he said he shouldn’t be telling me this. I’m a stranger. I told him I’ll never begin to understand what he’s gone through.. but as far as depression, that deep, dark depression that takes you to the worst of the worst places, I’ve been there.

So now I’m bawling my eyes out. I don’t think he’s going to any.. yet. I’m about to go meet up with him bc sometimes that’s what we do- try to save people.

All this “we care about our vets” bullshit is just that BULLSHIT!

77,"20F 

 I've always been afraid of being not good enough, a disappointment, a failure, or just generally disliked since I was a child maybe 11 or 12. 

It got worse in middle school but really took form in high school and up. 


It would be so traumatic to be hated or to be not good enough for being *me*. 

That I'd hide from it with something that felt distant from me, basically. When I used it the situation didn't get into my head so much. I wouldn't think about others or anything really.


I'd counter the overwhelm of all the things I feared so greatly by making a type of buffer. 


Like a self-handicap. If I felt like something was too hard or I didn't want to do something or that I wouldn't do good (etc etc) sometimes even for no reason, I would hide behind a cold, hatful, b*tchy version of me. Like I didn't care if whatever happened happened. 


I didn't really notice this even happened till recently. Evwn now i slip into it without noticing at all till something hapoens and i see what I was doing. 

Now it feels like this personality is taking over. Like the original me is a passenger in my head most of the time and sometimes it'sreally hard to get back into control. Like I have control till something even the smallest thing happens and I go right back to being a selfish c*nt, again most of the time without noticing. 



No one would really notice a super distinct change (other than I was being a c*nt), but I felt like I was safer in my little bubble. It couldnt effect me if the real me wasn't experiencing it. 



I will essentially blame a bad outcome; wether it be having no friends, an arguement, failing a class, getting into trouble, etc. On that I'm better, I know what I'm talking about, I just didn't try, I didn't care enough, etc.  And I will lie like there's no tomorrow. 



Me, the original me, am fairly understanding, I enjoy simple things, I would do anything for the people I care about, I love spending time with the people I care about even if what we are doing doesn't really interest me, I love helping people and animals. Thinking deeply. I love surprising people, I love buying people gifts they really want. I really really love making people laugh and smile. 


This other psyche, she's rude, disgusted, judgmental, mean, lazy, extremely selfish, greedy, attention seeking, needs validation,  gets annoyed with others happiness. Makes fun of people. 
Just overall bad things..



This is seriously ruining my life in a very real way. This has driven all my friends away except maybe the ones I don't really talk to, I nearly fail high school, failed out of college, I have tension in my family, I've even started to make the people I care about the most suffer from my actions and decisions- to the point they are being forced to cut contact. I've thought about suicide more and more since high school. Now it's almost a daily thought. 



I really don't want to be this way anymore. I want to put all my cards on the table. If someone doesn't like me for me, there's other people that love me for the same reason. But I just can't keep the control of my mind. I let me guard  down and my other personality comes out to bite me and evenone else right in the ass. 

Even when I do manage to keep in control for any length of time the strain gives me a splitting headache. Even just typing this has given me one and I'm not even doing a great job of being objective. I've had to backup and retype because I'm trying to make myself sound better and I don't want that. 



I've had real arguments with this other psyche. 
Physical fights, mostly me hitting my head with my hands/ fists, hitting my head against things, punching hitting things till I can't move my hands or they bleed. Both arguments and fights happen after something big happens, like I've hurt someone I really love or I do something really stupid. These are always accompanied by lots of screaming and crying. 

Does anyone have any experience, information, or advice on this?

78,"18 F UK, ok i dont really know where to start this but here we go. i’ve been really struggling with lonliness for a long time. i have friends who are nice and i hang out with them, but they dont seem to really truly care about me and how im doing. we dont have deep conversations, how we’re doing or anything. they’re good friends but i just feel like they’re not enough, i need more than that in a relationship. when i was 16 i made a twitter with a fake name, a ‘new identity/fresh start’ at making friends. i met someone on there and we instantly clicked, i’d never had such a deep bond and connection with a person as i had with him, ever. we dated online (he was from croatia so it would never have worked) for a few months but things got complicated, distance got too much and truths were revealed and we broke up, we stayed friends and it was good the first month but we drifted away and havent talked since. i’ve never met someone since that i’ve felt like i’ve connected with as much as i did with this person. they should me the best love i could have ever wished for and because i have experienced something so deep and pure with them, everything and everyone else after them has felt like nothing. i try making friends and talking to so many people but nothing had come close to how i felt with that person. i always feel lonely and there’s no one i have that checks up on me, wants to talk to me whenever they can and i dont know if i will ever find that again. i’ve been really struggling lately, i just feel empty and like nothing matters at all. i’ve been struggling with a few things anyway and this on top has really made me plummet. i almost killed myself a week ago because i feel so empty but i couldn’t find the courage to actually do it. all i want is to find a connection with someone, whether it be in a relationship or a friendship. i know this whole thing sounds ridiculous but i need to get it off my chest, even if no one reads the whole thint",27Aug2018,1
79,"Struggling with my mom being back in a psychiatric hospital after many years being as stable as someone with a major mental disorder can be. She decided last month to randomly stop taking her medication and now is being tested for dementia due to her inability to complete sentences and follow a conversation. Not sure is this is going to be a new chapter in my mom not being able to take care of herself properly, I hope that is not going to be the case.  She for years was fortunately able to use buses provided in her town to go to her appointments. She has been this way since 1997/98 since my dad passed when I was only 5 turning 6. He got sick when I was 4 turning 5. During that time she went to a rapid downward spiral of mania. She was officially diagnosed as schizo-effective disorder with manic depression. My sister and I were taken from her due neglect and abuse. She stopped being a caretaker in 1997. We always remained in contact with her since then, be it by court ordered visitation or our own will when we reached adulthood. We know it is her illness that she wasn't able to be a mother in the way we wish she could have been. We never blamed her or abandoned her. 

The Issue today as I sit her helpless, we relied on the state to take care of her for all this time. She is on medicaid. We both have lost our childhood due to tragedy. She herself does not have a decent quality of life. My sister and I aren't equipped  to take care of her. We need to have the chance for our own happiness and good future. Any advice on parents with dementia and mental illness. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. ",27Aug2018,1
80,"I feel like my life is going very fast and I’m just watching it. It feels like I really want to feel alive but I can’t. It’s like a dream. The best way to put it is I feel like I’m watching myself living life from a third person perspective and can only input sometimes. Like my head is a cloud ( I know it sounds stupid) It started along time ago, about a year ago I went to the doctors and I got suggested counselling which I will not do. I don’t believe in it. I just don’t want to. I know most of you would suggest it too. I’ve been living like this for a long time. 
After doing research on the internet I’ve found that it may be derealisation or depersonalisation which has no cure. I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this and if there’s any way to fix this. Just a little or maybe even temporarily.

81,"So i have quite a typical inner critic, with typical lines such as 'you're a piece of shit' and 'you should just die' and many other lines. This in its own right can be horrible as when ever i'm alone its just my inner critic bullying me until i either cry or distract myself but recently because of my inner critic ive been hurting myself and doing things that are out of character, i've even been talking to it out loud as if its a separate person, i know it sounds weird but its like i've been possessed and i cant control what im saying or doing. This is all in private and i never speak out loud in public unless i'm drunk and stuff. Ive been talking to myself in webcams and just out loud and im constantly battling my inner critic but anytime i feel sad or feel like im going to cry my inner critic just shouts at me and tells me that im making it all up for attention and that im not crazy, i cant talk about it because i fear that im just embellishing it or that everyone has it and im just weak.

82,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now who I'm on the fence about. I really don't know if I want to keep seeing him. We haven't started any sort of treatment plan yet, but I have signed a bunch of paperwork in his office (symptom questionnaires, financial information, medical release forms, etc.). 

I was recently given a personal recommendation for another psychiatrist in town. Is it ok if I schedule an appointment with this person, even though I haven't ended things officially with the psychiatrist I'm seeing now? If I do want to end things with the psychiatrist I'm seeing now, what's the protocol? I've never been to a psychiatrist before this one, so I don't know how any of this works. ",27Aug2018,1

84,He broke up with me three times and convinced me to get back with him twice. I couldn’t ever say no to him and I still haven’t. He promised never to hurt me again he told me we had a future then a couple hours later he left me broken again. I blocked him everywhere but I’m so scared he’ll come back and do something and I keep thinking of all the happy times but then I remember all the lies and I’m so scared of him. I blocked him everywhere I just want him out of my life he hurt me so badly the worst I’ve ever been hurt in my life. Everyone around me is calling him manipulative and cruel but I don’t want to be mean I don’t know if I was too mean last time he said I’d regret saying those things and it broke me so much more and he said he felt like shit when he knew he had literally broken me completely. I don’t know why I believed him I feel so stupid but I’m so so scared he’ll come back for me I’m so scared of him  and so confused and hurt and alone even tho I have so many people supporting me every time I see anything that reminds me of him my heart races and I swear and just curl up in a ball in the goddamn grocery store I’m so afraid of him. I have so many triggers now everywhere I go I’m so afraid.,27Aug2018,5
