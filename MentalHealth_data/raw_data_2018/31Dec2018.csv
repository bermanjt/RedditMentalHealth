0,"I had a moment today when a coworker said something that really upset me. I was a little upset about what they said, but I wanted to bring it up to them in a calm manner. However, that was the opposite of what I did. 

I went up to them and brought up what happened and how it made me feel really bad. I ended up being kind of aggressive and over emotional and I was shaking really badly the entire time.

While this was happening, I had a moment of depersonalization where I felt like I was outside looking in. I was thinking to myself while I was over reacting, “why am I doing this? This is not the way I was going to react.” It almost felt like I was being possessed and I wasn’t in control of my actions.

Right when I “snapped back” to myself, I apologized and told her that I was over reacting and I did not know why I reacted that way. My coworker also apologized to me for what they had said previously and told me that my feelings were valid.

I can’t help but feel really weird about it all. It’s unlike me to do that, and I’ve never had such a strange depersonalization episode. I felt completely out of control of what I was saying and how I was acting.

I’ve been under a great deal of stress lately and I wonder if it was just the final straw and I snapped? Or am I having a bad reaction to the Wellbutrin I’ve been taking? I’ve heard that Wellbutrin can cause increased aggression, but I’ve never really experienced this before.

I hate the way I reacted today and I’m concerned that it’s my meds. I kind of want to taper off my Wellbutrin because what happened today really bothered me and I don’t want to act like that again. However, Wellbutrin is the ONLY thing that has helped my depression. I feel as though being super depressed all the time would be better than being angry and overreacting.

Has this ever happened to any of you before? Can Wellbutrin cause such a thing, or is it just me breaking under the stress?",31Dec2018,1
1,"When I try to explain myself, it feels like I'm just making excuses.

In one example: my mother. I can sit down and talk to her about my depression and/or anxiety, and my symptoms. She was diagnosed with Clinical Depression (at the time) and General Anxiety as well, years ago. She says she understands that some days I can't get out of bed. Some days I cancel plans because I can't bring myself to do things. Some days I need mental health days and want to avoid everyone and take care of only myself. I get easily agitated aside from sad. Some days I can't make important phone calls or do important chores because my anxious brain tells me to be afraid, (I'm still procrastinating some chores for this reason, tbh) and sometimes want someone to do it for me or guide me through it. Things like that. She says she agrees and understands.

When I'm having a depression episode (I'm now week 2 into one,) she flips and says I'm using it as an excuse. If I can't get motivated or I'm too anxious to move, I'm lazy. If I do something to take care of myself, I'm selfish. If I make plans and when the time comes to carry them out and I'm having trouble getting out of bed, I'm a good for nothing piece of shit. If I'm tired after doing a 4 or 5 hour shift at work where I barely break 20 hours a week, I'm lazy and she reminds me how my siblings work 60-hour weeks and don't complain. I figured since she has MS on top of her mental health issues, she'd understand. She tells me the same thing: ""Some days I (physically) hurt too much to move. Some days my body doesn't actually want to move, so I have no choice but to cancel plans I've made."" Things to that extent. Basically her MS is like the symptoms of my depression, except physical. I know my mom expresses toxic traits, but I can sift through normal toxicity.

It's not just my mom. In another example, some of my friends--while absolutely great 95% of the time, like to gently remind me sometimes that if I say ""I can't [x] because of my depression today,"" or, ""It's not that I normally feel like this, but right now I'm thinking [y] is this way because my brain is overclocked and my anxiety is getting in the way,"" I'm using it as an excuse. 

Long story short, I had to stop taking my meds about 6 months ago cold turkey, and in the last few months, my body is producing especially-raw symptoms. I've been ""using it as an excuse"" a bit more lately because of this, but this has been an on going issue for the past 3-ish years since my health has gotten progressively worse. I still almost never would even bring that up, except in real heavy mental health episodes. Lately, while looking for new mental health providers, I'm still not abusing it, even though the frequency increased a little. 
This has been on my mind since the episode of South Park this season where Cartman and everyone was justifying wearing those stupid ""anti-anxiety"" cardboard boxes on their head because ""Oh it's okay, I have anxiety.""

How can I bring up my symptoms without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses?",31Dec2018,1
2,"TLDR: I've (23, F, UK) been experiencing feelings of disconnect with my body for the last few months which do not seem to be connected to descriptions of depersonalisation that I've read. I'm not sure what terms to describe how I'm feeling so that I can seek further advice and support.

Long version: 

Over the last few months, I've been feeling an increased aversion towards my body. This has somewhat coincided with me having a relapse of a chronic (though generally non-serious) illness that I have, though that's the only thing I can pinpoint at the time and it may not be related. I feel a dislike of my body, not with regards to its appearance, but with regard to how it functions, both normally and abnormally, and the way I have to deal with it. I *hate* taking medication every day (sometimes more than once a day) to get it to work a bit better, though still not quite right. I feel like my body isn't my own because I don't feel like I have ownership of it. It doesn't do what I want it to and I don't want to take care of it. This tends to therefore manifest a lot through me not wanting to, or doing, necessary self-care, like taking my meds or dealing with things like my periods in my usual way. 

When I've tried to search for it, I'm given results all regarding derealisation/depersonalisation, and I don't feel as if this fits from what I've read. I never feel ""outside"" my own body, or as if I'm seeing myself as a third person. I might be wrong and it's a different form of it, though.

What I'm looking for are terms that I can use to describe these feelings more precisely so that I can more appropriately seek help. If anyone has any advice or experience they can share, then that would also be very much appreciated! Thank you so much for any help you can give! ",31Dec2018,1
3,"I started Fluoxetine on friday. My doctor instructed me to start slow and take 20mg every second day, so I took it on friday and today. Thursday and friday were pretty good, better than most if not all days of the last month. I started to feel like shit yesterday evening and today, though. I feel overwhelmed.

4,"I can't get over stuff and it hurts. I'm tired of feeling a pain in my chest from stuff that's in the past or from small things that shouldn't make me feel pain but I do and it sucks. I wish I could just be careless and carefree and I try so hard to be but I'm not. I try to escape my feelings by distracting myself but my mind wanders and the memories keep coming back. I just don't know what to do. I focus way too much on things that I can't take back, over mistakes, over small things about myself that I can't change.  I end up feeling nauseous.

In the process of taking care of my wife I pushed all our friends away so I could deal with what we were going threw.

7,"This will be a long and poorly explained post, so please excuse me in advance. I just don't know where to vent anymore. I always considered myself a pretty rational person, and I just want answers even when I know nobody can give them to me. So I'll just begin.
I never been in love all my life. And if I was, I'm not sure if I know what love is really like, because I've only experienced something that looks like it for imaginary people. They are too many to count, but one of them remained with me for years, and still does. I've done research on this, and everybody seems to assume that the people you fall in love with in your mind are perfect. Mine are not. They used to be, when I was really young. But, especially this one, he's not perfect at all. He's cold, aloof and pretty sharp-tongued. He doesn't love me in a traditional way, I know he sees me like a thing to protect, but nothing more. I'm okay with that, since I enjoy simply the thought of him pretending that he exists. I would like him to be real, but I stopped struggling with it years ago. It all greatly contributed to me being depressed, suicidal, and pretty delusional for some time, while at the same time it was keeping me from doing really bad things. I kept going with my life essentially because of him. Nobody except 2 or 3 people know this, cause to me is always sounded too crazy to be real.
The fact is, to this it adds the fact that I cannot and do not want to be touched by any man. I don't remember people ever doing me harm, but I have panic attacks when I kiss people, and I never like anyone enough to actually want to kiss them in the first place. I'm really happy with friendships, and I never want anything more from real people. I'm despite it all very warm and touchy with my friends, and I love them very much. With people I had crushes on, it was always the same: I thought I liked them in a romantic way, so I tried and got close to them, but when we became friends, every single feeling faded away instantly and I was the happiest person in the world just calling them friends.
But meanwhile, the fantasies and those other people in my head stayed with me. They never go away. I suffered so much because of this that I came to the conclusion that my mind is just totally fucked up for some unknown reason. I'm quite young and fairly good-looking, it's not that I don't have people wanting to be with me or asking me out. It's just that, everything always fades, and my interest doesn't seem to get back ever.
Everything disappears, except for them. Those same people whose number keeps growing every day, even if, luckily or not, my main ""person"" has been just that one from approximately 6 years now.
I know I've got social anxiety, I've been in therapy all these years but never got an answer. Someone told be that this could be psychosis. Some others told me I suffer from dissociation. I even suspected a Dissociative Disorder for some time til now.
But honestly, all this just seems too much.
I'm just tired. Sorry for the rambling.
Have a good day.",31Dec2018,1
8,"I feel like everyone hates me for reasons that I don’t even know. Is it the way I act? The way I look? The things I like? People are so judgemental and horrible and even though I have people close to me I feel that aside from my boyfriend and my mum, no one is truly there for me. I tried to kill myself a month ago, a slash to the wrists. But it really fucking hurt and I couldn’t do it to myself. I’ve felt like a failure ever since then. I keep having hours of optimism but at night that facade comes down again. I wish I could remove myself from existence but it’s not that easy. I can’t be here anymore but I can’t kill myself. If anyone reads this, I’d appreciate some advice, but you could also tell me to do one and I probably would haha. All it takes is a little push. ",31Dec2018,1
9,"Let me preface this by saying: the country where I live (not US) offers almost exclusively cognitive behavioral therapy. Any option is further killed off by mental Healthcare being absolutely atrociously mismanaged, and private therapy costing over $150 an hour, which I certainly cannot afford. My issues with CBT come mainly from the fact that every time I tried, all they focused on was what I was doing instead of what thought process inspired me to do something. I was told that I needed to learn a new response to something, without any kind of justification aside from social norms. It felt like I was being told to actively ignore my problems.

So if anyone could offer any advice on ways I could get different therapy, OR on any of the mental issues that I'll list after this, I'd appreciate it.

A lot of my baseline emotional responses could possibly be interpreted as manipulative, however whenever I exhibit this behavior I am not doing it consciously.

I have an immense ego. So much so that I actively consider many others that can't keep up with me in certain fields inferior to me. This is integral to my social interactions and to the way I see society.

Although I consider myself well-meaning and 'benevolent', I am also highly controlling and I will get angry when I cannot get someone I like/love to do what I think is the correct course of action.

Helplessness causes active panic and distress in me. I will lash out at everyone around me when I'm put in a situation that I have no control over.

I cannot cope with criticism, at all. If someone tries criticizing me, I immediately flip it around and try to put them down any way that I can, unless I acknowledge that criticism as legitimate, which happens way less than it is due.

I believe that whenever I voice pride or complaint, the response from my parents (whom I still live with, being 18), is finding a way to say ""you could have done *thing* better"" or ""you are to blame for *thing*"". I have been told that I do not perceive reality correctly and that I am delusional, but as far as I can see, delusions are a very he said she said thing in my family. Anyway, my apparent *perception of reality* results in me on one count isolating myself from my family (which I don't want because I do love them and they love me) and on the other behaving in this same critique first, praise second manner towards people that rely on me for a sense of accomplishment. And given that I've been told that this is a delusion, I don't even know if I'm making this up.

I have massively violent, aggressive breakdowns where I will do anything in my power to make my 'target' feel terrible. If they're unresponsive to verbal abuse, I have turned physical before, but I've gotten better at controlling myself. I have rationalized this as ""wanting to make them (my target) feel as bad as they made me feel"".

I shame people actively as a way to try and stop them from acting in a way that I believe is undesirable. I think this comes from most of my learning to be socially acceptable being based on what I was bullied and humiliated for. This might also explain my hostile response to any criticism.

I'd appreciate any advice on this.",31Dec2018,1
10,"Alright so for you to understand the story you need some background information

My mother died about 7 years ago and my family was crushed especially my father it didn\`t affect me much because I was too young to understand what happened or so I thought 

About 3-4 months after her death my dad started dating another woman mind that woman was sadly manipulating him in a roundabout way lets call her a gold digger, for now, he didn\`t know that though so it continued till 3 and a half years ago they broke up because we went on a vacation and he didn\`t bring her along at that point we were already sadly like strangers to each other since my grandmother hated him for some reason (his mother) and talked crap behind his back us the young gullible kids were sadly her targets and we came to resent him. Later i don\`t remember how that part of my life is blurry for some reason like i am watching a movie we ended up realising he wasn\`t pure evil and started living normally skip forward about 1 year he went through 10 women (he became quite picky since the last accident) and not one of them managed to get into his eyes now he finally found a nice divorced women she has a kid we get along and finally start doing something then we realise that we weren\`t living so normal because we had arguments every day about cleaning and stuff like that you might think that is not a big issue but my dad works in the police department and is very stressed so the smallest of things can make him feel down.(this is the short version the long one could get its own series of books and tv shows)

So the problem is he wants that women to live with us I agree with that we like her and she is nice to us however our lifestyle is broken and fractured in more ways than one I can\`t describe it since I didn\`t feel strange about it till now 

trouble everyday money issues stress etc

At the beginning of their relationship, they promised to not cause stress to each other however that is our daily life and I want that to change because of today we screwed up real bad by not helping him clean the house and screwing some things up 

Like I said that doesn\`t sound like a problem however I don\`t know what else to type and it really is a problem since it is affecting us

So the question is 

I don\`t know what it is 

How to make myself more open towards emotions since I had an emotional blockade since my mother died I think at least since I can get swept up in the mood but nothing can affect me at all or change my stance towards anything and it sucks since I can\`t get motivated for even small things so the question is How do I help myself improve thus being able to help my father settle his relationship better since like this the stress will kill him before anything else can ",31Dec2018,1
11,"If you struggle with depression like me, and you haven't addressed your debt, might I you to move that to the top of your list if properties to stabilize on your journey to health. 

I am lucky enough to have moved back with my parents to save money last month. This was after doing anything to improve my body image to make myself feel better about what I saw in the mirror, eating better, positive affirmation phrases, stop smoking weed, etc. I still felt emptiness. 

I realized that I was caught in repayment purgatory and living paycheck to paychech had caused me to pass up so many opportunities that could have fulfilled me and help me mend the damage my illness has caused. The weight of 30k+ in loans was lingering over me for so long I guess I got numb and underestimated it's impact on my ability to move forward and cope with my depression. So I pulled the trigger after being independent for 7 years. It's a rough and embarrassing choice but I don't regret it. 

I already payed 1k towards my credit card in one lump payment and let me say, even with that, holy shit has my whole outlook is began to change. I feel... victorious I guess. I can see now just how real the cycle of debt and depression is. Please don't underestimate it like I did and become complacent and make excuses. You can't afford to get in your head about it either. Do whatever you can to get on the right track and your future you will thank you!

14,"I don't understand why I feel so depressed right now. It isn't just feeling sad. I know when I feel just sad--that feeling always passes quickly and easily after a while. This is much deeper and I am starting to have those dark, horrible thoughts that I'd had back in 2015 before I, well, I don't want to think about that. My whole body is shaking and my anxiety seems to be getting worse and worse as the hours pass. I don't know why I feel like this. Not one thing happened today that would explain why I am a depressed, anxious mess. My main disorder is also at a peak right now and I think that is contributing to the anxiety part, and MAYBE the depression since I can't go back outside now. It is nearly 8:30 pm and I am tired from walking so much today already. My body is tired and my mind needs rest, but the anxiety and depression that seemingly has come out of nowhere is making it damn hard to relax.  


I DID drink a LOT of Red Bull today, but the last one was hours and hours ago and I didn't even feel the effects of that one at all. It did nothing for my energy. It just made me more tired. Can that be part of why I am feeling like I want to climb the walls, but also want to hide under my covers and never see daylight again? I don't remember ever ""crashing"" this hard off of energy drinks. I did also have a large-ish mug of coffee, but that was this morning. Grrr. I never had this reaction to caffeine so why would I be reacting to it like this now?  


I have NO point to this post. Can someone relate? Can someone offer some hugs or something? Can someone hit me in the head really hard so I can forget that I am feeling this way?

15,"Hey guys. I'm relatively new here and new to Reddit. I usually find posting my personal problems to social media to be pointless and unnecessary, but I'm at my wit's end here. I apologize in advance if this comes off as a ramble or attention seeking.



basically this is a huge internal struggle for me. so recently I've become very consciously aware of everything wrong with me, and realizing how badly it's affecting my life and my relationships, including my love life. I have a habit of cheating and hurting people, and it comes off as almost compulsive and impulsive simultaneously. I'm starting to feel that my terrible habits in relationships have a deeper cause like something psychological, almost like a ""sex addiction"" or something. i get extreme feelings of loneliness and constantly end up needing validation, which ends up being in the form of sex. I've hurt multiple partners because of this, and recently it happened after years of thinking I had it in check and it's almost completely ruined my relationship. 

before that even happened though, I noticed that I've been in my lowest point in life. I'm extremely suicidal and depressed, and I also ended up relapsing with drugs i haven't touched in half a decade. I spiraled down hard and the relapse in behavior and drugs both happened all at once. 

long story short I really need some help here. I'm seeking therapy but my appointment isn't for weeks yet, and I'm at the point of feeling like I have to admit myself to get help. especially because of suicidal urges. I feel extremely guilty for everything I've done and try to tell myself I'm not a bad person, but it doesn't help given my actions. I've tried changing my behavior for years and every time I get better I manage to fuck it up. 

also i figured I should include this, so before anyone asks, i was sexually assaulted years ago and also had a history of neglect in my childhood, among other things. i have no idea if those past traumas changed my outlook on sex and relationships for the worse, or if I'm genuinely just a shitty person. all of this anguish is really fucking me up mentally, guys..",31Dec2018,1

I recently posted about one of the most important lessons I've learned through my experiences of 2018: **Learning to show vulnerability** (*post is in my profile or earlier in this reddit*).  Here is another : **Learning to become selfish.**

[https://theextrovertedintrovert.ca/lessons-from-2018-part-2/](https://theextrovertedintrovert.ca/lessons-from-2018-part-2/)

The term selfish has become associated with several negative terms but I believe being selfish is essential for us to live a sustainable and healthy lifestyle.

24,"So um this is a bit wierd for me to talk about, and i probably won't post it since it's not that big of a deal. But if anyone does see this, then i just want some advice on this topic.

I have really bad anxiety, especially talking about me or my feelings (like right now). So to avoid that i just don't talk about them, even when it's to someone i don't know because i find it irrelevant and a very down topic.

All my life I've always tried to bring smiles and laughs on people's faces, and i know it sounds dramatic and wayy too over the top but it's true. I really want to try and make people happy, even if it's just for a moment. 

But quite a couple of years ago i started to feel more down and upset, and i thought it was just a ""teenager going through puberty"" type thing, i mean it probably is but i feel like deep down it's something more than that.

Last year i was extremely depressed and started to self harm frequently because i thought that it didn't matter, and no one would care if i died anyway (which i still do but that's for another time). Even then though, i still thought that it was just a pathetic phase that everyone goes through, and mine is just taking a bit longer because I'm want to make it long. 

Then 2018 came along and i was better until August time where i just became stressed and confused all the time. 

I don't know what to think of this anymore, i don't want to be depressed but then at the same time i think that i deserve it because, I'm a shitty person who tries too hard.

I know people on here have much worser problems than me and that i don't deserve to have any advice or even just a simple reply, but i just really want someone to speak to me about this.

Also another thing, I'm just always upset over being indecisive and being a dissapointed to everyone else. Even when i am happy, there's always one point during my everyday that i remember that I'm just a petty person and a child that nobody wants and life wpuld be perfect for my parents if they just didn't have me.

And i can't speak to a therapist or even a doctor or something because of a million different reasons. One of them being because i get too much anxiety when even typing this to a random stranger. If i ever said this face-to-face with someone I'd probably have an anxiety attack before even looking at the person.

I probably have more to say but i will end it here otherwise I'd be writing a book about my problems which sounds ignorant.

Overall I'm just confused and i need someone to tell me what i need to do or what I'm experiencing right now. And sorry for the long text",31Dec2018,1

But in September, I was going for a drive to a relative's house, which was just whatever, but I was sort of cornered by my parents to not drive so late or else something bad was going to happen to me. I really paid no mind since I drive really well, long distances and what not. I got on the car and as soon as I got on the highway my stomach turned and I started to get anxious about losing control of my car, and I know it sounds stupid, but I actually thought I was going to die. It really took me a while to recover, getting shit ton of spasms while driving, just the feeling of losing control any second. Until today, I sort of really still have that clinging in the back of my head, and it really has took a toll on my social life. I know it sounds plain stupid, but I can't help but get anxious and I just can't seem to be relaxed in the car, especially when I am a passenger, knowing i have no control. I know they are just thoughts, but I have been evading this to the point that it has become a real thing in my life and it's just plain sad. Thanks.",31Dec2018,1

30,"This is really long, I am sorry

To anyone who has battled Prenatal Depression, Anxiety, and/or OCD, first of all- you are freaking hard core. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. 

That being said, I am struggling (FYI I have an appointment with my midwife/OB tomorrow and plan to talk to her about my worsening mental state)

Background- I have felt with depression and Anxiety for about 5 years (Post Pardum depression set in right after she was born, got better and then with my second pregnancy I had anxiety the entire time. Once she was born, I was okay for about a year and then PP once again set in. I did not speak medical help for either and regret it now. )

After my second daughter was born and PP set in once more, I started finding things that helped me have Kid free time. I am an artist, so taking time to sculpt or paint helped. I also started playing roller Derby which was wonderful. 

Now, I am currently 36 weeks pregnant with our 3rd. It was completely unplanned (I have an incredible husband who is beyond supportive in all my endeavors and needs) and has really thrown me off. I figured after the first trimester I would get over my unhappiness about the pregnancy. Everyone was over joyed about it, even my husband who also was not wanting more kids is now so excited. As any normal parent should be. 

But here I am. Crying myself to sleep 5 our 7 nights a week. My appetite is hardly there. I have a horrible temper with my kids and then have overwhelming guilt and panic attacks when I lose it and yell at them. I try to get excited about the baby by doing things most moms like. Shopping for needed items, planning the baby shower, etc... and it does help a wee bit for a shirt time. But then I slowly sink back into despair. My husband is always telling me ot will be okay and once he is here it will be different. He tries so hard to make it better, but it's not reassuring me. 

How do you cope? I dont really want this baby. I in now way wish him harm or myself harm, but the idea of having another child is terrifying to me. I cant keep keep from yelling at my two wonderful kids as it is. My panic attacks are debilitating. I spend so much time crying my oldest (5) is starting to worry about me which is unacceptable in my eyes. 

To make matters worse, I am a doula and I know the risks of mental health issues in pregnant and new moms. I know the it can lead to low birth weight, preterm labor, and mental health issues in the baby. I also know that anitdepressants are a risk in pregnancy and nursing as well. I feel so stuck. I have to have this baby that I really dont have a connection to. That my husband loves. I feel like of I continue to go untreated I am hurting my children who dont deserve my angry outbursts. It I do try to treat it, I could be hurting this poor little baby that is already going to have a harder start than he deserves. 

How do you handle this? If you have been there, what coping skills have helped you with guilt or anger? ",31Dec2018,1
31,"i posted here last night saying i think i’m ready to go to a behavioral hospital or seek help.. (see previous post)

ok so self diagnosed over here but: depression, anxiety, binge eating, impulsive decision making, isolating myself in fear of hurting people i love because of my sadness. 

i love people and i love them well; but i don’t love myself anymore or what i’ve become.

it’s a constant war in my head to be alive and i am strong as HELL. but i am tired of fighting my bad thought life and i have become so unhealthy and i want to give up.

let’s say in theory, i want to give myself the gift of wanting to be well in 2019. i spend NYE with my framily and then i disappear. i pack a bag and go to the behavioral hospital in my city on january 1st. what will likely happen to me?

should i ask for medicine? for therapy? for inpatient care? how do you get help? i am scared. i am not good at communicating. 

i am a person who is highly known in my community and i don’t want anyone to know that i went to a mental hospital either. i am scared. i don’t want people to think less of me and i hate how much i compare things in my head. 

i don’t know if i’m more terrified of myself or giving someone else authority over me and what happens to me. 

what will happen to me if i go seek help at the behavioral hospital? how do i fight for the help i need?

32,"It almost feels that I'm losing my grip on reality but I'm self aware at the same time. I'll try to keep it at 2 paragraphs for the sake of your time:

I left the Army after my contract had ended. Swore it was a great decision. Primarily because it was stressful and I assumed the ""civilian"" lifestyle would be cake. At first my mental state was normal (for me). Now it's been such a rapid decline people are starting to take notice.

It all started with an elongated period of brain fog that would persist no matter what I'd do to counteract it. What followed was the paranoia (I dealt with anxiety a lot as a teen but it faded when I found purpose after joining). I've had multiple random panic attacks this past month and I'm not sure the cause, they seem to come and go. It seems that the brain fog is less frequent but it always comes at the most inconvenient time, like right in the middle of an important conversation. I have begun seeing flashing lights out of the corner of my eyes and purple splotches at times when disassociating. 

The emotional rollercoaster I go through each day is pretty exhausting, from paranoid, to euphoric, then paranoid again. My thinking pattern is inconsistent and I can't even explain who I am or what my values are anymore. I just want to be able to fit in and not overanalyze anymore. I've been seeing a social worker but I refuse to take medicine only because the game of trial and error when finding the right pill terrifies me.

What is your advice on snapping out of this and coming back to Earth?

33,"My wife hasn't been officially diagnosed, but symptoms strongly suggest BPD. She already takes antidepressants, Vyvanse for ADHD, and one or two others I can't quite remember.
I'm 31, she's 27, we have 3 amazing kids (8, 6, and almost 3)

We've been together since 2008, married since 2012. Tumultuous roller coaster best describes our relationship. She's lied a lot before we were married, cheated on me once, as far as I know, 2 years into the marriage, and has only consistently been taking prescribed meds since 2016.
Before she started meds I was very used to frequent bouts of irrational anger, impulsiveness, provocative behavior, and I ended up moving out for 6 months in 2016 because of how bad I was being treated.

Since she started taking meds, she's smoothed out quite a bit. Still some impulsiveness and short stints of unwarranted anger (usually during that time of the month) but otherwise pretty smooth. 
The past week and a half she's been experiencing an 'episode'. I know there's some discussion about the proper use of the word 'episode', but you can gather what I mean. 

There's a lot going on here.
She's been at this job for one year now, the longest she's ever held a job, she likes it, perhaps a little too much. She seems to be attaching herself to her co-workers very much, so much that she takes every single little word of advice about life and wisdom to heart. This of course is somewhat characteristic of BPD, they struggle with their identity and will be easily convinced of truths that are of course true, but not applicable to her (our) particular contexts/situation.
She works as a mail carrier/parcel delivery, very fast paced, frequently over burdened work, frequent overtime, by choice. 

I used to work in retail as a department manager for almost 10 years. I quit because they weren't giving me the flexibility I needed to take my daughter to be seen by a psychiatrist because she also has ODD/ADHD. And also working on retail is complete garbage and 10 years is enough. My quitting (just over a year ago) coincided with the commencement of her job as a courier. 

Me having time off was good for us it seemed, being able to see my kids a lot more, being able to do housework and cook etc... I eventually got another job in Feb. 2018 as a bike courier. The hours were great and I still had time to get things done around the house. I stopped doing that at the end of June 2018 because the kids would be done school and we had planned on keeping the kids home for the summer to save money. My two girls ended up at each other's throats 4 days into summer vacation so we put them in summer camp. 

I ended up doing some renovation odd jobs here and there, and also refurbishing and selling bicycles, my favorite past time. My wife is paid well and much so for overtime, and we were comfortable like this. The plan was that I also get a job as mail carrier once my driver's license is at full status, but that won't be until the end of July 2019.

I haven't seen my wife act as she currently is since before she started her meds. She's still taking them as far as I know. She's said to me that me not working is part of the issue. But it seems to me something triggered her, the change in demeanor was so abrupt and intense. She told me she feels trapped, she's tired of our responsibility to one another, she's tired of being the 'sole provider'. 

I'm weary to remind her for how long I worked, while she didn't, while she flip flopped and changed her mind on what career path she would take and how supportive I was for each one. She paid a private college to become a healthcare aid, she took out 10K loan, we're still paying it off. Work was sporadic and didn't last longer than a period of 3 months. She 'donated' her ovarian eggs many times to get money and would sometimes brag about how much money she would get over my crummy retail salary. The times she was unemployed, she would spend at thrift stores or getting new tattoos or piercings. You get the idea. She tried out police school, started online courses to become a teacher, tried to become a permanent apartment building maintenance contractor for one of the biggest pricks I've ever met. Worked at a farm/vineyard where she met the guy with whom she cheated. Had made so many ambitious life plans from shoddy jobs I knew wouldn't last more than a few months.

To end this dreadfully long post, I make her coffee every morning, I cook her supper every night, I take the kids to school and pick them up, help them with homework, clean the place, I de-escalate the tantrums and freak outs my daughter with ADHD experiences. My wife's schedule has been erratic because she's been on-call until a couple weeks ago so it's been difficult finding a job that would be flexible enough to work with hers. She expects it to happen in the blink of an eye, during the holiday season. I currently have several prospects.

For almost 2 weeks she's not been herself, hyperactive, reclusive (drawing portraits of almost every one of her co-workers), hyper organizing, and when the kids are in bed, non communicative to me. Tonight she sent me a text of to a link ""15 signs your marriage is finished""
At this point, thinking in the long term, if these cycles continue and she doesn't want to get help or accept that they're happening, it may be just worth my while to humor her. The cycles are just exhausting emotionally and physically. I've lived through so much of it... It's eroding my spirit. Constructive input is appreciated.

A way that it manifests for me, I think, is my lack of ability to feel strong emotion. I feel like I have a hole in my chest where feeling used to be and now there's nothing. I just, I want to get better, I want to feel again, and I thought I could share somewhere this journey or my struggle.

36,"2018 Christmas, it was fun for most of it I got a switch and new makeup and earrings, it was fun. 
Note:
I struggle with mental health constantly, and it's been about 6 and a half years. 

[[STORY]]

So Christmas, I do my makeup and get dressed everything is jolly and great. 
My cousins and great uncle and Aunt come over it's peachy. 
Me and my cousin were really close and so we were in my room talking and he pulls out edibles. 
I've never done edibles before but only a few hits on a joint, but besides that I've never done anything hardcore. 
I wasn't really ready for the high. The cookie he gave me was already half eaten but because I was excited and stupid I ate it without any thought. This was about at 5 pm... 
After that we played Zelda and nothing exciting really happened besides me eating a shit ton of candy and spacing out constantly. 
After a while my high started calming down and it was about 7 pm now?¿
He gave me another edible but this one was supposed to do the opposite of the cookie, and instead of make you calm it was supposed to make you a little more hyper etc. ...
Of course I ate it excited for another trip. 

Shortly after we put on Netflix and were laying next to each other, this wasn't uncommon for us because he was like the older brother I've never had. 
It was now 9 pm and half way through the horror movie he pulled me in closer. 
Where I was to close to him my hand was smashed in between us so I moved it and it was on his thigh. Of course I wasn't really worried about it because cuddling was nothing sexual for us it was just a coping mechanism almost. 
He then proceeded to come on to me sexually pulling up my shirt and groping me. I wasn't prepared for this and I started shaking really badly... My cousin then whispers into my ear, saying ""I know you want this"" and then I proceed to say no we can't ,not only are we related this is wrong. He told me he didn't care and that it'll be okay. 
He only stopped because I started shaking really badly and was about to cry and I proceeded to say no. 
He finally let me go, but because I'm stoned and scared I couldn't move and stayed next to him watching the movie in silence and just pretended it didn't happen. 
I then texted my boyfriend and best friend, I then told my cousin I needed to go to the restroom and after that I broke down crying and called my boyfriend. 


[[ What I realized now ]]

-I was taken advantage, but it wasn't right for me to get high that way. Plus it might of seemed that he got the wrong signal..

-I can't tell my dad cause it'd crush him, because that's the last of our family 

 [[My mental health]] 

-I'm practically fighting this alone and I don't really have anyone who relates. 
-I'm scared to tell someone out of fear my cousin will tell everyone my secrets and my self harm tendencies. Or they won't believe me... 
 -I now also have night terrors and keep dreaming about what would've happened if I was too scared to say no and let it happen. 
-My PSTD isn't okay and my self harm tendencies have over all incredibly increased. 

I'm now alone..and I needed to get my story out there.... 
Please if you have any tips please let me know..
My nightmares are getting worse and I'm about to be forced in the same room with him on New Year's Eve, 
This isn't the first time I've been sexually hurt like this...but it's been a long time and I just want a coping mechanism...I know I don't have it as bad as some..but hopefully I can get some advice out of my rant...thank you for reading.. ",31Dec2018,1
37,"Backstory: in 8th grade i was severely bullied (physically, emotionally, spiritually...etc.) i ended up in a hospital 2 times for attempting suicide and another time for behavioral problems. i was given meds for a mood disorder which pretty much drugged me down. (i am now  off all medications and am very well other than memory issues)

Current Problem: i am now in 11th grade and attending college at the same time (and succeeding). i no longer attend therapy because my mom doesn’t want to pay for it and with my and her busy schedule it doesn’t work out. HOWEVER, i keep having horrible horrible nightmares every night. for example, one of them was of a girl who used to bully me (whom i haven’t had contact w since 8th grade) accusing me of sleeping with her boyfriend. idk. and then right before i woke up, she said “no one likes you anyways, you’re pretty useless” and just kept saying how much everyone hates me. last night i had a dream i was being hunted in a house and couldn’t go outside, and when i finally got a gun, it was only a water gun and i was so powerless. i know this somehow relates to my trauma from 8th grade. i am still very lonely and have few friends bc i tend to shut people out and like to be alone most of the time. i get sad when i’m alone, but i want to be alone (hopefully someone understands that). i just need advice, should i tell my mom? should i ask to go back to therapy or to talk to someone? the nightmares are affecting my sleep and i have been fearing sleep.

tl;dr I give a backstory of my bullying experience. I need advice on what to do about my nightmares that I feel stem from the bullying I experienced 4 years ago. Should I tell my mom? Should I go back to therapy? ",31Dec2018,1

40,"I've been reflecting a lot this last week. Last month I went home to see family. It was the first time I have gone home by myself, since my suicide attempt in 2017. My family is hectic, there's a lot of people in my mom's house. Lots of animals. I get it. Though, I was devastated that they didn't want to go with me.

I have a hard time leaving the house on my own. PTSD and anxiety are just so much fun. Anyway, I managed to take the Greyhound twice by myself. Mind you, I was so incredibly baked off of the edibles it was the only reason I made it. It's about 5-6 hours ride from my home to theirs. 

In less than an hour, I made my mom shut down, and my sister fought with me. I'm not the same person I was the last time they saw me. I'm not the same person I was when I was married, or when I was under her thumb. My sister came at me stating I need to just say fuck it... I understand why she said this, and why this works for her. However, it isn't how my brain works. I'm working on finding coping skills that work for me.  She was so determine it was the best way and only way. They also would stop listening to me in the middle of saying something, and wouldn't even notice when I stopped talking. I wasn't even talking about mental health or anything like that. I was just contributing to the conversation at hand which was about the pets. It all just hurts.

For me, being in a numb state is scary/dangerous. More scary than dangerous, but my fear overrides a lot. Anyway, the whole time I was fighting to not shut down. It's my fault, I should have known better that they wouldn't understand. My mom told me she understood, because she deals with it every day at work. Fuck you mom! I'm not just one of the patients you help with. I'm her fucking daughter, and I needed her to fucking listen to me. I just wanted them to acknowledge that they were actually listening. 

I'm jumping ahead, so on Saturday when I woke up. My brain was screaming I wasn't safe. None of my regular stuff was helping. My brain told me I needed to go home. I was trying so hard and it wasn't enough. Instead of being comforted I got yelled at by everyone. I'm still learning how to self advocate, and this was a huge step for me. When I get overwhelmed or scared or if people are yelling. It makes me burst into tears. In my family that makes me a drama queen. I've developed this habit where I hide behind my hands and try to get as small as I can. 

Though, since I was the reason for the yelling it made it worse. My mom yelled at me for throwing myself a pity party, and that they've done nothing but listen. I needed acknowledgement of it all. I feel so fucking crazy sometimes from all of it, and I needed them. I should have known better. They've never been good at any of this. My mom broke something in our relationship that morning. I was trying to apologise, because of the intense guilt I felt for not being strong enough to stay there. She looked at me, told me she didn't matter since I blame everything on her. I don't know though, I understand she did her best. She's not the one I'm fucking mad at. I'm just angry at all of it. She told me she's used to it, because all I do is hurt her. I didn't respond other than run away, because all I could think of was, right back at ya. 

Though it was my sister that I had the hardest time with. She is one of my favorite people in this world. I'm so proud of her and all she's done. She's a good mom, especially for getting pregnant at so young. She of all people, I thought would understand. I'm very private and internalize my feelings, so when I'm freaking out it's either numb and robot like, or I'm crying. I went numb, I told her my brain was telling me I'm not safe. I understand logically I was safe. I understand logically that it's my PTSD freaking out. I understand all of this, but it doesn't change how I felt in that moment. She told me to repeat I'm safe and to scream fuck it. I don't like doing these things out loud. It doesn't help me, if anything, it makes worse. Could I explain this in away for them to understand? No, I could not. Instead I got corned in her bedroom and her yelling at me about how I'm ungrateful, selfish, and it's not fair that I can always run away from my problems. She sure knows how to hit close to the soul. I already feel these things about myself, but here's the thing, I'm really none of these things. She also yelled at me that she can't run from her responsibilities and depression, but it's not my fault she got pregnant so young, or kept having kids. She's an angry young woman, my anger has been under lock and key, but it's starting to bubble up from whatever hell I shoved it in. She straight up told me I would never be able to control it, that therapy isn't helpful etc... 

At this point there was no way in hell was I going to stay at my mom's for another night. The last thing that happened was my sister using my nieces and nephews against me. I just left at that point. Just confirming that I am all the things they think I am. At least it's how it felt. 

That was almost two months ago, since it was the beginning of Nov when I saw them. I barely talk to my sister. I did text her a few weeks after I got home telling her I love her, but idk how to respond to any of them right now. 

My heart hurts, I know I did the right thing for me at the time. I hate that it's come to this. I hate that I can't handle them. I hate that they can't handle me. I don't want to lose my family, but idk how to hold them at arm's length. I am afraid to also cut contact. I just want to feel accepted for who I am by those who ""love"" me. Sometimes, I feel like my mother doesn't love me. She cares and I know this, but she doesn't love me. I'm the one who reminds her of a lot of bad shit. Her failure as a parent. I feel like sometimes my mere presence hurts her. 

So, now here I am 11 pm feeling sad and lost. ",31Dec2018,1

44,"My whole life I've had issues with paranoia. I know it's normal to have the ""someone's watching me"" feeling, but even when I was really really young -- like preschool/early elementary -- I remember having many instances where I was so intensely worried that someone or something was behind me that I would lay flat on my bed or sit with my back against the corner and cry frantically looking around for long periods of time until it went away. I was so extremely stressed, but as a child I don't think I ever brought it up to anyone because once the feelings stopped I didn't really think about it and when I am with people it doesn't seem to happen much. I also would throw huge fits and have anxiety attacks about sleeping near windows and doors that led outside. I remember the first sleep over I went to was in like second grade and there were many people and at first they told me I was going to sleep at the front of the living room which was near the front door, and I flipped out and would not do it and almost went home until my friend who home it was said I could come to the other side of the room with her. I also remember being forced to sleep in the living room near big glass doors when we would visit my grandparents, and my fits got me nowhere, so little child me would literally stay up all night with my back against the wall making sure I could see all possible entry/exits to where I was. As I got older things got better and happened less frequently. While I'm sure I still had problems with this in late elementary-middleschool, I had no more major issues I can remember until maybe grade 9. I rememeber it started happening again. I dont know if it's related, but I've also had dissociation issues my whole life and remember having more disociation and bad panic attacks around this time. One night I went too walk my dog, I lived in an apartment complex and it was dark and raining, and I got so paranoid I was being followed or something and was running home, and it got so out of control the best thing I could think to do was lay down on my back in the middle of the path until it went away. I was so close I could see my apartment but it felt so strong I couldn't keep going or I thought I might get caught and murdered or something. Skip to now. I'm 18, in college, living at my grandmas who travels a lot so I'm often home alone. The paranoia had gone back down to what I would think is reasonable but these past few months I've noticed it getting worse. I live in a nice neighborhood, and we have a security system and everything, it beeps when any window or door is opened, so I know I'm being irrational, but I'm always so terrified someone if here and going to get me. When I shower I'm scared I wont be able to hear the door open over the sound of the water and someone will be there to grab me, or when I close my eyes to wash my hair I panic at the thought that I will open my eyes and see someone in the shower with me. I ususally take baths so I can leave the curtain open and see the whole room because it's just too much anxiety to shower. I always turn a light on in my room before sunset so that if I'm not in there when it starts to get dark I have a safe place to go where I can see everything. Our stairs to the basement dont have a door or anything and split the living room/kitchen area and the area where my bedroom is. If I happen to be on the couch in the living room and it gets dark out, I will be too scared to move around the room or to cross the space to get to my room and will just sleep on the couch. Otherwise if I work up the courage I will run to my room and shut the door and lock it and rub my back on the wall to make sure nothing followed behind me. I will always lock my bedroom door at night. I always get super paranoid that someone may be living in my basement, though I know this makes no sense but it's hard for me to convince mysself these things aren't true. Every noise I hear freaks me out more. I can sleep in the dark because I know nothing is in my room when I lock it for the night and my mattress is on the gound and in a corner and the lights are plugged in at the head of my bed so I can unplug them as I fall asleep. Without these kinds of conditions it's much more difficult though and sometimes even after all that I will sit up looking in the dark or re plug in the lights to make sure nothing is there. I also just remembered that when I was little I was always paranoid there were cameras hidden all over my house and other peoples homes and that I was being watched or recorded, I would constantly look around trying to figure out where they could be. Finding out about nanny cams definitely didn't help haha. Now I have that issue less, like theres only been a couple times  when I've questioned that maybe there is a camera in my house, but I still find myself doing it at other peoples homes or private spaces sometimes. I feel like I'm crazy, and I know it's irrational thinking but sometimes I worry that it will take over eventually. Also I don't know if its related but a couple months ago I had a really terrifying moment while I was staying up late working on school, I was listening to an audio book and heard a weird warping sound and a ton of whispers behind me, so I paused the audio book and still heard the whispers, so I looked behind me to try and see who was there and saw no one and the whispers stopped and I was thinking ""omg I'm crazy, that was all in my head"" and tried to work again but then it happened again and I looked and it stopped, so I sat there terrified and listening to the silence but then the warping got louder so I followed it and I traced it to a spot in front of my room but it sounded like it was in the basement below there. It sounded like an alien invasion. I have NEVER hallucinated voices to this extent before. Like I've done the usual ""wait did you hear that?"" or thinking I heard my name, but I swear this was like a group of like 15-20 whisperers behind me talking about me but I didn't know what they were saying. It was terrifying and I decided I needed to go to sleep. I doubt it was sleep deprivation because it was only like 1am and I usually slept around 12 but had stayed up until 4 many times without something like that happening. Nothing that crazy has happened since. I often hear a sound in my bedroom that sounds like a ball bouncing a couple times on hardwood (theres carpet in my room). I have yet to figure out what that is but tell myself maybe it's something weird in my vents?? The sound isn't near a vent. I told a friend the ball thing before and he convinced me I had demons I BEG YOU not to do that because that makes me seriously so fucked up and scared. I've also been having headaches multiple times a week, sometimes daily, for about a month and a half now, don't know if this is related but the paranoia has gone on long before the headaches.",31Dec2018,1

I love my boyfriend so much but we both struggle with depression and anxiety. He went through a long period of threatening suicide daily and daily drug use however these days he has gotten exponentially better. I was there during it all..and worked through all of it with him. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, and I definitely thought about quitting but we worked through it. 

Nowadays, it’s flipped. I’ve been dealing with a lot of depression and have been confiding in him about it. I am in therapy and take antidepressants, but still talk to him about my struggles because he is loving and supportive. I found a Reddit post from today by him (we follow one another) saying he was at a loss and so stressed by me. He said he didn’t want to break up, however he needed a solution because he wanted to see me well.

I texted him and we talked about it, ways I should improve, what are good communication methods when one of us are overwhelmed and how to move forward. We agreed to stay together and I promised to work hard to find the positives and try to continue to better manage my symptoms. I feel awful, I never meant to make him upset, but I also wanted to confide in the one I love most. He says he just wants me better.

So, what are so practical ways to keep poor mental health out of a relationship? I love my boyfriend and we have lots of future plans, and I don’t want my sadness to ruin this.

59,"sorry in advance for typos and grammar errors,but anyway you will understand what i am talking about.


I am 28 years old.

everything started back in childhood,when i had problems with my father.it was very serious,he made my life really hard and that was time when my micro panic attacks started.Then i though there was something wrong with my penis.I assumed that i had Inguinal hernia.i was ashamed,i was frightened,i couldnt tell it to my mother and surely couldnt say anything to my father.so i just let it go and live with it instead of treating it.

times passed.my depression was getting bigger and it really was hurting my life.but its nothing yet,then i had these thoughts that i have Cancer.i couldnt do anything but just think about this.It was like nail on the coffin.i refused to do anything in my life,i stopped talking to anyone,did not leave house,i lost interest in everything.I was just sitting alone waiting for death to come.

Then i just got tired.i went to doctor and guess what,she said that i dont have cancer.i went to another doctor and he said that i dont have inguinal hernia either and everything was ok about my penis.

well,i was kinda shocked.i was not feeling happy,i just couldnt believe that all these time i was wrong.i couldnt believe that all those irrational fears were stronger than me,this was hardest to realize.

so,here i am now,as i said 28 years old and i have to start my life all again.without normal education,even tho i studied on few different faculties,without normal job history,without friends to socialize with,without any interest and etc.
but at least i dont have those panic attacks,i dont have that terrible pain in my stomach when i lay in bed and try to sleep.

I know it is really hard to talk to people about ur conditions,mostly they are unable to fully undertsand you and its really hard to get any empathy.but reading about others peoples mental conditions,how they fixed their life,it was a relief for me.

so,you are not alone,there are other people with problems like me,like you or even worth,but it can be helped,it will pass sooner or later.",31Dec2018,1

 Yesterday I felt tense and off from the moment I woke up. The jitteriness made my mind wandering, replaying my most negative thoughts and memories, things I'm disappointed or worried about. Every little thing I wanted to do started to feel like a hazardous situation, or like I shouldn't be doing it. 

I couldn't focus at all. I felt nauseous, my heart was beating as if I was running, I was borderline ready to cry. The pit in my stomach wouldn't go away, and when I was left alone, I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like I was physically in danger, and my mind wouldn't shut up. 

So I did it, I cut myself. It hurt, but the moment I allowed myself to do it, the pit went away. I actually felt a little happy afterwards, or rather, relieved. And ashamed. Now I have to hide my forearm again and it'll be harder to say no to the urge when it returns.

I’m also a mess myself. I’ve become apathetic towards everything and everyone around me. Empathy is difficult, and I’ve let Reddit convince me that I’m a heartless sociopath who feels no remorse. I don’t think I’m a sociopath, but I feel like one.

What is currently stopping me from therapy are a few things. My GP contacted my mother and told her that I was lonely. She came to me asking why I felt this way and what I was still doing on the couch and I denied it all. My GP telling my family about my mental health annoyed me because I felt a betrayal of trust with my privacy. I think it won’t be long until she tells my family that I tried to kill myself, which would honestly just fuck everyone up. I’m trying to avoid this.

When my brother heard about this, he was understanding about my depression until he told me that seeking therapy was a stupid decision because now it will make me look weak in the future? I don’t like my brother. I’ll never open up to him. I will always tell everyone in my family that I’m fine to keep the peace. 

What’s started to now make me really think about Therapy is that my dad is also now starting to catch on. I know that I can’t talk to my family about this stuff, and that I don’t have friends either. I need to speak to someone because right now I don’t want to speak to my family about this. They will never understand other than tell me that I’m “stronger than that”.  My brother said that.

85,"Throwaway account - this year has not been the best, with family deaths, dealing with hospice (family member not me), parents divorce, and more family stress in general - however whenever I think of these things I feel like it almost didn’t happen. It’s hard to explain but in the moment I feel sad about it but after that it almost doesn’t feel real, or like it didn’t happen. Ex) with one of my family members who passed, I know they’re gone and the funeral was tough, but now I just can’t picture them gone, I know they are, but in the back of my head they’re just on another trip or something. I’m thinking this might just be part of the grieving process, and I know people grieve in different ways, but I’m just curious. I know reddit isn’t the best place to go with this stuff but I am probably going to go see a doctor soon (persistent head rush whenever I stand, maybe that’s something too who knows lol) so maybe I’ll bring it up there

86,"i am24 years old. I had major depression and anxiety disorder paired with what they think borderline disorder (not sure yet, my psychiatrist think so but we are waitin psychologist response).  


Without going too much into detail: i am suicidal. really badly. And i am one step away from being hospitalized.

I already being hospitalized in another country (czech republic) but only for a week and that was a facility just for people with depression and such, u could go out whenever u pleased and just stay in for the night. I felt so much better, i talked with a psychologist twice a day and they dont force therapy on you.  


In this country (Italy)tho there is no distinction in ""levels"" of i dont want to say ilness, but just functioning.  
So my fear is i will be in an enviroment where i will be limitetad of my freedom like i was not fully capable of understand, i cant use my phone, go out etc.

Money is not a problem, is completely covered by healt care.

My psych told me i should call up if i feel bad tought overwhelming [me.Today](https://me.Today) is new years eve and i am alone, no family, no friend, just me and my tears but i am afraid if i call someone they will lock me up and i dont know what to do i feel stuck.

It sounds weird but I kind of have a trigger word - when someone says therapy/therapist to my face I feel like crying and  I get scared because I had a bad experience with one at CAHMS when I went to an anxiety group. But I never get scared or anxious from the word councillor - it just sounds more calm, less troubling. I know that everyone is different, but if you know someone with mental health issues and they need help, I'd say use councillor instead of therapist.

91,"I've always had a problem handling boredom but I s gotten worse in recent years to the point where I can't really do many things that I should be able to do. Like chores, phone calls, or school. 

The second I'm bored I start to feel terrible and I just can't Handel it. If I'm bored for to long it can put me in a bad place for a couple days and makes my other mental problems worse. But on the flip side of I can constantly due things that I enjoy or are interesting or exciting I do really well.

Generally when I'm bored one or more of these things happens. I get extremely agitated and angry starts out by making me pace like crazy but quickly progresses to me getting strong urges to run throw things scream and hit things. Sometimes I control it some times I can't. Other I end up getting really depressed and get really strong urges to self harm and starve myself sometimes if it gets bad enough I'll even start feeling suicidal. Other times my mind just completely wanders and I enter a day dream or some sort of deep thought. It can also physically hurt when I'm bored. These symptoms start even with only a little time bored like sometimes less than 15 minutes and get worse the longer I'm bored.

Normally I wouldnt call boredom a problem. It's a natural part of being human. 

But like it gets int the way of me being able to do things. I had do drop out of college because I couldn't sit through a class or do the work. I can't do chores properly because I'm either not mentally present while I do them or a rapidly get upset and have to stop. Even something like having to be present when my mom makes a phone call with insurance causes me to have a break down. I've never really tried to get a job cause I know I can't Handel it. I do work at my dads business shampooing carpets 2-3 hours a week but it's so repetitive and brainless I can just space out like when I pace and still do a decent job. I also have trouble falling asleep because I get bored in the time it takes to fall asleep.

Also when I'm bored I get urges to say provacitive things to people and upset them. To see if there reactions interesting.  I also sometimes want bad things to happen to people I don't care about just because it changes things up. Like when I hear about terrorist attacks and shootings I don't really care about the people involved and part of me finds it entertaining. I'd never do one of course.

I'm also terrified of the future cause I'm scared I'll end up in what I call the cycle of suffering where you spend most of your life working to pay for your own existence that you waste by spending to much time at a job. I'm terrified of responsibility because to me responsibilities are shackles.

I've talked to my therapist about this and her main solution is medicine and I have bad reactions to ones I've tried before and like I'm scared of gaining weight from. Also her main solution to my other problems is to do things I enjoy and eventually get better.

I'm not really sure what to do about this. Like I have no problem living life purely for my own enjoyment like why live if your not having fun but like it would be nice to be able to get a part time job or something so I would have more money to spend on my hobbies. Also would be nice to get to a point where I could take drivers ed and learn to drive.

I'm not sure if any of these have anything to do with this but I also have problems with self harm, eating disorder, anxiety, perfectionism, poor impulse control and intermittent depression. Iv found that all but the perfectionism can be dealt with simply by spending all my time doing things I enjoy or otherwise excite me. Im 18 and female by the way.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to deal with being bored so I can atleast get a little bit done.

92,"  Practical tips include:

• Eat healthy meals

• Get sufficient sleep

• Exercise regularly. Exercise releases chemicals in your brain. They can uplift your mood, increase your energy, and improve your sleep. 

• If possible, try to recognize triggers and early warning signs of a depressive mood and prepare an achievable plan of action in advance. 

• Confide in someone you trust. Have a contact list of people you can call when you’re feeling down.

• More steps included in the [video](https://youtu.be/ZG77JJ5qepM).

94,"About a month ago, my doctor placed me on Wellbutrin (buproprion) for depression and smoking cessation. I had been on the drug about 2 years prior, but stopped taking it due to being bad at staying with medication management. I had NO problems or side effects, whatsoever at that time. 

So back to a month ago, I'm back on Wellbutrin. Feeling fine, not really noticing a difference for about 2 weeks, and very suddenly I felt a sense of being overly giddy. I was in a really really good mood, and I felt like nothing could bring me down. I was bouncing around with energy (mostly belting Disney songs and showtunes) I also wasn't sleeping more than 2 hours a night because I felt like I just had so much energy. I also bought about $500 worth of clothes, shoes, and makeup that I know I didn't need, but didn't think about any of the reprocussions. 

after about 3-4 days of feeling that way, I hit a deep depression. I suffered  from suicidal ideation for a long time, but nothing in recent memory like this. I also struggle with an eating disorder that was well under control until this ""episode"" I was laying on my floor genuinely planning my way to kill myself. I felt like all my energy had been zapped from me from the few days prior and couldn't leave my bed. I didn't eat and was making myself sick on an empty stomach. I was also very moody and irritable, yelling at everyone around me. 

I was also having extremely traumatic night terrors, that I now attribute to this medication. since stopping this med,these have slowly started to stop, or lessen. 

Luckily, I had a medication follow up appointment with my primary care the next day. I told him what was going on, and he sent me to the psychiatric inpatient unit for an evaluation. 

There, they diagnosed me with Bipolar II and said that it is common that a drug can bring out these tendencies. The psychiatrist immediately D/C Wellbutrin. 

I am now on an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer and I feel MUCH better. I have not had such a dramatic ""swing"" since then. I am sad that I now have another mental health diagnosis, but thankful it led me some options that have really helped me. 

I'm just wondering why I didn't experience this beforehand while on the same drug? Anyone have a similar experience? Or words of advice to me to deal with this new diagnosis I have, of Bipolar II? 


TLDR; I was put on a mental health med that induced psychosis, even though I had been on said drug previously, with no prior issues.  Another mental health diagnosis was made from this situation. Any thoughts? ",31Dec2018,1

98,"I used to be very extroverted and open. And I used to always feel like myself and be alright with  everything. Things seem to have taken a wrong turn as I'm progressing through college. Throughout the years, I needed to spend prolonged periods of time alone to work on school stuff (I'm an art student). It seemed like I was forgetting how to talk to people. I started doing this thing where I put up this chill, happy front (how I used to really be in my freshman year)  to seem more likeable, but it either comes off as disingenuous if people see through it, or I have to keep it up around the people that like it and it's exhausting. This has lead to so many friendships starting up and fizzling out because I'm so incompetent with people nowadays. I'm awkward and I feel like a different person with everyone I talk to. 

Im going through a lot of weird times and changes as I'm getting older. I've forgotten how to be myself and I dont know what that even means anymore. I've lost touch with pretty much all of the friends that I've made along the way except for a childhood friend and my SO. I can't send a text without it making my mind reel thinking about how annoying I must be to them. I'm worried that if I'm not funny enough, or if I'm not that cool, ""chill"" girl people think I am, no one will want to be around me. But at the same time, I get so relieved when I'm alone since theres no one around to put up a front for. I'm so tired of it.

As a kid I never really got the affection I wanted but deep down kept it quiet because I knew it would cause issues if I talked about it. I think it was this alone that caused me to develop a kind of bad case of social anxiety and introversion. 

If it wasn't bad already, a while back I discovered I was transgender and it's had such negative effects on my family and friends. Not being seen anymore for who I am has had such a negative impact especially right before going into college.

113,"Hey all, longtime lurker here and frequent poster in one of two subreddits hockey related.

To keep things short, some people on Reddit seem to love bringing others down in a gang mentality, and when they can’t say anything but just disagree they downvote.

If I post something that the wrong person disagrees with in r/hockey, they gang up like a pack of wolves. I posted something in there that abided by their rules (mods never removed it) and people went in there to say how wrong my titling is rather than discuss the video I had posted which was why I posted it- for discussion.
People resort to saying I must have “never played hockey” and people hanging up on how wrong my opinion is on a play in a split-second game. All I did was post a video.

It got to the point where I DMed one of the people who kept looking for my threads in particular. They found that I’d posted again, trying to repost and not “editorialize” and they commented something like “still going on about this, huh?”
Yes I’m going on about it still as I should because I’m allowed to have an opinion.
I called them out asking their problem was, they just responded “😂😂😂😂😂”.

The mods there will ignore any reports or messages in order to lurk threads and pick/choose what abides the sub’s rules. I reported the trolls who still were commenting on my last post, but lol not one of the comments was deleted.

Anyway, I guess today I learned how people you see as comrades on Reddit’s you frequent don’t actually care about your opinion at all; they care about theirs and being correct. Because when they get the opportunity to be correct, they’ll shut you down and make you feel like an idiot about thinking about something a certain way.

I’m home now for three weeks of break and I’ve been seeing a new therapist who’s really helping. I’m getting good coping strategies and feeling better. I had a really rough semester last semester and have been seeing my therapist twice a week over break to try and work on coping mechanisms for my depression.


My mom is insistent that they’ve misdiagnosed me and that I’m actually bipolar. Never mind the fact that after being on antidepressants for 6 months, I never had a manic episode. She’s now saying that my therapist doesn’t know what he’s doing and is questioning his credentials (he has a Masters from a university specializing in Clinical Mental Health Counseling). She’s also saying that my psychiatrists and PAs don’t know what they’re doing and that I need to get in with a “real psychiatrist” (sure, mom, you know more than these board-certified PhDs🙄).


She’s now also convinced that I’m not telling my therapist everything and that I “rage” (this is projection) and she has to tell my therapist about this imaginary “rage” I have. She even insisted that my entire family would back her up on this. I then asked my family to which they all responded that she was making shit up. One of my sisters even said my mom had accused her of being bipolar as well.


I don’t want my mom to speak to my therapist and I’m not going to allow it. My dad has said wants there to be “peace” in the house and is going along with my mom that she should be allowed into my therapy sessions. Even after telling him I don’t want her there, he’s telling me reasons I should let her come and talk to my therapist. He’s making arguments like “let her come and the therapist will see that she’s projecting.” It’s really frustrating me and I don’t feel supported by my dad. I’ve explained I’m not comfortable with her coming and he isn’t respecting that. I also feel like my mom is trying to insert herself where she’s not welcome. I’ve been away at school for four years and have never had a manic or hypomanic episode and I’m really sick of this insistence that I’m bipolar. And I’m thinking about going back to school early just to get away from her, but I don’t want to stop seeing this therapist early just because she wants to be a bitch.

Without suggesting that I let my mom come, does anyone have advice for how I should handle this?
Should I go back to school and give up this treatment (I’d go back to my therapist at school who’s okay but not great)? Or should I try to suck it up and spend two more weeks here?

121,"And I’m not really sure what to do about this. I know that my mental health issues are long term so I’ll probably be able to in a few years down the road as well, but it would *really* help now. I’m not sure how to approach this topic with them at all. I don’t even know if I should, I know they’ll say no straight off the bat and that makes it harder. (It’s sad that convincing my family I’d benefit from this is harder then convincing my therapist, who I absolutely know would be on board.)",31Dec2018,1

123,"Just wondering if people taking their own lives is common where you live? It’s quite common in the small town I live in, especially with young men - so just a general wonder if other people see it as often as I do. It’s always sad, no matter their age but it’s become so common where I live that it isn’t very surprising. ",31Dec2018,1
124,"Recently after a failed relationship I have come to the conclusion that I desperately need mental help. My insurance isn't great and it would cost $50 per visit to see someone.

I did it through [stdcheck.com](https://stdcheck.com). I just keep picturing the results saying ""positive"" and not sure I can handle this feeling anymore.

I am so so scared. I talked to my mom who's a doctor and she even said it's unlikely I have it but I feel like I'm suffocating with anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this?",31Dec2018,1

While everyone is celebrating, I'm already in my bed ready to pass this awful feeling but when I wake up, I know it will stay.

2019 is shaping up to look much better, but im terrified it will follow the same route. so many things are different, and yet, im still scared shitless my mom is gonna get the same call she got this past july.

How’d it go ?

I keep asking my husband to take me my mom says it’s a bad idea 

I don’t know what else to do 
I’m progressively getting worse 
I suffer from severe agoraphobia panic disorder gad and now I added health anxiety into the mix

I can’t even sleep because I wake up from panic attacks

I have had 44 dahs of straight anxiety worry and panic attacks

I see a CBT psychologist weekly and I do everything required

I’m working on meds but none seem to be working 

I’m just lost scared confused

132,"I’ve done it for as long as I can remember but I go from: Angry, to crying, to a weird sort of anger cry, hyperventilating, having my muscle start aching and having to contort to get the stress out, 15 more minutes of a mixture of all of the above with some suicidal, destructive thoughts and eventually just staring at the wall for half an hour until it stops. It’s very brutal to witness and I look like some sort of psycho that should be restrained but I’ve never hurt anyone else during it. 

I only get this in very, very bad, stressful situations. I’ve been physically and mentally abused by my mom since I was a little girl and was stuck with her until I was 17, alone because my dad and brother moved out. We all know she has either schizophrenia or psychosis but she refuses to see anyone for it. Usually my head hurts for a few hours after as well. I have anxiety and tend to get depressed sometimes but never quite like one of these episodes. I’m waiting on my insurance before I can get therapy and see a doctor but I was wondering if this happens to anyone else? ",31Dec2018,1
133,"**Please don't be rude or downvote. I know it's gross but this a real problem. I'm embarrassed to even post this but I've gotten help with other issues on here, so I thought I'd try.**

I have a weird habit where I pick my teeth or nose, smell it, and play with it. I really like the smell of my snot and plaque. I also will rub it on my fingers/hands until it dries out and rolls into a solid ball. It's so bad that I bought a dental kit from the drugstore just for the teeth-picking tool. I used to just use anything with a semi shark tip (pins, mechanical pencils, etc). I also won't use a tissue for my nose unless it's running/bleeding badly or I'm in public.

I really try to refrain from doing this in public, and for the most part I'm successful. This has been going on since I was very young (elementary school, maybe earlier). I also had a habit where I would use the back of my index finger to rub around my mouth and then smell my finger...it used to cause a lot of irritation around my mouth area. I still do this occassionally, but not to the point of irritation. 

I want to figure out what's causing this, because it's gross...not to mention I'm spreading germs to parts of my body where they shouldn't be and then touching objects. Could this be an anxiety thing? Or is it something else entirely?

TL;DR: Strange habits regarding picking teeth/nose and liking the smell. Started at a young age. Not sure what would cause this.",31Dec2018,1
134,"Today is a better day. Instead of letting the past few further bring me down I decided to take action. So instead of being defensive and in a constant state of fight or flight me and my lady have decided to address the issues as they come up. She hasn't been wanting to hurt me by bringing it up but then she says something and I don't know what she's talking about and I get defensive. 
What should be easy for most people makes me feel emotionally retarded Honestly. I don't understand the degrees of anger or sadness. My father never aloud that so now I am an adult having to be taught what behavior matches what emotion. And what behavior just don't belong; like punching walls,  doors,  crying over being embarrassed or going into ""dead space"" As I call it where I lose time and chant the same things trying to calm down. I get tired of being compared to a demon and hearing people are scared of me. 
Maybe with this I can learn  my tone or when I'm being to aggressive. I don't want to lose the love of my life because I have the behavioral fortitude of a tween. ",31Dec2018,1
