1," In terms of whether I have depression, I don't really know. From what I've heard, depression generally induces low self esteem and a fall in enjoyment for previously exciting activities among other conditions. I can't get a diagnosis at this moment in time and so can't confirm anything, but I know I do not  associate with the low self esteem part, and instead the lack of enjoyment part. Given the conditions I suspect It's burnout. For almost 12 months now \(for the first few I spent It In a dark room\), my routine has consisted of watching movies \(whether at home or at a theater\), TV series, playing video games and surfing the web. I don't have much else I can do \(but all suggestions are welcomed since I could have missed something\) but what I'm doing is definitely a scheme for burnout. How do I regain those uplifting feelings again?",25May2018,1
2,"Recently I’ve been thinking about social media and the fact that it’s become a threat to public health. It’s in the news a lot. Like a lot of other people, I used to love social media (and was tricked into thinking that it helped my depression and anxiety). Obviously, times have changed since AIM, etc.

I’ve distanced myself from social media a lot since the election because I felt like I was losing my mind. People are talking about how deleting social media accounts made them feel less depressed. Do you guys think this is true? I would say, personally, that deleting Snapchat/Twitter/Instagram/Facebook has made me less panicky, but it doesn’t make me feel *better*. I’m still just as isolated and full of despair as before...I just don’t spend hours looking at what other people are doing. As for real-life friendships, people are drifting away emotionally and/or physically because that’s apparently what happens when you’re in your late 20s/early 30s and nobody warns you about it.

Furthermore, I feel so bitter and hopeless about trying to foster real human connection in the digital age that I don’t know what to do instead. Social media has made me more afraid of people. Most users on sites like Meetup.com in my area are middle-aged, so I wonder where young people like me are depressed and hiding. Sometimes, when I walk past strangers on the street who are my age, I want to ask them if they’re in the same boat as me. I made a dumb joke last week about wanting to set up a “human connection booth” that would look like a lemonade stand. Just sit at a table with a sign like “free human connection — no WiFi needed” or some shit. 

What are we young people gonna do about this? I’m as big of a fan as anyone of nihilistic memes, especially on really bad days, but is anyone else worried about this stuff? The long-term mental health of our entire generation is at stake. ",25May2018,4
3,"Like wtf man like i dont understand no more go see a mental health tell them how i lossing intersted in everything and im sure im in a depression. Dont want to get up. Dont want to do nothing.

4,"So I want to start with the negative aspects because that’s how my day started. So my mother and I (I suggest reading my last post on my unfortunate relationship with my mother, and her personality at times) went for a drive and things were mostly well. So she tasked me to go in a Walmart, grab an item, and leave. I figured that was since we were doing well since last night.

I recall her mentioning the absurdity of People of Walmart, the page where people are photographed and placed on the website for their goofy appearance. Anyway, for whatever reason when I entered the Walmart, I noticed the people looked strange. I saw a woman with bunny ears, I saw the typical 50-year old man/woman who worked there (who I always feel for), and I just started worrying. I didn’t know why exactly I started feeling nervous and anxious. I think I felt a bit overwhelmed because... well not to be condescending, but the people in that particular store *seemed* like they’d belong on People of Walmart.

I thought I was experiencing social anxiety because the store seemed so crowded. I’ve never felt anxiety in this context of feeling overwhelmed because of ‘strange people’ before. While I was covertly worrying, a woman in her 50-60s asked me for help reaching a tall item. I was happy to help her, but was still feeling strange.

This caused a scary feeling. If I’m correct I may have been detached at the very least, and numb. I was concerned I was suffering from derealization. One somewhat scary thing was I had some intrusive thoughts relating to harm, and they were frightening because I worried if I was actually harmful, but I’m well-aware they were intrusive in nature.

Important to note that another similar fear is worrying if it’s possible to lose contact with reality or ‘go crazy’. If you’d like, refer to my other posts.

However, when I returned home and went for a walk in this hot weather, I noticed all of the vibrant colors in nature and how pretty the day looked. Of course, I was very relieved that the ‘derealization’ only lasted for around an hour, as I felt much better when I went for the walk and such. 

The positive aspects of today were:

* Today I did mindfulness meditation, and it’s really good to hear an instructor (albeit from an app) reassure you that things will be fine, and let you know that you are valued. Sometimes we forget that in our busy, stressful lives.

* I enjoyed talking with someone who isn’t really a friend, but they seemed vibrant and I was happy to be cordial.

* I was happy to calm down and notice my breath.

* During the meditation, I was questioning my grounding in reality and whether or not I was in contact with reality. Shortly after I realized that I am questioning reality, so I must have a grasp on reality. I’ve always considered myself to be a realistic person.

* I am happy and thankful for the myriad of resources available, and I am happy to be alive although life seems very stressful and weird at times.

I am happy to receive support from you all. Am eager to receive feedback and advice!",25May2018,1
7,"I’ve recently got on medication after 20+ years of avoiding it. It’s leveling me out but my friends and family won’t stop punishing me for the actions and words that I could not control in the past. 

“Your actions have consequences.” Is what my gf told me before she became my ex. I had a mental breakdown in front of her. 

“All my friends say you’re toxic and I shouldn’t talk to you.” My long time friend told me. 

My father doesn’t talk to me. My mother can’t stop telling me how terrible I used to be from childhood until recently. 

The rest of my friends avoid me. They don’t return phone calls or texts unless they want or need something. Before the pills I was the one there for them, listening to their problems, trying to help. Now I need some help. Instead I’m alone and punished. My friends and family aggravated and angry with me for something I had no control over. 

Severe PTSD-major depression-suicidal idealization since age 4-a genetic chemical imbalance I didn’t ask for. That’s what I’m up against. Better than some, worse than others. But for my friends and family-I deserve punishment for aggravating them, scaring them with a suicide attempt, hurting them with uncontrollable isolation, and giving bad advice I thought was good at the time. 

Now I’m isolated. Afraid to make any new friends. Afraid to get into any new relationship. I plan to live alone. Be alone. Then I plan to buy enough heroin to kill myself. There’s no use getting better when there’s no one around. They’ll all be sad and pissed but the alternative is listening to their issues, needs, wants, and desires while also listening to how I fucked up that one time or all those times. 

Fuck this life. ",25May2018,4
8,"Is it toxic to talk badly of yourself? For example saying ""I'm garbage"" or just degrading yourself at all. I know someone who degrades himself a lot, sometimes for no reason. I don't want to seem rude but whenever he does that, it makes my head hurt and just want to be alone and take time for myself. I wasn't sure if his behavior is toxic, or maybe I'm the one with a problem?",25May2018,2
9,"Something is wrong with me or my upbringing. I guess I had life too easy. I've never actually really wanted anything. I was never interested in school and never put any effort into studying. I never bothered to pursue anything seriously. I've never had any dreams or desires for the future nor any longterm plans. I was able to get by but I lost my mind.

I am currently living with my family. I hate it. I have an autistic sister who constantly stresses me out. I am isolated in the middle of nowhere. Still, I don't desire my own happiness enough to do things that would improve my life. I wastefully spend money when I should be saving because I guess I don't really care enough. I have no long term plan and I can't really take care of myself.

I am trash. I am a lazy piece of shit who can't take charge of his own future. I have no desires. I only care about what is happening at this very moment and can't plan ahead for the future. I don't know how much of it is schizoaffective disorder, or how much of it is just the fact that there is something defective within me. I don't even have the desire to kill myself, which I probably should. 

I am lazy and I don't really feel anything. I can't make myself desire anything strongly as I have never felt strong desire in my entire life. The only thing I've really wanted is friends and a girlfriend, as well as a sense of belonging. However, no matter how much you desire them there is no way to obtain those things. For the most part effort won't make girls like you, nor will it get you friends. Those things just kind of happen arbitrarily without deference to your desires. Maybe I don't have any desires because the things I want aren't something that you can achieve by wanting them or trying really hard—they are the product of having your life already together and then chance.

**TL;DR**: I don't feel any strong desires. I am a lazy piece-of-shit  who is incapable of long term planning. My life is miserable because I don't want to fix it strongly enough. I am incapable of long-term planning.",25May2018,4
10," To run to seek relief by entertainments, intoxications, religious\-spiritual ideas, activities, holidays to escape the discomfort of irritation, uneasiness, uncertainty, compulsions at work you experience in daily life – is psychological laziness. One does not notice that one is psychologically lazy.   
 We are alert when we are held in an emergency situation, when we have to select from choices which are not clear, when we are to act instantly but effects of action are ambiguous, when there is pain in the body, when we face any irritating, discomforting situation. Brain gathers energy to meet the situation. At other times, we remain relieved, satisfied. We are carried away by the relief.

13,"Imagine.
Standing atop a mountain. Vast beauty stretching as far as your eyes can glean.
You take a deep breath. And you look at your feet.
You notice you’ve wandered to far from the path. 
Your toes curl over the sheer edge of the cliff, hundreds of feet of empty air between you and the next piece of sure footing.
You can’t step backwards. Paralyzed. Staring at your shaking legs.
You exhale and watch pebbles slide out from beneath your feet, falling down to a certainly uncertain fate.
You hold your breath. The world is still. 
Back straight. Head down. Trembling knees. Not daring to breath, perchance to slip. 

...

Eventually you must exhale, and watch another tiny stone roll from beneath your feet.
You hold your breathe again.

Breathe. Listening for the stones to hit the canyon floor.

Hold your breath....

Eventually you will run out of your fear and gasp for air, gulping it in after so long denied its freshness...falling to a certain death.

But now...

All you want is to fall backwards to safety. To your yesterday of standing atop a mountain, safely from the edge, or at least unaware of your impending danger. 

But yesterday is gone and you can’t remember it clearly...all you’re sure of is the edge of the cliff, of the tiny stones that cut into your grasping toes.

Inhale. Watch the tiny stones pour to their new home below. 
Hold your breath as they tumble...

You fear the fall and yet you’ve been here so long...how long...? No idea. Maybe forever.

Your friends and family urge you to step back...just step back...all things are fine in yesterday...on the path...away from the edge...

But you don’t remember the path.
And the void below your bleeding toes is singing. Welcoming you. 
You remember the void. 
It was here for so long.
It tells you it has always been here, an eternity, it’s as much a part of you as your blood seeping into the dirt and rocks is a part of it.

Breathe...listen to those little stones finding their way home...

The void tells you that your toes won’t bleed when you learn to fly. 
It whispers come home. 
And on the forgotten path behind you, you can hear people telling you to come home...

Your feet hurt. 
Have always hurt...?
Are not bearable much longer...

You’ve stood so long staring down you can’t remember yourself. Only your shaking legs and aching feet.

Do you have wings? Can you fly? Are you the void? Where is home...?

You gasp. ",25May2018,0
14,"It's a long damn story but we have a history of severe mental illness in our family including schizophrenia, severe depression, and multiple suicides. My sister has attempted 3 times and has been hospitalized numerous times in psychiatric hospitals.

She currently thinks she's possessed by a devil, that people that have died visit her often, grab her legs at night in bed, and have conversation a with her about the antichrist and the devil inside her. I'm just trying to get help. I called a crisis line today and left messages with her psychiatrist. She truly believes an exorcism by a preacher is all she needs and she's called several preachers to arrange one.

They say stuff about gay and trans people constantly and it just hurts me. I can’t even talk to them without the conversation turning against me. They deny that mental illnesses exist and won’t get me good help. The only time they got me help was when I was going to kill myself. Now they won’t take me to therapy and won’t get me new medicine.

So anyways after he walked by, a dark shadow figure appeared right in front of me, exactly how he was walking. Then the figure crouched down and looked at me. As if he was studying me. Then a couple seconds later it disappeared. The figure itself was really ghostly, it kind of shook me up. And the scary thing is that I was staring at him and thinking who the hell is that. It wasn't an ""out of the corner of my eye"" type situation. I was focusing on him and it was perfectly clear, but shadow like at the same time. It's so hard to explain. I've never experiences anything like that before. And if thats not enough, the exact same thing happened maybe 3 minutes later. The figure moved the same way and looked exactly the same.

24," I'm a fake  person. I lie to myself and others all the time for so many years I  became a fake person. I don't really do the hobbies I say I have.  I'm  always trying to be someone the present company wants. I don't know who I  am anymore, but I became a character of what others wanted of me. I  know what bits are the real me when this backfires and I can't sustain  who I'm pretending to be. But this tends to be someone who can't handle  much going on, and isn't truthfully interested in anything but  hedonistic stimulation or straight up spacing\-out nonproductivity... and  nothing inbetween. I constantly leverage things to slide  responsibilities away. I like to have opportunities available but can  not seem to capitalize on them. I don't know why. I seek them anyway,  and often leverage them against each other to maximize what I really  want as described. I don't know why. I'm genuinely unhappy I can never  accomplish anything but I paradoxically don't seem to want to. I'm  floating through life putting in the bare minimum and wanting nothing,  favoring cutting productivity for hedonism rather than earning it  properly. This has hit a point where I'm afraid I never properly  developed as a real person. I am pretending to be more productive and  suffering than I am/do, but also do happen to take much longer and have a  harder time buckling down than anyone else to accomplish the same  amount as my peers. When I try to cut out hedonism and properly  structure my life like other people, I can do so but fall into losing a  lot of time to non\-productivity or straight up inefficiency and much of  what I do becomes a juggling act that quickly falls apart. At this point  I'm doubting I'm capable of ever being a functional ""adult"" despite  nearly a decade of being so.

It's a  paradox. I stimulate more, I fall more into hedonism which eventually  starts undermining productivity, I stimulate less, I fall into laziness  which starts undermining productivity.

Please take this seriously I'm not some kind of edgy teen looking for attention, I really need help in figuring out my mental state. I just lost my job and I don't have a lot of money to go to an actual therapist/ psychologist so I was hoping that someone could help me out. I didn't want to type my whole life story so I made of list that highlighting some background stuff and my behaviors 

\- I don't have friends outside a few of my family members

\- I don't really love anyone, I do care for the few family members I deeply like, but I wouldn't care if they died or not

\- I excessively daydream to the point where I'm pretty sure is not healthy

\- I have a problem expressing emotion, I question if I even feel emotions sometimes

\- It's hard for me to connect with people on a deeper level, I just don't really understand the way they feel so I tend to stay away from creating emotional bonds with them

\- I have had previous costumer service jobs, and I've always been told I need to talk more or smile more, and it's frustrating how other people can do this so easily and I can't. I get along with my co\- workers just fine though.

\- I had a mentally and sometimes physically abusive step\-father growing up, he had anger issues, PTSD, and was Bi\-polar

\- My mother was never really there for me as a parent and I never really had a relationship with her

\- When I was in my second year of middle school I began to have suicidal thoughts, but they stopped and returned again in my last two years of high school and first year of college, but after I left to live with my aunt, I haven't had any of those thoughts 

\- I thought I had depression but I never had the symptoms, besides suicidal thoughts that where triggered by my abuse, but since leaving my parents I haven't thought about it.

\- I have never had the urge to hurt myself or others. Ironic since I was suicidal, but I wanted to kill myself the least painful way and in a way where I knew I would be gone for good because I didn't want to there to be the possibility of surviving and having some sort of brain damage or physical disability 

\- I have never done drugs or drunk alcohol or anything legal, well I never got caught if I did

\- I have never dated or been intimate anyone and it doesn't really bother me, I would like to have a partner\(s\) in the future but if I don't that's ok with me

\- I sometimes think I might have some kind of social anxiety/anti\-social disorder, but I'm no psychologist

So this is all the stuff I could think of at the moment, stuff I would probably tell a therapist if I could, but I'll try to answer any questions you guys have. Please be nice, thanks for the help.

However, he is someone who needs a lot of time doing his own thing, which the sensible part of me has no issue with. BUT, when he is out, especially with friends, i get sad/stressed, my mind hates him spending time with anyone else (especially females tbh) and not me. I even stress when he talks to other people over facebook or anything because i feel like i’m not getting his attention and i don’t like others getting his attention.

This is also an issue i used to have a child, when my mum used to go next door to her friends she would need to bribe me with sweets just to leave me alone in the house for a couple of hours, and i would still be upset.

I can't go into much detail but Jen is married 10+ years with 3 kids, works part time; the husband is controlling, manipulative, emotionally/mentally abusive, obvious NPD, works full time outside the house. My friend is wanting help out of the situation but her husband has convinced her that she has no friends, no support system, that this is all make believe, he is controlling her every move with a dictated schedule and monitors her phone logs and even the mileage on her vehicle. I've seen the progression over the past months of the mental abuse she's going through and don't for a moment doubt what I've been told or heard.

I live 500+ miles away and she has asked for my advice and help on getting out of the situation. She's never asked for money or the be rescued, she wants to do this on her own. I've suggested therapy would be a good place to start, as with the ongoing issues she needs someone there that can be an advocate for her. She's looked into a lawyer on my suggestion as well. 

My questions for the mental health community. What else can I do other than what I've done for the past year to help her, we text and chat daily with a weekly phone call or two, if her schedule allows. I reassure her that she has to fight on for what she believes...that it's important to be good to herself...etc I try to get her mind off the situation at hand but it's overwhelming on her side and I don't want to add to her issues. I'm not sure what else I am able to do from 500+ miles away.

She has insurance, through her husband, though it's a high deductible plan and she would be unable to afford the $100 copay for a therapist. Are there any therapists in the Detroit area that would be able to help with some kind of arrangement...or how could I find out for her?

Jen has told me that her own mental health is not well, that there are days that she can't get out of bed because of the depression. She has an overwhelming amount on her shoulders, and her schedule is dictated from 4:45 am till 11pm - 7 days a week. I worry that she is getting close to a breaking point and some days it's significantly worse than others, much more so recently. 

I feel that her situation is getting more dangerous and I implore her to utilize 911, she's convinced that her husband would be able to convince the police to go away and that nothing would be done. How could I change her mindset that that won't happen?

It sounds trivial, I know — and I never thought I would cope like this (e.g. not coping!). But I've sunk into depression, because I can't cope. All of the structures that underpin my mental health stability are collapsing at once. I can't see a therapist, because my insurance is in flux along with my job.",25May2018,1
46,"Hello. I am a 20 year old female who still needs ""security blankets"" When researching this on the Internet, I find that this is relatively normal. However, my particular issue is not as easily searched on Google.

The thing is, I can seemingly attach myself emotionally to various previously unimportant objects and turn them into comfort objects when I'm feeling anxious, scared, and alone. 

I sleep with a stuffed lion and stuffed baby doll which I have had since I was a baby. They've always been my most treasured personal possessions and I don't think I could cope with losing them. The problem is, when they aren't there say in public and I need emotional security, I turn to other things. Especially my purse. I'll feel almost an emotional bond with it. It's soft and made of cloth so I can hold it. 

I've even managed to turn garbage into comfort items. I got a small, heart shaped box of candy for Valentine's Day this year and the crinkly, heart shaped liner in the top is still sitting in my room as I have formed an attachment to it. 

The only real personal bonds I have are with my immediate family and my boyfriend. I sometimes feel isolated and I wonder if that has anything to do with my behavior. 

I don't have any opportunities to make friends because I am unable to drive or work due to severe psychiatric issues and impaired cognitive function. 

I'm not really sure what to do or how to stop attaching myself to random objects when I feel under pressure. Any advice would be appreciated 

TL;DR - I've been attaching myself emotionally to various objects of little importance in place of emotional support and I don't know how to stop. ",25May2018,1
47,"In part 1, I had explained that I need earphones as a coping mechanism (for social phobia) when I go to places with a lot of people.

My other coping mechanism for social phobia (part 2) is wearing a pair of dark glasses. They should be dark enough so that people can't see your eyes easily. I need dark glasses to peep at other people without them knowing me. Whenever I suspect that people are trying to bully me or talk bad about me, I will peep at them (wearing my dark glasses). Make sure your head is not facing the person; otherwise, people will start to notice you looking at them. They had never notice me peeping at them. Most of the time, around 95%, people do not even notice me or look at me. This makes me feel safe knowing that there no people who are looking at me, are trying to bully me or talking bad about me. However, when you are talking to a person, remember to take off your dark glasses. It is rude talking to other people with your dark glasses on.

51,"Accidents, illnesses, death of family members, anything that would have made me feel horribly. I have always thought to be a pitiful attention seeker and that I was being disrespectful to those who actually go through that. Still, it’s been like this all my life.
As a child I used to think everybody wanted to suffer, but now I find this very weird.

My father moved when I was about four, I have lived with my mother and grandmother ever since.
My grandmother was highly abusive, for example she used to insult me and yell at me, when I was twelve she told me somebody like me could just end up being a prostitute or a drug addicted. They told me I started to reject her at three.
My mother was cold, she didn’t want me around, she didn’t keep promises, she never played with me, she would tell me I was no longer her son, she yelled at me and insulted me and never said a word against my grandmother’s abuses.
I used to feel very lonely and not understood at all. I had to repress myself all the time and, when I started to react, at the beginning of middle school, the house turned into hell.

I had memories of me sitting somewhere by myself at kindergarten, feeling “gloomy”. I suppose I was feeling alone, discouraged.
My mother didn’t want me and I had to deal with all my problems by myself.

At the age of twelve I wanted to kill myself.
At the age of fifteen I started to selfharm and to think about suicide more seriously, to the point I was almost there, but I managed to go to see a psychologist, which has been awful.

62,"I'm not totally sure where to ask this, and I hope posting here is okay. 

I'm just very curious about people who have or want to detach from most of their family. I'm struggling with feeling awful for not planning on going to a BBQ with a bunch of my family, but I also don't want to feel awful for going and being treated less than everyone else.

A little background information: My father is my only blood relative in this situation. He remarried and most of the family is my step-family. I'm the 'youngest' (28) of our branch, with 1 older sister (31) and 1 older brother (36). I rent from my step-aunt who is a bit neurotic and I DO NOT get along with her well. She has a tendency to exaggerate, to berate, to complain, and to manipulate people emotionally. I have asked most all members of my step-family (especially step-sister) to not tease me anymore as we're adults. I ask to not be included in conversations that are dramatic or sexual. They have ignored me in this. It's uncomfortable. My poor wife (26) gets treated worse than I do. I'm not sure most of the family is truly okay with my sexual orientation. They say they are, but I still hear them talk about LGBT issues negatively. I have had a feeling of owing these people everything since I was 12. They expected so much from me but never really made me feel cared for. They mock mental health issues even though my step-sister has attempted suicide and my step-brother nearly died from drug abuse.

So I'm asking r/mentalhealth how to deal with this. I'm feeling pretty sure that I don't want to deal with these people anymore, but the idea of detaching is a bit scary. Plus with renting my aunt's house I feel as though we owe her something. We pay the mortgage, but still it feels like she expects blood.

I was hoping someone could give me more answers or insight on what disorder she specifically has. This is honestly my third time posting this and it may relate to some people here so maybe it isn't taken seriously as a mental illness? I don't know, but here it is:

I have a friend who has always gotten obsessive over people on the internet she meets through video games or mutual online friends. She barely meets them for a few weeks, even cries over them saying she's fallen in love. And those quickly come and go, but when she finds someone who responds to her antics, she does get into these long term relationships with them online for 2\+ years, but they meet in real life and their relationships don't last half a year or a year because she absolutely wants to get away from them after just a few months. She talks about having a family soon because she's 34 and her baby clock is ticking, but she is choosing these somewhat, degenerates that are always 5\+ years younger. Her last 3\-year relationship was with a 19\-year\-old.

* She definitely is a independent person \(enjoys living by herself\) and she understands she has to work.
* She is one of the most insecure people in real life \(too be honest, understandably related to her physical looks to standards of society\).
* She is a charming, sweet, funny, kind person.
* She has no strong ambitions or goals to besides complacently working regular store employee jobs.

I cannot definitely pinpoint her childhood trauma issues \(if she had any\) as of the moment which makes this harder to evaluate. I just really want to help her, because she just seems crazy delusional to me and it looks just really toxic and unhealthy.

71,"Lately, I’ve really been struggling with inadequacy (ie: imposter syndrome) with my grad courses and it’s started to trickle into my personal life. I feel like... I am never enough. I put my all into everything that I do, but it doesn’t seem  to ever measure up to my own, or others, expectations. I compare myself to my peers constantly, all of whom have completed their undergrad at prestigious universities/colleges, and I can’t shake this feeling that they are, in many ways, better than me. I have the same feeling when I hang out with friends from school. 

I’ve also noticed that I’ve become so lonely. Because of school and work, I’ve completely neglected my friendships. Someone who I cared for deeply in the past has also returned, out of the blue and after a year of not speaking, but it’s fizzled. After a few short weeks. I think that he made me feel unwanted before, by ghosting me, and now again, by ignoring me (and probably ghosting me again). I don’t matter and I don’t think I ever did, to them. It’s a hard pill for me to swallow. 

I’m leaving for a beautiful European vacation tonight and I can’t even feel excited because I feel like I don’t deserve it. It’s become this all-encompassing haze that I can’t shake off, like I’m constantly in this dream-like state where I’m functioning, but not really aware. My mind feels so far away from my body. 

I don’t know. I guess I just needed to share this with someone. I don’t want to feel like this anymore, but I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",25May2018,1
72,"I need some serious advice. My entire life is a repeating cycle of mental illness\-driven failure, and I don’t know what to do. Literally. At this point I am more than considering killing myself; I’m starting to plan it out. The thing is, I don’t want to die so much as I just don’t want to live like this anymore. I CAN’T live like this anymore. I just don’t see how I’ll ever be able to change my life or get back on the path to success. I want to share my situation here as a last resort just in case someone has any ideas I haven’t thought of yet. 

I am in my mid\-thirties, have had lifelong anxiety problems, adult ADD \(no hyperactivity component\), never ending sleep problems, and persistent digestive problems so bad that some days I’m literally afraid to eat anything at all \(doctors say it sounds like either IBS or Crohn’s disease\). I have massive social anxiety, caused in large part by my gynecomastia that I’ve had to deal with my entire life, even as an adolescent. I hardly own any clothes because I feel horrifyingly embarrassed about my body in most clothes. 

My family is a psychological mess. My younger sibling is in their 30s and is entirely dependent on my parents. This person has 100&amp;#37; given up on the idea that they can be an independent adult. My father is psychologically abusive, verbally abusive, manipulative, and controlling. The psychological torture he put my family through is, what I think, the major cause of our problems, and it persists to this very day. He never stops. I was never taught ANYTHING about how to be an adult. Only yelled at and berated for failing when I do. Everything I know is self\-taught, and I’m a bad fucking teacher. 

The longest job I ever had I held for four years. That was my first job as a teenager. Since then I’ve never been able to hold a job for more than about a year and a half. I’ve had DOZENS of jobs. My anxiety builds so much to a point and I feel so god damn stupid that I become so mortified by the prospect of presenting myself to the world that I can’t get out of bed. I exceed expectations at every job I get and get fantastic performance reviews, but quit every single job because I eventually can’t show up anymore. I become so crippled by anxiety I can’t leave my bed and quit via text or email. 

I go back and forth between failing to keep a job, then trying to go back to school for something, ANYTHING, that can get me back on track. I start and fail that, too. I’ve been to literally every community college in my state and two universities. I’ve got an AA degree to show for it, but no bachelors. I’ve completed two bachelors programs up to literally the last few quarters and panicked and quit. I have two almost\-degrees. None of it was intellectually difficult; I just couldn’t keep getting out of bed and doing it. I have massive debt from this.

I’ve lost everything and had to move back home multiple times. All I do is fail. I did it again. I had a great job. A CAREER kind of job. I excelled in it. I panicked and couldn’t leave my bed after a little over a year and quit via email. Another bridge burned. I’m now jobless, don’t qualify for unemployment, and am going to be homeless in one week.

I can’t talk to anybody about this, because people just think I’m lazy. Nobody takes me seriously. I can’t tell you how much that hurts. To NEVER be understood. They see that I’m somewhat intelligent, so they just tell me to “get my shit together.” HOW??? PLEASE TELL ME HOW!! I’M BEGGING ANYONE TO TELL ME HOW!!! I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I’M DOING!! IF IT’S SO FUCKING EASY, SOMEBODY TELL ME WHY I CAN’T FUCKING DO IT!!!!!!

Like I said, I’m homeless in a week. I have nowhere to go and nobody thinks my problems are real. I can’t get a job because I have no place to live. I can’t get a place to live because I have no job. I thought about checking myself into a mental hospital but I am convinced nobody will believe that I have a problem. I am considering going to an ER to tell them I’m going to kill myself, but it sounds humiliating and I still think I’ll be turned away for not appearing serious. I live in Washington state, so mental health resources are virtually nonexistent. Literally. Look it up; it’s beyond appalling. 

I defy anyone here to tell me how I have any chance whatsoever of turning this life around. I defy you. Right now I’m about 75&amp;#37; sure I’m going to kill myself by the end of the week. What else can I do? I have nothing and no one. I only know how to fail. I only know how to lay in bed in the fetal position in a state of constant depressive nervousness that makes me physically ill. 

If anyone has ANYTHING to say that could help me I’m willing to listen. It would even help just to know if anyone out there has gone through anything similar. I’ve never known of anyone to have failed as much as I have. The number of times I’ve failed in my life would be shocking to most people. I’ve probably set records. This is really my last shot at reaching out to anyone. I don’t know what to do. I’m not going to make it through the week. ",25May2018,2
73,"Apologies for the long rant, but I'm trying to crowdsource opinions on this as I'm totally at a loss. For context I'm a 30 year old guy.

I've always had a pretty good relationship with both my parents, even though they divorced when I was 11. Sure we've had the odd disagreement, but nothing beyond usual parent stuff. In the last few years, my dad has suffered a pretty devastating psychological blow from some friends of his. Their daughter was dying of inoperable brain cancer, and my dad pulled out all the stops to try and help them save her. He consulted medical professionals all over the world, read around a bunch and basically tried to stop her from dying. It sadly turned out futile, and I'm not sure of the full story, but my dad's friends basically threw his help in his face and told him to leave them alone. To be completely charitable to everyone in this situation, their daughter was dying and they probably weren't at their emotional best. My dad never spoke to them again, and now hates them with a passion.

Now, my dad is a very helpful guy. He tends to offer help and advice, even when it's not asked for. To the point that it's sometimes a little stifling to my own personal autonomy. The problem is he has a pretty bad temper, in addition to having a lot of pent up rage over his unresolved situation with his friends' daughter. I feel as if I ask him to spend time with me, he very frequently ""helps"" to the point that it is frustratingly micromanagey. Also if I refuse to take his help/advice he gets very angry and hold me emotionally to ransom, by saying things like ""I drove all this way/spent all this time, just for you to throw it back in my face."" I either follow his advice, pretend to follow his advice, or go against it and end up fighting. The issue is I've seen this pattern of behaviour play out a whole bunch of times with other people - he offers help/advice, it's not taken (or worst people tell him to get lost), and he gets really angry saying ""why do I bother/people are ungrateful/nobody listens to me."" He's admitted to me a number of times he thinks that his unresolved conflict with his old friends has coloured his behaviour, but refuses to seek professional help.

I have some of my own minor anger issues that I've made a conscious choice to deal with this year by seeking therapy/workshops, mostly driven by the fact at how angry I've seen my dad get and wanting to catch myself before I end up there too as I get older. Part of my coping strategies have been to remove myself from situations where I feel I'm about to lose control due to anger, and I'm pretty good at reading my symptoms (chest pounding, face flushing, shaking) and de-escalating by walking away. My dad, in addition to being very confrontational, is very judgemental of therapy; he used to be a police officer and if you sought mental health support it would go on your record. I don't know how attitudes in the police have changed since then, but my dad was always aware how visible his record would be to colleagues and saw mental health support as a ""black mark"" preventing him from getting promotions, etc. He never knew about my mental health support until today.

Today we had yet another fight over me refusing his help. It followed the exact same pattern as it always does, except this time I walked away as he was berating me for being ungrateful and not taking his unsolicited help. He got extremely mad at my attempts to de-escalate and sent me a series of emotionally manipulative texts (saying he tried to help and I threw it in his face, he travelled all this way to help, I've ruined his day, etc). I ignored them and he eventually rang me demanding why I didn't respond to his texts. I explained I'm seeking counselling for my anger and one method I'm using to de-escalate is to avoid fights. He was shocked that I was in therapy, but carried on berating me asking how would I feel if he walked away. I apologised for his hurt, but said I would continue to do so to protect my own mental health. He explained he had his own issues with his past trauma (see above), but when I suggested we go to anger management/relationship counselling he stonewalled me and said that today's fight was due to me walking away. After this came more berating, I got all my anger symptoms, told him I was getting off the phone and hung up. 

The second call he made to me went in a similar way, but he initially tried to approach it more cooly. He asked me to forget about everything and we were both clearly stressed out. I responded that this was true, but I didn't want that to be an excuse to ignore the conversation that we both need mental health support. Things got more and more heated (same issues about me walking away, being ungrateful, etc). I eventually asked him point blank - ""will you go to relationship counselling with me so we can communicate more effectively and stop having the same fight over and over."" He was silent for so long that I thought he'd hung up, then said he didn't think it was necessary and continued to blame my behaviour for the fight. I tried to manage my anger as long as possible, until he accused me of making everything about me. Then I told him I was to upset and hung up again.

I've now had a series of texts berating me for hanging up, calling me dramatic, guilt-tripping me for trying to get professional help (rather than just make up with the person I love), and generally making this worse than it needs to be. 

I'm completely at a loss. I know I can't  force him into therapy, but every argument he has with me and his family/friends is the same argument. In calmer moments I've tried in the past to guide him through these feelings and avoid him getting so angry, which he is largely receptive to in the moment. But when he gets mad again it all goes out the window. I just don't know how to handle this anymore and feel I'm going to lose my relationship with my father over his hang-ups over getting mental health support. 

This has been far longer than I expected, but unusually cathartic. Even if nobody reads this I feel a bit better, but any advice would be great (including telling me I actually am an asshole but can't see it!). I have a wonderful support network in the form of my mother and partner, but they have their own stresses and I don't want to overburden them with my stuff too.

Thanks.",25May2018,1
74,"So today I had to make an incredibly tough decision and ended a relationship (hopefully temporarily) with someone whom I was truly and madly in love with because, despite all of the love and support i received from this person, my current mental state, and the way I was acting because of it was causing far too much damage to sustain the relationship, and to carry on would only have cause more.

Usually, when i'm this far down the hole, i reach out to one of my few closest friends - the ones who actually understand what it is I'm going through. But it's a Friday night. Everybody is busy, everybody has plans. No one has time to listen to me ramble on about how much I resent my own existence and how much I'm sick of constantly having to hold back tears because I'm so fucked up.

But I can't be on my own at the moment. I'm too afraid of what will appear in my mind. I need to be around people. But not just people. The right people. I can't just switch my attention onto something else and switch off because it's no panacea. It provides no real respite, release, or catharsis. It's only a temporary distraction.

I have enormous procrastination problems. Sometimes I can’t get out of bed. I stay there for a whole day looking at my phone or my computer to the extent I forget to eat or shower. I have no structure in my life, I plan things spontaneously

I have anxiety and recently I’ve noticed that I get anxious just by interacting with people. I just want to get away from the situation as quickly as possible. I also have friends who have noticed that I don’t pick up on certain ques or that I don’t have a filter or that I come across a certain way when I didn’t intend to etc.

I’ve also noticed I have a problem with navigation and taking instructions. It’s like I don’t listen so after a person has said something I forget it completely. I’m also prone to errors and don’t pick up that I’ve done something wrong until someone else points it out. It’s like I’m constantly in my own head thinking about something and losing focus on what I’m currently doing. 

I don’t think I had these problems when I was younger? I did very well in school, I was calm and well behaved and always had good grades. I’ve always been a sensitive kid, kind of aloof but the difficulties I’m experiencing now wasn’t present when I was younger.

I’m not sure where to turn or what to do. I definitely feel like something isn’t right with me. Every day chores and things that other people do seems so hard and difficult to me, I don’t know why.

80,"I’m quite a reserved, introverted person. I struggle with mental health issues underneath the surface that still haven’t been diagnosed because I am a minor, and my parents refuse to believe I probably have a mental illness.

I’ve been feeling awfully lonely lately, I’m in high school with a group of friends I love very much. We are small, only about 5-6 of us. But, sometimes I feel like that isn’t enough, and I need to have more friends to be happy. I don’t want to feel this way because the friends I have are wonderful and I wouldn’t trade them for the world. I don’t mind making new friends either, but I want to be content and okay with being alone.

With my breakup of my boyfriend not to long ago, and the fact that it’s almost summer and a lot of my mutuals and ex are in marching band (for August and the fall) I feel like I’m going to be awfully lonely. While everyone else is having a good time, with a bunch of friends and meeting new people, I’m going to be stuck. Having anxiety about being alone and worthless, even though I have a group of friends I appreciate and care for who do the same for me.

I basically want to appreciate quality or quantity. I want to be content and happy with being alone sometimes, and that I don’t have to do something everyday with friends. And how to be okay with not doing something everyday in the summertime, and improving my mental health. Advice and tips are welcomed of course. Any stories of victory would be helpful. Thank you so much. ",25May2018,5
81,"Hi, so this is the first time I've actually written something on this site but i need help and at this point I'm desperate and this might just be me over reacting and being an over protective friend but i just really don't care at this point.

But first you need a little context on me and my friend Aaliah and what we (unofficially) do for the school. We are well known in our school for dealing and helping others of all ages with mental health problems. We started doing this as we have both also be through mental heath problems ourselves. We have been doing this for 3 years now and have helped 94 different kids with completely different problems and completely different solutions and tho it has given the both of us an amazing and unique outlook on life, i know that some of the things said between us and some of this kids, and other unfortunate things done by this kids has had both positive and negative effects on us mentally (which is probably why I'm on here writing about all of this because I'm not to sure if its just me just preparing myself for the worst).

A friend has been upset about something for the last couple of weeks and he's just not being himself at all. He's not telling me whats wrong and its getting to me (tho I'd never tell him that for obvious reasons). Me and Aaliah have also been seeing some subtle signs he's sending to specifically us in our group of friends that he wants to talk be when ever we try he just seems to panic, block it out and tell us that it's nothing. I know we have to wait until he's ready to comes to us but i hate seeing him like this. He's like a brother to me and it kills to think that he couldn't come to us as soon as he started having problems. 

I'm not to sure if I'm just making it sound worse in my head or if its actally another bad case. What should I do?",25May2018,0
82,"   My mother and father have been separated since my 6th grade year, they told me and my younger brother the day after Christmas, on our two week break. That's how far I can recall my depression. My anxiety though, occurred long before that in Elementary school as far as I can remember. The reason for the separation was that my mother fell in love with another man, who I now call my stepfather. I am 24 years old. 

   In ways my stepfather has been more of a father to me than my very own. I actually do not even speak to my father, I only saw him in the hospital earlier this month when I had attempted suicide for my first, and last time. I will get back to that experience. I endured physical abuse by my father and occasionally my mother during my early teenage years. To a point where I missed school days due to the markings on my face, it was always the face. Fat lips by father, hand mark on face by mother, and me confused on why this was happening to me, my brother never got hit, he played the game very well. I on the other hand, needed people to know how I felt and did not know any other way to deal with my emotions.

   I am not a prejudice person, I love all life and people. They are like me, they have their own problems, their own issues, no matter what skin color or part of the world they come from. My mother and stepfather, are prejudice, so there was always that underlying conflict between us before I could see it. My mother and step father like to call black people niggers, or Hispanic people beaners, when its convenient for them to talk about another and feel superior to them. I'm also Hispanic, and so is my mother, she is just has a light complexion with blonde hair so it gets to her head. And my stepfather likes to complain about welfare, even though we all survived on food stamps after my parents were divorced and him and my mom started to begin a life together. My father is prejudice against anyone who has less money than him, so I fit well in that category. 

   I've had my fair share of therapist's but the questions they ask are already ones that I've asked myself and their understanding of my life is far less than my own so I see no need for them anymore. It gets to a point where they are just someone you can talk to because you get to a point where you have no one to talk to about real issues in life. Parents cant understand because they are the root of the problem, and friends, well when your a point in your life like me you tend to not have very much of them. Medication no longer helps either because when you see the world for what it is, there is no pill out there that can make you forget that. You might feel better for a few months because of this pill, or years for some people, or only weeks like myself until the problems begin closing in on you again.

   Speaking of problems, money is my main one. For short, I gave up a car under my name for a car under my stepfathers name. This car that we will call Nissan, begin its life with my younger brother that I spoke of earlier. He lived in San Diego in a studio with his ex girlfriend and ended up getting a DUI one night on a hit and run. They caught him waiting at a light to get on the freeway. They paid bail, took the car away and paid on their own for a few months until they urged me to let my car go on a repossessed because I was a couple of months behind, but still managing to stay afloat, and begin taking over the payments on Nissan. They also urged me to give my old car to my younger brother to drive around without a license, which showed me how idiotic they really are. This brings me to the title of this post.

   Self centered parents after a suicide attempt. This whole situation leads to how my mother, step father, and father separate money and support, or if you'd like, love for your child. Earlier this month on May 3rd, I attempted to overdose on my medication, I took the remainder of my bottle, which totaled to 24 pills, and did not want to live anymore. My mother was threatening to take the car away from me because I had not paid for two months due to my mental state. I had ended up leaving my job and was planning on killing myself soon, I actually did not worry about the car payment because I was telling myself that I was no longer going to be alive to pay. I had a job for three years and was paying every month on the car that I let get repossessed. I drank heavily and smoked weed everyday, but I made it work. 

   A main reason I almost forgot, because i try my hardest to bury it, was my thirty eight year old uncle physically attacking me and attempting to throw me out of my grandmothers house, where I had a room I lived in for close to a year. My fat, worthless, waste of a human heart uncle, lived in the living room because he a dope head, coke head, and just a piece of shit in general. He broke into my room, accusing me of slamming doors, there was draft from the windows open, and began pushing me on my bed every time I sat up, against the wall every time I sat up, eventually grabbing my neck and forcing me to the ground where he grabbed my legs and began dragging me to the front door from my room. It was traumatizing. He began my ribs while dragging me, every time I attempted to grab a passing door or part of the wall. I called the cops where they threatened to arrest both of us so I said just leave the property, I don't need your help. 

   Two weeks later I'm taking 24 pills, impulsively making the decision to end my life. This landed me in a 51/50 after I called the fire department because I realized, I do want to live, no matter how hard it gets. I've never seen my mother and father cry the way they did for me that first night I was in the hospital, like I was there little baby again, comfort and understanding that I have not felt, ever. And I say cry for me, because I have seen them cry in the past, but never for me, maybe my mother, but not like that, not for the reason she was crying that night. She became my best friend again over that weekend I stood in the hospital. I only saw her twice a day, an hour each time for visitors. But now, three weeks out of the hospital, everything is about the same as before I went in. She just came to me as I was writing this, and told me how she was sorry if she is stressed over the car payment and that she does not want me to be stressed because I should focus on getting better. I told her stress is the wrong word, I'm hurt that money is more important to you than my health. She said sorry and that things are back to normal, with the tone she uses when she is in a good mood. No curse words, no irritation, she wanted me to feel loved again. I don't know what to feel. Certainly it's love, maybe it is not, because before she came and told me that I told her I no longer wish to be alive with how everything turned out after my hospitalization, and then her tone changed, her words changed, as if she was remembered how I looked in the hospital, desperate and alone, she saw her little baby again. Somehow money really does rule over love, even with a parent and child, and even when your mother and stepfather like to say they make over 100k a year together, and your mother lives on site as a manager with no bills but her cable, in a state which is California. Even with a parent and child. But I do wish to live, I do. But it gets very hard sometimes, when all you can do is go on Reddit and type words and somehow wish to feel better. I don't feel better, I feel more lost now. I guess I'll go shower now.

83,"I’m 22 and feel so low just now, sometimes I feel so disconnected from the other people and feel like I carry a load of secrets around with me. I think my path started going wrong when I was 17, having never been particularly good with girls I probably clinged onto my first proper relationship for far too long, it was very destructive as for the four years I was with her I just smoked a lot of pot and felt sorry for myself, more so when we moved in. 

Around 1 year in I started using escorts for sex as my girl had been through a traumatic childhood experience and found sex difficult, I’d always feel so disgusted by myself afterwards and would often cry when alone, but I would occasionally go back everyone has urges. When I was two years in I essentially broke up with my dad and we no longer speak, this coincided with the time both my grandparents died. My school friends have became estranged as I barley ever get to see them anymore and when I do feel I’m too consumed with my own shit to be a good laugh, I can feel me drifting further away from them. 
 
 I’m filled with an overwhelming sense of loneliness that just will not shift, I don’t look forward to things in life I just drudge along, often times I’ll sit with some music on and think of the best exit strategy, should I speak to someone and can counselling help? ",25May2018,1
85,"I know that while a psychologist is seeing you they aren't supposed to have other relationships with you.

Is there a way you can be a normal coworker with someone who used to be your therapist?

87,"Bear with me, I started typing and it turned into a lot more than what I was expecting. I don't expect many responses, but any would be welcome.

This might not be the right sub for a post like this, but it's mental health related. If anyone knows a better place to post stuff like this, that would be great. I usually write stuff like this in a journal, but I'm curious what others would have to say about my thoughts. Journaling is helpful, but I only ever get my own perspective on what I write.

I've been feeling pretty strange recently, partially because I have become very introspective, maybe too introspective at times, trying to analyze my behaviors and even my thoughts, looking at every little thing under a microscope. It seems like a good thing to increase self-awareness, but can you be too self-aware?

I often find myself getting lost in my thoughts and not being able to focus on what's immediately around me. Even while I'm actively doing something, my mind usually wanders off to something and somewhere else. I shift into a sort of autopilot sometimes. Especially with things that I've done before. Like at work, for example. Once I know what I need to do and how to do it, I don't need to put any conscious effort in to get things done. I just do it. Like muscle memory. It's like my body just knows what to do automatically, leaving my mind free to turn it's attention elsewhere. This even gets in the way of enjoying what's happening in the moment a lot, too. Watching TV or movies, hanging out with friends, driving, playing games, reading, these things never seem to catch my full attention. I'm there but not there at the same time.

I recognized that my absent-mindedness was starting to get in the way of me living my life, and wanted to do something to change that. I started reading about mindfulness techniques and meditation. It really seems like a good way to train my brain to focus better and to feel like I'm more in control of my life. It usually feels like I'm living in the passenger seat, not really being the driving force of my own life, just reacting to things that happen to me or around me. I want to be more self-aware and more in control, but I feel like I'm just making myself more confused by looking inward so intensely. I end up questioning every single thought and emotion that comes across my mind, trying to figure out what parts are real and what parts are simply constructs of my vivid imagination.

I may have difficulty concentrating most of the time, but I realize that my brain is a powerful tool. When I can focus on something, I try to examine it from every possible angle. So when I turn that focus on myself, on the thoughts big and small that run through my head, I try to get to the bottom of everything. I try to figure out why I think the things that I do. I have been able to learn a lot about myself and I think I have a better grasp of what makes me tick, but sometimes I just get wrapped up in circular logic.

Here's an example: When I want to reach out to someone and talk to them, am I doing it because I'm lonely and want attention? Or do I actually care about the other person and what they have to say? Can it be both? If I feel that I'm only reaching out of loneliness, chances are that I won't even reach out at all. Because I recognize that my intentions might be selfish in nature, trying to make myself feel better. Like I'm using the other person to help satisfy my own needs. Stuff like this just makes me more confused sometimes. Self-awareness starts to turn into self doubt as I question the motivations of my actions. When I feel like I want to do something or talk to someone, I find myself questioning if that's what I actually want to do, and if I do want to do something, I ask my self why I want to do it. Do I do things because I enjoy them, or are they just distractions? In trying to become more mindful, I think I'm becoming more lost in my thoughts more than ever. I feel like I'm doing it wrong.

In my mindfulness exercises, I try to calm my mind by focusing on my breathing. That's a pretty common thing people focus on when trying to meditate. Focus on the sensation of breath, and gently bring your attention back to it when your mind wanders. I've been able to do this with some success. I usually do it as I'm lying in bed to try to calm my overactive mind. Last night, I became extremely focused on my breathing, and my whole body in general. There were none of the usual thoughts swarming through my head. I was only aware of the physical sensations of my body, aware of every little feeling of discomfort. I could feel the minor aches and pains that I would normally ignore. Because I was so focused on my physical body, everything became intensified like I turned up the volume. I could feel my heart beating in my chest and I could feel my pulse in my fingers and even in my toes. I could feel the food moving through my digestive system, tracing the gurgling and the nearly imperceptible movements of my intestines. It was almost as if I could pinpoint the location of my supper as it was being digested.

I noticed that I had turned my attention away from my breathing and brought it back. I became intensely aware of every single breath. Instead of letting myself breathe automatically, I switched it over to manual control. I took some deep breaths and felt the air filling my lungs. It even seemed like I could feel my blood rushing to my lungs to carry the oxygen off to the rest of my body. After the deep breaths, I dialed my breathing down to barely noticable shallow breaths. This went on for awhile. I was calm and my mind was quiet, but I found that I was so focused on my breath, focused on controlling it, that I couldn't make the transition into sleep.

I tried to think of other things to get myself to breathe automatically again, but I was still consciously in control of my breathing. As I tried to let my mind drift off and wander again, my attention slipped away from my breath. But in the back of my mind, breathing was still in manual mode. When I stopped controlling my breaths, I just stopped breathing altogether. My nervous system was seemingly unable to take over again. My mind was wandering as usual and I was listening to the peaceful night sounds out my window, trying to fall asleep. About a minute or so would go by and I noticed that I hadn't taken a breath yet. I had to consciously inhale and exhale. This kept happening. I'd drift off for a minute, maybe more, then realize I wasn't breathing. There wasn't even the normal panicky sort of discomfort that comes around when I try to hold my breath, like I had somehow turned off the self-preservation part of my brain.

Laying in bed, trying to settle down, I was rationally aware that I was using very little energy, and so I needed less oxygen as a result. I was unable to release control over my breath and seemingly only breathed when necessary. This didn't even really bother me all that much. I was still very calm and relaxed. I eventually did fall asleep, but I'm unsure if my breathing returned to normal before or after falling asleep. The idea occured to me this morning that I might have even held my breath until I passed out. That's not supposed to be possible to do, and it's probably not what happened, but I can't seem to shake that idea. After all, I had no discomfort from not breathing, even for more than a minute. The whole experience was very unusual, but it doesn't really distress me. I find it more intriguing than frightening.

To those that took the time to read through my ramblings, thank you. I'd be happy to expand on anything I wrote or share more of my thoughts with anyone who's interested. I'd also be interested in hearing what others have to say about any part of this, or share any of their own experiences.",25May2018,2

91,"So I'm 26 and am two months into recovery from eating disorders I had had since 2009. I thought that getting rid of it would fix my emotional and mental instability but it hasn't.

Here is a description of my average day:

I wake up. If I am excited about something from the previous day I am euphoric and pass around the house, listen to music, drink coffee, chain smoke cigarettes and talk to myself.

If I wake up and am not excited about anything (I call these fixations) I desperately search for something to get excited about. I feel that if I don't latch on to something I will forever be sad. I just search random things online until I find something I can devote my life to (that's how I think) 

I try to convince myself that these fixations will last and that I'll never be down again, but around the late afternoon it usually crashes into depression and I throw away any reminder notes I've written that tell me what I am excited about and how exactly I should think about it and what I should do to keep it going forever. Of course, it never lasts forever but I try to convince myself that this one is different. 

This happens every day, with mornings being the period ripe for euphoric bliss if I have something to be happy about. I struggle with this even at work and have to take breaks sometimes to check my phone and remind myself what I'm excited about and why. I have no strong self identity so I am always trying to decide what my life should be about. This can range from sushi to Ukrainian politics and everything in between. I am completely insane. I've been single since 2014 and my only friends are work friends and cigarettes.

96,"Columnist Douglas Todd writes about his father's mental illness, particularly the signs of schizophrenia he exhibited a few years after returning from driving an ambulance in the Second World War. 

Here's an excerpt: [The Riverview Hospital “ward notes” about my father’s shock therapy read largely without expression, which, not without coincidence, is how my father came to be.

“Record of coma insulin treatment: 166 hours, 5 minutes on treatment. 29 hours, 15 minutes in coma. 27 comas,” says a ward note dated June 16, 1954, less than a week after he was involuntarily admitted to the mental hospital. “7 grand mal seizures.”

There is no record my father, Harold Todd, his parents or his wife ever gave what is now called “informed consent” to this sudden series of shock treatments at B.C.’s large psychiatric facility in Coquitlam.

Nevertheless, my dad, at age 28, endured being repeatedly strapped onto a bed for scores of electro-convulsive therapy sessions, the kind made infamous by the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. He was also subjected to even more experimental insulin shock treatments, which for a decade or so were the big thing in psychiatry until they fell out of favour in the late 1950s, when their healing effects were debunked as “mythical.”

It would probably be going too far today to refer to such shock therapies as state-sanctioned torture.](http://theprovince.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-my-fathers-shock-therapy-contains-cautions-for-today/wcm/0c27145f-65b3-4826-a25d-0ef2369f4f78)",25May2018,1
