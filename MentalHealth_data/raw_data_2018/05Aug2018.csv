0,"Hello. This story goes back to 3 years ago. At that time I was 14, and started having a really bad time due to psychosis. They were 2 years of pain, suffering and agony. I would harm myself fantasizing with ending my life, with suffering immensely. I started to get therapy, and some treatment. It didn't work entirely after 1 and half year. I would keep cutting, punching, having suicidal thoughts... All of thesw wouldn't end after I decided to finally take the last decision I could have ever taken: committing suicide. As you can see here and now, I didn't succeed, and that's something I don't regret at all. I started to see life with different eyes, I started to feel positive, smile, laugh... I don't want to say that suicide changed my life, because it just worsened it for a long time, but having gotten over it made me someone stronger. If you are thinking on doing it, first of all, see behind the pain and suffering and talk to the joy, pleasure and happiness that life can give you.

 This is a part of my story. 

Thanks for reading it.",05Aug2018,2
1,"I’m honestly in a pretty good place right now. I’m far happier than I’ve been for as long as I can remember. But I still feel deeply lonely. Insecure. Unsure of myself, despite every reason to believe in myself. I can handle those things in moderation, but there are some evenings where it all comes crashing down on me, and for a couple hours I feel totally helpless. 

These and other things, like difficulty expressing my emotions, are making think about asking my doctor about antidepressant. Any thoughts?",05Aug2018,2

3,"It's absolutely absurd. After all, intelligence comes in many forms, it's something so subjective even IQ tests cannot even begin to encapsulate it amongst individuals. I know all this, but yet I've come to the conclusion I must be lower than average. 

I've taken an IQ test twice--the first time I got 130, and the second time as low as 89. I'm obsessed with understanding how smart I am, even though I probably will never know.

I do know, however, my brother exceeds me in most areas. He excells in math, physics...he even took home a national championship for IT in Skills USA. He's a valedictorian with a consistent 4.0 GPA, and although I managed a 3.7-3.9 average in high school, his accomplishments put mine to shame. But I don't want to compete with him--what I'm obsessed with is understanding how less intelligent I am. In contrast to my brother and my mother, who both breezed through school like it was nothing.

I guess what I'm trying to say is...how do I get over this obsession? I know it's pointless, and I'm confident aside from these persistent thoughts. I just want to learn to move on, and stop trying to envision a spectrum of intelligence I cannot even begin to understand.

TLDR; How do I stop obsessing about my own intelligence?",05Aug2018,6
4,"I am currently listening to a Joe Rogan Experience podcast ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQzRcjRGFNg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQzRcjRGFNg)) with Michael Scott Moore. He was held hostage by Somalian pirates for some time. He developed PTSD. At around 35:00 minutes he talks about this and says that the FBI psychologist he worked with advised him not to get help with the PTSD as it would pathologize it. Now, I am probably misquoting him in some respect, but I have a question that pertains to my own experience over the past few years.

Several years ago, I was with my best-friend/cousin and he said that he thought I suffered from anxiety. Now, I certainly saw what he meant, but I had always read about anxiety and thought ""nah, what I experience is nothing like that,"" which is probably classic denial. Once he told me this, I obviously became much more aware of it, and at times was rather bothered by it, like I had at no other time. Therefore, my question is this: did my becoming aware of my anxiety make it worse by way of me focusing on it too much?",05Aug2018,1
5,"Hey there. I've been thinking about talking to a doctor about starting antidepressants. Lately I've been feeling exhausted, don't find anything interesting, my mood swings at the drop of a hat. It's causing problems with my relationship and also just making me feel bad about my relationship with my daughter, I just want to be the best me possible for her. When I'm alone, though, driving in the car, sitting at home, whatever it may be... My mind is just stuck on horrible thoughts and I just don't think I can deal with it anymore. 

I don't really have a ""primary care"" doc like most people do that I could go to. I was looking at online visits since I don't have very much time available to take off of work, but I'm just terrified of the video chats. They make me super anxious and I was just wondering if anyone had found a website where you could communicate over phone or messages? Or is that against some law or something? Lol. I'm just really nervous to talk about this kind of stuff with anyone I'm not familiar with so if I don't have to visit a doctor's office or skype, I'm cool with it.

6,"Hi guys. Not sure if this is the right sub so i’m sorry if it’s not. My best friend of 6 years has always struggled with her self image. In high school she obsessed about her weight and constantly switched between eating too much or dangerously not enough. She used to work at a gym so after high school she certainly lost weight but I think she’s gained a little back since quitting that job. She hates wearing things that show off her “problem areas” and will not wear a bathing suit in front of people, change clothes in front of people, or be intimate with guys. She has grown up around more average sized women but thinner girls. Myself and our other best friend are pretty thin and all the girls closer to her age in her family are extremely thin. She’s struggled to kick the mindset that fat = bad or ugly. I’m pretty well versed in feminist ideals so I’ve been able to see beauty standards for what they really are and not care about how I look as much as I used to. She however is not a political person whatsoever and rejects most progressive ideas so I struggle to see how I could use my knowledge to help her in that way. But that’s the only way that I know how. I don’t know how to show her that physical beauty and weight aren’t everything. I don’t know how to convince her that humans need to eat and that food isn’t a monster and that being thin is not going to solve her problems. I don’t know how to  convince her to talk to a therapist or a nutritionist to help her break this terrible mindset. If anyone has any ways that I can comfort her or open her eyes without being rude, it would be greatly appreciated. I’m tired of seeing her in pain but I also don’t want her to set a bad example for her 3 little sisters. ",05Aug2018,1
7,"So as the title says, I can't sleep over other peoples houses anymore because every time I try to get some sleep, I'll have a mild to moderate panic attack. 

It all started after I joined the Marine Corps Reserve, and found out I was going to the Middle East next year. To be honest I really don't want to go, mainly because I don't want to be away from my life for so long.  It kind of eats away at me.

Now, every time I sleep at someone elses house but my own, I feel a sense of dread and helplessness. My mind is flooded with thoughts about leaving for up to a year and my brain starts racing at a million miles an hour. It sucks because before I was a Marine, I never had this problem. 

It even happens when I'm walking with my friends on a walking trail at night. I get really depressed and anxious and want to go home. I never skip out on going with them, but I'm always the guy ""who doesn't feel like going"" for this reason.

9,"I don't have anyone to talk to about this, and I have an irrational fear of psychiatrists that will be covered shortly - call this, a stream of consciousness in hopes of finding some kind of answer.

As a result of head trauma from abuse at a very young age, I developed a fatty lipomas in the parts of my brain responsible for impulse control, trust, abstract perception, and a few others... That is not the important part, though. My entire life, has been one series of trainwrecks leading to the next - I can never seem to make the right choice, impulsively act while knowing what I'm doing is going to screw me over, but doing it anyhow. At 34 I've never been able to hold down a job for more than a year, because I always get restless, hostile, and very unsettled and depressed - but everything leads to depression. I can't seem to form lasting platonic or intimate bonds with people, but I want to;  can't stay in one place, but I want to settle down and build a life for myself; I know what needs to be done, but it's like there's some unseen force preventing me from ever doing it. This has led to chronic depression, and earlier in my life, drug and alcohol addiction. I don't know what the hell to do! I've tried every self-help course I can find, every NLP walk through... I've attempted suicide 3 times, but every time it somehow gets botched - so I have this sense of purpose, this idea that I'm meant for something more in this world. But I just can't. It's infuriating - I have an IQ of over 145, with deep understanding of the universe and what makes people tick, a love of music and a talent for statistical analysis and prediction; but no motivation, no ambition, nothing.

On top of all this, due to a rather catastrophic childhood, I have severe delusional paranoia - I have tried seeing shrinks, but they just want to put me on more pills... And I'd rather die, than go through psychotropic withdrawls again. All of my family are happily married, have amazing careers, houses, a life for themselves... And I'm working a temp job, living in a weekly rent studio in a shitty desert town. I'm an absolute failure, but please don't take this as a call for pity or me feeling sorry for myself - I'm losing hope, and all the light and happiness has left me. My existence consists of just surviving the day, so I can go to sleep and dream of a life where my brain works right. I'll be perfectly honest, I don't think I'm going to last through the end of the year; I don't care about what happens in the afterlife, because anything has to be better than this.
""What man has hell to fear, when he has lived through it his entire life""
I once had someone tell me on a suicide hotline, ""Maybe it will never get better. But you can't sell yourself short, because what if it does?""
That may have worked when I was in my teens and twenties... But I'm just under halfway through the expected lifespan of European males, and what do I have to show for it? I don't know what I'm looking for here. But I need hope, because I'm going to buy a 45 next week. One last Christmas, and if it isn't getting better, if I can't fix my head, I'm going to commit suicide.

14,"I am looking for information from anyone who knows of alternative, but scientifically grounded, forms of mental health treatment. Specifically treatment modalities that don't pathologizing pain, impose a specific moral flavor, or use a black and white disease model to understand mental health problems. 

Anyone who has had experiences with psycho-emotional help like this please let me know. I really need help, but I cannot go back to the same thing again.  

I've seen over fifteen different mental health professionals, and I eventually gave up on therapy because I was being harmed more than helped by doctors and practitioners who  saw me as sick, invalid, chemically imbalanced, abnormal, or defective at a fundamental or biological level for living with traumatic pain.

It took me many years to realize that the problem wasn't a personality clash with the therapists, but a problem with the disease model of mental ""illness"", the pathologization of personality, and the over reliance on psychopharmaceuticals. 

I would share sensitive information and private problems with my clinicians, and they would react by telling me that my thought, feelings, and personality were comparable to a malignant disease like cancer. They treated me like a subject in an experiment.  My sense of self and esteem was harmed quite badly by clinicians reducing my personal being down to a two-dimensional model, and deeming everything outside said model as invalid or wrong. 

Further, psychopharmacology proved extremely unhelpful, and actually did quite a bit of harm to my mental well being by way of bad side effects. 

If any of this resonates with your experiences, please share. I really need some help, but I can't deal with this kind of therapy again.

15,"I’ve been looking on my social life lately and I’ve realized that I’ve never developed very close knit relationships with friends that I have/had. I never knew how to interact with people and develop closer relationships with people as a kid and came off as weird and awkward because of it. I’m going into my junior year of college and still don’t know how properly invest in people so they know I want to be there friend.

I have one friend that I’ve been close with since kindergarten, but like most Highschool friendships we’ve grown apart but still keep in touch (he actually said he’s heavily considering having me be his best man if he decides to propose to his gf next summer which made me feel really awesome). 

When I came to college Ive tried my damnedest to interact with people. Went out to parties, joined extracurriculars, etc. I’ve actually achieved quite a bit: joined a frat, became VP of a student ran investment fund and got into a class that required me to apply and usually chose upperclassmen over underclassmen. The problem is I realized a majority of my brothers are assholes and are completely different from when I first met them and hung out with them and I find myself hating them so much because of the stupid shit they say and do and the lack of initiative to achieve anything. On top of that the president of the investment fund is leaving the school and going to a better school (I don’t blame him; follow your dreams) and now I have to most likely take over and manage the majority of things. 

So the real close person I really have is my girlfriend which I’m definitely ok with, but I feel it’s unhealthy to only be super close only her. This also scares me a lot because my dad doesn’t have many friends and never hung out with anyone when I was a kid and would unload a lot of his personal problems onto whenever he took me into town with him to do any errands or the mall/comic shop. 

I don’t want to end up repeating the cycle when I have kids myself, but I don’t know how to actually invest myself into people and not feel like I’m coming off as a creep or make myself think I’m wasting my time by asking them if they want to hang out and they say the can’t.

16,"I just watched “Unsane”.  While watching it, I had very strong, emotional feelings while watching it.  Arms folded.  Breathing hard.  Moving in the chair.  And flinching.

Lots of flinching.

I don’t know why I had these reactions.  After watching it, I went outside to smoke.  After two drags, I didn’t want it anymore.  I opened my car and crawled inside, curled up in the back seat and stayed there in the dark.

I wanted to remember.

I wanted to remember what happened in my childhood.  I know the answer is there.  My mom told me the story many times.

In elementary school, like, second grade, there was something that happened.  I don’t remember what it was.  But my mom says I was in a room with the school counselor, the principal, my mom, and my teacher.  I wasn’t telling anyone anything.  I just sat there and claimed up.

“Did someone say something to you?” 

“Did someone touch you inappropriately?”

I just sat there.  Halfway because I knew my mom would find a way to make...whatever it was...my fault.  Again.  She was good at that.

I couldn’t tell anyone in school.  It would find a way back to my mom.  She would say it was my fault.

So I sat there.

Maybe this movie brought that memory subconsciously back. But I do know this...

19,"Hello all! I'm a 16 year old male and basically in my childhood I was sexuall assaulted by my older brother for years. He's about 2 years older than me and I was an innocent child and didn't know any better so he would make me give him hand jobs and would try to do the same to me. At one point he tried to force me to give him a blowjob but I managed to stop him. Not to mention the fact that my parents went through a messy divorce and I was hit by a car all while I was still very young. Pretty much 6th grade through half of sophmore year I was extremely depressed. Earlier this year I planned to commit suicide and had everything planned out but decided not to in the end mostly because I wanted to do it somewhere my mom wouldn't find my body. I was feeling pretty good for the past few months but then something terrible happened my brother came home from college for the summer. Now the 'serious' sexual assault stopped years ago but I've still had situations where he's tried to pull down my pants or will put his hand on my waist when he walks past me and I freeze when this happens and I feel so violated. Afterwards I get angry at myself for not fighting back. I hate him more than anyone else and I have to live with him for another whole month. But that's not even the worst part for me the hardest part is that I just want to be a normal kid but I was anti social for a long time because of obvious reasons and I'm slowly becoming more extroverted but I feel like if I could just overcome the damage that my childhood did to me I'd be able to be so much happier and do something fulfilling with my life. I haven't ever told another person I know in real life about what happened to me and my mom doesn't believe in therapy because apparently because my ancestors were slaves I have no right to have mental issues so I just seriously don't know what to do.

20,"Hey reddit,

I'm seeing a therapist for my own reasons right now – which don't involve suicidal ideation – but a loved one of mine has substantial mental health issues of their own and is ideating suicidally. I learned about this from a different member of my family, not from them directly. They've ideated before in dark periods, and then stopped when things were going well in their life. They're currently in another dark period. But this is them taking a step more concretely towards action, although I don't know how to interpret it. My family member said that this person is ""attempting suicide"" by, what – for confidentiality reasons, I'm leaving unspecified – doesn't really seem like a way one can actually commit suicide, but is nevertheless definitely not a healthy thing to do to one's body. It's something they've done before without attaching the notion of committing suicide to it. Drugs and weapons are not involved.

This person doesn't see a therapist, and doesn't want to. Obviously I'm extremely concerned, and I want to get advice from a professional rather than reddit, but I don't know if this is the sort of thing that I can talk with them about without my therapist being legally forced to take action. Since this is a high tension situation – and this loved one would feel betrayed if they knew I had talked to a therapist about them without their permission – I don't want to make a decision with effects that I can't undo, but I obviously want to do something, or at least get advice about whether and how I can do something. I understand that this should be taken very seriously.

So does anyone know whether I can talk with a therapist about a family member ideating/possibly acting on suicide without their legal intervention?

If it helps, I'm in California. Thank you for any help you can provide. I'm not currently talking to this loved one about this since ostensibly I don't know about it and its extremely sensitive, but my other family member is.

21,"Dated my significant other for 4.5 years throughout college (lived together for 2.5 years). Both graduated, found good full time jobs, and moved to the same rural area together into our first nice place together ($1,000 rent). This was possible due to our agreement to split rent based on our income levels. 

Our relationship was never really in danger until recently. After 3 months the 9-5 schedule and the “real world” began to weigh on her. She became unhappy with life in general and began questioning everything from who she was &amp;amp; where her life was going. Symptoms of depression began and the lack to express herself and communicate drastically increased. In what seemed to be a flash of a decision she went part time with her job and moved to Texas with her father where she only works a few hours a day making $500 a month. We had plans to only be in the area we lived for 1 year before I could relocate with my career in the government.

She felt she was living someone else’s life and the only explanation was she needed time &amp;amp; space to find herself before being able to commit to a relationship. I’ve been told that she loves me and wants to be with me but is not in a mental space to do so happily right now. I’ve kept communication open &amp;amp; she even returned for a weekend visit to spend time with me a couple weeks after her decision to move. There is no doubt the connection &amp;amp; love is still there and I am positive there is not anyone between us. 

My dilemma is not knowing whether to continue communicating with her as she has told me she loves me and sees a future with me, just not at the moment. We have promised each other to not see anyone else, but my heart is in agony with the distance. She has agreed to speak with a profesional regarding her mental health and is looking for work in Texas. However, her actions do not support this. She is living with her dad, purchased a new car, and is spending her time doing otherwise. 

She speaks to me as if we are still together to a certain extent, but is unable to live with me and work through our relationship together. She tells me she needs me in her life, but I refuse to be just friends and need to know I’m the only man in her life. She promises that there isn’t anyone else and swears I’m the only one she will be intimate with.

I don’t know when to stop being there for her as an emotional crutch and talking to her about her situation as I feel I am the one who has been taken advantage of and left to dry in an undesirable location while she can be mobile and not have adult responsibility. I don’t want to play the cold turkey card and cut communication because I do love her. She’s aware that I have an engagement ring and would gladly spend the rest of my life with her as well. I’ve given her control over the situation with hopes she will come around. 

Any perspective on this would be very much appreciated as I am full of uncertainty.

22,"     For a long time, I thought that what I was feeling and experiencing was just a part of life. I have felt numb to a lot of emotions. Love, happiness, excitement. To me it all seems grey. I've always been an angry individual for no reason. Most of the time I don't even know what I'm angry at, though I take it out on others and myself a lot. I don't really know what to say. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Just to finally express how I'm feeling I guess. But I dislike feeling like this. Though living like this for quite a while, it feels like it's who I am. Like this sick haze defines a piece of my personality. And if it were to completely rid my thoughts, I feel as if I'll be different than who I am now, and I'm scared of that change. 

     I'm almost sixteen and going into Junior year. There shouldn't be anything wrong with me, I'm loved unconditionally by my parents and my family. I'm living an easy life that shouldn't be plagued by worry, stress, sadness. I think I may have a sort of depression, anxiety, and even bipolar coming into the mix. I know the first thing that should come to my mind is to see some sort of therapist or whatever would be best. Though the thing is I've never told anyone about what I'm feeling, and I'm too scared to. I think that I would like to get help, but I can't mentally express my feelings to anyone. I can barely even talk to anyone normally. I just try to fake my emotions and pretend I'm not broken. I barely even talk to my own family about my life. They don't know much about me and complain that I don't talk to them. So I can't handle having a conversation out of nowhere with my parents stating that I want to seek a therapist of sorts about my symptoms of depression, anxiety and such. Also just wanted to throw in there that I am not suicidal, and have no intention of self harm or suicide on my mind. 

     I don't know what I'm wanting to get out of posting this. I could of just looked on what other people posted and the answers of their post that is similar to what I'm feeling. Well, thank you for reading this.",05Aug2018,1

26,"The best way I can describe it is that I confuse things in a way that they feel like they have to do with me. For instance, scrolling on reddit, and some post might feel like it has to deal specifically towards me, and than my mind will off shoot some out on a limb possibility process. Or I could be watching a Netflix movie, and for some reason it feels like it specifically applies to ME, and not the general public. This feeling will happen, and I'll usually intellectually rationalize it away despite the knee jerk feeling being there. It is especially noticeable in conversations in real life. People will mention something, some story about somebody else, and somehow it feels like they are referring to ME. Someone else could be getting yelled at and it somehow feels like me being the recipient, as irrational and confusing as it sounds. The best idea I have of where it originated is from taking psychedelics when I was younger, and it having some type of ego boundary lingering effect.  
My hope is someone can recognize this and throw some other terms for it, to aid in finding some type of treatment to help. Hell, just finally admitting it outside of my head, is huge. Most people just go, oh you're just crazy.  


TLDR: Help identifying weird ego boundary issue, trouble maintaining focus in conversations about who the conversation is about, and knee jerk feelings of things having to do with me that definitely do not have to do with me. ",05Aug2018,1

29,"This may be a long one, but I do apologize in advance. 

Just day’s after my 18th Birthday, My Mom took her new boyfriend out to my cousins 19th Birthday at a bar. I had gotten a call from my cousin and she said my mom’s boyfriend had been asking her where he can find coke in our town. She then proceeded to say, he was getting violent with her mother (My Cousins Mom) In the bar. I was worried so I rushed down to the bar, and I saw police speaking to him. I remember seeing my mother, and she was just obliterated out of her mind. I told her to not being him back to our house. I had heard he was abusive, and now on coke. Next thing I know, he was at my house and he was doing lines of blow in my kitchen. I confronted him about doing drugs in our house, and how it was not okay due to having many children under the age of 12 in our home + My mother works for social services (Ironic right). 

When I confronted him this man came at me with my fist, I remember this memory so vividly. He came at me to punch me, and he was yelling at me swearing and calling me names. I remember my cousin jumping in front of me to protect me and I was holding her back from getting hurt as well so tight that all my acrylic nails snapped and bled. 

I remember being screamed at that he was my new father, and I have to listen to him. (My father has never been around and no one will take his place).

I remember having to remove my nephew, brother with autism, and sister with down syndrome from the house. It was 2 am, and I had to pack them all up and take them to a safe place. 

I was torn that my mother could let a man charge at me, and yell at me like that. I was put into such an unsafe position all I wanted to do was call for help but who could I call without my mom losing her job? I’ve kept this inside for a while in fear she would have my youngest siblings taken from us.

However to this day I still get flash backs. I am so scared of men now. Whenever anyone fights me I get so scared that almost instantly I have panic attacks. I am suffering with PTSD. I cannot deal with confrontation, I can’t deal with people cursing at me, or yelling at me. I get so anxious and instantly have panic attacks that take me several minutes to calm down from to be able to breathe again.

I guess why I’m making this post is I want to know how I can cope, how Can I get over this trauma? PTSD Plays a huge part in my day-to-day life now. I am on a wait list for a psychiatrist however I feel so fucked up and scared all the time. What do I do? ",05Aug2018,2
30,"Idk what to do with myself (F19). I get anxious over what feels like every conflict, but like more than normal. Actually, I get anxious and over think *everything*. I hate it, I hate it so much... you’ll hear people say, my mind always goes to the worst case scenario, but my mind seems to go further and I can’t get out of the thought. 

I have a boyfriend, the reason I mention him, is because whenever I’m with him or he’s around me, I don’t get as anxious and I don’t cry really. But when he’s over with a friend for a night, or gone from me, I feel vulnerable and I get anxious and stressed and really sad because of all my thoughts...

My mental health history in a short sentence-ish, is that I’ve not been able to escape my mind and bad thoughts that our demeaning and harsh on myself and life, since I was 16, it’s slowly just become more prominent in my life. I’ve had a few times where I had a mental break down with thoughts of suicide and my first year of college didn’t treat me well mentally and I also did counseling then for the first time as well. 

Sometimes I feel like I need medication. But I hate thinking and knowing that I’m not mentally healthy...

32,"I wake up, have no energy to do much, have been like this since probably around 12 or so. I never managed to be in a relationship since I cannot trust others, and seem to have lost the yearning to socialize to any degree.

In primary school, I believe I had some friends, but I mostly just did my own thing. In high school, I was pretty much neutral, and had maybe 2 friends which I very quickly ceased talking to after graduating. Now in my late twenties, I have no friends, seem to not want to socialize with anyone, never had any form of intimate relationships with anyone due to lack of trust and have not achieved anything in my life. I haven't got any money, little to no work experience and no current employment.

I know that exercise and healthy eating provide a huge boost to my mood, but due to being extremely lethargic in my waking hours, it seems like an insurmountable task. A catch 22.

I've wanted to cease suffering, feeling like some alien in society. I avoid people and social situations because I do not have answers to the common five questions regarding work life, love life, studies, friends or current interests. 

I don't listen to much if any music, I watch movies in an indifferent fashion and I have trouble concentrating to read books or watch lectures.

I can cut off people on a whim, because I get impatient and know this is a huge issue of mine. Not sure how to tackle it really, it all just seems daunting as hell. 

I know what the usual answer is, get a job, workout, the girls come with self love, etc. The problem remains that I seem to be incompatible with most social stuff. Probably due to not learning how to do it when I was younger.

I spent most of my life in my room, playing video games or wasting it on the internet. I notice that my lifestyle closely resembles that of 'incels' or just 'outcast hermits' and I know it's to blame for my ineptitude so far.

However I disagree with the incel mindset since I find it over simplifies things and paints them in black or white. In reality, there is more nuance. Sure people are attracted to others who are 'normal' and good looking. I'm sure most men there would also agree that they wouldn't want an overweight or aesthetically unpleasant significant other. Making it somewhat hypocritical as they would be upholding the same 'tier' or 'caste' system, but on a second level order, for the third order people they claim are beneath them... 

I also realize that looking good helps one feel good too, but tge issue is how do I go about fixing my social ineptitude? How do I 'tap-in' to this unknown wavelength everyone else seems to be tuned in to? Watch all the popular movies, listen to trending music and follow what is currently in fashion? Then my issue becomes how do I blend in when it comes to talking? Why do I have to do all this just to live my life? Is being alive not good enough? Having to fit a mold is now a necessity?

I have days where I wake up and seriously consider just offing myself, but I would not be doing myself any favors as the problem would not have been solved in a satisfactory fashion. It'd just be swept under the rug, and the next person who feels like me in this or another generation would end up feeling alone once more and likely off themselves too.

I like to posit that I am a fluke, a result of the infamous 'behavioural sink', . Maybe I'm bipolar? I've been on antidepressants and they really have not done much... I've tried ADHD meds, and though they seem to help just a bit, I know they aren't good for me in the long term. Most of these mental health 'fixes' are band-aid fixes to alleviate symptoms but not find the cause of the problem... I know something can be done, I just don't know where to start. With no experience, degree, friends or money, I'm in a hole of my own making and I'm not getting any younger.

If anyone here has some thoughtful advice, I would love to read it, especially if it is not a canned generic response and you managed to read the whole post!

36,"It's hard to know where to start, so I'll just start somewhere. I feel like everyone around me is depressed/has mental health issues. Life just seems to be too hard for everyone. All my friends are in there early 20s, and the pressures of life seem to get to them. My best friend talks about how he does not want to get out of bed, my roommate can't sleep at night, my girlfriend has been going to therapy secretly and just sleeps most of the day. A lot of my friends make suicide ""jokes"" and depression ""jokes"", many of them going to therapy. 

I am typically a pretty upbeat person and I feel like I am a positive influence on their lives, trying to keep them having fun and trying to be there. I feel like its to no avail sometimes, but hopefully it is making some difference. 

However, I have been feeling very depressed for the last year. I don't have an interest in things like I use to, focusing on anything is a challenge and my eating habits are all over the place. I don't say anything though because I feel like all the people around me have their own problems and I just don't want to pile on. I relate to them all because I feel the same way, but I can't let them know because I get worried that if they see someone so positive and happy actually be a sad mess on the inside, that there is no hope.

I find hope in that I believe someday they can all find a way to be better, but that fades a little each day. Maybe I am holding myself in to high regards or being self righteous, but I want to say what I am thinking. I think being positive towards others and listening helps a little, but I just don't have that for me. 

Any of you relate? Why is this world filled with pain? Feels like a lot of people, especially young, feel that life just isn't worth it anymore.

It would literally take me about half an hour to write up a pretty basic cover letter but there is some huge ass mental wall that is preventing me from doing it? It's like I am interpreting it as the hardest task in my life.  I constantly pull out my cover letter word document, stare at it for 30 seconds, then just leave it till I turn the computer off.  Is it sad that I actually tried Modafinil (a nootropic smart drug) back say 8 months ago, to actually try and write this cover letter? 8 months later, still haven't wrote it.   


My only guess is that my situation plays into part. I live in a regional city of about 50 thousand, not a major city, unemployment rate one of the highest in the state. You vs 500 other people applying for jobs here. I've just lost hope which adds to my depression and depletes my drive to move forward in life. Mentally it has taken its toll on me, when you are stuck in a massive depressive unemployed cycle for 1.5 years and feel like you can't get out of it. Also anxiety as well, being socially isolated has messed me up in some sense to the point I've probably developed symptoms of social anxiety over the past 4 years.

38,"Has anyone else had experience with this?

Recently broke up from a two year relationship. Very intense, emotional, supportive relationship that I didn’t realise how much I was dependent on for stability. We didn’t break up acrimoniously it was more for practical reasons about career/life at this time in our lives.

Since breaking up a month ago I’ve been feeling anxiety I didn’t even know I could experience. My stomach is curled in on itself constantly, I can hardly sleep or eat much, my thoughts race at a thousand miles an hour all day about the same thing, trying to convince me I made the wrong decision. The worse the feeling gets, the more I think that there’s no use being alone and taking the right career option if I’m going to feel like this, I can’t function. It’s triggered OCD that I didn’t know I even had, having constant disturbing intrusive thoughts that are driving me insane. I feel like the part of my brain that wanted safety and comfort and love has just gone haywire and it’s self destructing. I feel no motivation to do literally anything except sit and think about this or panic or cry. I feel like my entire sense of self has been demolished, so much of it was tied up with my former partner who helped me escape some pretty bad times over the previous two years. 

I don’t know what to do. Is this my mind and body telling me I made the wrong choice? I can’t live like this for months and months. I’ll go mad with regret. But the rational part of me thinks that if I’m this dependent then it’s all the more reason to build strength again by myself.

I know they won’t say that but I’m scared they will. I’m scared to talk to my mom about stuff because she will just blame everything on my boyfriend when the fault was really her. I want a mom to talk to but she was part of the childhood trauma. I want a family.

40,"The following thoughts have been building up for years and now I'm tired of it.

I'm 25 and still living with my parents. I want to get a job so I can live on my own, but I still have to finish college, which feels near impossible since I've been failing courses over and over again. Meanwhile my student debt has become pretty high, so I feel like I'm way too late to switch degrees (and I'm getting tired of studying and failing). Also a part-time job is not an option while I'm in college. I'm decent at art but that's basically my only skill...

That in itself isn't a hopeless situation, but now comes the real problem: me. Normal people might be able to at least enjoy their lives in the meantime by socializing with others, going out, spending time on their hobbies, etc. Meanwhile I'm struggling to enjoy most things, even my favorite hobbies, and I'm becoming a social shut-in outside of a few exceptions. I'm even having problems getting back into gaming or watch a full episode of a series. Most of this is not because I grew out of it. I also used to have some bad social anxiety, but things got a lot better until it almost disappeared, until recently it returned partly. Now I don't even have the motivation or confidence to meet up and talk 1 on 1 to some of my friends.

I don't exactly know how to describe it, but there are certain things that other people seem to learn or do naturally as they grow up, such as going on vacations without their parents, organizing stuff, being assertive, taking initiative in keeping in contact with friends, dating, looking for jobs, fixing technical problems, volunteering, etc. All kinds of things that I somehow seem to suck at or feel anxious about.

I'm looking for a way to find the confidence and belief that I can change myself and improve, because currently I just feel stuck with not much hope for the future. Just telling myself ""you can do it"" doesn't change anything. I need legit reasons to believe that **I** can (learn to) do the things I mentioned, because people always treat me as if can just as easily do the same things as them, as if I'm like them.

I don’t feel suicidal or anything, I just feel emotionless, and it gets so frustrating until it makes me actually cry. I now wake up with no energy or motivation to go to work, but I just go and deal with it. I feel sort of distant from myself and I also have this weird effect where sunlight is way too bright and hard on my eyes. I also feel... “distant” from myself. Like, it’s not exactly depersonalization, but I just don’t feel all there. Like, I hear my music, but I’m not connecting to it. It’s not making me happy and hyped like it used to. I tried playing my PS4 yesterday, buy I just couldn’t get into it. Like I couldn’t focus on it. I also wane up with a weird, sharp headache in the mornings.

46,"...And I don't know where to start to fixing them.

To start, I think I have unresolved childhood traumas. I grew up in a rather unique situation with limited contact outside of immediate family. And then my parents had a lot of conflicts themselves. I grew up thinking everything was within the realms of normal (like, it's bad, but other people have much worse). That was until I started public school and I acted different from everyone, and then they started bullying me about how things were at home.

In high school, things were mostly okay, except for drama surrounding me trying to learn how to drive, getting a job, etc. None of which I did until I got to college. I joined marching band, but I was introduced to music late and no one taught me much so I held my instrument most of the time and got yelled at for being dumb, ignorant, pathetic, etc. but I keep going.

I think I had mini-panic attacks all during my life, but they weren't noticeably bad until I got to college.

I also had undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia up until my junior year of college. I was smart, but I would make a lot of dumb mistakes, procrastinate, and forget/misinterpret things all the time. I would also fixate on the worst future thing possible, and it would depress me. 

I had to switch majors because I was afraid I was going to fail out of my scholarship. I made stupid relationship (friends and boyfriend) choices my freshman year. I'd also been very sexually interested/promiscuous my entire life, which interfered with my school. I'm in a LTR with my current boyfriend. He used to get mad at me over a lot of things I did. One of the worst was when we were at a cookout, and I accidentally dropped a chicken wing on his expensive white shoes. He yelled at me for 45 minutes as he drove me to work.

I continued with marching band in college, but I was still significantly behind my peers, which fed until my insecurities. I generally had panic attacks during practice, but the anxiety of people wondering if I was okay made me keep it as internal as possible.

My senior year was one of the worst and best years of my life. I was doing so much stuff that would do nothing for me later on in life. I stayed in marching band, worked two part time jobs, was president of my sorority, and had to graduate! I should have graduated a year early, but I didn't know what I wanted to do in life. 

I became a heavy drinker. There were a few times I went to my morning classes visibly drunk. I failed those classes, obviously. I was too ashamed and embarrassed to talk to my professors for help. I felt like a major disappointment.

I attempted suicide twice during college. Once during my first semester and once during my last. I always lie to my doctors about feeling suicidal thoughts, because they happen at least monthly. I feel depressed roughly a week each month. Sometimes more, generally not less. 

I frequently have obtrusive thoughts. If I'm in a sexual moment, my dad flashes in my mind. When I would walk across the stress, I'd imagine me getting hit by cars. Holding a knife? I'm stabbing someone. Cleaning something moldy and filthy? I'm licking the toilet bowl and scarfing down mold soup. When I first started driving this year, anytime I would drive through a heavily populated area, I'd hear the screams of people I was mowing down. I still sometimes hear those screams. I hear people calling my name, knocking on doors, etc. when no one is near. I'm paranoid that people can see into my room when the blinds are open. I can't have a magazine in the bathroom because I'm afraid they're looking at me.

When I was a kid, I was paranoid that everyone could read minds but me. Even now, I catch myself adjusting my thoughts so others won't hear them. I think my boyfriend has been pretending to love me for the past 4 years, but he's actually staying with me because I'm attractive. I'm paranoid that he says things so I doubt my self-worth as anything more than a sex-toy girlfriend. 

These are just my biggest concerns. There's other things that worry me like my binge eating, insomnia, etc. 

My initial psychology appointment isn't until the end of September.

The overwhelming sense of dread,
the restless voices in your head,
how nobody thought you meant what you said
when you told them you wish you were fucking dead

The side effects from every med,
the useless self-help books you've read,
a dollar for every time someone's said
“just think of all the good times ahead!”

The entire weekend spent in bed,
the text messages left unread,
wondering why your friends have fled
as you drown your sorrows in garlic bread

The panic attacks and tears you've shed,
the comfort in being isolated,
the bathroom sink stained deep red
from slicing your wrists til they bled

just hanging on by a thread.

How loud must I scream before this gets through your head?
This is serious stuff and word needs to be spread!

I'm a creative person, and I often love to create and utilize new or cool ideas, both in art and in other areas, like rpgs. However, I also have a complex where I get too attached to said ideas, and as such when I run into a situation where my creativity is blocked I either try and sidestep the issue or convince people to see it my way. All well and good, except with low self-esteem I get desperate for validation and take things very personally if said ideas get rejected, especially if I feel they've just been rejected without any consideration (which, I admit, is likely less often than my brain wants to think).

The overwhelming sense of dread,   
the restless voices in your head,  
how nobody thought you meant what you said  
when you told them you wish you were fucking dead  
The side effects from every med,  
the useless self-help books you've read,   
dollar for every time someone's said   
“just think of all the good times ahead!”   
The entire weekend spent in bed,   
the text messages left unread,   
wondering why your friends have fled   
as you drown your sorrows in garlic bread.   
The panic attacks and tears you've shed,   
the comfort in being isolated,   
the bathroom sink stained deep red   
from slicing your wrists til they bled   
 just hanging on by a thread.   
How loud must I scream before this gets through your head?   
This is serious stuff and word needs to be spread!   
Fuck your dinner plans or what the weatherman said,   
can we just talk about mental illness instead? ",05Aug2018,1
56,"I am near Minneapolis, MN and have been struggling with mental health for a while. I can’t really put a name to what’s going on. I often feel depressed, stuck in a rut, unable to do anything with my life. I get angry over small things. I just don’t really feel like myself and haven’t since I was a kid. I can’t work out my thoughts enough to understand what’s wrong.

58,"I grew up an only child with a single mother. My father died when I was an infant so I never knew him. We lived abroad from my mother her home country and when I was 4 we moved back there. My father his family wanted nothing to do with my mother and me. We moved in a big house close to my grandparents. I never liked the place. 

My grandfather was a good man but drank too much. My whole family did/does to be honest. When I was 10 I had to drag him from my mother when he was choking her. He got his act back together and everything calmed down. The guy was like a father to me. When I was 15 he was diagnosed with cancer. When I was 16 he died. Not a pleasant sight to see. I was still in highschool back then and started to rebel. Drink a lot and skip school. I lost 3 years in school this way but in the end I got in to a school that knew how to deal with me and I turned in to a great student. After my studies, tourism, I wanted to go to university and study history. My mother would not allow it, using the excuse I allready lost 3 years and she would not pay for it. Working to pay it was not an option because it is very expensive. She found a local college where I could study to become a teacher. I always suspected it just to be so I was not far away.

When I was 19 she started to have back aches, couldnt drive with the car anymore etc. I combined college with taking care of her and doing all housework, groceries,.. . She had been sick 3 years before her diagnosis but just didnt tell anyone because she was afraid of what would happen. The story she did happily tell everyone is that she didnt tell because I would have dropped out of school because of it. 

I dropped out of college after 2 years because I could not combine it anymore and I wanted to go study social studies. She refused and I could not combine a job, college and her. She was a very harsh person during her health issues. Kicked out her nurses, cleaning persons, ... . Told me I did nothing for her while I stopped my whole life for her. 

When I was 25 in the fall of that year I got a cold. A week later she started coughing and offcourse blaming me for making her sick. On thursday she could still walk by herself, on friday I had to help her out of bed, saturday I had to carry her to the toilet and on sunday I had to hold a bowl under her to go. We had an appointment on monday for the hospital so she refused all help. On monday we went in with an ambulance and they kept her because there was something very off. 

Her cancer had spread everywhere and her coughing was pneumonia. After a couple of days not getting better I was called to the doctor. They told me that there was nothing to be done and I had to make a choice to put her in a coma or just wait for nature to do its work. If she was in a coma it would happen in a couple of days so they asked me if I wanted to euthanise her or not. My family didnt want to choose so I had . I chose yes. She died a couple of days later.

I moved back in to my old house and met a girl soon after. Moved in with her quickly but still owned my house. It was a very abusive relationship because of her trust issues. I never hurt her and always tried to do my best but after 2 years I told her to leave me alone. 

In this meantime I again started to have issues with anxiety. I had this before when I was 18 and found out I had brothers/sisters that my father never told my mother about ( no contact with them, they dont want anything to do with me). I moved in with my grandmother because I was not able to live alone anymore. My house slowly started to be unmaintained. Bills started piling up, cellar is flooded, garden is shit, .. .

I hardly can go to the story with my anxiety and panic attacks and now I have one more month to fix my house, bills, etc .  
No idea how I will do this, I feel horrible.

She did not respect it at all, kept texting me every single day, even tried a fake apology for being a bad mom, but she proved that it was fake 2 days ago. She showed up at my daughters daycare while I was picking her up. No consideration whatsoever for anyone else, parked her car right in the middle of the driving area so no one could get through and she trapped me so I couldn't get to my car without avoiding her. She kept saying I have no right to be mad at her, I have no right to keep my kid away from her, that I need to stop with my BS and talk to her. Then she followed me home demanding I talk to her. She used my daughter for her stupid games, telling her ""YOU make sure mama brings you over and calls me"". Proved to me her apology was fake by completely denying everything she apologized for. I've been seeing a therapist, and after talking about my mom she said no contact is the best thing for me, but how am I supposed to go no contact when she does crazy things like showing up at daycare and trapping me?

67,"So I've been going through flurries of ups and downs and when I am down, I have noticed that my parents constantly underestimating me has taken its toll and it is getting to me. 

Some examples are...

&gt; I have been debating to go to uni on/off for the last two years but I am told it will be too much for me and I won't be able to manage it. My friends have one year left to go and I can't help but think that could have been me too.

&gt; I was looking into travelling (with an organised group) but if anything they just joke about how extravagant I am being (bearing in mind half the people I know have gone travelling and everyone recommends doing it). I feel like I am missing out on all these prime experiences.

&gt; I am moving out soon (which my parents have greatly helped me with the process), but they mention every day that I won't be able to ""manage it"". This only makes me more eager, to prove them wrong, but the fact they say I won't be able to cook for myself every day or keep the place clean makes me feel like I am incapable of the basic tasks.

&gt; I made a comment about me wanting a pet when I move out and that caused basically an argument because guess what, they don't think I can manage it and I am not ready for one yet.

I understand they know me the best and I want their advice, but I am constantly being shut down and honestly, it is getting to my self-confidence now. When you're told something over and over again, you start to believe it. It worries me that I am no good at things and my aspirations are unrealistic :(

They are happy with the simple life and are satisfied if I work in an office or retail or a restaurant, but I want more than that and I don't feel they believe in me. They talk about their friend's kids going off and doing this and that, but when it comes to me mentioning it, all of a sudden it feels not possible.

They want the best for me, but I guess a lot of these things involve taking risks which they don't feel confident in.

How do you cope with this? Trust me I've tried speaking to them and it doesn't work.

Can anybody relate? Advice on the matter?

68,"Hi, I'm undiagnosed but I think I may have ADD or Anxiety. Simply put, one symptom that I have the most trouble with is these random bouts of feeling completely overwhelmed, mainly by noise and touch sensations. Anything at all sounds way louder than normal. It feels like there's a pressure on my head and every little noise is squeezing my brain. As for touch I just feel everything. While normally your body ignores your clothes or the feeling of blankets over you, in these moods I feel this constant overwhelming stimulation sometimes to the point of tears.

69,"19/F/USA here. Last semester I failed out of engineering school due to depression/stupidity. Everyone is telling me to go to tech school, but I hate the idea and it feels like people are telling me I’m just too stupid for engineering school (which I probably am). Plus a lot of people from my high school went there and I’m trying to avoid them. I don’t have my own place or a steady job but I’ll be forced to soon. My boyfriend is still going to college at the school I failed out of. He’s perfect in every way and he’s the only thing that keeps me fucking going.

70,"I'm on a vacation that many people would love to experience, but I'm stuck in a hotel bed and considering my options. Backstory?: My spouse's parents are long divorced and remarried. We are visiting his dad's family in a tropical area. I have been here for over a week, dealing with his family. We have two young children, we've had to manage them this entire trip. We've had our own rental house for most of the trip, but we have had to be at his dad's house for every dinner and many other times. It's not at all child-proofed, their dogs bit my daughter on the second day, and even though I'm a stay at home parent I've been at my wit's end. They have not offered to babysit, have not helped with the kids, have not played with them, etc. Yesterday we checked into a resort hotel with my inlaws, which they arranged by using a connection they know who works here. We got to our room and it's dirty, the shower doesn't work right, there are dirty linens on the pull out couch bed, it's one of the worst hotel rooms I've had, and yet, we can't complain because we're paying a discounted rate? I kind of lost it because nothing I can do possibly pleases these people, they're backstabby, constantly critical, toxic, and I've had it with trying to bend over backwards to maintain this relationship. I'm at the point where I'm considering buying a solo ticket back home and leaving tonight, leaving my kids and spouse here, even if that means we separate/divorce. I had been looking so forward to doing a couple of touristy things, but because they will not babysit (even my brothers-in-law), there's no chance for us to go. I could maybe go by myself but that doesn't appeal to me at all. I'm so lost. I feel like going down to the pool and trying to have fun with my kids is pointless. I haven't gotten out of bed all day, I've just been googling flights and planning my escape.

80,"i'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but i need to talk to someone and i feel like i rely on the people in my life far too much. i don't want to keep doing that. 

to preface this, i have no diagnoses. i'm getting tested for adhd soon, but that's not what i'm here to talk about, although i have no doubt my 'allergy to boredom' may well have something to do with that. i don't even know if i really have depression, all i know is i feel awful most of the time

so basically, i've always been prone to getting very frustrated and sad when i'm bored, or alone. i'm not a particularly reckless person, my life is pretty unexciting, so that's natural. but it's gotten so much worse, to the point where i'm feeling painfully fucking empty most of the time

the weird thing is, it's not like most people's experience of depression, which always seems to involve a lack of emotional reactivity. that is, for most people who have mdd, positive experiences have little effect on their mood. i just know that my experience is unlike that of some of my friends, who are just as capable of feeling awful at a party as they are at home by themselves. and i hate to see them suddenly get hit with the ""oh fuck, i'm sad"" when i know that they feel like they /should/ be having fun... but i can't relate to that

i'm different in that, in social situations i have so much fun. i feel great. i love spending time with friends, getting to know people, talking to people, trying to connect with people. and i'm a happy drunk, so if it's a party or a night out with drink involved i'm fucking ecstatic. i just turned 18 a month ago (UK, so, can legally go out and drink. yay) and i think i've quickly earned the reputation among my group of friends and acquaintances as being one of those people who's never going to say no to plans. and i think people appreciate that about me, which makes me feel good, because as much as i have a fair bit of social anxiety i'm evidently a massive extrovert. i love people

the problem is, i never want it to end. i'm always the last one still awake, the last to want to go home, the one wanting to make plans immediately again the next day when everyone else just wants to sleep. and i think it's definitely getting to the point where people are starting to see past my 'chill' and fun-loving persona and realise i'm actually just really really needy. and i think it probably gets tiresome, especially when i get drunk i often want to get into 'deep' conversations which is often just me telling people how sad i secretly am.

so put it this way. my parents are gone for a few days so i had a small house party last night with a few friends. most of them stayed the night. we got very drunk, had fun, had some serious conversation, which i feel verged onto me oversharing at points but i have a much higher tolerance for alcohol than most of my friends so i don't know if they actually remember enough to be bummed out by what i said lol

anyway, it gets to 5am. i'm still wide awake, because why would i want to sleep when i'm in my element? but everyone else is getting tired and going to bed. and the dread kicks in, because suddenly in a house full of people i am all alone. and it's the realisation that i'm going to be all alone until my parents come home on tuesday. and even then, i won't be alone, but i'll be bored out of my fucking mind. so i drink some more, and i try searching for codeine in the house (my dad used to get it on prescription, but never really took it) but didn't find any. end up chainsmoking and whatnot, just feeling awful until i finally get tired enough to sleep.

now today, after everyone went home i managed to occupy myself for a couple of hours watching shitty tv. storage wars and whatnot. this is a feat in itself because i can rarely last 2 hours watching anything before i get bored. but eventually, when i did get bored, and was no longer occupied i just... burst into tears. was crying for ages. took a very long sleep. now all evening i've been intermittently crying again, and i'm just in a very dark place. i don't have serious suicidal ideation, but i'll start thinking i wish i was dead or wishing i could cause myself some physical pain that might get rid of the emotional pain

it's crazy. i can go from so happy to so sad just like that. and it's not so much that i'm /that/ needy that i need other people, but it's more that... other people are the only thing that interests me. and being bored makes me violently depressed. people always say one of the best ways to deal with depression is to find a hobby, but i've tried that. i get bored of everything so quickly, and just start thinking what's the point. and it feels like there's some kind of... blockage in my mind. like, i know that i am capable of feeling good - of feeling fucking awesome. it's just that most things in life don't make me feel anything. it's like i'm missing something that makes me capable of enjoying life. people talk about appreciating the 'simple things' but for me it's like... unless i have everything going on it might as well be nothing at all

i don't know if any of that makes sense. but i'm just tired of feeling so empty when i'm not drunk or sufficiently distracted. because i know that i can't rely on other people for my joy all the time, and i know that i definitely can't rely on drink. i knew that the second i turned 18 drinking would be a problem. i don't have any physical dependency on alcohol, but a psychological one. and i really am terrified of addiction....but it's one of the only things that makes me feel good

and i'm doubting if this is even depression i'm experiencing. i'm definitely emotionally reactive, i've got fairly good self-esteem all things considered. i mean shit, i've been accused of narcissism in the past. i don't feel like i'm worthless or a failure, in fact i feel like i'm destined for greatness - so my view of the future isn't that bleak. maybe when i think really hard or really seriously, but i live in fantasy most of the time. although i am a massive perfectionist, so when i do fall short of my own high standards i react pretty violently. but i tend to direct the blame to outside forces rather than myself. i know that's bad in itself. but anyway, it's pretty evident i'm missing out on a lot of the very distinctive characteristics of depression

so why do i want to die most of the time? why do i feel so empty? why is alcohol and other people the only way i can feel good?

i just don't know how to cope with it anymore. i'm definitely at a point where i need to be better, and healthier. because my mental health is taking a nosedive, and if i carry on the way i am i know it's only going to get worse

**tl;dr** can't cope with boredom and loneliness. dependent on drink and other people. not interested in many things; don't find pleasure or enjoyment in much else. scared of people growing tired of me, and scared of getting addicted to drinking. but want the pain to stop",05Aug2018,3

My whole question wells up from a conversation we had a few days ago. She told me that due to she being so anxious so often, she has panic attacks. With my minimum knowledge of mental health I assumed that it was originated somewhere, something worried her so much that it resulted in that. She says that it happens for no reason like once a week, but I don't want to do further inquiry in order to not look rude and that I don't care.

Why those things happen? How can I help her? The topic of her anxiety usually comes up, how can I make people understand that She isn't seeking attention?

I've been struggeling with depression, anxiety and now recent years, increasingly suicidal. I'm currently in a ok phase compared to earlier, but the thing that now breaks me down is money.

I can't function with a job, I'm in bed for much of the day, luckily I do still live with my parents, but for me thats a huge challenge mentally as we dont get a long. Now, I need to move out, although I probably cant with my anxiety, I need to make more money than what my healhcare offers (which is barely enough for rent), so if you were me, what could you possibly do?

To me everything is money, the freedom, the power, the maximum stressfree life possible, unlike now, basically waiting for death one day at a time. At this point I'm seriously desperate enough to ask billionaires for money, I cant swim in debts for ever. 

Any advice from anyone, older ones especially, would be greatly appreciated. I fear tomorrow.
