0,"I have GAD/SAD/Depression.  I've had a pretty good handle on most since I moved away.  

Man, the past couple weeks tho.  Ever have where your thoughts are just going crazy. One minute they are this, then keep switching to others, which causes more panic, and just goes down hill by the hour.  

Only happens when home tho, but like tonight, for example, I'm going from moving away again, yet no way to, jobs, people I haven't seen in years, the fact I have no social group, back to people, what's living in tokyo like, how about africa, let's go ride around town, maybe I should eat... Like its something so random every minute and it's causing my chest to tighten, sweat.  I don't think it's a panic attack.  I haven't had one of them in like a year.  

Also my motivation and energy are beyond gone.  I get home from work.  And sit in my room.  No tv.  No sounds.  Just sit on my phone.  

Just gotta stop thinking. ",16Jul2018,2
1,"I started taking 25 mg sertraline about a month ago and after the horrible side effects passed after about 2 weeks, I felt amazing. I felt no depression and had lots of energy. But since my anxiety was still high my psychiatrist decided to increase me to 50 mg and same thing happened again where i had side effects for 2 weeks, then they went away. This time I felt an amazing improvement. I had very little anxiety, no headaches, my IBS magically went away and I felt amazing for about 4-5 days and thought I had found my correct drug/dosage. But they past two days, suddenly out of nowhere, my IBS started bad again and my anxiety spiked up also. I have no other sideeffects but my anxiety is so high, its almost unbearable. Does this get better and should I just wait. Its been a month since I started sertraline and I am on my second week of 50 mg. ",16Jul2018,2

3,"I went on it because i was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety, and after a therapy process of 2 years in addition to the Lexapro i felt it was time to move on, and so did my psychiatrist and therapist. 

I tapered off by taking 1/2 a pill one day and a complete one the other for one month, then 1/2 every day for a month, then one day 1/2 one day nothing also for a month, and now ive completely stopped. (Its been a little More than a week completely off of it)

The withdrawal started at the last stages of tapering and its been like the seven circles of hell. 

At first the suicidal thoughts came back, and it was scary but nothing really life threatening, and now they've stopped. Then tiredness then sleeplessness, sadness and all that jazz, but it seems im over that too. 

Now im having serious memory loss, specifically short-term memory, i feel like im impaired. Information goes in and out of me but nothing sticks, i have a hard time remembering what i ate yesterday or what i read five minutes ago. Also i've been in the worst mood ever, super bitchy with my loved ones, super extra sensitive, and unable to handle stress, oh and also slight dizziness. 

I read that memory loss its a permanent side effect with the use of Escitalopram (+ others) and that seriously scares me.

4,"so i always felt like killing myself, what was holding me was my mom. i wouldnt want to kill myself without telling her i would do so and then this would come as a bad surprise. today i told her i would probably kill myself within the next year or months to come. obviously she cried and said i need help as she always did. anyways, i feel better now that it's off my chest and i feel ready to go. wish me good luck.",16Jul2018,1
5,"Every few days, I convince myself I'm mentally competent enough to live unmedicated, and I just stop taking them for a few days to weeks at a time. Obviously that's not a sane thought, and I soon question why I'm doing what I'm doing as the ""withdrawals"" become more noticeable (floaty thoughts, extreme drowsiness, increased rapid cycling rage and depressive mood episodes, impending feeling of doom, paranoia, SI, all that jazz). However, even though the thick brain fog and worsening moods, I tell myself that I'm ""in too deep"" and that ""you made this decision, and you're gonna stick to it"" so I can somehow prove to myself that I was right all along. It gets to the point where I have to hide my own pill bottles from myself because seeing them on my dresser or in the medicine cabinet sends me into a several hour long rage and sob. 

I don't even understand the thought process at all. It's really frustrating. I keep shooting myself in the damn foot by fooling myself into thinking everything will be fine without my medicine. Eventually, I do realize what I'm doing is harmful and that I should take the medications again, but then I start lying to myself shortly after, and the cycle repeats. This has been my life for the past four years. I am so drained. Just kinda wanted to minirant and see if anyone else experiences/has experienced this? And if you have, is there anything you've found helpful to encourage you to take your medications more consistently in that headspace? ",16Jul2018,1

8,"Trigger warning: Abuse/Neglect 

I’m Kevin; 15, I come from a really abusive and neglectful past. My dad was big in the high quantity drug trade and my mom was a major user and had severe mental health problems. 

My parents met at AA and decided it would have a brilliant idea to have a baby. 

The way I was abused and neglected produced behaviors in which I avoided all attention in my early and mid childhood. (Reactive attachment disorder). Now that I’m in my teens, I crave ANY type of positive attention, any type of affection, anything. I just want to be cared about and valued. 

I sadly exist now, and they’ve decided that they can treat me however they want, and expose me to whatever. I resent them, I feel I’m pretty justified. Over 15 years and a custody battle and a switch in guardianship, what’s been created is something horrible. 

A spineless being that put up boundaries, that will do anything for any type of positive attention, that puts others first not out of kindness but out of fear and survival instinct, and that is literally pathetic. 

I can’t even really form connections with males, and I don’t feel like I have common ground with many females but I feel safer talking to them. 

If there was a suicide method that was 100% effective and 100% instant, I would follow through. I’m scared of suffering, and even though I’m an atheist, sometimes I’m afraid of being wrong about religion and death. 

I really just don’t know anymore. ",16Jul2018,1
9,"This is going to be a little long, but please read. I am suffering.

To give you guys a little background,

I'm a 20 year old male. I suffer with social anxiety disorder and I pretty much had it my whole life. However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I've never really recovered since.

When I was young, I used to always be a teacher's pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this.
In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, ""Devin hurry up!"". (Looking back on it he didn't even say it in an angry way and I'm mad at myself for letting that get to me.)

Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn't like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn't like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn't call on me! All I wanted was his approval.

I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher's favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year.
Because of this incident, I'm now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I'm with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I'm very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It's hard for me to relax in public!

It's like I want approval from everyone! If I don't get it I get upset and feel like there's something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I'm so upset because I feel like if it wasn't for that situation, my anxiety wouldn't be so bad now and I wouldn't have all these issues.

Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn't make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I'm going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety.

I'm mad at myself that I let a petty incident like this ruin my life!
I'm sorry for this rant. I just feel like I will never be able to enjoy life to the fullest again.

Any advice for me would be appreciated.",16Jul2018,1

13,"Okay, I have suspected that I am not normal for a long time. Well, its pretty obvious at this point that I'm not. I don't form bonds with people and if I do, it takes years. Not a lot of emotion if any at all aside from anger. I do laugh at certain things but actually having a good laugh is very rare. I don't have empathy. I'm not sexually active at all. I work as a prison guard. I used to do drugs but recently quit. My hobbies include video games, reading, and working out. 

As a kid, I think I was normal. As I got older, I changed a lot. Like I said, I don't have a lot of empathy and my emotions are almost completely absent. An example of this would be not feeling anything when my grandmother died. I remember right before the end she was rolling around in her bed in her own piss crying and babbling about nothing because of her dementia and she kept wanting to hold my hand and wanting me to reassure her that she would be okay and that people still loved her. I felt absolutely nothing. She loved me very much and I think I remember loving her as a kid. This has happened with other family members as well where I don't feel for them when they die. I have to pretend to be sad at funerals. Its not like they were abusive and treated me poorly. I just didn't care. In fact, when my grandmother died, I was relieved because that meant I could call in sick from work the next day. 

I generally find people annoying and avoid having to talk to them unless I get trapped. I can generate pretend interest in what they're saying but I think they eventually clue in that I don't care. When I'm at work, and there is an critical incident, I don't feel any anxiety because of it, though I do feel normal anxiety about other things in my life such as disease. I don't ever do the right thing for the right reasons. In fact, I can't remember a moment in my life where I ever did the right thing for the right reasons. The only reason I do anything for anyone is because of the social stigma of not doing that thing. I am completely selfish but make a lot of effort to seem otherwise and will go out of my way to help people if I know others will see. 

In terms of people I do care about, I care about my parents and my siblings. There hasn't ever really been anyone else in recent years that I have a bond with including my best friends. If they found out, that would be awkward but I can't help it. Also, generally my affect is pretty flat, but I can laugh and joke to ease the tension if I know I need to. 

I want to know if I have a personality disorder or if this is a case of extreme depression or maybe autism or something. I don't feel like getting an official diagnosis if its something more severe. I'm a 29 year old male btw. ",16Jul2018,11

15,"I don't know what's going on in my head right now.  Listening to up-lifting utopian love soaked hope filled power metal makes this easier for me.  Anyway...I've noticed I've been acting like my dad lately.  I never did this in the past.  I also feel my sense of identity fading.  I find myself adopting the more annoying traits of my father.  I don't want to go into the details. He has a fragile ego and tries hard to look good.  I think he is actually a good person, but I've seen his ""reactive narcissism"" appear when he's threatened.  Blah blah blah... don't know why I'm telling you this. It's really weird though, like I'm doing stuff he does, which I've never done in the past and noticed doing it.

I often personnally have trouble imagining that I someday won't dread getting to work, and I get anxious when I realize that I don't know where to begin for the other things I'd like to have in my life (a good circle of friends, being able to play music with people, hanging out with friends at a bonfire, having someone to share life with...) 

I am started meeting with a therapist every 2 weeks, but progress has been slow and I'd like to have some tools to rely on now, to help me get through the really hard times.

17,"I feel like I'm losing control of myself. I had a multi-week nervous breakdown towards the end of last year, tried to re-take control of my life but before I'd completely recovered got roped back into what had broke me.

I'm too flighty and inconsistent to be of much use but I'm trapped working on it still, while half the other bullshit from last year, most of which you wouldn't believe, is still ongoing because fuck me. The work itself isn't even stressful or difficult, it's just the baggage has hit critical mass.

If I listen to my subconscious, I really really want to drop this thing and reboot my life. If I listen to pure logic, I'm throwing away career, opportunity, a lot of money, and a year of my life.

My burnout/anxiety symptoms have only been getting worse, while this thing is dragging me along like a cat on a leash, and I'm dragging myself along like a cat on a leash. It's pure misery, but for no \*logical\* reasons. Just subconscious ones.

20,"Im in a very complex situation so im not going to bother with too many details. Basically ive had some serious trouble with a teacher. This teacher was the first person i rtrusted with some serious issues ive had over the years. I've never really had someone ive felt i could trust completely before this teacher(even my parents).  Stuff happens and basically this teacher and i arent allowed to speak anymore (nothing illegal happened sexual etc, the teacher had just been a little to caring for their own good). Over the past year and half her and I had prolonged eye contact. 

This is where body language comes in. Before i go on i want to say i openly admit theres a reasonable possibilty ive misinterpreted things but as far as im concerned missinterpretation is one thing, mind reading is another.

Flinching on both our parts occured throughout the 'distant relationship' (ill refer to it as that since we barely spoke to eachother but are still legally supposed to have a student teacher relationship as both operate in the same school community. However we both aviod eachother as much as possible.) Specifically eye flinching. Another time and this teacher was walking ahead of me and a friend. She stopped at a door, cocked her head to the side as if to listen to us (we were only ones in the area and we were talking loudly and clearly enough for said teacher to hear) then jogged half way down the hall to her office. Now this teacher knows about some anxiety issuss i have where i would feel sick to my stomach. The day previous to this she walked into my class talking to all this teachers previous students as if they were old friends. At the end of the class i left and you have to go to the office and state why your leaving school. She pops around the corner and hears me say 'i feel sick in the stomach'. Now this teacher knows i've really been struggling with the fact that her and i no longer speak. 

Another type of concerning behaviour for me was that this teacher would be walking along a hall and id be talking to people, she would snap her head round to look directly at me and snap her head back wh3n i made eye contact. A few times ive been in a class and she'll look directly at me as shes walking past, we make prolonged eye contact.

This is only a brief snap shot of an incredibly confusing and complex situation but the point of this post is this: is it wrong of me to assume this teacher cares abuut me more than she should? Is it wrong for me to assume she has been struggling with the loss of our student teacher relationship aswell, based on these 'signals'? Is it mind reading to assume shes also been emotionally distraut based on the fact that she is seemingly unable to speak to me (when the initial break down of the relationship happened all i was told is that i could no longer speak to her about my personal issues, not that we no longer have a student teacher relatilnship)?

21,"Talk to me please. I am really scared of my future. It's not just an abstract fear, I have actual reasons to be scared because of my debts, my diseases and my incompatibility with life. I am too weak to cope with it by my own, but I have no single person to help me. There are many things I am scared of, but 2 of them are the most scary. First is that the microfinancial organization I owe money to will reach me. I won't be able to even explain my mom why I loaned money, and she will get really upset. I have already made her upset with my inability to go to the university and study like everyone else do. Second thing is my psoriasis that covers a big part of my skin. I will eventually become ugly. I can't work to return my debts or to get medical help, my fear rules my mind and makes me unable to work.

Sorry for shitty English, I know I suck and my life is a big mistake. But I can't kill myself because my mom won't survive that. I should be alive until my parents die of old age.

22,"As the question in the title says, what the hell is wrong with me? Let me explain what i mean. I am a complete pessimist, but what made me ask this question are the things i experience: I very often just feel empty, with feeling of void where my heart is. (Not speaking metaphors, i physically feel this way) When i am sad, which happens rarely since few years, i just can't cry. No matter how sad i feel or how sad is the thing that caused me to feel sad, i can't cry. Another thing i experience are moodswings. I have weird moodswings when i compare them to moodswings i see in for example, my friends because i can feel empty one minute, and then out of the blue feel so angry that i want to punch something/someone and then i can be laughing like there's no tomorrow but few minutes/hours later i can feel so empty that i cut myself, which i do from time to time to reassure myself i am still able to feel at least physical pain. So again, what's wrong with me? I will be grateful for any answer. And i apologize if what i wrote is messy, i am not very comfortable with confessing anything, i do it here because if i'd ask someone of my surroundings i'd get mocked for it and i trust basically nobody, even my closest friend doesn't know i feel this way.

Now I know it probably didn't happen overnight just I can't recall it happening, it feels as only a before and after. Not so much about my family interactions, they have always been the same, and they've been decent, but much more about my personal ones, like when I'd be with some friends and I just couldn't feel quite natural while saying or reacting to most of the stuff, same when at work. I kinda drifted appart from a lot of people due to it all but it doesn't make me sad or anything, to some degree it even made me feel better because then I didn't feel so preassured. When talking to new people, it's a bit of the same, I mostly don't know how to react, or how I should be feeling, so I act out half of the time in the way that seems appropiate and reasonable, which also leads to me not desiring to get close to others. And it confuses me, because it was all different, but I don't miss it, because it doesn't feel natural to miss it. But I'd like to try and make sense of this state too.

When there is a small problem it escalates because of my fear of asking for help. I also can never get any sleep because I’m afraid of dying in my sleep, so I get like 2 hours a sleep a day (basically when my body has given up and needs me to sleep against my will). I’m also severely depressed. I have no hope for the future and no longer care about anything. I used to love football and music but now I just use them to pass the time, I’m basically miserable. These two problems have been getting worse and worse over the years. This is added to my terrible addictive personality (to gambling primarily, but also for a short stint to alcohol) and my bad anger issues. I’ve been to anger management twice but I still flip out over small things. Like if I miss the train I’ll act like it’s the end of the world. I also think I might have OCD and ADHD. OCD because I need things to not be touched from where I put them, I need to always rewash my dishes before I use them, I need to do everything in the pattern 1-2-2-1 and if something happens to one half of my body I need to do it to the other half, like the other day I accidentally pruned my pinky on my right side and was in so much pain, but I was physically forced to do it to my other side to have it be even no matter how much it hurt.

The change in my life that drew me to ask for advice was that recently I think I’ve been experiencing a mental breakdown. I have been seeing things that aren’t there, I’ve been apparently yelling things out loud without noticing and the scariest thing is that I’ve found myself talking to people that aren’t there. Like I’m having a conversation with someone next to me on the front of the house, but they aren’t there. I’m not schizophrenic because I don’t imagine them per se, but I talk to them and they sometimes talk back. The other day I was sitting on a bench waiting for the city bus and I had a conversation about this game I have in my phone. We spoke for about 6 minutes (mostly me) and throughout the conversation I would shift between knowing I’m talking to myself and thinking that’s a real person. 

What do I do? In high school I was a state math and debate champion, I did great on my SAT, I got a full scholarship to a good college; now I feel like I should be in a mental hospital. The other day I just broke out in tears and fear out of nowhere and had to crawl under a table in the house to calm down. I think I felt like something was trying to get me or something, because I felt so vulnerable and in need for help. So please, can anyone help.

Any advice ",16Jul2018,11

33,"My therapists and all the other 7 were useless, she's the best so far.

A few days ago my GF of 1 year basically had an emotional affair with my ex-friend and it hurt me like nothing has, I trusted her so freaking much and Loved her so much, It hurts me to see her doing everything she wouldn't do with me with my ex friend, it hurts me that it took her less than a week to be with her and she's dong everything she wouldn't do for me.

I'm going trough a lot and I can do nothing but to just stare at walls and bite myself. I have thrown my baldes away so I can't self harm but I was thinking of buying more. I keep complaining and exhausting my firends, I'm toxic and never let them sa anythhing :( i can't control myself and i""m in so much pain.

I might have a huge risk of cancer too and the results will probably arrive in 15 days and it's killing me. I might never be able to Start my Hormone theraphy and be myself. I feel like an ugly gross dude (I'm transgender) and I spend most of my days wondering what I did wrong or why I deserved this, I mean I did a lot wrong :( I more than deserve this, I never gave her personal space and attached to her like a parasite :(

I just can't do anything Other than to bite myself and have no coping mechanism is there anaything I can do to sooth myself? I can't get myself to watch a movie or play a game, I only recently started listening to music. we're still friends and I keep seeing her posts and stuff and it hurts me so much",16Jul2018,1
34,"Hello, so this happened in the middle of the night and i'm scared that something is wrong with me. I woke up around 12-1 am and i had this weird feeling in my left arm. It's hard to describe it but I remember being extremely annoyed by my left arm. I couldn't lay down because i felt so uncomfortable so i sat up but it didn't help. I grabbed my left arm tightly and I wanting to cut my arm off because the feeling that i had was SO annoying. I couldn't find a comfortable position in bed and i guess i finally fell asleep because i was exhausted. When i woke up this morning i felt fine but now i think i'm going crazy because I seriously felt like i wanted to cut my arm off last night.

37,"I and BF went into a corner shop to get some water, I got two bottles of sparkling water from the fridge. The man at the till said, ""You do know they're sparkling"", I replied, ""Yeah"". He said, ""I'm sorry I'm not being rude, it's just that people often get them mixed up"". So I apologised to him and said not to worry, I knew he wasn't being rude (just stupid).

Later we went to the bus rally at Whitley Bay. I asked one of the bus drivers when the bus to Tynemouth would be setting off, as their website said there was a bus from Tynemouth to their location (which they were running) and I assumed they'd also be returning people back. The woman said she had no idea what I was talking about. Said there's excursions but not to Tynemouth and certainly not as transport and no stopping. She'd never read the website advertising their event. Later BF spoke to someone else and they said it has been cancelled.

The plan was to go to Cafe 19 on the seafront which is apparently the best cafe in Whitley Bay. I felt it would be an improvement to the horrid one I'd been to the day before which served me overcooked, split, scrambled eggs on toast (with soggy toast) and a pot of tea which spilled over the table when you poured it, along with a jug of milk covered in tea-towel lint and dust. This cost £6. It costs about 45p to make far better scrambled eggs on toast and a cup of tea at home.

So we went to this Cafe 19, a group of pensioners walked slowly in front of us in such a way that we couldn't walk around and had to crawl behind them. They then stood at the entrance and stopped still blocking access. Eventually I got sick and just said excuse me. They moved about an inch, enough for us to get past. The place was full, the outside area had no seats, which was fine, so we went indoors. I found one of the servers and asked if they took cards, he said they did but there was a £5 minimum. I said this was fine. He then said, but if you're ordering breakfast we're ending the breakfast now. I said fine. I asked if they had a menu. He said yes but it's last orders you need to do it now if you want any breakfast. I said I didn't want breakfast, I wanted a menu, “Don't you sell anything else other than breakfast?”. “Coffee, tea and cakes”. “Don't you have a lunch menu?”. “No we don't have a lunch menu yet”. I took this to mean they didn't serve lunch. I thanked him and left. I asked BF why it was so difficult to get a simple answer to a simple question. He didn't know, he never does.

When we were standing looking at the buses, a man came along in a high vis jacket and said in a half loud voice right beside me, ""Everyone, can you just...!"", I assumed he meant that he wanted me to move, but I said to myself out loud, ""Proper English would be nice"", then I turned to him and said, ""Can I just what?"", he was lost for words, I assumed he must have been an idiot and walked off to lay down on the grass while my partner looked at old buses. I noticed when looking around that the event seemed mostly aimed at the people who owned the buses and that they'd rather the public weren't there at all. The constantly wanted people to move out of the way.

When I was laying on the grass a man came over and said to another man, ""Do you know if the toilets over there are open today?"", the other man said, ""I think so yes."", then he asked, “well, weren't you here last Sunday?”. The other man said “yes I was, and they were open”. To which the man replied, ""Oh, well, in that case yes, I think they probably will be open then"". None of this meant anything, why didn't the man just say, ""I don't know if they're open, sorry”.

BF came back and told me the bus to Tynemouth definitely wasn't running and that it was cancelled at short notice. But there was a bus station close by and there was a bus to Tynemouth due in 10 minutes. By this point I was already sick of people. But I agreed that we would go, as we were both very hungry and my doctor told me I needed to make an effort to get out and have exercise.

We missed the stop in Tynemouth centre and had to walk back from the bus stop. It was very busy and I wasn't anxious so much as annoyed that people walked and stood in the middle of the path. We got to a cash machine and stood in line. The woman at the front told the man behind her, ""The cash machine is out of £10 notes"", he said yes and then he used the machine, then before he left he turned and said, ""I don't know if you heard, but the machine has no £10 notes, you can only get multiples of £20s"". I and BF thanked him. Then I took out £40 and when I got my money I turned to BF and said, ""I don't know if you heard, but this machine has run out of £10 notes, you can only withdraw multiples of £20s"". Then he took his money out. I said, “are you not going to tell the gentlemen behind you what the woman said to the man, the man said to me, and what I said to you?”. He said the man was just being friendly and that no, he wasn't because the people behind him probably heard what he said. Which was my point, we'd all heard what the woman at the front said, there was no reason for anyone to tell anyone else this inane fact.

After this we went and found a pub, by this point I was almost shaking with rage and disgust at the levels of stupidity I'd encountered already that day. When we walked in we found that all of the downstairs area was made into a restaurant with numbered tables, food menus and a Sunday carvery. I just wanted a drink, so I said to the server, ""Please could you tell me where the bar area is?”. He pointed to the bar in the restaurant then asked if I wanted food. I said, “no, don't you have a real bar, where we can just order drinks, and not food. You know, like, with stools?”. He said, “upstairs”. I thanked him.

We went upstairs and ordered our drinks, BF asked for his drink, the bartender said “yes”, but then turned back and said, “no sorry, we don't have any”. I figured seeing that his job was a bartender it would be reasonable for him to know what drinks he did, and did not have in stock in his bar. BF ordered something else. After we got our drinks the man said, ""Would you like to order any food?"", I said no. Why can people not assume that if I wanted food I would have asked for it? Indeed we'd come upstairs away from the restaurant for this exact reason. We sat down, I drank my pint and asked BF this. He said the bartender was just being friendly. I didn't think so. It felt like the whole place had a kind of ""Would you like fries with that?"", culture. I sat and stewed and wondered if I'd just gotten old. Why was everything so pretentious, lacking quality, value and necessity?

I'd had enough, I longed for a time when I could get a decent cup of tea for 60p in a polystyrene cup, excellent chips for 80p with batter and salt and vinegar and a buttered roll for 20p, and sit on a bench enjoying my meal in the sun. When we sat I looked at the website for the local chip shop on my phone, there was a job advert, ""Exciting career opportunity, Fish Fryer"". Even job adverts had succumbed to the pretentiousness of the place. Working in a chippy is now an exciting career opportunity in 2018. So that you can earn a wage, pay too much money for everything then die.

We left and decided to go to the market because BF wanted a burger. We got there and they had burgers, they were £4.50 each and nothing particularly special about them. It was too busy and the market has been selling the same tat to tourists for the past two years. Rarely is there anything of novelty or quality to be found there, which is why we stopped going on weekends. We occasionally go to car boots but most decent items are sold on ebay and don't make it to the traditional markets any-more.

I wondered if this was the point of work. To work a pointless job, to earn money to overspend on pointless frivolities on my weekends, pay people far more for a product than it's worth for 'the experience' of eating standing up in a crowded market, or sitting down in a pretentious bar. We only wanted to go out and have a nice cheap fry up and a cup of tea, which in the past was never such a difficulty.

Before we went back to the flat we went to Herons and bought bacon, beans and black pudding. We went back and made a breakfast of Scrambled Egg, Toast, Beans, Bacon, Black Pudding with ketchup and a mug of tea. I still can't quite figure out where I've gone wrong. I've made an appointment with a Psychiatrist to see if there's any way for me to go back and blindly go about life in blissful ignorance again. I'm not hopeful of this.",16Jul2018,0

My college years were filled with existential dread, axniety, depression and OCD thoughts. However, I could still feel both positive and negative feelings.

But lately (3-4 weeks ago) I felt as if someone pulled a switch in my brain. I suddenly became uninterested in literally everything. I wake up in the morning and I dread having to live another day. I spend my time eating because I don't feel like doing anything. I suddenly don't like video games anymore, not even my old favorites. No matter what activity I start pursuing, it gets extremely boring after 5 minutes and I always quit. Music sounds PAINFUL to me, I feel like every single sound gets on my nerves and I feel bored and burnt out on my old favorite bands (can't get into new stuff either because nothing sounds good to me anymore). Painting is now frustrating because I feel like I lack the skill required to paint and it's rather annoying than pleasant. Going out feels like a chore, I don't even like going out in nature anymore. I tried to watch movies, series and even cartoons but I get bored in less than 10 minutes. 

You guys, I literally have NO IDEA what I even like anymore. I don't have preferences anymore, I don't like or dislike things. I don't have feelings towards anything and anyone (not even family), everything just EXISTS and I have no feelings associated with anything. I'm not suicidal, I'm not even sad, I'm just numb/neutral to everything and it's driving me crazy.

42,"Hi everyone. Wondering if anyone has experience with finding housing for someone with mental illness. What we have in mind is a service like a halfway house, where people can live 'on their own' but with some limited assistance.

My sister suffers from bipolar/schizophrenia (hard to say because she refuses to see doctors unless she's committed). She's been committed about 8 times over the past 4 years because she was in psychosis, but she tends to bounce back after a few days to a week or two. She's actually ""functional"" about 85-90% of the time, so my mom is hoping she can live on her own. She's really a huge drain on my mom, as she can be emotionally abusive towards family. Unfortunately that's part of her illness. She's very irrational and can't work, and occasionally loses touch with reality, but usually she can do day-to-day things to live on her own like cook, clean etc.

Anyway, she was just awarded disability so we don't know what her benefit is yet, though we're expecting it to be small. She is 31 years old and has lived with my mom for the past 4 years since the onset of her illness.

My mom is hoping to find some sort of program specifically for adults with mental illness, perhaps a halfway house that provides some assistance, but allows people to live mostly on their own. Do you know of any such service? She's currently in Florida, but would possibly relocate.

Thanks for any and all advice.",16Jul2018,1

46,"I'll try to keep this as a brief as possible, which is hard. I really need some advice on this and am willing to reach out to online communities to get life advice here.

I had a ""friend"" (whom I have considered ditching for the past year or so) go off the rails on me over something to do with his ex. Ok, so I knew a guy, a weird guy, from way back in high school. During my high school years I didn't really know him too well. I always saw him as weird but friendly-ish. He was a serious pot-head in high school. I didn't smoke pot at all back then so we never associated too much. He is this big white guy, very rarely saw him but when I did he was very chatty and outgoing, kinda sketchy when he was younger. So, over time, as I got into my 20s I would run into him every now and again. 

As time went on I started noticing a pattern with him though. He would often have great ideas, projects (some farming related, others not) and he would try to get me in on stuff, telling me he would possibly pay me in the future. Almost all the time, I would check in with him a few weeks later and he'd have stopped doing this project and moved on to something else. Anyway, so we chilled on and off for the past 6 years or so. In my post-University years I had little social life and hanging out with him every now and then was nice (especially since I smoke often now). I'd just sometimes run into him and we'll chill. though he was always kind of off. I know from his past that he has struggled with mental health issues (I have too, esp with anxiety and depression in my youth), but I am generally open-minded and non-judgmental about stuff like that. The guy is not dumb by any stretch but not intellectual either, sometimes it's hard to have a serious talk with him about issues, for instance. Sometimes he would do odd things, like I would chill with him and we might have a plan to do something and he'd just ditch be out of nowhere to go chill with someone else or something. He would often have big plans and be involved with a business or claim to be starting one and then tell me he might be able to get me a paying job, but whenever I follow up with him he'd have moved on to something else. Flake in other words.

So, time goes on, we chill. At one point I realize he was the only semi-consistent friend I'd had (outside of work friends). My social life in the past few years since leaving Uni hasn't been that active for a number of reasons. Anyway, let me hurry up with this story. The guy is strange, sometimes he seems on top of the world and in the best mood, other times he is in the worst mood and doesn't even want to talk. He gets jobs, seems to be doing really well, making decent money, and then he always just quits abruptly, usually on one of his emotional downturns. 

So, about a year ago or so he starts dating a young woman, Let's call her Ellis (let's call him Guy). Me and her and him chill a few times and I like Ellis and start seeing her as a friend as well. She is a bit of a hippie, kind weird too but so am I so we all get along. I meet some of her friends, these dudes and I end up getting along with them too. Overtime I start chilling with these dudes, and as more time passes I end up spending more time with them than Guy.

So, one day I run into Ellis in my neighbourhood. I ask her where Guy is and she tells me he just dumped her. We talk for a while and she tells me he was going through some episode and just dumped her, after telling her they were going to move in together, a few days before they are to move-in together he just dumps her and goes back to his parent's house, kind of stranding her. This kind of goes with a pattern I am seeing this Guy. She tells me he goes through weird times and tells me not to mention this to him since me and him are buds. It kind of blows my mind why he dumps her as they seemed so happy, but that's Guy for you. During this time I contemplated dating her but I don't for 3 reasons 1) don't date your buddy's ex 2) rebound bad idea, and 3) I get the vibe that she just sees me as a friend. So I had a short-lived semi-crush on her, but it lasted like a week or two and that's it. Anyway, so time goes on and me and her chill a bunch of times with her dude friends.  I chill with her dude friends a bunch of times, they have parties, go to bars, go for hikes, one of them teaches self-defense. I get a social life. I think it kind of ironic how I was friends with Guy, became friends with his ex, and then through her I make a group of good friends and things are great.

So, Guy and I are still sort of friends. We hang out a few times and smoke, etc. One day he offers me a job doing a write-up for a business he works for. I have a feeling he will flake out but agree to do it anyway. He brags about sleeping with a bunch of girls to me which is like whatever and he tells me him and Ellis are kind of talking things over and 'might' get back together. I actually want them to get back together because I like both of them and hanging out with them is like getting 2 for 1 friends, y'know? One time I hear him yelling at someone on the phone while I am visiting him. He isn't just raising his voice but yelling, swearing, putting the person down really brutally, saying he is going to f\*\*\* another girl. I tell him that him screaming at someone on the phone while I am visiting makes me uncomfortable. I find out he was talking to Ellis just then. I grow more uncomfortable and tell him he shouldn't be talking to his girlfriend that way, he goes into a diatribe about how I never had a serious relationship and talks about how 'all girls are b\*\*\*es. I know he's having a rough time with the break-up so I just say whatever. 

Later on that night we chill with a friend of his, this other guy (call him Ishmael). Ishmael is also a writer. Guy wants Ishmael to write something up for his company as well. During a brief break Ishmael tells me he likes Guy, but finds his behaviour erratic sometimes and thinks he flakes a lot. I am relieves to hear someone else thinks this as well. He tells me, in private, that he sees Guy as a scam artist and tells me he wont write up the thing for him because he doesn't see it going anyway. I ended up writing the thing up, sending it to Guy, and lo and behold, a week later Guy tells me the company was looking for something else.

Ok, so time passes. I end up seeing Ellis one time with her friends. Ellis takes me aside and tells me not to tell Guy where she lives now (she lives with her dude friends) because she is worried that he might show up on her doorstep and harass them. This sends red flags off in my mind. I don't know the context fully regarding their relationship and I am sure there is more to it than I know, but the fact that she's telling me this makes me really start to question Guy. She tells me she doesn't think he would ever hurt her, but if he goes through a bad episode he might show up at her place. She tells me they are working things out but she constantly blocks him for months at a time, but is still in love with him, blah blah blah.

So, time passes. Guy and I drift apart and as summer rolls around I contemplate not associating with him anymore as I start seeing him less positive. Just the fact that his ex made me promise not to tell him where she lives really freaked me out. So, one day I run into Ishmael and we talk for a while. I tell him I don't know if I will chill with Guy anymore, Ishmael says he feels the same. I tell him I became friends with Ellis and her friends and chill with them more than anyone else lately. I mention that part of me wanted them to get back together because I liked both of them, and I mention (naively) that she is cool and I say, very off-handidly, something along the lines of ""hell, even I had a bit of a crush on her, but obviously wouldn't do anything"". 

About two or three weeks pass. 

Guy texts me when I am at work one day asking me to talk to him. I call him and he goes off on me, yelling that he knows I talked to Ishmael and said ""I have a crush on Ellis"" (I remember saying had, not have mind you), then starts yelling at me to stay away from her. I'm taken aback by all this. Then he goes off on me, tells me to explain myself. I try to explain it to him, and tell him that I only thought about it briefly when he dumped her but would never do anything and only saw her as my friend. He then goes on about me saying ""I hang out with her friends"" to Ishmael. So, he goes off on me. I hang up on him, text him not to contact me anymore. He goes nuts, sending me text after text of abuse, telling me I am a loser, Ellis is only nice to me because she feels sorry for me, he trusted me and I am a snake, etc. I then go on my facebook and see he is talking crap about me on facebook, saying I betrayed him (carrying on as if I cheated with her). He then sends abusive e-mails, long blocks of text, bigger than this one, going on about how I betrayed him and he hates me, semi-threatens me, makes vague threats about running into me, warns me to turn the other way if I see him. I tell him I am gonna call the cops if he doesn't stop threatening me.

I get in touch with one of Ellis' dude friends. He says Guy started harassing me as well. I find out he's been harassing pretty much everyone online, including other mutual friends, insulting people. I get in touch with Ellis. She says he's doing the same and tells me to ignore him, not to take it personal, he's not in the right state of mind. She tells me she heard he is abusing over the counter drugs and is going off on everyone. I don't know if he is abusing everyone equally, and I wonder if him finding out what I said caused him to start abusing drugs. Apparently he has substance abuse issues, far more serious than weed. I find out other people have called the police on him. I got mixed feelings about Ellis at this point and I wonder, as time has passed since, why she would ever put up with this. I tell her Guy and I are done permanently, even if Guy ends up apologizing I can't go back to ever being friends with him after this. She says ""fair enough"" but kind of insinuates that she might continue speaking with him later on when he is through this episode.

(who puts up with that?) Time goes by, I don't hear from him. The last thing he told me was ""this is a life lesson, don't go talking sh\*\* about your friend's wife, you lost a friend today"".  Part of me is relieved that I am finally done with him since I was planning to cut him off anyway. I am debating whether to stay friends with Ellis or cut her off too. Some people I've spoken to say to cut her off, some say cut all the dudes off just because if I chill with them (and her) news might get back to Guy and, even if he is in a good place at the time, I have no guarantee that he wont go through a bad time again and go off on me.

57,"Last year I went through about a month of extreme derealization, I don't remember much from that period but I just remember that I felt like my spirit was trapped in my body. Nothing really felt real at least during daytime and the month just slipped by, then I started to kind of wake up briefly every once in a while and then it gradually went away.

So to the present, I think I'm experiencing derealization again but it feels different in a way I can't really explain. I wasn't aware I was like this again until recently, and then when I went on a family trip to an amusement park I decided to experiment. (I'm usually dead scared of rollercoasters; I'd barely ridden a above average one in my life.) I just went ahead and got on the scariest one in the whole park, with 360° spins and all. It was definitely something I wouldn't have ever imagined riding and I would've normally been screaming my head off the whole ride. I barely even felt a thrill. I kept my eyes open the whole time and didn't really feel anything, just thought it was pretty fast. I feel like that can't be normal and that there's something seriously wrong with me, i can't get myself to feel things like I would normally. This is terrifying for me and I just want to know what's going on with my head and why this is happening and how I can get it right.",16Jul2018,1

But I think I'd like somewhere where I could get advice on social anxiety or how to deal with social situations without paying money?

59,"I'm a little hardcore about fairness and have been spending a LARGE amount of my mental energy arguing with people that just straight up don't exsist.  I don't see them or anything and it's kind of like that process of learning... where you pretend you are teaching someone else in order to help yourself understand better.

But it's getting out of hand.  I can't hear a random comment, or see a random post on Reddit, without it turning into a multihour fight (in my head) about what is really fair/reasonable.  

For context: I'm slowly creeping out of a multi-year depression.  Am bipolar and am lonely as all hell. (I only have one friend and I'm terrified of going out to social gatherings anymore). Obviously this has to play a large role in what I've been experiencing the last few months but I'm starting to feel like I'm a step away from a homeless person yelling at nothing on the street.  

Anyone know of ways to cope with this and quiet my mind?  I'm at least aware but getting hard to really snap out of it, even when I realize I'm in the middle of it.

61,"Hi reddit. I was thinking about writing to this community for a while, but somehow it was hard to admit myself that I may have a problem.
2018 was a very hard year for me on a personal plan and I was constantly stressed during the first months. But during the past months I am experiencing a lot of mood swings escalating from feeling energetic to being very sad and lonley. During the last month I have noticed that I am feeling hopeless and for the first time in my life I have even though about suicide. I know that currently I would never be selfish enough to do it, but somehow I think that I couldn't make it up for more than 10 years from now. 
Usually I am, or at least I was a very friendly person, enjoy going out and having fun, understanding the absurdity, but fighting it back, but during the last period I can't stop thinking about how cruel, ugly and horrible everything is. 
I have a lot of negative thoughts going in my head and I am very afraid that I will end up lonley and miserable, without no one in my life because I don't feel like I am capable of loving someone without the constant fear of losing a person.
And please don't say that I should start doing something with myself because I am really trying so hard, and I can't maintain a quality time learning, at least not with the same passion like I was doing it during the previous two years at faculty. Also I am working freelance job and exercising every day in the morning, but instead of feeling better I am feeling worse as the days go by. 
I am afraid to speak about this with my friends because I think that I would be a trainwreck to them. And when it comes to my parents, they would never understand me because they are not even noticing that I am suffering feeling anxious and stressed all the time.
I am so afraid because of this and I can't recognize myself now, because I feel like I am a completely different person from the one I was during the previous summer.
Thanks if you've came this far with reading and even though it may be hard to give me an advice on this one, it is better now after I've actually somehow admitted that I may have a problem.

65,"Hi, my name is Alexandra and im currently in a residential program for mental health. I have depression, OCD (Intrusive thoughts), Social and generalized anxiety, ADHD and SAD. I frequently experience disassociation, it can last a few minutes to a few days. I talk very little, my body is still, its hard for me to walk and think clearly and i often stare directly at an object for a long time. During this i experience something im not really sure how to explain. Lets say for example i just became dissociated, im sitting in my room on my bed and staring at a spot on the wall. My legs are crossed and my arms are at my side. I then begin to feel as if my arm(s)/leg(s) arent there anymore or they are twisted in a really weird way. I know that they arent but thats how it feels and i end up not being able to move that limb. If a staff (from the program) is sitting with me ill sometimes say that my arm is twisted and ill be kind of panicked. They say its not twisted and they will touch that limb to show its not and that i can still feel it. 

This doesn't just happen when im dissociated. It happens when im in the car sometimes and im being driven somewhere. Its basically whenever I dont look at my arms/legs for a while i start to feel like they are gone or twisted back or in a different position. 

I tried looking up what i just experienced and there wasnt really anything that came up. I just want to know if anyone has any ideas as to why this is happening to me. 

Ive also described this to my therapist and psychiatrist and the rest of my therapy team. But no one has any answers and it scares me every time it happens and im also scared that it will not go away one day and ill just have to live like i dont have a limb that i actually do have or having it feel like it always in a weird position.

69,"So, right to the point in case it gets long - I’m facing some difficulties with identity, anxiety and feeling emotions. I portray myself way differently than I am inside - to the point where it feels like Im almost living a lie. Life is blurred around me, and I dont feel strong emotions, good or bad. I act different than I feel because of anxiety - I act really, really shy. Everyone calls me quiet, and I hate it because that’s not really who I am... I’m just scared of expressing myself because people could easily judge me and I dont want to taint my relationships. But I’ve acted quiet/timid for so long that the internal me and external me are split apart, and I just watch life through this shy person’s eyes. To make matters worse, I daydream. A lot. To the point where I wont be mentally present for more than half of my day sometimes. I live different lives in my head, through my daydreams, and I think that’s only seperating me from reality further. But... I feel like I can be myself when I daydream, and I dont want to lose that. 


For background, I’m 21, in college for stem, very high GPA, and for all intents and purposes I appear normal. I’ve been in a healthy relationship for 3 years. I have friends, although they’re *way* closer to me than I am to them. My childhood sucked (whose didn’t though), filled with emotional abuse, neglect, split parents (of course the narcissist got custody), and I self-harmed and had suicidal intent starting in 6th grade through graduation, when I finally got to leave that place. My excessive daydreaming started as a coping mechanism to deal with my life back then. 

I feel kind of screwed up, honestly. I seem functional, and I feel like I could mask myself and daydream my entire life away; no one would notice. Not one person in my life, even my SO I’ve lived with for 3 years, has noticed. But I certainly feel the pain of faking what I am and hiding so much. I think I might need help, but since I’m technically functional, is it even a problem?

I'm scared my mum doesn't know i love her, i think my dad knows but not too sure about my mum because me and my mum have never go on before and i always felt like i hated her and i'd post about it on Facebook and she'd find out about it through other family members i have on my friends list.  


I get upset that i don't spend enough time with my hamster, i stay at my boyfriends house everyday and have done for the past 5 years except i come home when he's at work or out and stuff, i basically just sleep at his house then come home if he's not going to be in his house as well but since i got my hamster 2 years ago, i still stayed at my boyfriends house for a year of having my hamster and the 2nd year, might even be the 2nd year and a half i've asked my boyfriend if we can stay at mine one week and stay at his the next and just keep doing that. so we do that now but i still get upset about both my mum and my hamster.   


Now, this is the strange one. This is what i don't understand so whatever i try and describe might not be 100&amp;#37; accurate as i don't understand it and i'm only trying to put it into words despite not understanding it.

I don't feel like i am/should be the 22 year old girl that i am i feel i should/am the child (I can't identify which age i feel, maybe 4 years old and above) and it's as if i'm judging my self. I scares me that i have a job... like wtf...that's what adults do, i shouldn't be working, It's also about the fact that having a job means i'm conforming so society way of life which i find i really robotic. Everyone must do this, everyone must say that, You must act this way or people won't like you ( for like jobs/ job interviews and stuff ). Even facebook gets to me, it's so brain numbing, scrolling though the news feeds for hours... i see my mum doing that now and that upsets me and my dad is all about Facebook too, it's as if i'm seeing people life/ sanity (Don't really know how to describe it) being taken from them. I hate how brain numbing technology is, it's really sad for me to see everyone's face in their phones 24/7. No one seems to be able to have a real conversation now and memes......... i hate memes with a passion, to me memes are for the people who are well far into the brain numbing-ness. From my experience people who enjoy memes only speak in memes even though you are trying to have a normal conversation with them, your questions don't get answered or you don't even get a good response because they just hit you with meme talk that had absolutely  nothing to do with what you were even talking about, that really upsets me. to me that is actually not far off brain dead. They people i just can't deal with, you can't have a conversation with them what so ever, so i tend to just not speak to anyone who likes memes but unfortunately my friends group has 5 people who speak in memes but out of that 5 only 1 or 2 of them i am actually able to have a conversion with.  


but yeahh, i'm not too sure if i have something wrong with me or maybe that's normal or.. i don't know i'm confused.

I am married and have a 7 year old (I had him at 14). I've been living with my husband and his dad since I was 14 but for the past year and a half we have been renting the house for ourselves while he has lived elsewhere.


Paid the mortgage, all utilities, and my father in laws cell phone bill just to be able to live there but we recently found out that the house is full of toxic mould that has been making us all very sick and was told by doctors, ODSP, and child services that we were not allowed to step foot back in that house. 

Of course we don't want him around that either so we've been literally sleeping on my mother in laws floor for the past month while we try to find somewhere to live. 


I have no idea why but no place will accept us no matter where we apply and ODSP said that it's a 6m - 1y wait for a low income house. 
We've applied to every rental place with an asap opening and have all been denied. 
I have great credit, no debt, and nothing else that I could imagine they'd deny me for but yet they have all said they won't rent to us and refuse to tell me why.

There are two that are totally running my life right now and I’d love some advice on coping mechanisms.

The first is my nervous ticks. Specifically, chewing on my knuckles/joints and running my fingers over my fingernails. My knuckles have gotten so bad that I can’t even feel it when I bite anymore, so I can’t always get myself to stop because I don’t realize I’m doing it. The other thing is just an annoying habit, when I’m not doing it my hands feel almost tense. Just not right.

The other is obsessing over how much time I have in my day. I look at the time and see I have 5 hours, 22 minutes before work, and start organizing how I’m gonna go about that time. If any of my plans run too long I panic. I obsess over how much sleep I’m getting. I obsess over how much time I need for activities. I obsess over how much time I have before I’m done with work. I’m never able to just sit back and enjoy my day because every hour needs to be filled with SOMETHING even if I choose for it to be filled with nothing.

With no time to plan, every day I am 'winging' it, which for some may be liberating, but with my personality type it's a nightmare. I have been glued to my laptop perpetually researching things to do, places to go, the next flight, tours, accommodation. Despite this, I have paid for several events and not turned up as I was too depressed to get out of bed that day. One day I began shaking as 3 consecutive flights were delayed, French rail workers on strike and I would lose a significant amount of money if I didn't reach a specific place to start a guided tour. 

The reality is, this holiday has been horrible. I am traveling alone with major depression, going to bars every night, watching big groups of friends having the time of their lives while I watch. I thought I could just make friends with strangers. I estimate &gt;10 evenings I sat alone crying in bars, beating myself up over 'why don't you have friends' 'none of the girls want to look at you, you're repugnant' 'everyone is aware of how bad you are feeling and they choose to ignore you because you are worthless'.

It seems everyone is their 20s lives for travel and they do it frequently with their existing, wide range of friends. This should be the best month of my life but I still can't get excited about literally anything in the world.",16Jul2018,5
83,"I am a 19 year old female from Maine, USA and I have a voice in my head and I’ve been having delusions since I was about 12-13 years old. I have a lot of trouble with keeping track of my thoughts, it’s like my mind is always racing and I feel emotionally empty, I didn’t even cry when my grandma died. I find myself having conversations with another imaginary person when I’m alone and I feel like my family is always out to get me and that they control how I feel. I haven’t told my therapist because I am already diagnosed with bipolar disorder and if I tell her I’m afraid she’ll say “no achildrenofbodomfan, you have bipolar disorder.”. I’ve never told any of my previous therapists because I didn’t want them to think I was dangerous or a complete psycho. I’m really scared because I’ve been feeling worse and worse every day. I just want to be normal.",16Jul2018,1
84,"Not very active on Reddit and never posted here before, but I feel like I'm crumbling and I don't have anyone to talk to right now. Most of them won't really get it and the rest are busy with their own pain and I shouldn't bother them with mine, although I know they would have wanted to help. Plus, it's 1:30 am. 
I have depression and anxiety but have been fine for the most part for a year now. I see my therapist weekly and on meds, and I'm ok. Every once in a while I have a panic attack or a really bad day, but it's nothing compared to what it's used to be. 
But I feel awful tonight. I don't think I felt like this in months. I don't know what triggered it, I just remember a couple of hours ago, I was hit in the stomach with the feeling that everyone hates me. That they all pretend to like me for different reasons and that I'm an idiot to be trusting that many people. 
I want to not feel that way, but my anxiety tells me that this is the truth and that I should cling to the feeling that they'll probably leave because otherwise it'll hurt so much more when they do. 
I cannot afford to be surprised. 
I just know that bad things are about to happen and everything is out of my control. I feel so incredibly hopeless. 
But there's something kind of comforting in this feeling. It's so familiar and I haven't felt like this in a long time, it's almost like I missed it. I guess I'm just relieved that I was right in thinking that it'll come back. Even if it's just for tonight and I'll wake up fine tomorrow. This is not going away, ever. And I should accept it.

85,"I'm a 13 year old gender questioning person. I'm trying to get help for the latter. I'm just sitting here crying like an idiot now because I fear that I might feel this way because I just want to start over with a new ""me"". I feel sick like I'm going to vomit. It's like there's two sides to me. I just want to forget about it and go back to my usual autopilot state. I'm just unable to be honest with people, dammit! Whenever I want to say something I either end up making it sound like something else or don't say it at all. It's like I'm not only trapped within my gender, but my outer personality too. I will never be a real man because of how I act, and I'll look like an idiot if I act the same as I do now as a guy. I hate gender dysphoria. I hate depression. I hate borderline. I wish I had never been born.",16Jul2018,3
