0,"Before starting, I have asked for help before. I went to my school therapist and told them how I felt and how I was doing. Their immediate response was to call my parents. My mom is already dealing with a lot of issues already (family, money, our future and housing problems) so the call triggered her to yell at me. I got defensive and told her someone probably reported me to whoever called. The lie wasn't that out of place considering I've been reported to my school for suicidal thoughts and depression before already. Asking my mom for help is completely out of the question since my whole personality is built on acting fine and pretending to be someone I'm not. If I ever asked for help, I'd recieve the same lecture I get from her every time. The ""I've been through so much more than you, you don't have the right to have issues"" talk. I've been considering suicide the past few days and I really think it's the right thing to do. Logically, I know that it isn't a good choice and it's my brain that's being a dumb useless slab of meat but on the other hand, life just doesn't feel worth it anymore considering that I've been in a gray spot for so long and I can't get the help that I need.

I've had a few friends get dragged to hospitals on 5150's (mandatory 72 hour hold in a mental facility) and get evaluated and medicated there. A few of them got better and went on medication. This would be my last resort but I just need to know if there are other ways to get help without asking directly for help. I don't know if getting therapy would be a finanical burden 

TL;DR - Asked for help in the past, didn't work out. Is there any way to get help without directly asking someone for help? ",26Feb2018,2,
1,"I’m gonna keep it short and sweet and I’m just looking for advice on how to move forward. 

My mom and I argue once in a while, just like any other family. And it’s always been fine. Because we listen and laugh it off and honestly listen. 

Sometime when it gets heated usually my dad gets involved. But he is usually a mediator. 

It started when I felt as if though my mom didn’t understand some thing and we got into an argument. And over what, was very small. But my dad chimes in and told us to calm down. So things kept escalating. And we are all three yelling at each other. So my dad goes ballistics and repetitively decides to keep telling me to kill myself and to go and hope I die. 


My mom and I immediately stop and are shocked. This man is a physician of more than 25 years and he turns to tell his future physician son (going to med school in the fall) to kill himself. He starts coming at me and yelling (this man is usually very tame) but my mom and I totally forgot our issue and it was focused on my dad. And my mom the entire time was protecting me from him. But the man wouldn’t stop. Kept telling me to get out and hope I would die. 

I’m lost for words. 

It hurt so badly. 

I’m starting to just wonder if he really loved me as a son. 

And we all have our problems. And I’m a fairly good person, I like to believe. I’ve listened and we all have our own issues but nothing of a caliber worth saying to kill myself. I graduated from an IVY League school. I’m going to med school in a couple of months, it’s everything any parent would hope for their child to achieve. Or atleast I would hope

And to hear ‘go kill yourself’ 

Even in my most angry spouts in life, I could never imagine saying that to anyone. Especially my own son. 

He calmed down 1 hour later after us profusely arguing. And he pretended that he didn’t do anything. (TBH we were all at fault for the original issue). 

We call a psychiatrist friend over and my dad barely even mentions what he said. He acts as if though he didn’t. He played dumb and was LAUGHING. Both my mom and I knew what he said. 

My mom apologized for it, he even tried to. 

But ever since I’ve been in this shock. I don’t feel safe in my house. I don’t feel welcomed anymore. I’m questioning who cares. I’m questioning on if I really should be here at all. I’m starting to just sit and feel like this isn’t real. And it’s concerning me because I’m lucky enough to be self aware. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m lost for words and don’t know who to go to for help. I’m becoming paranoid because I feel as if though maybe everyone wants me to kill myself. My dad certainly felt like i should.

3,"Hi everyone,

I am a 23 year old female and I am slowly realising that I am very self absorbed- especially when I am stressed or suffering from anxiety. 

I think it is stopping me from making meaningful connections with friends and it is causing huge fights in my family.

My mum calls me a narcissist and selfish because I often talk mainly about myself and am really, really bad at remembering to do chores. I am deathly scared of being a narcissist and really really dont want to be one. 

The thing is that my relationship with my parents is complicated because when I was a teenager, they were quite controlling and expect me to just do as they wish. I feel resentment towards them, though I do love them. I just feel terribly guilty that I don't seem to care about the small things in their lives like how their days went or what's going on with work. I feel stifled by them and really want to move out but my city is waaayyyy too expensive to move out in as a single student (even though I have a part time job as well).

With my friends, I am less self centred though I do struggle with empathy. I really want to get better but I am deathly scared that there is no cure.

I want to be a loving and kind and helpful person, but I feel like I can't. Just like I feel like I can't please my parents because I don't care enough.

I have anxiety and sometimes this makes me very self focused because I can't stop obsessing over certain thoughts. 

Has anyone experienced this and got better? Is it genuine or is it faked?

I am feeling absolutely terrible and hopeless right now. Thankyou for your help.",26Feb2018,1,
4,"I started taking my meds again after giving the unmedicated life the old college try. I have bipolar 1 and borderline personality disorder. When I become manic it can last for weeks or even months and I slip into psychosis. I miss those highs at times, but it totally ruins my life every time it happens.

I take Trileptal 600 mg and Risperdal 1.5 mg. 
The first time I was put on Risperdal 6 years ago i gained SEVENTY pounds. I went off of it,lost most of the weight, and lost my mind completely. Took a couple years for the psychosis to return, but I ended up involuntarily committed last summer. I took my meds for a few months,put on 20 pounds, ans stopped taking them. Lost the weight pretty effortlessly.
I've been back on it for about 2 or 3 months now and I've already gained THIRTY! 

I am a recovered anorexic so being overweight is a special kind of hell for me. I have tried another antipsychotic that didnt have the weight gain side effect but it didnt work for me. Please, someone, anyone, give me some advice. I stepped on the scale tonight and I'm totally beside myself, it's enough tp make me feel suicidal. I feel less suicidal on meds,but totally disgusted with my body.

If you haven't heard of the Kid who shot himself at Jackson Middle school you should. From recent events like stricter school rules to prevent shootings I've gotten weird about them. Heres an example: When my school said limit hallway time for safety reasons, I thought that ""a shooter wants a large amount of people dead right? So wouldn't they just shoot kids at mod change?"". It would sound as if when I presented that idea to you, you'd think I would be planning a school shooting, but I'm not. And from all the events happening in my life I keep going into logic of things.

16,"I'm 19 years old, I've never really felt particularly depressed in my life, nor have I suffered any sort of episode or psychiatric issue. I've never really understood why one would commit suicide and I've never considered self harm in any way. I've never been in any situation, as far as I can remember, which would indicate to myself or others that I have any kind of mental problem.

Recently however I've been thinking, even planning, to stab myself. It would be a non-lethal stab in a muscle of the arm with a rather small knife in an attempt to do as little lasting damage as possible. Why?

Honestly it's kind of just out of boredom. I plan to do it outside when it's rather dark and blame it on some drugged up stranger. I want to see what people will say, what it's like to go to hospital and have a wound treated etc...

I understand it might be a little bit cruel to my mother to put her through the shock of hearing about her son getting stabbed, but it's not like I'll be screaming in pain for hours or anything as I've mentally prepared myself for the worst.

I'm not a mental case, at least I don't think so, I've never done anything particularly crazy before. It's not like my life is particularly boring or that I feel I need to do this to get attention or anything, I'm just curious to see what the whole experience would be like and I expect to pretty much forget about it save to bring up for an anecdote here and there (I definitely don't plan to ever do this again, or anything like it).

17,"Not really a mental health issue in my opinion but here goes anyway. I work as an electrician, installing lights, working off a ladder, carrying heavy material etc. Construction stuff.

This past year in particular has worried me. I am nearing the end of my apprenticeship and will be licensed by this time next year. There is a lot I still don't know, lower term apprentices often out perform me, Journeymen notice this and so do foremen. It gets worse every week really. I am making stupider and stupider mistakes, constantly doubting what I install or how long I take to install something. Constantly worrying if I forgot something important about the installation, forgetting to grab material. Doing things one way and when asked why I did it that way forgetting all justification for why I did and I'm basically left with just saying ""I don't know, I shouldn't have done it that way"".

Often we work in groups and these things get in the way there too, slowing the group down. I'm nervous all the time about my ability and usually when you make a mistake, the mistake will not present itself for months down the road so I am always thinking back if I missed something or made a mistake months ago. This has already happened on this job site a lot for me, you can start to feel others faith in you fail through, ""seriously?"", kind of looks. I almost always have to re do things because I always miss something, even just one small thing.

I could take a break I guess but obviously I need to work too. The job is slowing down and I can feel as we run out of work I might be one of the first to go as in the past with this company the slow ones always go first. 

All these things were fine early on in the apprenticeship because ""You're still learning"" but now I'm afraid I didn't and I have just a year to improve competency. No one wants an incompetent journeyman, in construction and electrical you are a liability and a hazard if you are.

I don't even know what my question is, just wondering if anyone can relate. My work ethic is alright, was better when I was younger but I feel that in general is declining too.

This one girl. She’s the closest thing I’ve had to a best friend. I know she’d blame herself for my suicide. She’d think it was her fault for not talking her out of it. She’d find some way to blame herself even though she wouldn’t be at fault. She’s a better person than she thinks she is. 

She says that she’d be sad, and that she’d grieve. And I believe her but not that it would be as big of an impact on her as she thinks it would be. We live in different countries and never see each other because we’re both too broke to afford plane tickets. 

You’re probably reading this and wondering “if you’re so worried about your friend, why don’t you just not kill yourself.” Because I’m stuck where I am, in a bad situation I have no other way to get out of. You won’t talk me out of this.

I start feeling super self aware to the point my mind honestly doesn't seem to want to accept that it or anything else exist.

Now for probably the past 2 weeks I've felt this feeling but instead of brief intense episodes, it's just been consistent with the intensity varying from mild to medium. On top of this, over the past few days I have started to feel sort of like I have been in a coma since high school, and all the events that has happened since then have been dreams and that I will eventually wake up in the morning and head off to school like the past 5 or more years never happened.

25,"So, I have stopped taking meds because they caused me some undesirable side effects. Im so-so now about it but the doctor says is about time to take a new one. I have been diagnosed with a epileptic disorder associated to anxiety and depression. It is not thaaaaat bad... I think. It could be worse. I've been taking meds for 6 years. I've gone and come with different doctors. This last one seems to care for me enough but I've told him that I don't want to take more meds. For one reason or another, my body has been resistant to treatment or those meds that they give me only make it worse or didn't help that much. I've developed side effects that have affected other organs in my body (I guess is for the long time medicated). I'm afraid of that things keep happening again. I don't want to feel worse anymore.

I'm insecure or compliant enough to always follow the treatment but now I'm just tired. I think there is a limit in how I can improve. And I'm tired to have been told one time and another that everything will change. I think there is a limit to that too. And I'm fine with that. It's not that I expect a miracle.

This months without meds have been better for me in some things. Worse in others but I think I can manage... in more months or something like that. I mean, I been bad for years and it is not like I can expect to be cured in 2 months, right?

My concern here is: I don't feel sure to stop the treatment but neither to follow it anymore. I'm really tired. I don't think my doctor will understand nor does my family and that make me anxious. I'm not sure about their feelings. I tend to be paranoid so I just feel like they are going to hate on me for not being compliant anymore but I don't want to do as they say. I am the one dealing with the symptoms and I will not lie if I say that I feel alone sometimes. I just want they to accompany me but not tell me what to do anymore. I'm an adult after all and I will deal with the consecuences of my actions. Problem is, they say that I am ill and that I must do this to heal and be well, besides that some of them seem to believe that sometimes I can not take proper care of myself. I do not know what impression I give them, but I think I can decide for myself. Although that decision ends up being bad for me. However, I wonder where the limit is? Is it true that I can not think well?

It pains me to think that maybe they are in the right and maybe Im just a wrong stupid person that is not doing what is suposed to do in order to be ok.

I don't know what Im going to do. Maybe I will talk about this with a person that I trust (a friend) and hear their opinion. Later, maybe I will talk with the doctor before talking with my family because they will not be pleased to learn this.

28,"So I'm currently in university in the Netherlands, and a good foreign friend whom I live with has been saying some troubling things of late. We've always had philosophical conversations, but the subject of death, foresight and the matter of free will came up surprisingly often recently. He also suddenly gave me his dad's phone number and today asked for some paper to write a note, which I found disturbing enough to ask what all this death- and ""does life have meaning""-stuff was about. 

He then proceeded to tell me that ever since he was little, he's had dreams that predict the future. The dreams consist of small snippets of future events, some of which he remembers, some of which he forgets. These events have been mundane things, but also quite extreme at times.

Upon first hearing this, I tried to convince him these were just things his mind conjured up based on what he'd experienced during the day. But while he seemed reasonably okay with that explanation, just talking about these visions was apparently so tough that he burst into tears several times.

I should at this point also mention he's told me that he finds it very easy to lose track of what day it is, and feels some days take forever while others fly by in an instant. He also isn't doing too great in uni and his parents (who support him financially) are not supportive at all.  

I am very worried and quite confused by everything he's told me, but I really want to help. I've already offered to help him with his grades, but of course I can't really provide psychological help. Therefore, although I know this is a long shot, I hope some of you may be able to help us identify what is causing this and what he could do to change it. Also, while he is unable to afford professional help, do any Dutchies here know of free mental health services that he could use?

I WANT to do stuff, but i always end up just not doing it, or sitting around all day. I don’t even feel like going to school anymore, I’ve always been an A, B student but recently I just can’t be bothered and I’m actually starting to slip a little. I’ve always been sorta lazy but this year it’s gotten worse, I can barely get out of bed in the morning and never on time, so I’m usually late every day now. Some days I skip out on first period to sleep in or “do homework” where I tell myself I’ll catch up in homework but I sleep in instead. But this past week has probably been the worst of it, I faked being sick two days straight because I really didn’t want to BE at school, or even get up for that matter. Ive only faked being sick once in fifth grade but I felt so guilty about it, but this time I didn’t even feel guilty or shameful that it’s scaring me. But what scares me the most is that I still feel this way, i don’t want to get up tomorrow or do anything. I just want to lay in my bedroom.

He said that he had that problem for a few years already, and though he asked for help, Chinese doctors can't help him, so he begged me to ""ask western people if they can tell what is wrong with him"". Apparently, the fellow Reddit users are the way more trustworthy than official Chinese medicine, so couldn't refuse the guy's request. Below is his story in his own words, with the symptoms, diagnosis etc

"" I have seen an article,Fast reading,as the name suggesta the set of ordinary reading methods cann't peformance better than fast reading .Although it's not popular nowadays. but the theory may still not be realized.we ordinary people read,usually in the traditional reading method ,that is,word by word.we hear clearly when we every word in our mind.that is ,silent reading,my mind like a announcer to see the words to play out.but all the voices are intenal,the brain deal with the text through the sound and the internal auditory system.This process is probably going through""the eyes see the text image-the inner pronunciation to read out-the inner hearing system to hear-understand"",but the fast reading method  omit the middle step of this process,directly go through""the eyes see the text image-understanding"".we probably have had this experience,sometimes the train quickly pass some billboards. we  often cann't pronounce the ad when we see all the words to understand. that is ,we actually have inadvertently adopted this efficient image way to understand the text.
orinary people read the text in the speed due to their speak speed.that is limit itself,usually only in 600 words / minute.But when we read the text in image way, we human eye can be a text into the film,and omitted the inner pronunciation .so this kind of reading will be more efficient, faster and more convenient. The ancients of the ""take in ten lines at a glance; "" is probably based on the this.
At that time I was eager to be able to achieve this  ability,so the key points of training are on the elimination of the pronunciatiation in the heart which is the person's natural physiological mechanism.
In this kind of desire I am very cruel to do those training,  The first to start, I do not know how to train this ability.so when the brain sounds come out,I just think about some very bad things, so as a  suggest that I cann't pronounce,  but even this made me so uncomfortable, in order to eventually the so-called ""fast reading"" purposes, I still  doing this practice.

a month later, I feel that the heart  always want to pronounce when I see the words , I feel a rea pity that is not come true. But the third year of the third test, I no longer deliberately care about the pronunciation , I found myself  understand the text really faster than before, and seem to have  the step  of the pronunciation "" Reduce "".  But all of this changed,I always forced to suppress my own pronunciation, from that time,I found myself  really make a mistake, I began to suppress the sound out. But this time I follow the brain  natural mechanism, I found that the pronunciation are no longer natuarl in the heart as in the past.The next ten years I was in the major mental hospital , one of the best hospitals in the country is the sixth hospital of Peking University, all the hospitals gave me a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and gave me a medicine, I insist on medicine Four or five years, and do a lot of physical examination, such as brain computers, ECG, brain CT, cerebral vascular patency is not smooth, etc., the results are all normal. The doctor said that life to go with the flow,  in the future study and life I did not engage in learning and reading activities.for many years, I  play at home every day ,and play the game, did not go to work,
I eager to learn some Knowledge, engaged in some mental work, so I went to learn, but the sun and the moon flies, no matter  how many years I feel the reading barrier is still there, no change.when I see the text now ,there is no  sound, or occasionally jump out a little sound , When see a little longer sentence again or twice I still can not understand, short sentences I can understand. This is all my symptoms, hope that the US hospital can see where the problem, and there is a cure method.

31,"There are things going on with me mentally and physically that aren't right. I'm feeling embarrassment about that. All the mental and physical stuff has been gradually building up and getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I feel like my head is going to explode. I'm at the point where I am having a lot of trouble functioning in my life and need to take a leave of absence of university. 

About 8 months ago, the man (my mother's ex-boyfriend) who abused me emotionally for 12 years was ordered to enter an in-treatment facility for drug abuse and drug induced mental issues. I don't know much else about the situation other than that. What that means for me is that he is no longer in my life and I have been allowed the opportunity to try and heal from that. I have only just realised just how damaging that relationship has been for me. At the beginning of the 12 year relationship I learned how to act in a way that made me as invisible to him as possible. That involved discontinuing music practice so he didn't have to drive me there, staying in my room as much as possible, excluding myself from family functions... all at the detriment of my character. My family assumed I was lazy and unmotivated and to avoid a conversation about my issues with the ex-boyfriend, and therefore more emotional abuse when no one else was around, I learned how to appear ""blank"" in a way. Like I never needed help or that I was never upset or bothered by anything. To those in my life who did not know what was going on at home I guess it translated into me seeming like I am always calm under pressure and that I never fail. When I receive praise from co-workers introducing me to other business owners or evaluations from my professors, I feel like they have such a high opinion of me that it is something that I cannot realistically live up to. And I don't know if that's me being too critical of myself or what but... that is where the embarrassment is coming from.

I feel like I need to justify everything to everyone. I respect my employers the most out of anyone in my life and I really care what they think... I would be letting them down if I took a LOA because they've been bending over backwards to accommodate my school schedule.

I just don't know what to do and am wondering if anyone has ever experienced this or has advice.

I have a Disabled parking permit and my Service dog in training. Thing is, I don't feel like I qualify for these things. Yes they all help me out so much and make life easier but should I even have them in the first place? 

In my head, I keep wondering if I'm just exaggerating minor problems or that its all in my head, and that I've given those around me a false sense of my wellbeing and issues. This is why I don't feel like I should have the accommodations that I do.

Parking Placard: I can walk, haven't used braces for a week or so. Maybe I don't need them? Maybe using them was making me feel like I needed them because having extra support and then taking it away would make my joints feel weird/painful? Yes, there have been times where I couldn't walk and had to use a cane or my dog etc....people get sore though maybe it's just that. I don't know....but I feel like I shouldn't have requested the placard like it was a lie of me to ask.

Service dog: I was rejected by the organization that I originally applied to for not meeting their qualifications (Aka functional enough it wasn't worth it). I was accepted by a self-train organization where you work with trainers and train your own dog. The interview was a lot easier with this one and I was accepted, But its a for-profit organization. Maybe they are laxer with there criteria? ""What does/can she be trained to do for me?"" This question keeps running through my head. She knows deep pressure therapy and is learning to alert to anxiety. But is that enough? If she gets big enough she will help with stairs, but everything else she could learn feels like I'm just fishing for tasks to make sure she meets ADA requirements. Waking me up, medication reminding, tactile stimulation etc....I mean I can get up just not consistently or in time for anything (Chronically very late to everything, have to take evening classes due to this)  I can take my meds but frequently forget for several days at a time (Alarms don't work) Tactile stimulation is so easy, any dog can learn it, how can it possibly qualify as a task. 

She has over 300 hours training under her belt and works very well and I know she only technically needs 1 task (DPT) but I feel like a faker and liar because it seems like her tasks are so minimal compared to a dog who does a million different things for there handler or a diabetic alert dog who is always working. 

Overall I keep feeling like maybe I am a functional person under all of it and just lying to myself, maybe I'm just lazy and don't want to do anything and exaggerate my physical symptoms and pain to make myself seem disabled enough to my mind's eye.

I feel very turned around and confused

TL;DR: I am diagnosed with many issues mental and physical but I'm feeling like I was wrong in getting the accommodations that I have. I question if I'm lying to myself and others around me exaggerating issues to make myself seem disabled. I also worry that my service dog only does minimal tasking and that maybe I don't actually qualify for her. ",26Feb2018,1,

35,"Idk what it is, maybe I'm depersonalizating, but sometimes I can't control my body, and it just feel like if I'm watching my life fall apart. 
For exmple, I was doing an exam and I say I didn't knew a thing while I did, and   then I kept having this weird feeling that was telling me to answer ""I don't know"" to every answer and I didn't really controlled it.

36,"My SO has, over the last 2 ish years, has gone from the occasional anxiety attack, to bouts of some kind of anxiety or depression or something of that nature (she will only tell me she feels ""bleh"" but it will sometimes go on for 2 or 3 days at a time.)

This past weekend was a bad one. All day Friday she was in a bad place at work went to bed as soon as she got home, Saturday wasn't much better until late in the evening. She mentioned feeling better. She decided she wanted to call our doctor and see about an appointment to get this checked out. I was relieved. 

Anyway... that is probably way too much information. But the reason I am posting this is, as the husband who is not dealing with these issues myself and can't truly comprehend what she feels or what is going on, what do I do for her? Or maybe the better way to ask this, if any of you have partners going through or dealing with depression or anxiety, what do you do for them? 

I know I can't fix things or make it better. There isn't some magic fix I can do, but I want to everything I can.

Any tips or things you folks do to help them get through bad days?

Thank you",26Feb2018,1,
37,"I've been extremely lonely since the beginning of this year as sometimes I go 3 days without seeing another person. It lead to a poor motivation to go to classes and very little personal care or doing anything for myself one of which is getting a new Id to mark my attendance to the lectures I've been going to (most likely I'm under 40% attendance). The university knows about my issues as I get extra time in exams (due to anxiety of exam halls) but because my low attendance, poor assignment and on paper general laziness I feel like although the reason are understandable I'm basically a lost cause and get removed anyway. How do I explain what I've been going though and that I actually can catch up and willing even though all evidence points to the opposite?",26Feb2018,1,

39,"I recently posted in r/depression about this but I thought this would be a good place to share/ask too.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I've been struggling with recurrent depression and generalized anxiety disorder for probably about 5 years (at least how long it's been diagnosed). When I was 19 and in college I became very suicidal and was hospitalized 3 times for suicidal ideation/trying to kill myself.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Since then I've been doing better, no more hospital stays, but the road has certainly been up and down. I've been on mediation (welbutrin and fluvox) that seems to at least keep me at a dull, constant low instead of wildly dipping down. Depression and anxiety have become as much of a part of my life as eating or sleeping. They're just there, part of my personality, part of my routine.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Since being diagnosed 5 years ago, I've been fired from many jobs. Due to being in school and moving a lot, I've had many different ones. I've probably been fired from at least half, if not more. It's always for something different. One time I was on my phone, one time I was always late (definitely due to depression/not being able to get out of bed), one time it was because my anxiety freaked out my boss and she no longer felt comfortable having me around the residents (assisted living...that one was hard, I loved that job). I tried talking to her about an issue but I couldn't calm down/stop shaking and stuttering because I was so fucking anxious. There's been other times too.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I think I'm going to be fired from my current job tomorrow. I'm a vet tech at a small, family-owned clinic with 11 employees counting the practice manager and owner. There's 4 doctors, 5 techs. I love my job. I care about animals more than anything and really strive to do better every day. I've learned from at least some of my mistakes in the past and have been upbeat, compliant, and earnestly open to critique at this job. I'm hyper-aware of the threat of termination and seriously, I try to be the best employee I possibly can be. I could probably be considered a submissive kiss-ass. I just DON'T want to be fired. That's been my main goal.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
But last week I fucked up the drawer and didn't close it out correctly, so it was off for the next day. My boss took me into his office and closed the door (bad sign) and told me that he thinks my fostering (I foster dogs for a local rescue) has been distracting me from my job and getting in the way. He said I've been distracted and flying out the door at 6:01 (we close at 6) and rushing towards the end of the day and making mistakes. I don't feel this is true, but I know my perception may be off and biased. My fostering certainly doesn't have anything to do with this. I cried (I know, like a little bitch) and told him I was sorry and that it was unacceptable and that I would try harder.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
The next day I was in charge of a hospitalized patient and was busy helping the doctors with incoming patients and didn't do his noon treatments til 1:30. The owner noticed and has been asking my coworkers about me and my performance.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I'm going to be fired when I go back tomorrow. I know it. I've been having breakdowns about this all weekend and it has sent me into a depressive episode. I don't want to live like this. I can't keep getting fired. What's causing me to be so absent-minded?? I want so bad to be a good employee but the harder I try the worse it gets?? What can I do about this? Are there job counselors or something that can help me see things from an objective perspective? Is there something I should be utilizing/doing differently? 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I know this is impossibly long but even if you don't read it, it was therapeutic for me to write it all out.  If you're going to say ""just get over it and be better at your job"" please don't, it doesn't help. 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
tl;dr - keep getting fired, make little mistakes and am absent-minded no matter how hard I try, depression and anxiety have taken over my life and make it worse. what do",26Feb2018,2,

43,"It's like my emotions are all-or-nothing. Most of the time during day to day things I don't seem to feel as much emotion as other people, average things that make people smile or feel excited just don't effect me. I have to force a reaction. Then sometimes there's periods where something will set me off and I get extremely depressed/anxious, with compounding irrational negative thoughts that can lead to crying or sometimes suicidal thinking. It's often when someone's angry at me or I've made a mistake, even though logically it's not a big deal and most people don't have that intense reaction to it. The thing is my base state is pretty content, I'm not depressed normally. Although I used to have depression for years so I'm thinking that might've messed up my emotions, or maybe I was always like that. It's not like I was always aware of how irrational this was too.",26Feb2018,5,

I can't get myself to do any of my school work, I am speaking to my friends less and less, I've stopped sleeping and eating properly, and personal hygiene is almost non-existent unless its to cry in the shower. The worst part is I know I shouldn't be doing any of this, but I hate myself too much to stop. I know I shouldn't hate myself but I have no motivation to change because I feel like I don't deserve it since I hurt too many people in the past and I am too much of a failure to continue.

I just don't know what this is really, when it happens I try to get my mind off of it by watching something or playing something but the thoughts remain very strong.

55,"Hello all,

I see myself as being relatively uneducated in the area of mental health, and I desperately need advice for a dear friend, so I came here to hopefully get some decent, experienced information.

My friend and I are *somewhat* romantically involved, so that is probably causing me to be a little more passionate and worried about her. So, from what I can tell, she left a suicide note just last week but decided not to go through with it. She has been battling depression for six years now, and she feels like nothing she does has helped very much; it's wearing her down (getting tired). She has went to a psychiatrist and takes several kinds of medication for her mental illnesses (seems to be antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and anti-psychotics). She says that her body quickly becomes immune to everything, and she has to keep trying new meds to get the same effect.

Cutting seems to help her a lot, but recently she said that even cutting doesn't help her to feel anything. That scared me... She wonders what she can do now if cutting isn't helping.

I know that her depression is the worst when she is alone. If people are around that she feels cares about her and she can rant to them (feel understood), she seems to be a lot better. But it's a big cycle.

So my question to y'all is this: can I actually *do* or tell her anything that is going to help her situation?",26Feb2018,1,

There is one problem though: I seem to be slowly dying on the inside and it came so far that I've started feeling it on a physical level. Throughout last 6 weeks I've tried to take notes on thoughts that were eating my mind and facts about my existency:

* I eat once a day, if I try to eat more than that - I'll vomit.
* I am NEVER happy. I don't understand happy people, as if they are acting very foreign and weird to me.
* I am not interested in anything. I don't have any hobbies or interests, everything is greyed out and makes no sense for me.
* I can't ""relax"", I don't know how to rest, I don't understand and dislike people who have rest. Having a rest = doing nothing = wasting your time on nonsense.
* My libido is dead and gone: I don't want anything or anyone. Occasionally I masturbate, but I don't have any sexual urge or desire to do so.
* I wake up 3-4 times a night simply because my mind is overflown with random thoughts. Sometimes, I wake up for no reason and just can't fall asleep.
* I think about death few times a week. I understand I won't ever commit suicide, these thoughts just randomly pop through my head here and there.
* I am constantly sad for no apparent reason.

I need to motivate myself to do some very unpleasant things (deal with my abusive ex regularly being one of them) but I avoid that and lots of things because when I do try to face these things my mood plummets. My habit is to avoid these tasks. However, the longer I avoid them, the more it wears on me because I’m not facing these things and they need to get done. It seems like regardless of what I do I take a notable hit to my mood, something I cannot afford at this point in my recovery. 

I’ve been reading about motivation and it seems like I was raised differently than most people... my parents relied on shouting and shame to motivate their kids and frankly I didn’t realize this wasn’t normal until I had my own kids and started seeing how poorly it motivated them. I’m working on undoing that damage but I’m having a hard time changing how I motivate myself. I still rely on shouting and shame.

Using my insurance's site, I found only four near me(within 10 miles), are women, who offer evening appointments, and who specialize in anxiety(one of my issues), but when I look at their pages, they don't talk about anxiety at all. 

I have tried using Psychology Today's site which was also recommended to me, but most aren't actual psychologists. Some of the terms I see are Licensed Professional Counselor, MSE, SAC-IT, Master of Science, Counselor, Master of Arts, National Board for Certified Counselors, Clinical Social Work/Therapist, Master of Social Work, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, and Doctor of Psychology(an actual psychologist, right?).

What are by best options and course of action to help my anxiety(social and otherwise), fear of driving, and possibly ADHD? I found a place that specializes in anxiety near me, but my insurance doesn't cover them. Are the ones that I listed just as good as a psychologist?
