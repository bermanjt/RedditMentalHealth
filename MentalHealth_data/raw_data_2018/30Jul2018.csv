Being an addict is not nearly as bad as being sober and loving an addict. Whether it is a family member, spouse or friend. Nothing will screw you up more than being associated with an addict. You can’t save them but they sure as hell can destroy you, and they will. 
You’ll waste your whole life waiting for them to change. Sleeping next to them and feeling alone, wondering why they won’t treat you right. You keep thinking it is your fault and you give more and more, hoping that your effort will change things. You’re in love with a lie, this is just the truth that you don’t want to face.

My good friend and I were on a vacation this weekend with a group of other friends and he had some sort of a mental breakdown. The night before everything is going very well, everyone is having a great time. The next evening, my buddy starts to have sever paranoia and anxiety. I can see he’s visibly upset so I take him to the side and ask if he’s ok. He explains to me that he is not feeling well at all and that he thinks the people around us are talking shit on him and laughing at him behind his back. I explain to him that everything is going very well and I don’t understand why he feels this way. After 20 minutes of talking to each other I make the assumption that he must have ingested a drug of some sort or the alcohol/weed is effecting his train of thought. I tell him to sleep it off and he’ll feel better in the morning. It’s now been 3 days and his mind set has became exceedingly worse.  Throughout the weekend his paranoia and delusions got increasingly irrational: people are following him, everyone is judging him, cops are following him. He tells me he hasn’t slept in 3 days so we got back into town tonight and I decided to let him sleep and adjust to being home again.

My friend is 25 years old. I’ve known my friend for the last 17 years and he’s never shown signs of having a mental disorder. The people we were with this weekend all have been close friends with us for over 10 years. 

I’ve done some reading online and on this thread and I think I am going to take him to the ER tomorrow and see what they can do to help him. I am just trying to be supportive of him and I’m not trying to upset him anymore.

I need some help, motivation, friends, tough love... or something along those lines.  I have always struggled with my weight, it's never been an easy journey for me.  I am studying holistic nutrition, and I love health and talking about health, and I am always the first person to give advice to other people about what they should or shouldn't be doing.  But as the world goes, I have the hardest time following my own advice, and cravings and emotions take over more times than not.  I am about 50 lbs overweight on a small frame (female), and I just can't find out how to love myself.  I am actually afraid that if I love myself 'right now as I am' then I won't be able to lose the weight that I want because I'll get too comfortable in this skin (so to speak).  I am not one to use anti-depressants or any other pharmaceuticals, I am holistic as can be and I just don't know how to go about this mental hump.

I would be grateful of any advice, or even a new friend that would wanna chat once in a while to yell at me or something.  Has anyone gone through this along their own weight loss journey?

I went to the school and the police but they never arranged for me to see a therapist and basically told me to go in during “open hours” to start an appointment, and I just never did. It got to a point where I started cutting. So once particularly bad drunken night, I messaged my mom and she got me appointments with a councillor and a therapist. I really enjoyed the therapist and decided I just wanted to talk to her. Then one day my mom texted me my therapists phone number and asked me to set up my next appointment, and I just didn’t. That was a few weeks ago and no ones brought it up since. I’m worried I’m gonna fall down a dark path again but I just won’t text her.

He wouldn’t call it depression, even though that’s probably what it is. He can’t really think of an explanation for it except feeling empty. He feels it in that spot in the very center of his body, right behind the stomach, the same spot where he feels anger and jealousy. He wakes up most mornings feeling like nothing can stop him, like he’s going to be the next Alexander the Great. He wakes up some mornings wishing he hadn’t, not dead, just not wanting to exist for that day. He can’t pick and choose when the emptiness will envelop him, it just happens. He wishes he had control over it, some days he does, most he doesn’t. He can go periods of time where he’s on top of the world, again feeling like Alexander. He isolates himself from the outside world, not wanting to partake in it. He longs for someone that he can speak to without hesitation, but his own mind is the only one who understands. He has always been his own best friend, not wanting to become too attached to others. He feels as if he is but a shell, a shell that no longer has a host. He’s finally met a girl, but not sure what to do in fear of scaring her away. He’s writing this as... well, he’s not sure why he’s writing this, but knows it feels right.

Work - Im  a young ceo of a small but increasingly successful start up whom I founded with three people who are very close to me and have faith and trust in me. I've done no work over the past month  , barley able to get out of bed...I'm able to hide it but it won't be for long 

Freinds- I do a good job of faking it and will cancel plans blaming work (lol) and if I do need to make a showing ....it takes energy just to get out of bed and oodles of caffeine or a bit of alcohol to feel buzzy enough to pretend to be like my old self . 

Family - I look after my single mum and younger siblings financially and moved back in with them ....as long as the money is in the bank account they don't ask too many questions ( also I've usually been the dependable one )

Body / well being - I'm starting to hate the way I look and my self esteem is just diving ,also my  eating patterns are way out

21,"Let me back up a second and give some backstory.

I am female, 24 years old, going to be 25 in August. Earlier this year (January/February) I was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder and prescribed 50 mg Sertraline tablets. As far as having social anxiety, I think it took root at the end of middle school/beginning of high school. Everyone thought my antics and behaviors (shyness, thinking things that weren't true, breaking down at uncalled for moments, even in the middle of class, or when the teacher called on me) was just me being a teen and I was looking for attention. It wasn't until I had a severe anxiety attack in the middle of my algebra class at college that I was taken to a counselor and eventually a doctor.

This summer from May until now I worked as a camp counselor and it was absolute hell. Everyone knew I had a mental health disease, and if I wasn't bullied for it, my superiors would put words in my mouth and force me to do jobs outside of my contract. One week before the last week of summer camp, I poured out a handful of pills and stared at them. I could've ended it all then and there, and no one would miss me, no one would give two fucks. I was sent home instead as my boss caught me in the act and told me to get my life together.

Worse still, my parents object to the idea entirely and think my medication is slowly making me insane, saying I'm not longer the ""bright, beautiful, daughter"" they gave birth to. They have also extorted every cent I earned this summer to help pay to lavish their brand new house. My friends keep telling me to open a go fund me or a patreon so then I can earn my lost cash back or have people raise money so I can move away somewhere safe where I can start again, but I know I'll just get caught like I always do.

People say I need help, but I don't deserve it, because the world thinks I don't deserve it, no matter how hard I work for it.",30Jul2018,0

I've been in a relationship with my SO for several years while they have been living with mental illness. For the first year or so, my SO struggled with bouts of mania and depression. In terms of day to day, their mental health is considerably more stable thanks to medication and therapy (woohoo!).

  


When we first started dating (early 20's) we had a great and healthy sex life. Now, three years later, we're lucky if we have sex once a month. We believe the medication is the culprit of the loss of their libido.

  


Sex is important to me but my SO mental health is more important so I don't want the medication to be changed. I'm not sure if this is the subreddit to talk about this but I was hoping to talk and see if any other couples have struggled with this?

29,"Background info: 3 years ago, I was up really late at night around 3 in the morning and I went to go to sleep. For some reason, I couldn’t sleep and I stayed up all night. It sort of mentally scarred me from staying up at night up to present day. So whenever the time hit 12:30 or sometime around midnight, I would go to sleep because I would get anxiety if I stayed up any longer. It didn’t affect my daily life besides the fact that I didn’t like staying up late anymore. Then it branched out to me having trouble sleeping if I didn’t do homework or if I told private information about certain people. Which is fine because it made me become a better and more productive person. But its evolved to me worrying about small stuff like liking certain posts on social media even though I know nothing bad will happen to me.

Present day: It was mid June and I couldn’t fall asleep for some reason for two nights in a row so I took this over the counter sleeping pill. In the process of falling asleep, I was thinking about “What if the fact that I overthink and worry about small stuff, it will affect me in the future?” And now I think that affected me mentally and physically. There was a period where my blood pressure was super high, my pulse rate was high, and I wasn’t in the mood to eat at all. I got better once I talked to my friends and family about it. But I still was thinking about how I would worry about small stuff and if there would be a point if I stopped. And it was tolerable. I could do stuff and get over things if I distracted myself like go and hang out with my friends and fall asleep normally. But there was once incident that happened a week ago that has been on my mind that isn’t that serious but it affected me. It happened at Guitar Center and I started bleeding on a drum stick. It was a very very time amount, unnoticeable. I was going to clean it but some guy started using it and in my mind I was like “Oh shoot thats not good.” And I cleaned it after it was done. I got concerned and started looking up if anything would happen to the guy. Nothing would happen if I had AIDS or HIV. Normally, I wouldv’e been like “Oh, he’s okay.” But now I question myself, “What if I do and I just don’t know.” So I kept looking stuff about AIDs and HIV when I have no need to. Now I think about the possibility that I affected someone when there isn’t. Usually, if I could sleep, it would go away and I wouldn’t think about it, but it didn’t stop. So now I think about the possibility and I overthinked it so much that I’m concerned about getting HIV or AIDs with a future significant other even though I know that won’t happen. So now I just think about the past and how I was never like this and I just wanna get back to how I didn’t worry about small stuff and blow it out of proportion. I don’t know what to do and I’m just stuck at a mental block I don’t know how to overcome.",30Jul2018,2

38,"Please bear with me; I desperately need help.

5 years ago (early 20s) I was diagnosed with an auto immune disease that resulted in near death and being forced to end my studies and quit my casual employment of 4 years; likely a result of years of physical and mental stress of study and work with no free time and too little sleep.  It took me about 2 years of on and off symptoms and ongoing treatment before i was in remission, though i still receive medication every other month. I've never been very outgoing, and even finding and maintaining casual employment and study was difficult for me, so during my 2 or so years of sickness, rather than do what i could to prepare to rebuild what life i had i instead told myself to just have a break - i suppressed my ambition and ignored any thoughts of motivation, and instead just gave up on everything. I lost all of my friends and became a recluse, blew through all my savings to avoid having to find employment or go on (Australian) unemployment benefits, and ended up where I am now; in some kind of mental hell of my own creation with no escape and no light at the end of the tunnel. The last 3 years i've spent pretending everything will be fine and letting my life waste away, but I can't bring myself to change anything. 

I just found a Reddit thread with \_\_[this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/68t6o6/serious_what_are_some_mental_health_red_flags/dh14irc)\_\_ and realised it applies perfectly to me, though I don't know whether it constitutes depression. I've thought before that death would make things so much easier but i've never actually considered killing myself. 

I've recently finally worked up the courage to admit I have severe problems and started seeing a psychologist. I've never been emotionally open to anybody so i am finding it very hard to communicate how i feel, what issues i feel are relevant etc. My psychologist is very kind and caring, and i've visited her 5 times (6th will be this week), but I don't feel like just discussing my emotions, and exploring issues from my childhood and relationships is doing anything to help. 

I'm at a point now where I have to find work, voluntary or otherwise to receive government income support, but the idea of moving back into the world and exposing myself to other people in a professional environment induces crippling anxiety attacks. Even my phone ringing causes panic attacks.

I don't see visits to a psychologist helping me as soon as I need, and i don't see being forced into life again ending very well for me. I need to do something to start functioning again but I don't know what or how. Do i need medication? will it help? is it a good solution or a last resort?

So, can anybody offer advice on how to escape this living 24/7 hell? Ignoring it is no longer viable. Is there something specific I can enquire of my psych?  Do I need meds? Will drastic action help overcome this or ruin me? I've considered going on an extended visit to live with my auntie in Jakarta, Indonesia to see if that kind of exposure to life and wildly different experiences will help jump start some positivity and motivation.

39,"i'm gonna try to make this short: i'm on 450mg wellbutrin for depression, which has helped very much, and was prescribed xanax for whenever i have a anxiety attack. that being said i'm anxious about an excessive amount of things. which makes me question whether or not my paranoia is something to be concerned about.

for one, i question everything. every social interaction, everything i witness, i just really analyze them heavily and work out these scenarios or situations in my head of what could possibly happen. i think i did a bad job of explaining that because i don't really know how to. i usually chalk it up to social anxiety and the fact that i'm just not used to it.

i also fear undercover surveillance. some police depts. started using totally plain cars for traffic stops a few months ago. i saw a kia pull someone over like a month ago and it blew my mind. i drive for work so i started to keep an eye out, and i can tell people slow down in these common areas which i guess is really good for traffic safety, but it causes me a lot of anxiety. i'm not sure whether the anxiety is the cause or effect of my paranoia.

i also advocate for george orwell's 1984, and have always hated the idea of government surveillance since i was 14 and the nsa scandal happened. but then recently it had developed into the understanding that the nsa is following my computer activity, to me believing just someone is watching me through my computer. it isn't the issue of the webcam, i just have a feeling that someone is watching my every move on this computer. every letter i type, every backspace i hit for letters mistyped, and i feel judgement for things like that. i also worry how people will read this. i delete things and carefully select my words to try and not sound fucking dumb. i stare at words and analyze what i could possibly change. i really fear judgement. 

i feel stuck in this cycle of crazy thoughts of my friends not liking me and people overall thinking i suck. i stopped hanging out with anyone except my girlfriend after i got back from my first year of school (which led me to really going headfirst into depression, good experience otherwise) and started thinking they didn't care. i explained this to a few of the ones i've been talking to more consistently and they say it isn't true but i really feel it in my gut. i see a lot of ulterior motives or that they feel bad for me or something. 

i worry about all of this because i feel like my self negativity is really making these fears into delusions.

i think i need to see a therapist

oh boy!",30Jul2018,1
40,"I wanna keep this simple, I want to be diagnosed professionally for a few reasons.
• So I can Understand what is genuinely wrong with me and educate myself so I don't go off making guesses
• To Prove to any education or work place that I have a serious illness so They can cut me some slack if I'm having any type of episode (Seriously, They won't take me seriously without professional paper)
• To Finally get proper Techniques and  Skills to tackle the problem head on

That and Many others though I cannot think of it atm.

This is where the problem is;
I've been with this Mental health service (not gonna say who because I'm a lil paranoid) for 2 or 3 years. Throughout it not once Have I had a diagnosis even though it was pretty obvious My brain wasn't...functioning at all.

I've asked countless of times...
Only now I've managed to get a Psychologist yet when I mentioned that this service has had some sort of idea that I might have Severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, she seemed so shocked and Well...Not interested. So that means They didn't write it down in my file...Which Made me felt Like I was lied to in some sense. All these thoughts ""What if I was Lied to??"" ""What if I don't have Anxiety??"" And so on so forth.
She did Read the file btw, She told me personally that she did.

I just want Answers on why Haven't I had anything because It's killing me from the inside

I keep on getting thoughts that I'm not mentally ill and I have just been lying to all my loved ones and seeking help just for attention..

I know I'm not too young to have a diagnosis..

And tbh..From Seeing from my friends who is also under their service I've been thrown to the side....Everyone has Had their diagnosis and is getting intense therapy (Not jealous at all btw just very very confused)...

Im not boasting about ""Ugh I should get therapy and ugh all these stupid therapists""...No No Please don't think I'm like that

I'm just so confused and I can't trust this Health system anymore...",30Jul2018,1

43,"This past month has been quite the wild ride, and I've never worried that I was going crazy more than I am now. I've developed strange obsessions that get progressively stronger over time until they're consuming. I spend the majority of my time in a sort of dissociated haze. I've been making so many connections in places where connections certainly do not exist. Random, nonsensical crying is more common than before. My dreams are more vivid than ever before, which has made it difficult to tell whether or not some things are real. Any amount of socialization seems unappealing, and many of my fantasies revolve around leading a hermit-like lifestyle with minimal human contact. The lines between reality and fantasy are starting to blur.

I have no clue what's going on right now. This isn't a post asking for advice so much as a way to vent. I plan on getting help as soon as the opportunity comes my way, but until then, I'll have to try my best to keep it together.",30Jul2018,2

45,"In this shithole town (sorry, townsfolk!) I live there used to be a ""crazy"" person. We'll call him ""B."", not his real name but the first letter of the term for crazy homeless person in my country (baliw). He's usually seen in the downtown area near the mall (aka market) or the town park and regularly goes to church too for some reason, which makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe during sunday masses, which my parents force me to go to even though I'm not religious, because most people in the Philippines where I live are very religious. Anyway, like most other ""baliws"" B. is either very poor, or even homeless, or both. 

I don't know exactly what illness B. has. It might not even be an illness but a disability like autism or just plain retardation but most people say he's crazy. Here's a list of the things he does, that make him look either crazy, or maybe just handicapped.

* Running around like a madman

* Making loud random noises, usually emergency siren type noises

* Chasing and touching strangers

* Doing all of the abovee - running around, making noises, and chasing and touching strangers - in the church during mass

I don't know B.'s age, but I'm guessing anywhere between late teens (16 to 17) and early 40s. He's bald and has a huge head and similarly huge, bulging eyes. Thankfully he seems to be gone (e.g. dead or just not in the town, or maybe institutionalized)because the last time I saw him was a few years ago. But there's another guy that attends sunday masses that also seems to be either ill or handicapped. Why? Because he walks around to change seats more often than church-goers normally do. I'm not sure though. Maybe he's just strange. Or high on something, maybe drugs, the most common of which is known as ""shabu"" in our local language, For you English-speakers I think it's either heroin or meth, I really don't know.",30Jul2018,1

I live in an otherwise functional family, no issues in that sense. I am the only issue here. I hate it, I hate myself when I do it. It's only at home though, never at school or in public or anything. Why do I do this to the people I love the most in my life? The only people that I love. The thing is, I've always be known at school and all that, I'm funny, people like me, it's fine. But I have no close friends and I hate being out in public. It's exhausting and I get so nervous, I'll sweat and itch and twitch like I'm insane or something. I just want to be normal.

56,"A discovery that I've made recently as I deal with my own mental heal issues, is that mental illness doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you. It means that you are in the midst of sudden, intense, dramatic *healing*.

I want to repeat this one more time: there's nothing wrong with you.

### Metaphor

A chick is developing inside an egg while the mother hen sits on top to keep it warm. The chick grows inside the egg until it begins to feel crushed against the boundary of the shell. The shell was once a protective home, now it's an oppressive prison. The room gets tighter and tighter until - Boom! the first crack in the shell.

When the chick looks through the crack in the shell, it realizes all at once that the shell IS NOT the Universe. That the Universe is much, much grander and spacious than the shell. It's just a matter of time now, the shell breaks away and the chick is free to explore this greater reality.

Just because you find yourself in emotional or spiritual distress - be it physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual - does not mean that there's anything wrong with you; it means that you're *healing*. It means that you're growing. It means that you're looking for that first little crack in the shell that shows you what lies outside of your suffering.

### The Universe Exists Inside and Outside of Your Suffering

Think about your depression, your anxiety, your suicidal thoughts, all of your reasons for your suffering. Think about them respectfully, because they come from you and you deserve more respect.

All of this suffering exists in a cloud that surrounds your body. It's not what you are. None of it is as true as you believe it is. Would you be willing, now, to question what you believe is real? Thoughts such as ""I should be dead"" or ""I'm a disappointment"" or ""I'm a failure"" or ""I'm lost and confused"" or ""I hate myself"" -- what if they were all just thoughts and not reality? What if they were just thoughts that you could choose to stop investing yourself in?

The Universe is not suffering. The Universe is the space in which suffering happens. The Universe looks upon all creations with love and adoration. It's love and adoration flows freely to all beings, all creations, all manifestations. It continues to love us even as we insist that we're unlovable. It persists. It wins in the end. Love is effortless - closing yourself to Love is what takes effort.

Time is our friend.

### Respect the Path that you're on

Just because you're suffering, doesn't mean that you're on the wrong path. You ARE on your path, you ARE on track. There is deep wisdom in you that knows its doing. It's built into you. Trust in the majesty of who you are. Fall back into it. Listen to yourself respectfully and make your choices from there.

You'll heal the quickest at the rate that you allow yourself to relax, to trust yourself, to trust life, to offer yourself respect and companionship.

58,"This is a test to see if my profile can still post anymore content. If not, ill just open a new account and start over. Keep reading to see why.

So I recently discovered a rather underhanded practice reddit seems to use when removing content deemed unsavory. Reddit appears to blacklist users silently with no attempt to communicate their post are being auto removed and why. 

On the user end everything looks normal. You can see your post in your history, even look at it on other browsers and apps, and everything looks normal but your not getting any views or comments. Most would rationalize that its mostly cuz they don't have a following base or maybe the title was poor and just post again later like normal. But after a while you begin to see that no matter how much you post or how long you do it the results are the same and you may begin to think your content is so unattractive no one would dare read it. 

But then you open the same links to your content in incognito mode and notice they all say ""removed"" even though you can clearly view it when your logged in. Checking your email or spam filters reveals no messages of warning or notice from reddit.

What is happening is that all your content is being removed before anyone even gets a chance to see it regardless of topic or context. And this was intended to go on indefinitely hoping you remain blissfully unaware that you were wasting your time and effort to use this platform. The only way around seems to be making an entirely new profile and post again.



So, in my case, I posted something in the depression sub reddit about research that's currently being conducted about the effects of psychedelics for those who are highly resistant or unreceptive to conventional medicine and therapy. The post got several hundred views before I noticed all activity suddenly stopped.

[Developing New Therapy for Depression, Anxiety, &amp; Addiction (Ted talks)(and more)](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/93470x/developing_new_therapy_for_depression_anxiety/)

[Only 28yo &amp; already feeling like I'm only waiting to die...(Long Read)(First Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8xjqa7/only_28yo_already_feeling_like_im_only_waiting_to/)

The above link takes you to another thread about this topic with video links to TedTalks and a profile of the individual speakers; The second is to give a bit of perspective about myself. I've spent the better part of nearly three years looking into ways to analyze and combat my disorder and so far this appears to be the most effective approach after Anti-Depressants and Behavioral Cognitive Therapy. But, even after decades of legal suppression and the stigma it still carries to this day, the clinical observations are consistent and frighteningly optimistic. Even better is that there are, pending your resourcefulness, many avenues of access if you can't get clinical assistance and found to be largely nonaddictive.

Before I go further, I have to justify this as strictly educational and do not condone behavior related to this that violates the law where ever you reside. I am not a medical professional nor practitioner with credible experience on the matter of controlled substances. Just another guy on the net who spends way too time looking into research related to depression and other mood disorders and suggest you alway fact check.

That in mind I'll continue.

There are many people suffer depression to many degrees of severity who just aren't very receptive to conventional medication and therapy, and suicide is 40+ times more likely to those with untreated depression. However research has seen remarkable, long-term, relief of depression and anxiety in terminally ill patients literally standing at deaths door. That's powerful evidence of the medical benefits of psychedelics considering these are patients literally with no hope for survival but still find peace and relief, sometimes with as little as just a single treatment.

The theory behind how this works is involved with how psychedelics affects how the neurons in your brain communicate. Since neurons communicate through chemical catalyst, such as serotonin and dopamine, psychedelics block these chemicals between the neurons you use most consistently. But instead of causing you to stop breathing or spazing out your brain will immediately compensate these lost neural pathways and start going to town using as many dormant neurons available to reconnect the regions that lost their old neural pathways. MRI scans have revealed that instead of new, direct, pathways from any two regions where a spiderwebed network across many different regions that have never revived so much activity before. Its theorized that the new pathways are reconnecting the regions of the brain that may have atrophied from diminished activity, such as the regions responsible for satisfaction, creativity, and pleasure.

In short, psychedelics jam the parts of your mind that maintain your depressive state and force activity in all the other areas that you rarely use that may be responsible for your sense of joy, meaning, satisfaction, community, etc. If all your mind can ever focus on or perceive are only negative elements then those thoughts are likely to only get worse with time because they receive the most ""exercise"" while the parts you need to elevate your mood and outlook are severely ""out of shape.""

Another remarkable result of psychedelics is how eerily similar peoples experiences are when they attempt to recollect what they remember, and frequently claim it to be one of the most profound and important experiences of their lives. Then there are many instances where patients who reduced or eliminated toxicity addictive behaviors with their new found introspective.

Finally, is the accessibility and toxicity issue of psychedelics as a controlled substance. While LSD has been reported to cause states of psychosis, its often remarked that you couldn't consume the amount of psilocybin mushrooms needed to kill you. Even DMT, an endogenous chemical claimed to be one of the most powerful psychedelic known, has yet to document an incident of lethal overdose, even in a clinical experiment where patients received consists intravenous doses of DMT. These substances are a natural part of human history and culture, and made at home through *comically* easy and safe methods.

So to anyone who still clings to even the faintest hope, or those whom have exshaughsted all other options, this may be worth a look into before ever attempting suicide. Because, if you've already reach the point realistically considering it, what more do you risk to lose? Do your homework, ask questions, and decide for yourselves.",30Jul2018,7
62,Of corse I know that almost everyone would love to relive their life. But with me I can’t even think about my childhood without having a strong urge to want to do it again. I’m curious if it’s because I’m not happy with the present or if im just feeling nostalgic ,30Jul2018,3
63,"Hello. Today, I'd want to talk about what's been  going on my mind during my whole life.

Well. It all started when I was a little kid. I would hear voices that no one else would, and I neither would tell nobody. Now, giving a big step in time, hen I became older (13-14 years), I started feeling like there was someone watching me, chasing me every place I go with intentions of hurting me, with appearance of a child, an old man, a simple flower pot. At this age, I would start to fantasize with killing myself and wanting to hurt myself as much as I could, because, the voices I used to hear when I was younger, started to hate me more and more. After 1 month of this situation, I firstly visited a psychologist, but I was told by her to go visiting a psychiatrist. My first appointment with this new therapist was horrible for me. The doctor would make me take Risperidone (antipsychotic medicine) 3 times a day. 2 years after visiting this place, I got diagnosed with a personality disorder that couldn't be fully diagnosed until I was 18. It took me a whole year to partially recover some stability, and 3 (current date) to be 85% stable.

66,"My husband has walked out on myself and our 8 month old. It’s been two months now. 
He is seeing a therapist who has said he is emotionally shutting down when he is with me as the trauma of what he is doing is too much for him to handle. 
He said he is leaving because he is unhappy but we planned this baby, this wasn’t an accident. I’m confused why all of a sudden he is so unhappy and wants to leave.
He has had a flirtation with someone at work in the time since he left. 
I don’t know how to be with him. He doesn’t miss me or feel anything for me and when I get upset he just stares at me blankly and doesn’t offer any comfort. I have sat in front of him hysterical, crying (literally) pulling my hair out begging him to see what he’s doing and he has looked on as if I wasn’t there. 
We have been together nearly 8 years and married for 2 1/2. Not perfect but always happy and in love.

I am looking for some advice/insight before I go to see a therapist. 

Long story short, I get angry and resentful so easily with even trivial things. But even when I am angry with other things, it feels like I am angry with myself. I can't really control myself when I am feeling angry, which leads me to hurt myself. (ex. making bruises on my legs by hitting myself)

In addition, I have so many other problems such as obsessively worrying about future, having lack of confidence, feeling unmotivated, and being distracted too easily.

70," I have to quit Lamictal today because of the unfortunate side effects. I have been taking 200mg for over two years so I  ignored the symptoms that appeared thinking they were unrelated to the med.  The symptoms started with slight skin rash on my right foot. I thought to myself that this couldn't be side effect of Lamictal since I had been on it for so long. Then the rash became worse and started spreading on my right foot. Past few days, I have also had burning and dry eyes so bad that I had to leave work in  the middle of the day. I called the psychiatrist today and she said to quit the drug immediately. 

Lamictal  has been the ONLY drug that has ever helped me. I have tried every anti  depressant with no success and then we finally tried Lamictal as a ""what if"" trial. It has been absolutely a miracle drug for me and I have been  able to achieve so many wonderful things in the past couple of years because of  the med. Therefore, I think I tried to ignore the symptoms even though I knew that Lamictal can cause Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. I am nervous to know what my life is going to be like without Lamictal but I am obviously more scared of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and know I need to address this STAT (I already stopped taking Lamictal as of this morning).

“I understood myself only after I destroyed myself, and only in the process of fixing myself did I know who I really was.”
Life is painful and messed up, it gets complicated at the worst of times, and sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do. Lots of times people just let themselves get lost, dropping into a wide open, huge abyss; but that’s why we have to keep trying. We have to push through all that hurts us, work past all our memories that are haunting us. Sometimes the things that hurt us are the things that make us strongest. A life without experience, in my opinion, is no life at all; and that’s why I tell everyone that, even when it hurts, never stop yourself from living.
Hiding your hurt only intensifies it. Problems grow in the dark and become bigger and bigger, but when they are exposed to the light, it becomes exposed and it shrinks. You are only as sick as your secrets. So take it off, stop pretending your perfect and walk free.
We will never get back the life we waste trying to be normal.
The strongest people are not those who show strength in front of the world but those who fight and win battles that others do not know anything about.
You are not your illness. You have an individual story to tell, you have a name, a history, a personality. Staying yourself is part of the battle.
You keep a lot to yourself because it’s difficult to find people who understand. Don’t be ashamed of your story, it will inspire others.
Don’t expect everyone to understand your journey, especially if they have never had to walk your path. The deepest pain I ever felt was denying my own feelings to make everyone else comfortable. Ignore the people who say just get over it. Healing is a process.
You cannot recover from anxiety by just staying calm; you cannot recover from depression by just being positive. If mental illness were that simple we wouldn’t be struggling in the first place. Those who suffer from mental illnesses are stronger than you think. We must fight to go to work, care for our families, be there for our friends, and act normal while battling unimaginable pain.
The only thing more exhausting than having a mental illness, is pretending like you don’t. 
The mentality and behavior of drug addicts and alcoholics is completely irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and unless they have structured help, they have no hope!
I have been drinking since I was 12-13 years old, and I actually managed okay as a pretty heavy drinker my whole life. One night I got into a car accident. Over a few days, I drank myself into a stupor. To this day I don’t remember the accident. When I realized I didn’t remember it, I was completely disgusted with myself and sought out treatment. In recovery, I battle my mind and sobriety every day, but more important, my presences around me and others.
Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come. Remember everything you have faced, all the battles you have won, and all the fears you have overcome.
I smile because I have survived everything the world has thrown at me and I smile because when I was knocked down, I got back up.
People who repeatedly attack your confidence and self-esteem are quite aware of your potential, even if you are not. Someday, everything will make perfect sense. So for now, laugh at the confusion, smile through the tears and keep reminding yourself that everyday happens for a reason. One day it just clicks, you realize what’s important and what isn’t. You learn to care less about what other people think of you and more about what you think of yourself. You realize how far you have come and remember when you thought things were such a mess that you would never recover. And you smile, you smile because you are truly proud of yourself and the person you have fought to become.

79,"I've struggled with correctly identifying my mental health issues for as long as i could remember. As a child I was diagnosed with ADD and went through CSA as well as emotional abuse by my caretakers. I'm not looking for sympathy as I've processed these experiences and feel I healthfully contextualized my experiences. 

Since 2012, I suspected I may have a personality disorder. My wife and I would discuss this at length (she felt similarly with her own mental health, too). Upon research, I could see perspectives in which I had symptoms of almost all of the PD's. Upon this realization, I stopped paying attention to personality disorders. I didn't seek therapy because I was fearful my therapist would recommend that I leave my wife (wife wouldn't entertain couples therapy). 

Last year, I met someone and it brought back my interest in psychology. She thought her husband and friend were NPD. We both had traumas and found solace in discussing our experiences, especially the emotional abuse we suffered. She had trouble with interpersonal relationships and came to me with advice because she couldn't understand why her husband was frustrated. She is very, very flirty. She openly discussed her history with the people she had left behind. The sex was intense, almost movie-like. She tended to mirror people intensely, friends and lovers alike.

I spoke to a mutual friend and asked her what she knew about BPD. After more research I stopped believing it was BPD. 

It seemed like HPD and I told her that. She largely agreed. My research led me to start analyzing myself again. At some point, it seemed like my friend had BPD (hpd was phased out in the DSM-V). I told her husband because her mental health was deteriorating. Discussed her mental health behaviors at length with her friend and at times we both believed we had every PD under the sun, including BPD. I scheduled an appointment with a psych to get an eval. Well, I lied to everyone because I never went. I told my friends I was diagnosed with AvPD. I was so sure of myself that I had all of these PD's and overtime I was able to recognize that I was using this research as a way to disassociate from the problems going on in my life and as a coping mechanism. 

The good thing is that my knowledge about personality disorders is now fairly extensive. In march, I was getting obsessive with reddit and discovered a startling pattern of posts by a few people. I was able to connect the dots and that was the moment that I suspected I was autistic. 

In my life, many people have said to me that they thought I was on the spectrum. I never took it seriously and always kind of viewed it similarly to when people lose their keys and exclaim, ""OMG, I'm so ADD.""  I entertained it in the past, the symptoms aligned nicely, but I dismissed it. I guess you could say I emotionally rejected that idea out of fear. 

Back in March when I revisited this idea, I did some extensive research and took some tests and they all confirmed. I booked an appointment with a psychologist that worked with many autistic clients. Upon the first few sessions, she gave me an unofficial diagnosis. ASD is one of the few disorders where self-diagnosis is considered valid by the community because the tests and money involved in getting a medical diagnosis can often be an arduous process with the potential to be a traumatic experience for the autistic. 

Here's my problem. They seem to believe I have BPD based on my what I've said in the past and completely ignore my realization that I'm autistic. I don't understand why they place more validity upon a previous self-diagnosis rather than my more recent one. I haven't self harmed since junior high. I do have emotional abandonment issues and actually being emotionally abandoned only reinforced these beliefs. 

Lately, I've been experiencing suicidal ideation because I'm going through a divorce, house is being sold, lost my career, in debt, lost my entire friend group, and my mom just passed away after a short battle with cancer that had recently came back from remission. Well, no shit. Who wouldn't have suicidal ideation if this all happened within the last 4 months? 

The perception of my unstable sense of self is explained by falling in love with someone and smoking weed heavily with them. Despite the stress, I've been maintaining my boundaries with ease. 

I'm lawful, morally minded, and don't fit any of the symptoms. 

I feel they're being exceptionally cruel toward me and seeking confirmation bias from the behaviors I display under such severe stress. Most psychologists recommend getting your dx during calm times because PD's are persistent throughout life and not due to circumstances. 

My friend doesn't have BPD either, fwiw.

81,"From what I've seen, society is getting a lot better at helping addicts. Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, drug courts, rehabs, the list goes on. So if you're abusing drugs or alcohol, society says 'Oh! You poor thing! Let's get you into rehab and a counselor and here's all these fancy tricks to make you a productive member of society!' If you're overdosing, call 911, they'll save your life and cart you off to a hospital and the doctors say 'Looks like you've had a rough go of it. Here are your options.'

If you cut yourself? 

Society says 'OH MY GOD YOU FREAK SOMEONE LOCK THAT ASS UP!!' If you cut too deep, you can call 911 sure but you will be judged. They will roll their eyes and say 'Ugh, some emo kid thinks s/he has problems. Do you know how many addicts I've saved today?' When you get to the hospital, they will stare. Not look you in the eye, not give a straight answer. Then a psychologist comes in, barely paying attention, asks you questions without really listening to your answers. Then you are locked away, you can't go outside, given nothing to do, and forced to take medications you don't need because they just want you quiet. No one cares about your pain, or why you cut. They don't want to see the scars. 

I've had experiences like that. I have watched addicts I've personally known and loved get hauled out of their addiction by friends, family, programs on programs.

85,"Hello,

I would like to get some really serious advice about my current situation: 

First of all, I live in Barcelona, Spain. I have been living with my parents pretty much all my life until they started a new life in the South of Spain.

So, the thing is: I decided to inform against my dad to the police station because of gender domestic to my mum and domestic violence to me. Then, I went to an investigation court but everything was quite horrible because both of my parents have more than 65% of disability. With that, they were protecting my dad because he has 1-2% more of disability than my mum, and he doesn't know how to write or read. 

I don't know how to react about this. Both of them have different mental disorders, but after all my mum is smart and I love her. She does not deserve all what he has been going with a man like him, because I cannot say that he acts the way he does because of mental disorders or because he really is an aggressor. 

The main judge said to me: 'why you don't revoke the resignation? why don't you call a psychiatrist before you do all of this?' well.. I have been living with this situation all my life. Everyone I knew they were like.. 'yes, you should go and stop this situation'. No one told me about to call a psychiatrist or I didn't even think about it. I was just asking for help because I cannot keep going with this anymore. So finally, we were not at our house for a month.. we discovered how Social Services were working in Spain.. and some of the woman who where there were like 'I am thinking about to go back with my husband because this looks like a jail, instead of a place to help us', which is totally true.. then, they were going to get a divorce and my dad got scared of the situation of the judges and they both cancelled everything and they went to live in another place. My mum is just doing it to be sure that he is going to live really far away and because he doesn't know how to do that but she doesn't want to stay with him. 

So, then it is me living at my mum's house alone.. but he was living here for 20 years and he also has Diogenes syndrome and the house is full of dirty stuff. Like I am just making a documental about it.. and I am cleaning, but after all.. I am pretty scared that no one would help us, like if he comes back at some point.. the justice would be against my mum and I.. but it is not healthy to live like this. It is not his house, it is been horrible since I was a child.. and if he is living there, I just wanna feel free and clean because I cannot keep living like this or my mum anymore.. but the psychologist of the court told us the other day that if he has this kind of illness we should not do anything. Just keep going like this. I can be pretty much sure that it is horrible. 

Psychiatrist, psychologist and lawyers out there. I need to see a different point of view. If this is right or fair, or information about everything. I am serious.. because some of my family are like 'I have enough problems with my family too'.

94,"My relationship with therapy is very masochistic. It requires trust, honesty, and vulnerability or else it won’t work. Actually, it’s a step beyond the basic concept idea of openness. It’s an intense self-examination. A continuum of emotional mapping and paying attention to the how’s and why’s, and understanding the root of my reactions. The gravity of what I deal with on a daily basis is too much for my loved ones to handle. I am terrified (and so are they) at what I am capable of so I wouldn’t dare put this emotional weight on their shoulders.

I have a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist; luckily, they are both located in the same office. I see the doctor once per month for my prescription refills, and I have forty-five-minute sessions with my therapist every two weeks. Technically, it should be weekly; however, I can only withstand so much emotional anguish at a time.

The patient-therapist relationship is very intimate. I am extremely guarded and wary of people in general; if your energy is off, it’s not going to work. Previous therapists have been calloused or only saw me as a patient, not a human being. And one even made a rape joke. Yes, a male medical professional thought it was appropriate to joke about rape in a therapy session. Naturally, I never went back.

You see, my problem is two-fold. I am bipolar one, and I also suffer from emotional PTSD; along with significant trust issues. So I am as fucked up as it gets.

Although simple in theory, I hate talking about myself and reliving the past, however, I know it’s a necessary step in my life. Being this open and allowing others into my space is very hard for me. It took me awhile to find the right fit. Leon, my therapist, knows me very well. From our first session, there was something different about him. I knew he meant me no harm. He is very patient with me and sympathetic to my trust issues, and the long list of my other problems. He understands why I am hesitant in discussing certain matters and knows when to call me out on my bullshit. Both he and my doctor are very straightforward. Which is both a positive and negative experience. The negativity has nothing to do with them directly. It’s just that being exposed ignites so many emotional reactions. Sometimes it’s too much, and it triggers my other side.

The week leading up to Memorial Day Weekend, my doctor was overbooked. He asked if I wouldn’t mind seeing the nurse practitioner. I was hesitant at first, only because I didn’t know this person. Newness in that intimate setting makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I knew there would be a bit of awkwardness as I warmed up to her. But what I was not expecting, was a nasty bitch with a shitty attitude. When I entered her office, she didn’t look me in the eye and coldly asked me to verify my last name and date of birth. I was taken aback by her demeanor and that introduction.

I have gone to the same facility for almost five years, and on this day, I had a double session with both the doctor and my therapist. I was already checked in by the reception and had just left my therapist’s office so I was put off by her line of questioning. I think interrogation was more like it. She also demanded that I confirm how long I’ve been on my medications and other facts that were listed in my file. It was sitting before her and had she bothered to have read it, she would have known my medical history. I have a photographic memory; however, I can’t recall all of the medications I have been prescribed or offer exact dates of my hospital stays. Some of that I have blocked out, purposely, and other shit I don’t fucking remember.

With each silly question, I felt myself slowly unravel. Finally reaching my limit, I stopped this woman midsentence, saying that I didn’t like her energy and advised her that we should not continue. Rather than defuse the situation, she, it seemed was keen on “breaking me,” and I am sad to report that it did not end well for her. I lost my patience, zipped up my ethnic suit and popped off…at the fucking psychiatrist’s office. The doctor had to come in and referee as my rage was becoming uncontrollable. I was very close to punching her in the face.

That definitely was not a high moment in my life. However, I have no regrets. Her energy provoked the situation. Once you take me there, you have pushed me past my grace and patience. I don’t hear anything you’re saying. I am either counting in my head or depending upon the severity of the circumstances, contemplating if the felony would be worth it. Thankfully, I am not *there* often.

Anyways — getting back on topic. Even though I am left feeling like shit and emotionally raw immediately afterward, I know therapy is crucial to my well-being. There is no cure for my condition, but treatment offers me a small bit of reprieve. It’s a safe place of open discussion, without judgment. Also, it’s a test of my wills. Leon helps me to weed through what is real versus what solely exists in my head.

Another downside to therapy is that my doctor’s office is only one subway stop away from my office. Leaving me little to no recovery time. It’s quite challenging getting back into the headspace to deal with my coworkers. More often than not I am pinching myself on the train in an attempt to keep the tears from falling. At times even taking Xanax to numb my nerves so I can finish out the workday.

It would be easy just to give up and let my worst side get the best of me. I am bipolar, boo hoo. But, fuck that! I am not a victim, and I refuse to live that way. Or subject others to my manic antics. Early on after my diagnosis, I assumed that mental disorders were something you could just shake off or take a pill. I didn’t pursue the right treatment measures, and I found myself in a dangerous place, more often that I’d like to admit. I ignored the warning signs, and that left me institutionalized on several occasions. It wasn’t until the last stint that I realized that I needed to take hold of myself and find a healthier way of coping. Drinking heavily and smoking lots of weed, both of which I still do but now in moderation, is not a smart approach to living with a mental disorder. Nor is just taking a pill. Therapy, along with medication, is a permanent part of my lifestyle. Even when I don’t want to go, I know I have to. I feel it is my responsibility to protect myself from self-harm and also not to be a threat to others.

My greatest fear is suffering an unrecoverable breakdown. I came very close to not coming back to myself, and that was terrifying. With therapy, I have learned how to recognize my warning signs better. It’s also bittersweet as I have to deal with the reality of there being no cure. And there is a large part of my personality, along with the associating behaviors, that I cannot control. I still have low days, and my emotions are consistently up and down. But I take comfort in knowing that I am making the right decisions for my mental well-being.

If you are suffering from any mental anguish, I encourage you to get help sooner, rather than later. [The National Alliance of Mental Illness](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-HelpLine) is a great resource. I have reached out to them in the past, and it opened my eyes to the various resources, and people who can offer assistance. Also, don’t be afraid of therapy or admitting you need help sorting out your thoughts. Think of it as a great conversation, and that is something that we can all benefit from; mental health issues or not.",30Jul2018,4
96,Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I want to stop taking Paxil. Thankfully I’ve only been taking it for 2 weeks at 10mg but I read about withdrawal symptoms. Is it likely that I will get these considering I haven’t been on the pill for a while? ,30Jul2018,1
97,"As an introduction, I have no history with mental disorders, and as far as I’m aware neither has any of my family. I’ve had 2 panic attacks though but that was probably from stress

Today I was playing on my computer, only to hear my friend. At first thought I probably had forgotten to disconnect from a discord server, but it wasn’t even open in the background and he wasn’t online either. I took my headphones off and heard his distinct voice again, but it was all incomprehensible. This happened probably 3x for ~5 seconds before I jumped up out of chair scared shitless.

What is this related to? Should I see a doctor?",30Jul2018,1
98,"A lil background information, very recently had a terrible break up, have had a lot of stress and sickness. I do have anxiety and depression.  Ok so about an hour ago something weird happened. I feel like fast and not myself, I feel hot, and I keep saying my thoughts out loud to myself. I’m not sure what is going but it feels wrong like somethings wrong. This has happened to me before like four times in my life.   I know it’s not a panic attack because it just isn’t the same. I don’t know what it is or how to stop it. ",30Jul2018,1
99,"I've been very stressed out over the past few months, and because of this I have become increasingly unstable. It broke down a lot of my confidence, but the way that I thought about it was that my mind had delved into a very strange territory. I'll explain it as I see: Skip back a full year, to when I was very stable and confident, I think there were activities and mental comforts that helped stop me drifting into unhappiness, stress or anything else. But, when those comforts are put aside your mind drifts into that area. What that area is very hard to explain, but it feels like all negative emotions just swarm and take a hold. You become very easy annoyed, saddened and the slightest hint of stress is met with shortness of breath and sweating. It's unfair, however, to say that this is all that happens. There are mood swings too, ranging from feeling much more assertive and intelligent, feeling euphoric and feeling, as pretentious as it sounds, more ""awake"" to the world, which was kind of what I was trying to escape to. As I've explored this kind of mental map more, I am now able to willingly change moods and other traits, but carry two things to each place: depravity (as in being completely engrossed in the wrong things and having somewhat narcissistic thoughts), and the same sense of humor that I've had for as long as I can remember. Staying depraved is probably what allows me to ""shift"" between moods, but I can honestly go from complete lack of emotion on all fronts to having it just fly out. I really doubt that this can be attributed to anything many other people have experienced, it seems like a rarity mixed with a bit of the placebo effect, but even if I don't get that response, this could be of interest to someone, at least.",30Jul2018,1
100,"About 4 and a 1/2 months ago I went on a Xanax binge for week taking 6mg daily. When I stopped I experienced the normal withdrawls: derealization, depersonalisation, 1 manic episode, anxiety, sleep problems... ect. 

The problem is I still have severe derealization and depersonalisation, which is very strange considering short time span of of my use. Also after a short time using the supplement 5-htp I developed what I can only describe as regular manic episodes. They come once or twice a day and last about 1 to 2 hours. They don’t feel like your traditional manic episode either. I feel overwhelmingly stimulated as if I have taken to much Ritalin or adderall, but instead of feeling euphoric I just feel flat, depressed and anxious. 

Does anyone have any idea what’s happening to me? I think I might be going crazy.

Currently I’m treating my symptoms with cbd oil which is working very well in reducing the severity of my manic episodes. I plan on going to the doctor soon I’m just very busy a work at the moment and my symptoms aren’t currently severe enough to greatly effect my every day life.",30Jul2018,1
102,"i feel like who i am when i’m alone is my true self (called blue) and who i am with other people is just someone else (red). when ‘i’ speak i try to stop myself from continuously talking or talking about something i don’t want to talk about but i can’t stop as if i’m trying to control someone else. i am a huge introvert, and don’t really like all the people that red hangs out with (who is a massive extrovert). i feel completely suffocated and stifled by this massive and obnoxiously loud personality and i don’t know how to stop it
i would really like someone else who experiences this or knows anyone who experiences this too (any tips would be really appreciated) ",30Jul2018,3
103,"Hi ok so I was prescribed sertraline earlier today. I kinda expressed concerns to my GP about previous hypomanic episodes, and the possibility of bipolar, and she said if I had any negative symptoms to come back.

I took it like maybe 12 hours ago, for the first 8 I felt nauseous and exhausted and then suddenly I was going for a run down my street at midnight, I literally haven’t left my bed in days, I’ve been depressed for over a month. I called my friend and like I couldn’t hold a conversation, to the point he had no idea what I was saying.

Idk if it’s psychosomatic and I’ve convinced myself this, but it’s come out of nowhere and I’m genuinely terrified. It’s more intense than any other hypomanic episode I’ve had before.

Has anyone had anything similar? Is this normal for when you first take Zoloft? 

I’ve called 111, they suggested waiting till tomorrow to see my GP? But I don’t want to like go in and then like be told this is a common side effect ??",30Jul2018,2
