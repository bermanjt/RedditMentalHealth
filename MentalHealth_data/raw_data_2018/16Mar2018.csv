0,"I consider myself to be somewhat intelligent and more deeply looking into things like politics, society and economy. the problem with this is, it takes away any possiblity for me to enjoy things.

I'll give you an example, it was during our lunch break as one of my colleagues said he thought it was cool what rdj did with Marvel about infite war (that new Marvel movie) about releasing it early for the world. everyone was like wow thats awesome, great guys... all i could think was, yep thats called Marketing and pr. decisions like this are most likely not ""fan service"" but rather planned and staged actions.
this happens to many things in my daliy life and it makes it just more misserable. I feel completly detached from everyone around me (depression and self image issues are not helping). no empathy nor sympathy, just nothing.
Now to my question, how could i become blissfully ignorant? How can i stop myself from questioning everything and just accept everything as it is.
I see so many people watching stupid casting shows, basically public shaming and they seem to enjoy it. I always ask myself how are they doing it? How can they turn off their brain and enjoy these shows?
If this is my life, i would rather be stupid, simple and could atleast pass time more quickly with nonsense activities.",16Mar2018,1
2,"Honestly, I give up on psychiatrists. I had 3 psychiatrists actually diagnose me with schizophrenia while all the voices in my head were in fact my thoughts. They gave me meds which made me have harsh side effects and made me gain weight, evetually become very VERY depressed about it. I was also forced to take meds by my friend (I am living with him) so I had no choice. When I told my psychiatrist that the meds I am taking made me gain 3 KG, he used to say ""Oh 3 Kg is not a lot anyway"" I gained 9 Kg in total. Whenever I wanted to stop my meds, Me and my friend get into huge fights. I then had to go to a professer that told me that I didn't even need meds. but my friend was insistant on taking meds, so again I was forced. I am forever traumatised by hospitals, ER, psychiatric wards and psychiatrists. I will never see them again. ",16Mar2018,10

I'm more able to manage my symptoms without meds, only two meds I take regularly are Elavil and Seroquel, both are for sleep, but I take Elavil primarily for chronic migraines. Anyway, my boyfriend tells me that I zone out a lot, sometimes I notice it and sometimes I don't notice at all. A lot is usually on my mind but I'm distracted a lot, which usually helps. Any advice?

4,"After years of anxiety, add (which I'm not even sure if I believe in), and depression and numerous unfortunate events and existential crisis I decided to see a psychiatrist because I'm pretty much suicidal without actually wanting to die (look it up Issa ting).

Today I had my first appointment and did my intake with this well intentioned and well educated therapist. I was pretty much pre diagnosed (still need to take test and see psych) with Bipolar Polar. I'm not sure if I quite agree with that I've studied and researched BP before and all thought I'm not a licensed medical professional (I am a pre med bio major tho) I truly feel as tho I don't exhibit the symptoms. I've also known even before I knew the term I had massive anxiety, add and depression cause by my anxiety and life I general. I've never truly been happy but I've always been able to feign happiness or I'm happy when I'm sufficiently distracted ie via sports, media, books, relationships, etc. When I fall into my funks it's simply me no longer have the energy nor desire to go through my standard life routine or maintain my facade.

I think anxiety is my biggest issue but the rest of my problems stem from my pessimistic view on life becauses at some point I became agnostic and nihilistic. It's only agnostic and not atheist cause I still cling to some hope there's more to all this but my logic has deduced based on occams razer there isn't and that's where my problem lies. The human brain / ego provides defenses for us so we can go thru everyday life. Due to my nihilism I feel I've broken thru those defenses and am at a point where I'm simply like what's the point and my life has essentially become waiting to die but wanting to enjoy life in the meantime but not being able to because of my circumstances. Because of my anxiety and overanalzyation of ever single possible thing I have a some what cognitive dissonance when it comes to life and I see this more as being hyoer aware or what I'm calling for lack of better terminology hyper sanity. Basically I'm kinda feeling like Jim Carrey during that red carpet interview. ",16Mar2018,1

We’re conducting research on gender differences in alcohol use among college students as a way to cope with emotions. This will help us point to the need of greater alcohol control policies (in terms of access, availability, pricing marketing), modifying the role of campus culture, challenge media-driven messages of acceptability of alcohol tolerance and reinforce personal values and consistent rules across gender and health campaigns.

When I go to bed I have terrible nightmares about seeing my family get shot, or being drugged and unable to stand up-- sleep isn't even guaranteed peace anymore.

I've struggled with mental health since age 12. I should be on medication, but my psychiatrist lives too far from my school to get a refill, and I don't want to live my life dependent on a pill anyways.

23,"Back in November of 2014 my grandmother, who was 93 at the time, had a major stroke that destroyed 1/4 of her brain and brought on pretty severe dementia. My dad made the decision that she was to come live with us because we had an extra room and could help her. So began the most difficult year of my life. I was 23 at the time and really just starting to experience life outside of school. I had graduated from college the June prior and was trying to find out what I wanted to do with my life. My nana had been one of my best friends, my confidant. I could tell her absolutely anything, we joked about things most people wouldn’t dream of joking about with their grandma. That changed when she had her stroke. The close bond I had with her disappeared. I had to watch my best friend slowly decline over the course of a year. She had many episodes/mood swings where i was the target. I was called an evil witch... I had to put baby locks on my bedroom and bathroom door because she would barge in without knocking and I was terrified of waking up to her standing over me in my sleep. In fact, sleep wasn’t easy. I stayed up late listening for her to make sure she stayed in her bedroom. At the same time I had to have the tv on because I was so afraid that if she did leave her bedroom she would fall down the stairs and die and that my dad would blame me that I didn’t stop her because my room was the closest and therefore i should have heard her so i wanted a ready excuse. She finally passed away 3 days before my birthday in 2015, a little over a year after the stroke changed her. I just can’t seem to get over this. I still find it hard not to have the tv on in my room at night. I stay up way too late. I’ve basically become a shell of what I was... I lack the motivation to do the things i used to love, like exercise, read, etc. I’m at my breaking point. I hate the person that i have become. I’m lazy, pretty much go out of my way to avoid any physical work. I’m not sure if this is all connected to having to help take care of my grandma, but I so desperately want to change. I really don’t know what to do... I have tried a therapist but she said she really didn’t see what the problem was. I just want my old life back, I want to go back in time, stop my dad from ever having my grandma come live with us.... I’m not really asking anything here, I just desperately needed to vent and felt like people here would understand as none of my friends seem to. 

TL:DR- grandma with dementia lived with my family for a year, changed me for the worse and now i hate the way I have become. Don’t really know what I can do, been to therapist, but basically told nothing was wrong. Just wanted to vent. ",16Mar2018,1
24,"I am 18 and I am currently in my first year of college. Lately I have been experiencing my emotions differently. The earliest example I can think of would be starting in my junior year of high school every once in a while my emotions would feel muted. Kind of like when water gets in your ears and everything sounds far away, that’s what it felt like, my emotions where too far too feel them to the extent I normally would. The distant feeling lasts anywhere between a few hours to a few days, maybe even a week or two. Lately it’s been happening more and more and starting near the end of last summer I experiencing episodes of extreme sadness, I think it would be safe to label it as depression I felt disconnected from everything, things that would normally have me in stitches could barely get me to crack a smile. I was easily irritable and my friends noticed quickly and they seemed off put by it because it was nothing like my normal cherry disposition. In January there was a week where I felt on top of the world my mood was great better than it had been in months maybe years and I was just jittery constantly bouncing from thing to thing, I couldn’t concentrate unless there was considerable background noise, I couldn’t keep still always fidgeting. Then I slowly started crashing it seemed like my energy was gone completely I didn’t want to leave my room, I didn’t want to go to classes, I didn’t want to eat. One night I just started crying, I didn’t know why, my thoughts were racing and I was curled up on my bed and I just started chanting to myself why can’t I be normal, all I want is to be normal, why am I so fucked up. I had a few suicidal thoughts but I kept them at bay by thinking about my family. I haven’t had any instances since where I’ve been at such a high point before falling but I have noticed my emotions will start to go high before tipping back down again. 

Is this something that people just go through within there lives or is this something I should go and see a professional about? Any advice would be appreciated.",16Mar2018,2

33,"So I’ve been debating posting anything here. I’ve been a lurker for quite some time.. but I feel as if I don’t know where to turn and would love some outside input. 

I’m a 24 F living in the US with a rough abusive childhood growing up and multiple medical problems. I suffer from fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, and now an in the works autoimmune disorder. Also suffer from depression that can’t be treated with medication due to all the meds I’m on for other medical problems more pressing. 

All this combined has left me pretty friendless my entire life. I just couldn’t hold on to friends between the abuse at home and my medical problems. 

Because I couldn’t make any friends I always gravitated towards a boyfriend. He would be my circle. His friends would be my friends. But of course breakups happen and when you reach that point I was never chosen to stay friends with. 

Fast forward to today, and I’m in a loving supportive relationship which for the first time is healthy compared to my other ones. But he was the first guy that didn’t come with friends. We’ve been together for 4 years and have both struggled with making friends. 

I suffer from depression, and he suffers from a lot of mental illnesses. In the 4 years we’ve been together I’ve tried really hard to make friends. I’ve gone to meet ups, I’ve tried making friends with coworkers, and nothing ever sticks. They’re all superficial and don’t last long. 

I’m at the point now where I tried going to therapy about my mental state and just didn’t feel like my past trauma and current mental state was worth going to therapy for. It didn’t help that both therapists I tried didn’t seem to care about what I said. My insurance only covers the one practice in my area and I tried both the woman there...the rest are men and I don’t do therapy with men. 

But both times an inner circle was brought up. I told them both that I literally have none. The people in my life are family that live far away, my mother and my boyfriend. And really my family doesn’t count because they don’t get mental health problems. 

So I’m here to ask, what else can I do to find friends? Are there support groups online for depression? Or even just finding friends online? 

I’m so depressed and just feel that having more than just my boyfriend as someone to talk to is needed. 

So sorry for the long book, but I’m getting hopeless and thought maybe posting here might yield some good advice.

I'm wanting to learn some therapy techniques so that I can better help people in my life that I care about. I know the worth of seeing a qualified therapist and I am not trying to replace that, but becoming a more rounded and helpful person won't hurt. 

For example, someone I care about beats themselves up for hours and gets upset after making a mistake at work. I want to be able to help them calm down after making a mistake, and perhaps even help them in the long run to make it less of an issue. The advice I read online is stuff like ""focus on the positives"". But in reality, that doesn't really allow me to help my friend. Actionable directives are great, not fluffy advice.

I am wondering what resources/topics would be best researched. Perhaps even some books that help give people a firm understanding of some of the basic concepts?

39,"The situation:
My best friend grew up in a terrible situation - parents were meth heads, was left alone for weeks at a time, parent are both in prison now. We graduated HS in 2007 and he has since had an incredible career in the Army. He just got out after 10 years and the Army sent him to see a psychologist. He fits the description for being ""manic"". The Docs put him on Zoloft and Adderall and now he is 1) acting bipolar/schitzo. 2.)trying to leave his wife for no real reason. 3) trying to buy a 500k house (hes a student with less than 50k saved). 4) a bunch of other things that are 100% not in his normal character. 5) can very easily become confrontational and violent.

Other observations:
1. he's extremely confident for some reason. Always bragging about things that he normally would never.
2. he's very hot/cold. can blow up, go to mega chill, then blow up again in a matter of minutes. He has done this to me and his other best friend who lives near him.
3. Dr prescribed him adderall (I think my friend knew the symptoms and lied to get a script).
4. I think leaving the Army has caused him to go into an identity crisis. He was very successful while he served - green beret and was known as a badass. He did not see combat.
5. he stays out downtown until 3am almost every night. he says he ""needs his freedom right now"".

My questions:
I occasionally take adderall myself, so I know what it can do to me. A lot of his behavior seems like it's adderall fueled. meaning he can get fixated on things and they consume him. He 100% does not need these meds. I think I can convince him to flush them. His wife tells me that ""I'm the only one who can get through to him"". I believe this for the most part. I really need guidance here. I'm terrified for him. He's a tough guy that never backs down, and I'm worried that he could do something dumb and get himself hurt or in trouble.

42,"So let me start with a lot has happened this past couple of years where I knew I was on a deep dark descent. I'm stuck in this cycle, where I know my issues, I know the steps I have to take, and I succeed for a few days whether its nofap, eating healthy, or just having simple old discipline, and then I fall off a fucking cliff. Seriously guys one look at my bedroom and you'll know I have issues. It is so messy and I'm too lazy to really clean it and repaint the walls or better yet even consistently do my laundry. I have no structure whatsoever and I'm just trying my best to take things day by day.

So the main reason I'm writing, I have this female friend since highschool. We were always friends and nothing more, but there was always something on my end, and she said she felt something too back then. When I first met her there was an attraction and somehow we managed to stay friends after high school. At some point I didn't see it as a friend zone anymore because I legitimately saw her a best friend/girl I flirt with. Through all these years she was always 10% focused in college which I respected, so never hung out a lot even tho she lives 10 minutes away with a car. So we usually just text/facetime all the time. But I always noticed she found time for other friends and other guys.. and I think I'm just now realizing that our friendship might've morphed into something very unhealthy for me. Even tho we are just friends, and we both openly admitted there was sparks of something more, we never made that leap. But I still feel some kinda way whenever I see her hanging out late on snap even tho she almost never makes that time for me. I also think because of the dark place I've been in, my mind is in constant conflict about her. She's like my best friend and not my girlfriend but I get jealous when she's out with guys? How does that make sense? I honestly think somehow I made her into something she's not in my head, because we're so close and other then my mom, co workers, she's the only real woman in my life. But is that healthy? I don't think that's fair to her,  Idk now I just feel like I'm rambling, I guess I just want to know from you guys to really work on myself and not completely mentally fall apart, do I let go of a friend who I've known for 10 years..Or am I trippin and being too self involved? Any advice would be appreciated. I'm also figuring out if my insurance covers therapists because I think I got to the point where I need professional help, weed is cutting it anymore.

My moods are extremely changeable, and they often change to quite unpleasant things. I'm ridiculously sensitive to rejection, and any minor form can ruin my day. I can hardly bear to be in public sometimes, because I have no self esteem, and hate being looked at (however, my self esteem is also incredibly changeable). I often have a vague but very strong feeling that everything is totally fucked. A lot of the time, I also have a weird sort of flatness. I'm not necessarily actively miserable at such times (though I'm certainly unhappy), just nothing makes me happy, or elicits any real amount of emotion. When that happens, I have very little energy, don't want to talk to my friends, don't want to do work, nothing. I just sort of vegetate. 

I also occasionally enter this weird state of extreme self-loathing. It happens less often now, but I used to sit for protracted periods of time fantasising about suicide. Not as a release from suffering, but just as some sort of punishment. I'd try to imagine dying, what my own corpse would look like and so on. I once came somewhat close to pretty serious self mutilation. I'm not sure I could have gone through with it, but I was possessed by this very strong urge to stab my eye out with a pen. I suppose I felt I deserved it, for being so useless.

I sometimes fantasized about suicide to get away too, but it was always sort of in the abstract. I would think ""this is probably the best option available"", but I was never quite ready to actually try. I came a little closer than in the past today, since I actually sat for a while and though about how I might do it. I wasn't sure I was going to, but the fact that there is a pack of razor blades in my house, and that I would be alone for a few hours weighed heavily on my mind. I probably wouldn't have done it even if my mood hadn't improved, but it's still a little concerning.

I avoid people, even when I don't really want to. My best friend will sometimes follow me out of the canteen at school, and I'll just walk away and hide in the bathroom, even though I know it's the wrong thing to do. From there, when left alone, I will generally enter the 'flat' moods I mentioned before. Sometimes it will be the other kind I mentioned though.

I spent a lot of today (before I entered the weird mood) with just a weird sort of anxious discomfort. I spent the whole morning muttering ""it's okay"" to myself, like you would to a scared cat. When my self esteem is low, I'll also spend a lot of time just willing people not to notice me. I could spend all of my time out in public just thinking as I look at each person around me ""don't notice me, don't notice me"".

I'm seeing a therapist for the emotional abuse I got as a kid, but I don't really feel comfortable telling her about the vast majority of this stuff. I don't want to be sectioned or anything. Although she seems to think that I have some genuine issues, though I haven't talked to her about my current problems really, only social anxiety-type problems and my dad's treatment of me.

The worst part, for me, is the lack of consistency. I felt horrific today, and spent some time imagining my own slit wrists. However, by the evening, I feel perfectly normal. Yesterday I spent most of the day in a similar mood, but by midnight I felt strangely joyful. I feel like a total hypochondriac because of this. I often wonder if I make myself feel worse intentionally because of some weird victim complex or something. Also, I feel perfectly normal the vast majority of the time. If I'm not left alone by others for too long (which is a sort of rejection, which is a contributing factor for this stuff), I'll feel perfectly normal the vast majority of the time. As such, I never know what's wrong with me, other than the fact that I'm probably exaggerating my own problems. For example, when in one of my bad moods, I'll listen to music, but will actively avoid happier music, which could make me feel a little better. I think that at those times, I feel like being in a state of  misery is the only truthful way to exist. That if I feel okay, it's only because I'm intentionally avoiding the hard truth that I'm going nowhere and am a useless person. Basically, it feels like I'm finally seeing the truth, so I don't want to go back to feeling alright. Other times, I feel perfectly normal. Not hopeful- I never have, but I feel fine.

I just don't know what, if anything, is really wrong with me. I haven't really gone into much detail about some of my problems, because I can't make this post infinitely long. I just don't know if I'm somehow making things up, or if I really do have serious issues- or what those might be, *or* how I should be dealing with them. I've read over this mess too much now, so I'm just sending it out as is, sorry.",16Mar2018,2
54,"Recently I have been going through things at work where it seems like I am having an uphill battle getting back to normal after being out from work due to mental health reason. I was on leave a little bit then when i was back I found I still had trouble working so I decided I might benefit from dropping down to part time hours. The switch was easy and approved almost immediately. It didnt help and i went back out on medical leave for a couple months. When i came I was better, as good as can be. After working for a bit a pursued the idea of going back up to my full time since I couldnt afford to be on part time in the first place. My work(people who can or wont approve the change) say i have to consistently have high performance stance for awhile before they will even ""consider"" giving my hours back. My stats were never an issue before and i was never pushed to exceed stats, but now its being dangled like an unobtainable goal for me to keep my livelihood. What are people's opinions on this? Am i being discriminated against because of being out on medical leave?",16Mar2018,1
55,"Choice to have children: the thought of a small screaming terror that doesn't let me sleep or do anything I want who needs all my time and money is horrifying.  But also the thought of living in middle age and beyond without a family sounds so terrible and regret able.  Basically both options sound fucking awful and I just don't know what to do and would rather just not have to live. 


Career: in my late 20s and struggling with career choice.  I went to teacher school but the idea of teaching and being around only young people with underdeveloped minds sounds soul crushing but the idea of working any other job where you literally only get two weeks off a year sounds just as bad.  Literally all I want is time to relax and wait to die without having to do shit for other people.  


Hobbies/shit I kinda like: I have hobbies and stuff I do occasionally but will it really fulfill me for life?  No. There's no point to anything.  Yes doing stuff makes you happier but why?  What's it worth?  It's all just fake happiness that doesn't actually make the world better I'm just living here sucking up resources and not helping anything.  


The background: 
I had severe depression for years in the past that really sucked the life out of me and was unbearable and prevented me from keeping my job. Constant sobbing, couldn't leave my house, couldn't see a point to life and felt I was a resource eater with no purpose. Hated myself. I went on generic zoloft for a few years and I liked it temporarily but I started to feel fucking crazy. Like all my depression was there and I still felt hopeless and pointless but also like I couldn't stop smiling and I came across like a psychopath.   I eventually moved and started over and it helped a bit but now it's been about two years and I'm feeling these symptoms again.  Lack of sex drive.  Extreme tiredness all the time.  Not seeing a point to anything whatsoever.  And most significantly,  dreading the future.  The idea of continuing to live sounds like such a chore and I'm freaking out.  Am I falling back in to depression?  

What can I do to prevent myself from falling back to my depressive state?  

Edit: it's been a little over two years since I moved and started over in a new city. I haven't been depressed here yet. Probably just because it's been new and that's occupying my brain.  I think about moving again but I can't live my life on the go.  I want to feel comfortable and safe in a permanent home. ",16Mar2018,4

57,"Hey everyone. I hope you're well. My girlfriend and I suspect that she might have some kind of personality disorder and I'm pretty sure I need some help too. To keep things brief, she experienced a terrible childhood and us difficulty controlling her emotions. 

The trouble is that little things can sometimes set her off in different ways, extreme sadness or anger sometimes apathy. Sometimes she'll feel so terrible, just because and it can colour her entire day. Today she said she just felt miserable and everything was horrible. She has also said before, after losing her temper that she feels like it would be better if she wasn't around.

I've found a therapist and we're going to see them. I don't really know what to do to help her, she says that I'm the only thing or person that makes her feel better and I feel like I can't always do that, I can't always be helpful and strong, I feel like I'm cracking. I want her to be happy and for things to get better, I just needed to vent a little.

If any of you wonderful people could give any kind of insight or experiences I would appreciate it greatly. 

Thanks for your time and greetings from South Africa!",16Mar2018,2
59,"I guess some background is required so: I am a 18yo male, about to finish (hopefully) the 12th grade, living with parents a good life not missing on anything essential, having plenty of opportunities in all kinds of things. Basically a really good life in the eyes of many I suppose...

PS I have a different outlook on life from others and therefore spend a lot less time with friends as I do not drink, smoke or don't understand and can't enjoy some of the things that most people enjoy (like dancing).

The problem is that I make some choices in life that I know are bad for me and that I will clearly regret a lot of them in the future, as already I regret a lot of past decisions... Yet I keep making such decisions.
It sometimes seems that all my problems are self created in my mind, as if because I don't have too many in life I so to speak - create my own problems... 
The most recent example is very cliche, but it shows the problem perfectly...
So there is a girl I like and it is quite clear, atleast from my pov, that she likes me too.
And from that I conclude in my head that the right thing to do would be to ask her out or atleast spend more time with her. If she says no, I would be happy knowing the answer and ending constant distractions which are mainly me thinking of her. If she agrees I'm happy because I get to spend time with her. Yet I constantly don't do anything although the outcome of an action would always be positive.
 
PSS In this example fear might explain some parts yet I make similar decisions in places where fear doesn't exist for me like working in an incredibly well paying job, or just studying, I can do it, it would be good for me, I chose not to do it and end up miserably feeling about myself.

So I wonder if there is a scientific explanation for this behavior, or any tips how to stop such self destructive behavior, or maybe what is the root of such or maybe similar problems and how are those usually solved?

I will gladly answer any questions and thanks for any advice!",16Mar2018,1
60,"where do i even start? well if you are reading this i appreciate it, if you last the whole post then hats off to you.
I am a horrible person, toxic and self absorbed. I have depression, anxiety and.. i don't like this bit.. bpd. 
I always think im under attack or people are against me, i feel like as soon as something is not going well with someone then they must hate me, i mean in my head i do not see why they wouldnt. 
I cause arguments between me and my girlfriend because i get so defensive and again, feel like im under attack if theres even a hint of criticism. I dont let things go, i drag things out when they dont need to still be talked about. i create tension because i go silent, i go silent because in my head theres so many things rushing round. i almost become paralysed and freeze instead of just sorting things out. I think its pushing my gf away and i know its at least a huge drain on us. we are long distance too so it only adds to the stress. my thoughts become so irrational and when ive calmed down and thinking properly i can see how ridiculous i am being. im paranoid, i feel like people stare, i feel like they judge(i know everyone does to some degree but i mean like, really judge) and i feel like i dont deserve anything less. i dont blame people for thinking what they do, im sure i would if i saw me.. im a drain on everyone i know, burden is a good word but an understatement.
i havent properly self harmed in about 4-5months and its getting really really really really hard to not give in to urges. i find myself  fantasising about it often throughout the day and its often extreme. most of the day, everyday the urges are eating away at me. i have a hard time trying to fight it. soon i will be starting an 18month MBT course through the personality disorder service in my area, before i begun i was told i need to work on reducing my selfharm. i was self harming a lot and for ties it would be daily but i have, like i said, stopped anything i would consider self harm, im scared im going to ruin my chances on this course if i cant keep urges at bay. 
I am in recovery from an eating disorder too. this is becoming/has become an increasing issue too. i want to go with those thoughts, i want to go with the unhealthy ED behaviors so desperately but i know this cant happen. i mean it can, i know it can but for my own sake, for my gf's sake i cant let it takeover. im being torn in two completely different directions. one is safe and one is selfish. i feel torn, i cry about it and i feel so much hatred for my body, for what i put in it, for what i see all this eating is doing to me. this isnt about being thin, this is about so much more, i dont know if i want to go into that right now. i dont even know if explining would be of any use... 
I hate me. I hate how i look. I hate my face. I hate that my scars have faded so much. I hate how my head works. I FUCKING HATE ME.
i dont feel like me. or i do but i feel like in my head is not the person i am. i feel like im sat way way back watching from the back of the room while my body is what is seen. i stare at myself in the mirror and i dont feel like that thing looking back, i mean its me but i dont really feel like it is. the person looking back is an imposter? maybe they are but no one knows and or would ever believe that. then i remember, ive never fitted in, its not about to suddenly feel like i do and that the face people see is what i deserve to have to deal with.. but  hate hate hate it. 

this post is more of a venting/ranting post i guess and it probably doesnt make too much sense. I not sure what i hope to gain by this.

61,"so uh. idk why i experience this so i thought i would ask for advice here

for most years of my life i can remember most of what happened. as in if you said “hey remember (x thing that happened during 2008-2013 or 2015-now) i’d be like “yeah that was crazy lmao”. but for the life of me i cant remember SHIT from around 2014. 

what i do know is that during that year i was severely homicidal, dissociated a lot, and had an abusive relationship during some months. but when people ask me “hey remember (completely memorable thing from 2014)” i’m like “wtf no”. when i look back on posts i made from 2014, i dont remember a lot of it.
