0,"So basically for over a year now i’ve been doing rituals as in checking things all the time etc. 
Let’s say i have to put an alarm on i have to always read the numbers of the time of the alarm 24 times in patterns of 6, so i do it six times, short break, and then 6 times again. And i have these ”rituals” in many things such as taking water from a tap, but there are number patterns that i have to do them with, and the numbers are: 2,3,4,6,8,12,24,48. I’m also worried that if i don’t check the things someone might get hurt, i’ll accidentally hurt myself or i don’t wake up etc. Example for this is lets say the door to my room is open, but i get worried that my cat might go there and eat a medicine pill even tho my cat would be outside, so i close the door, but then i’m like what if the cat is actually inside my room and i go in and check every corner until i feel ok that it’s safe. Those are examples of what i have to deal with. I’ve been wondering that should i go to a professional to if i have something or is it just some crazy and stupid thing?",14Jul2018,3

5,"I have a friend in his late 20s who can be kind of intense at times. He acts pretty calmly from what I've seen, but once he gets to his worldview you see why one would call him intense. 

He used to be depressed when he was younger and attempted suicide a few times. He told me that he used to write dark stuff at that age about the world being destroyed by his hand. He told he actually wanted to find a way to gain power then basically destroy everything and everyone. He said it was that or killing himself.

Apparently at some point his worldview changed. He now ""wants the world"" and to see it grow (this includes silly stuff like having a harem *eye roll*). He says he'll either shine like the sun (something like that I can't remember) and get the lofty things he wants and the world or he'll kill himself. 

He's pretty obsessive, especially with philosophy because that's crucial to his ""mission"".

He can be kind of odd in person, sometimes speaking in an abrupt manner. I get the feeling when I'm with him that he's never quite there, he's lost in his thoughts. He's a pretty anxious person and gets angry about the fact that no one understands him. He believes only geniuses could understand him. But he's also polite and sociable and has a lot of friends/acquaintances.

I think he's mentally ill. I am mentally ill and have had friendships with other people struggling with mental illness. The thing with him is that he doesn't seem to think that there's anything wrong with his thinking.

Could he have some kind of personality disorder, based on what I described? Something else, perhaps? Or is he just... quirky?",14Jul2018,1

7,"Alright, this is gonna be a text wall so please excuse that...

My mind is split between two people, one is argumentative and the other “pacifist” the third person is Me, the person on the “outside.” I have no history of psychosis or anything like that, but ever since I was 6 I have had anxiety and when i turned 9 it branched off into depression (anxiety worsening as well) 
But that aside, I view myself as three people and when i talk to myself (in my head and out loud) I refer to myself as “we.” Like if I’m doing something I’ll say “Now we will pour the milk”

12,"So about 6 months ago I went out to a few bars. I was drinking quite a lot. I got really drunk...blackout drunk and my friend and I met 2 guys when we were out. 

They were friendly and conversational so I invited them back to my place to have a few drinks as the bars were closing. 

I was stumbling and falling over at mine and I remember the guys making jokes about how drunk I was. 

One of them followed me to my room and I knew what was going to happen and I consented. I was a virgin and I wanted to get rid of my v card. 

All was fine until that point. I don't remember much about the sex except for a few seconds of it. He was pretty rough and it wasn't a nice experience but like I said I consented to it. This part really isn't the issue it's that the next thing I know it's his friend on top of me instead of him. The first thing I did was punch the guy and he left.

Since then I have thought about what happened and I start to cry and have panic attacks despite it having been 6 months ago. I feel really disgusting that I had sex with 2 men....one after the other.

Do you think that I was raped or taken advantage of or that what happened was normal?

13,"I just got diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and i don't know how to feel. I am 28 year old female and am super anxious now knowing that certain moments in my life were actually manic episodes. (And so far I can only recall a couple and both caused my relationship to end (same person).)  I usually have depressive episodes, and so i've always just been diagnosed as depressed and have tried multiple antidepressants, none have actually done the job either. (I know, I know.... I will most likely need a mood stabilizer instead&amp; I am not looking forward to this trial and error thing again. )

Now I feel completely helpless knowing that i can have another manic episode at any moment and not know until its too late. And i will probably have to be admitted. 

I made an appointment with my DR for a week and a half from today. So wish me luck!

14,"I don’t know why I’m posting this, this is my first time on this sub and idk if I’ll get advice or if I need help or incite. 

sorry if this is long I’ll do a tldr

I’m an incredibly lonely and suicidal person running out of reasons to live. My daddy issues are affecting my relationships and friendships, I’m pushing everyone away and only making things harder for myself.
I guess I’ll start with childhood and work my way to the present. 
I was raised with a single mom and a lying bastard for a father. My father cheated and left my mom to start a new family when I was 2. When I was 5 it was really difficult for me to accept that he loved his family more than me and my mom. He was always months late with child support and hardly ever called. When he did he’d get my hopes sky high. I was 6 and still saw my dad as my superhero, and it really hurt my mom bc she saw through his nice words and she knew I’d be let down hard. And I was. Every single time it was ;
“only a few more weeks!”
Then the dreaded 
“Hey buddy, listen –
I don’t have the money/something came up/maybe next year”
He only came to one of my birthdays, and left an hour later without even telling anyone why.

Once elementary school started, I was dropped off at my grandparents house every morning and every other weekend where I spent most of my days entertaining myself in the basement. I recorded a bunch of mindless YouTube videos, played video games, with toys, stumbled upon websites i probably shouldn’t have, etc.
And after a while it was all I did, you know? Even once I went to back to my moms, I’d just be alone in my room playing games, toys, TV, etc. and it never stopped. 

[Fast forward]

Once I was 12 I was over the whole dad calling then contradicting himself routine.I never believed a single word, or had an ounce of trust for him. 
And what does he do? He fucks it up worse by actually buying a house near me. He lives here and I’m bouncing off the walls bc I can finally have that relationship with him I’ve always wanted. I could finally do all the things I could only dream of. Haha nope. Within 3 months he’s back in Florida. And I shit you not. His excuse was that his parents were too hard on his wife. Never mind he has 3 children dying to build a relationship with him. 3 children who barely even know who he is but hold him in such high esteem. Or at least did.. 
To this day, hardly know him or his new family.
[Fast forward]

I feel like this is where the downhill started. I was 13 and got my first laptop. From that day till now, it’s never been the same. After school I’d scurry up to my room, lock the doors, and spend every hour I could on that laptop. Some nights I wouldn’t even sleep. It wasn’t before long I joined e-communities, made internet friends, etc. 
My mom tried to get me to open up, to talk to her more, to go outside, to spend time with me. But I shut her out. Never listened. Told her she didn’t understand. normal teen stuff ig. And after a while I think she just gave up. She eventually stopped asking or anything and just let me surf the web as long as I wanted and whenever I pleased.
I’ve done, posted, and seen my fair share of horrible shit on the web. The internet culture began to mold me and I eventually became a different person. I lost my social cleverness and confidence. I became socially anxious and dismissive. Irritable especially. and for 6 years that’s how I spent my days. 
So many horrible phases and situations I put myself in. Trashy posts for attention. Bullying others. Trying to meet up and have sex with men twice my age. Things even now I find it so hard to forgive myself for.

My mom eventually found a new husband, but I never liked him or called him dad. I constantly lied to him, acted rude, and just never acted like he existed.. Never even gave him a chance. Even now, I hardly say more than a sentence to him every time I see him and call him by his first name. And I feel so bad for it.
She always asks I give him a chance and that he really wants to be a good father to me. But I just push them both away. I don’t know why, I just do.

Anyway so once high school started, I was still knee deep in internet culture, still terribly socially anxious. Sat alone at lunch on my phone every day. Didn’t know how to talk to girls at all, how to dress or carry myself like I should. I fell behind in school work bc I was more interested in my e-friends, weed, and long distant relationships. They say high school is the best and most memorable years of your life but I don’t remember them at all. Like seriously it just feels like an after thought. Everything does now a days I guess.

My mom eventually took me to a therapist when I was 16, where I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and autism (high functioning). I took fluoxytine for a few months but after a while I skipped taking them bc I felt emotionless whenever I did take them and I dropped therapy. (I shouldn’t have)

[Fast forward to present]

Now I’m 18 about to be 19, I’m in alternative school bc I fucked up my credits. I have little to no friends bc the only ones I had I’ve been pushing them away. I don’t live with my mom anymore, but I don’t feel the love from her anymore either. It feels I became too complicated to deal with so she just doesn’t anymore. I look at her Snapchat and she has her own family now with her husband and child. I feel like the black sheep and a total fucking failure.
I didn’t graduate on time (I was supposed to be a 2018 grad, now I’m graduating 2019 *hopefully*), I do a bunch of drugs to forget (mainly cannabis and psychedelics), I compulsively lie to my parents and girlfriend, my guy friends get turned off bc I get clingy and act immature/feminine, and I never help myself. I still just do what I did all those years ago. When the sun rises, I’m on my laptop. When things get hard, I'm on my laptop. When things are boring, I'm on my laptop. 
sometimes eat, sometimes bathe, sleep, rinse &amp; repeat. 
Just YouTube, Reddit, and video games.
I’m just stuck in a loop and i feel like I’m going mad.
I’ve had two meltdowns this past year, one in which I cut all my hair off and almost ended my life if it weren’t for my girlfriend, and another where I feel like I was in a temporary psychosis and just laughed and cried simultaneously, asking myself if I deserved love while burning myself. I know that sounds mad, and I’m so ashamed.

I still feel like I’m mentally a child. Like I’m still where I was at at 13 and still have so much to be taught and shown. I continue to isolate myself and just internet, internet, internet. For 12 years I've just been isolating myself and doing this, and I feel so alone. So lonely with no escape. Just white walls all the time. I’ve also been trying to be my own father but it’s been so hard bc I either discipline myself too harshly or not hard enough. And obviously there’s so much I can’t really teach myself. 

My mom told me 
“When I was your age, I had a decent job and already bought my own car. You’re nowhere near that.”

And I just felt so defeated and sad. And also frustrated. Like yeah well you had both parents to guide you to that point. Characters behind a screen raised me. 
It’s like they’re asking me to build a house without having the wisdom, knowledge, and discipline I need to do so.

Everyone’s trust in me has dropped to a 0. I compulsively lie and run away from my issues. *Just like my father*. I tell everyone I’m trying to better myself and I want to be better but their expectations aren’t too high. all I do is disappoint. 
I feel like I’m headed on a dark path, or even worse, becoming like *him*. I try to help myself but always always fail. I end up making the same mistakes and going back to what’s caused all of this. I want to end the cycle. I just don’t even know where to start anymore. What steps to take. I’m clueless. I’m a burden, just a parasite. 
I feel like ending it all would just be a load off on everyone. 
I just want to cry for Mommy and Daddy and have them tell me everythings going to be okay. I want a hug. I want to go backwards. But it's too late.
I think I need help.

15,"I feel like everybody in my life doesnt like me.I have moments where I feel like I am fake.It makes me stop in my tracks.I feel like people are disappointed in me and that Im a bad person. This causes extreme guilt. I sometimes have really bad suicide ideation. But it doesnt seem like a big deal when it is happening.It just feels like an emotion I have.  Then it goes away.It comes back so bad though.  I dont think it can be fixed with meds. I took them once and felt too euphoric. Like I was high. It lasted for a long time.My life is just kinda falling apart right now but it is great. I have these amazing moments. But they feel so temporary. Like they are cheap. 

When I am very happy I get suspicious. It usually means I am going to feel very disappointed. I have these really great feelings though, like I know secrets of the world. I get so disappointed that I cant pass the feeling. 

Then I have these feelings like there are people who watch me on my walk to school. They judge my outfits, my hair and my walk. They definitely think I act like an idiot. I walk too confidently. Im trying too hard. They think I do dumb things. Every walk feels like a mission. I cross random streets. Sometimes Im late for school because of this. I need to ignore it. 

Walking home from school is a mission too. I avoid many streets too. I walk with my friend but people definitely think I should not be his friend. They think Im stupid and desperate. I walk when he bikes on his bmx. (Its something else, Im protecting my anonymity). They think im too tall. 

I need to relax. I shouldnt think about it. I have good things. I know a bit about my past lives. I am also one of those people that can sort of manipulate things subconciously. For example a math test I was supposed to have was postponed for 3 days for no great reason. Then my teacher suddenly had to leave for the afternoon. A homework assignment was due. I asked for it to happen. That feeling of doing that stuff is beyond amazing. Im certainly on fates good side. 

People really dont believe me though. Apparently past lives dont exist. They certainly do. Ghosts exist too. There is more proof for their existence. I have experienced it myself. 

Wtf is happening? I dont understand right now.  I know a lot. I could write a book. I should do that. It would definitely help me not feel so depressed. Im gonna write everything. 

Im floating on air right now. I cant stop laughing right now. Im thinking of thjngs that happened earlier but Im thinking about my life.  Im foolish sometimes. 

I have so much potential in my life..my depression keeps me down.  Im levitating kind of. I feel light. I just want to forget it all.

16,"My 8 year old son told me tonight that he's been thinking about killing himself.  He's expressed two other times that he wanted to die, but usually in response to having to do something he doesn't want to do, like brush his teeth.  This time we weren't arguing over him doing anything, but were talking about how he gets upset sometimes.

**Family Background**: His father and I split up when he was two. He's an only child.  His father sees him regularly though he primarily lives with me. We have no formal court agreement on custody, because this has not yet been an issue. He stays weekdays over the summer with his dad, while we continue splitting weekends as normal.  His dad and I are both almost certainly on the autism spectrum though neither of us have been diagnosed.  Both of us have a history of depression (MDD) dating back to childhood/adolescence and his father once was on the verge of attempting suicide before military co-workers intervened.  There was definite neglect in the year prior to me ending the relationship with his father. I would frequently come home from school and work to find my 1.5 year old son naked and filthy and an over full diaper lying on the floor where my son had ripped it off himself, while my son's father was child-locked downstairs on his computer. Our arguments about that and his constant partying led to a few times of him recklessly swinging at me in front of our (then 2yo) son who was very confused and disturbed. (After we split, my son's father went to live with his parents who I trust to not neglect my son. Last year he moved into his own apartment.)

Another background issue is that I was in a serious relationship until two months ago with my ex-boyfriend who was spiraling out of control emotionally for months prior. My son was present for the very unexpected and intense break up. There was no physical violence thankfully, but my son was deeply shaken by it and upset with me that my exbf would no longer be in his life (we had spent 2-3 nights a month over the exbf's house with my son).   I am not currently dating nor looking to date at all as far as I can see.

My son has been suspected of having autism or adhd over the years by different childcare providers and the school guidance counselor. Unfortunately, my son's father has resisted seeking a formal diagnosis for my son, but did reluctantly agree to talk therapy about a year ago when our son was having behavioral issues at school.  His therapist recommended ending therapy around November after about two months of meetings because he seemed to be doing much better.
-----

**Now**, again, his angry outbursts seem to be increasing.  He was almost continuously angry and short tempered with me all day today at a fun park. Some of his angry reactions are spot on re-enactments of his father's typical angry outbursts that I remember from our previous 5 years together. Same phrases. Same tone. Same faces.

Driving home, I asked if he was angry with me in general for anything and he said he didn't know and couldn't answer. He then said that his dad yells at him a lot and when he gets yelled at like that it makes him feel like he's ""not special.""  Then later on at home we were talking about how he gets upset and he said that he sometimes wants to die. He said he feels that way sometimes when he gets yelled at.

Without trying to lead, I asked him if he ever thought about trying to die - to make himself die - and he immediately started telling and showing me how he would try to hold his throat (choking himself) when he was upset and trying to kill himself. He also said immediately after that he would ""*never* grab a knife and stab"" himself, while acting out stabbing his stomach, he just ""tried to stop breathing but stopped because he couldn't take it anymore.""  He said he didn't want to do anything that would hurt, but tried not breathing because ""it doesn't hurt.""

He said that he did this because he thought it would be easier and he feels sometimes that no one cares.  I told him that I, his daddy, each of his grandparents, and family and friends care very, very much for him and would be very, very upset if he were to ever die. I said that it was very important to me that he doesn't die and asked him to promise to not try to kill himself.  I told him that I am always here for him to talk with whenever he feels that way.

As he was going to sleep, he asked about my exbf and when he'll get to spend time with him again. I told him I don't know and asked if he misses him. He nodded his head yes and buried his face in his stuffed animal. He said he feels like something is wrong in my (Anabikayr's) life because we never see my exbf anymore.
-----

I plan to get him a child's emergency cell with my phone number and his dad's phone numbers programmed in.  When I told him this he begged me to *not* put his dad's number on there.  He's acted this way on other occasions when some minor thing was going on with him and I offered to talk with his dad about it.  I asked him to promise to call me if he ever feels that way again and absolutely before he tries to do anything again. 

I also plan to call the national suicide hotline (USA) during the daytime for more advice.

But I'm hoping some of you might have advice here too...

1) I don't know how to approach my son's father who can get aggressively defensive when it comes to implications of how he parents, and even worse when bringing up mental health for our son. His family tends to deny mental illnesses (and other negative things generally). My son's father has a terrible view of mental health care from his own experiences after his suicide planning. I need his signature/agreement for my son to receive any services or diagnoses from most mental health clinicians.

2) My mom suggested I offer to my son that he can come home early if he doesn't want to continue staying at his dad's through the summer. I know if/when I do so and if my son says yes, we risk a blow up from his father (screaming arguments galore). At worst this could translate to going to court for the first time, which worries me because my son's father comes from a well-to-do family, with far more resources than I or my working class family could hope to come up with.

3) What age appropriate things can I start doing asap with my son to help him deal with his emotions and respond better in situations that make him feel suicidal?

4) I know I'm completely fumbling how to help my son deal with my break up from my exbf. Any thoughts?

18,"THIS IS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT SO PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH ME!!!!!!


For the past 8 yrs i have wrestled with anxiety and depression. I have contemplated suicide, but never planned or attempted. Running away was seriously thought about. I have never been abused, or taken advantage of. Im 14 and non-binary (previously female)

I am now struggling to regain my sense of identity. Intrusive thoughts are apart of my daily life, along with severe paranoia about my parents snooping on my life (phone, room, and friends) I grew up in a conservative christian community from 04 to 09, till moving north and lived with my family and an older couple from the same community until 2014. This was very hard on me as i am an only child and was isolated from the outer world from kindergarten to 1st grade when I was homeschooled. After that i was enrolled in a small K-12 Christian private school, other than that i attended church, neither of these helped the isolation i helped, as the kids i became friends with mostly attended the small church we went to.

The older couple, while i felt a big bond too, were very judgmental, therefore i felt no desire to express my ideas or expressions. I still feel this way, and my anxiety gets in the way of things a lot, so even getting a new style of glasses (heavy lens prescription probs xD) or a hair cut is a really big thing for me. (and the others around me) After my family and the other couple parted ways, we moved to a small house. This was probably the most important thing to me at the time because I had never really experienced the freedom of not having to share my house with people that weren’t my family. 

2016 was a massive game changer for me. My depression became worse, and so did my anxiety. Fortunately, the previous year (5th grade)  i had made friends with a really awesome kid and we were now best friends, so that made things a wee bit better. But of course, stuff happens. 6th grade was the lowest year i have had, i was extremely insecure about my body, and eyebrows (still am!) and literally made myself do exercises at night so i “would have the perfect body” Looking back, I am so glad i never resorted to starvation cause that would have been the point of no return for me. That year was also the first and last time i will ever self harm and thats a promise. (no blood, just bruised my arm badly, also a promise)

Summer came, and 7th grade started. Before this, classes had all been in the same room, but this year was the first we would actually change classes. (private schools am i right) I was terrified of this, so bad in fact i would have anxiety attacks just thinking about it. And so the year started. My best friends parents had gotten a divorce during the summer, so she ended up homeschooling that year (they moved that December) So that really limited my social circle a lot, and for half the year i spent my lunches alone in the science class room. After winter break i joined a lunch table that my classmates ate at, and we formed a really good bond with 5 people there! (still good friends now!) 

8th grade passed by in a blink of an eye (2018) I discovered I was asexual (August) and later non-binary (January) of course i have never told anyone this. A new kid joined our circle of friends, and we all get along really well (sarcasm and morbid/twisted humor tbh) Our school was hit with tragedy back in October, and that really rocked everyone to the core, and overshadowed us the entire year. To be honest though this year I almost gave up several times... suicide was ever on my mind then, and my grades slipped from B’s to D’s to F’s (never was a straight A student) my parents and I were in constant arguments, and life was just a complete mess. I really learned how to deal with stuff though, and greatly appreciated two AMAZING teachers who never gave up on me (they don’t know this though) by the end of the year, I managed to get my failing math grade all the way to a A- and never felt better and prouder about that. 

I have to say, I am really proud I’ve made it this far, and honestly would not have been able to get here without my friends (who in fact no nothing about all this) they kept me going when all i wanted was to crumble to dust and blow away. I am doing a little better now, and staying strong. This has been a never ending struggle, and I doubt it will ever end, but I will not give up (thats another promise folks) My parents have never known how bad its gotten, and I’ve never been on meds or gone to therapy, I have had to be my own counselor the entire time.

19,"i'm honestly not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but this is the best place i feel like i can explain what's going on with me. 

first of all, i'm a very superstitious person, though not particularly religious (agnostic, raised jewish). i'm also a big believer in karma. i've had a lot of mixed luck over the years. i haven't been a good person, at least the person that i want to be.

  
i've had a bit of a rough childhood, being overweight and being made fun of for much of it and my parents tried their best, but fell short emotionally. any time i was depressed, it was a ""things will get better but it's your fault"" kind of thing. so i know that right there can cause problems. i honestly wished i would die when i was younger because i was just so sad, but maybe that was average angst.
 
but being a believer in fate and karma and such, i wonder if i've gotten off too easy and i'm about to be dealt a massive blow. i've had a few bad car accidents in the last couple of years i've survived. i've met and married the love of my life. but i keep having these intrusive thoughts that i'm going to die. that either i'm going to get sick and not know about it or something else. and they don't stop. and i'm honestly so scared. it doesn't help that we're living paycheck to paycheck and i know i need to go see a doctor to at least partially ease my mind. i feel like i'm losing my mind to almost irrational fears that i don't know are stemming from a deeper mental health problem or just a normal mid twenties existential crisis. if anyone can help, please. i feel incredibly alone and scared. my husband tries to help, but he doesn't understand.

Also, it’s usually when I’m out of my room, wandering about the house. It usually stops me from wandering around, getting chores done and such, since I feel around the corner someone could be there.

After this I found out info about the side effect of fainting and that I should have had a large breakfast the morning of the injection and not stand up too fast. I tried to apply this to my experience to explain it, and when I realised that I had a lump on my head and my friend informed me a lump was good as it meant there wasn’t internal bleeding I later passed this information on to my mum purely as saying I never knew that’s how it worked before. She had asked how I was feeling that day and I said I was feeling fine just very tired for short periods and then feeling ok but during the time periods I had to rest my head on the table for a bit and shut my eyes. She said you are always super tired. This annoyed me and she was annoyed at this point. I then find out this morning that my family just thinks I over think every situation and is so paranoid that I can’t carry on living like this.

29,"Hi so I’m making this post because I’ve been feeling strange for the past few months. 

Just for some mental health background I suffered from depression due to a life change approx 6 years ago and am since depression free (woo!) and I also suffer from general anxiety disorder. My anxiety typically affects me most with things such as feeling like everyone dislikes me and making me physically ill when something stressful is coming up (eg. On the way to a job interview). I missed almost a full year of school the year I was diagnosed with GAD because I was sick every day but it turned out to be anxiety not any physical illness. That being said I live with my anxiety very well (in my opinion haha.) I don’t let it prevent me from doing things so it really doesn’t hinder my life, if I’m feeling anxious about it I just force myself to do it anyways because I don’t want my anxiety to stop me. 

Aside from feeling that people dislike me, I would say I’m generally a happy person... I’m not sure though because of my current mental state I can’t really identify how I felt before? 

Ok so my current issue is that my mood changes are so constant and severe and I don’t know what it is or what to do about it. For example sometimes I’m so happy and feel so beautiful and will literally cry when I hear a song I like because it’s so good. Then the next day I’ll be sobbing in bed so feeling like I’m drowning in sorrow and loneliness for no reason. I go from feeling like I have amazing friends and an amazing life, boyfriend and family to feeling like I’m totally alone and worthless to everyone around me. Sometimes this happens within the same day.

I feel like my anxiety and the feeling that people don’t like me is what often triggers this change from happy to sad; although there many are times when there is no trigger that I notice. 

I would also like to note that I don’t think it impacts me in my performance at work (maybe once or twice but not usually) and that’s why I’m not sure if it’s just me being moody or some kind of mental health illness. I hope that makes sense (eg. my depression prevented me from living my life you know?)

I am not sure what it could be if it is a mental health issue. It sort of feels like bipolar disorder but I don’t think I display signs of being manic, just happy and naturally a loud and somewhat hyper person. My “happy” state has never gotten me in trouble (just shushed for being too loud and things like that) so I don’t think this is mania. I don’t feel invincible or anything like that. I just feel super happy, loved and beautiful.

So that’s it essentially.
I will not be able to see a doctor to discuss for a few weeks so I thought I’d ask reddit for now (just for some insight).

Trying to uncover what to do about/why I have severe mood swings, sometimes days or weeks long, sometimes within the same day. I feel happy, beautiful and loved 50% of the time and disgusting, useless, alone and unlovable the other half of the time.

32,"I’ve been suffering with anxiety and low self esteem for as long as I remember. I was always a shy girl and would cry over the way I looked even as a young child of 8.

I suffered with the same low self esteem through out secondary school and would get times of extremely low mood (not quite sure if I can call it depression) where I would shut myself in my room, sit in the dark and refuse to go to school. 

This carried on throughout my college years.

I then was in a 4 year mental abusive relationship which I have only become aware of recently after 3 years since breaking up from the relationship. 

Between those times I have been ‘happy’ or felt ‘normal’. I have an amazing family and have very close supportive friendships.

However, I am currently seeing you a counsellor because I have been suffering with depression for the last 6 months. Or from what I’m aware of anyway. I’m not sure whether I can see it more clearly now because I’m facing up to what I feel instead of masking my emotions. 
I have panic attacks and anxiety. I have mood swings. I get myself into a deep depression for days then get out of it. This isn’t a low mood. I feel empty and trapped. The typical symptoms of depression. Then I can spend days anxious and stressed. Other days I can be in a ‘normal’ state. Then this is the bit I’m confused about... 
I can also get into a state where i feel ‘wired’. It’s something that I have been suspicious of before but it doesn’t happen enough for me to mention it to the counsellor. I kind of feel like it may have been irrelevant because it doesn’t happen as often as my depression. So I feel stupid/embarrassed to mention it in case it is nothing. For a long time I didn’t take no notice of these moods because I just considered them ‘normal’ but looking back and analysing properly they seem a little strange. 

For example, the other day I became obsessed with the colour blue. I spent time in my room looking at things I could buy to decorate my room and spent hours doing so. That same night I stayed up until 4 in the morning writing a poem for my best friend and again it almost felt like I was wired. Time was passing by so quick yet I cannot tell you now exactly what I was doing for all that time. Everything seemed so fast paced. I also feel a slight sense of euphoria when I’m in these moods.
Now that I am out of that state it seems a little blurred. Like I can’t relate to how I was feeling and I get that same feeling as this when I’m in my deep depression state. It’s hard for me to explain to my counsellor how I felt when I’m not feeling it at the time. And my memory is awful. I forget things so easily. 

Over the past 6 months I have got into that wired state around 10 times (I’m not sure!) I can’t remember exactly. I remember on occasions I have felt ‘happy’ listening to music and dancing in my room but then suddenly I would get the urge to cry and feel so sad at the same time.

I have read about Bipolar II and the wired states I feel don’t seem to be so intense as what they describe online or happen often or long enough, yet something about how I feel doesn’t feel right. Like the normal diagnosis of plain depression and anxiety doesn’t cut it for me. I feel like it’s something slightly deeper and I can’t shake off that feeling. 

I feel so confused with everything. I am so scared to make the wrong move in case something triggers off a state of mood. 
I am worried that I am over thinking this situation and that those wired states are normal. Maybe I’m just desperate for a diagnosis for clarity.

I just wanted to get a view from a person that doesn’t no me from everything you have read. 

Thank you!

I've never been on this subreddit before but I figured it'd be a good place to address an issuer I'm having...(before someone inevitably asks, I do see a psychiatrist regularly, however the only doc in my area covered by my insurance is not very helpful). I am having a relatively disquieting issue... figure i ought to give  a bit of background info before jumping on in. I've struggled with overeating and weight issues my entire life. I'm 19 right now(getting ready to graduate from college :) ) ... in high school I weighed around 370lbs at 6'4 ft tall, and I was taking mood stabilizers for bipolar I. no matter how much I exercised, what I ate, counting calories /carbs/fat content/etc... I just couldn't seem to shed weight. Being a virgin at 16 yrs and being the laughing stock of my friend group, I began crafting a certain stimulant with a fairly easy one-pot method and consuming it to supress appetite. My friends and family certainly did not approve, but I did manage to lose upwards of 83lbs in just four months. I willingly stopped taking the mood stabliser toi avoid putting any weight back on, and I remained at my newfound weight for a couple of years. Sadly, I could not muster the willpower to ditch the stims, and I eventually became very unhealthy &amp; fell to a NASTY case of Stim. Psychosis. I willingly enter rehab after my friends and family expressed their extreme concern, was put on seroquel, and constant lethargy/appetite increase resulted in my gaining almost all of the weight bavk. This series of events ruined my depression and my mood, although I wasn't whacked out on drugs, declined steadily from then until now. welp,  I am back on my bullsh*t. picked a much less neurotoxic and physically taxing stim to start taking  a little over three weeks ago, and although I have lost about 23lbs in a single month and counting(if you think that's not possible, it most certainly is), sleep has been next to IMPOSSIBLE and  am starting to hear muffled explosions all around my head &amp; I keep seeing my childhood cat(who has been deceased for many years). I am well aware that what I am doing is unconscionably stupid, &amp; i am not looking for pity or advice. I simply would like to know if this could possibly lead to another breakdown. I apologize for my incpherent sentence structure and if I sound bitter its because I am very tired.

TL;DR- I have history of mental health issues, and I am hearing muffled explosions &amp; ambient distant music as well as seeing my cat everywhere who died when I was quite young",14Jul2018,2
36,"Hi, 

Met my friend (22F) at university. I have severe anxiety and have in the past, had suicidal thoughts but since having therapy, can manage my anxiety much better. She knows a bit about my anxiety and my past but we don’t talk about it a lot at all. Recently our work load has increased and she’ll often make jokes such as ‘ we have so much work, I want to kill myself’ or ‘ I’m never going to get this essay finished, I should just kill myself today’ and then laughs. She will also say these jokes in front of others who also laugh.  I’ve spoken to her a bit about it and said (in my opinion) those jokes aren’t that funny and asked if she was okay and she said she’s fine and I’m just being too sensitive and over reacting. 

I’m not sure what’s the best thing to do about those kind of jokes?

2. Wake up by 6:30 AM at the latest- Start getting hydrated
3. Do a *resistance* training workout, or anything to **elevate the heart rate** for 30+minutes 
4. Keep drinking water throughout workout (during breaks)
5. Take L-Theanine after the workout (At least 150 mg)
6. Take 50-100 mg of caffeine
7. *Fast* until lunch time. 
8. At lunch, eat mostly protein and healthy fats (half an avacado is great), and a little bit of carbs

Working out stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, the L-Theanine and Caffeine work with each other to elevate mood without the jitters from caffeine. Fasting until lunch prolongs the calming effects and keeps you from getting tired after eating a meal in the morning. Keeping carb intake low during lunch prevents an insulin spike which can also make one crash.

38,"I grew up in a dysfunctional home where my parents fought and fought to no end. Most of the problems and the verbal/emotional abuse was instigated by my father. 

There was a pattern to it, too: while he was angry on most days, he really went all-out on holidays and special occasions, be it Christmas, Easter, birthdays, graduations, etc. Even the 4th of July was not safe!

39,"My depression and anxiety have put me in a cycle. I got really into my feelings a few days ago when a friend mentioned that I go through friendships in waves (high and low points, being really really close friends to barely even talking). I know that's been true, since a lot of people I consider close friends, I don't even talk to and can barely call a friend. Then I have those moments.. of such heavy sadness that I don't really have friends. However, anytime I'm making friends or meeting acquaintances, I'm always thinking whether or not they like me and why they do certain things they do. For instance, if someone is on their phone during a large part of our hang out, it leads to ""Why are they on their phone so much? Are they not enjoying our time together? Why is society so glued to their phone? What is better about the content on their phone than being in the present with me? Is there something wrong with me? What am I doing wrong?""

And it goes on and on. The cycle between wanting friends, having them, then not having them, and blaming myself for the fallouts. It probably doesn't help that I had a friend of 8+ years abruptly stop talking to me when my depression was at its early stages, pre-diagnosis. It took digging myself out of my loss of friend sadness to go to the psych ER to figure out my long-standing mental sadness.

48,"This will sound awfully wishy washy as I can't really understand what it is I'm struggling with but I feel it's not helping, more so it's hindering me.

Basically, I get fixated on things; for example. If I start to like the colour green I fixate on it, I start to overly identify with green (like it's an important part of my personality - it's my favourite colour etc.) but more so I start getting into plants, I use ""green"" things in games e.g. play grass types in pokémon or druid's/ nature based things in D&amp;D. This will carry on for a while until something new crops up, for example I started Tai Chi classes and a lot of focus is on the symbology of water. I start getting into it and got fixated on this water idea, I started to like blue, fish, water type pokémon. It's almost like I feel the need to represent my likes at all times. Another thing I noticed is if someone likes the same stuff as me then I find something different e.g. my sister started getting into green and I shifted to teal as a new favourite; as if I need to feel unique or something.

I don't really understand why I'm like this, but whenever I get a new fixation I usually end up conflicted in my head with the previous fixation and wonder who I really am, and often end up in long bouts of rumination trying to figure things out in my head - of which I'll find an answer and then be happy engaging in that mindset until something else crops up making second guess and reconsider my current idea/ fixation. I hope that made some sense. It's this rumination, confusion and lack of solidarity of knowing what I want or whatever that causes me stress knocks at my confidence over and over..

I just want to be able to know what I actually like without flip flopping between things so quickly, I understand nothing stays the same but it shouldn't change so quickly either. I'm just confused and at the point that I need another persons view on the issue. Thanks.",14Jul2018,2

52,"\*\*TL;DR: Can't stop hating myself, what can I do?\*\*

I am about turn 22 and it will be a decade of self hatred. Which has included so many burnt bridges and ruined relationships, drinking, loneliness, job loss, self harm, suicide attempts and more. Things are better now than they used to be and I have an awesome job and love life. But still so much of my life is negatively affected by my self perception. Job, friends, romance, and more.

Basically I believe I am a bad person/selfish/uncaring and bad in every other way like ugly, stupid etc. There is no point even discussing these beliefs because I already know that sometimes it is contradictory and doesn't make sense but it doesn't matter because I will still believe it as it is almost a kind of defense mechanism where no one can hurt me more than I already hurt myself.

I have tried several therapists and they have been great but I never get anywhere because I believe deep down I don't actually want to improve. I just want to keep torturing myself. I know myself well enough and have strategies to get through my bad days and will always get by but fuck, the years keep going by and I still don't know what its like to have friends/romance or trust/openness with others.

I really feel so hopeless and have no clue how to improve. An understanding that I am complete evil shit inside is an idea that is ingrained into me and everything I do. My body language, my beliefs, hobbies everything. It's like this idea that I am not even human and that I am evil scum is so stuck deep down I have no idea how to shake it.

Any advice greatly appreciated, thank you. ",14Jul2018,5
53,"It took me almost two years to get my parents (mom and step-dad) on board with me doing therapy. I would bring it up, and they would agree, and then nothing would be done about it. That doesn’t surprise me though, my parents are full of empty promises. 
The switching point was me and my mom got in an argument over school. I’m wasn’t taking classes over the summer and she felt that I “wasn’t doing anything with my life” in reality I’m getting another job to save up and move out, and my parents had refused to do my FAFSA stuff so I was paying a ridiculous amount for school on top of all the bills I have to pay. My parents pay for absolutely nothing for me, the only thing I get is a house to live in. That tbh is better than living on the street but we don’t even have a kitchen and I sleep in the living room, so I spend most of my time at my BF house. 
I feel like I’m stuck living in this house with manipulative people who don’t care about my mental health. 
I cried to my mom telling her that I need help, she basically turned it around on me saying that I was ungrateful. 
She passive aggressively gave me insurance info so I could so it myself. 
I feel like they don’t care about my well being and my home relationship is toxic. But I’m stuck, and I can’t leave. 
I’m barraged my attitudes, passive aggressive comments, and the general feeling of being unwanted around them.

Even when I get ill there's no one I can call to take me to the hospital or buy me some medicines. It's the little things like these that makes me feel so lonely and sad. I can't even talk to anyone about my depression or anxiety, because I know they would laugh at my face or they'd call me attention seeker.

61,"So this week I started a new job that demnads a lot of physical and mental effort. The pay is amazing, but the work load was unlike anything I could ever imagine previously. My relationship with my girlfriend has been somewhat rocky for the last few months, and last night seemed to be a tipping point. We made plans to have a night in, so after I got home from a stressful day at work we went to get pizza. She requested that we get some wine on the way back. Me being extremely starved that day forgot to get wine on the way home, and we get into a fight. She accused me of being selfish and only caring for the pizza I've been wanting, and in defense I told her that she could've at least reminded me once on the way home when she stayed quiet the whole time back with a mood. This is where things tipped. I start crying and this immense feeling of grief, sadness, stress, anxiety, and depression washes over me and I completely lose control. I start breathing intensely, pulling at my hair, and have no control over my physical or mental self. My girlfriend tried to calm me down and dragged me to the bedroom. I cruy, and gasp for air trying to make the feeling go away, but I can't no matter how hard I clench my teeth or resist. After what seemed like an eternity I finally managed to calm down by breathing, but my whole body just felt numb. A very heightened sense of anxiety and panic made it hard for me to try to get a grip in myself without thinking of something positive like me childhood. All the while my girlfriend is trying to comfort me, but the sight of her face triggers my breath to go out of control again. Things subsided after a while, but I still don't know what happened.

64,"I met this girl at the tail end of the winter semester after asking her if she wanted to get coffee a few times (third time's the charm). She was extremely shy and awkward but very forthcoming and we've been talking nearly everyday for 4 months since the summer started. Before the summer she'd told me that she had been sexually assaulted by a group of people she met online. She was lonely and trying to hit rock bottom because her only real-life friend had coerced her into cheating on her LDR boyfriend and also nearly sexually assaulted her. So, now she's back with her LDR boyfriend (America-Japan), who is quite possessive and scared of me, although she says he's fine with me now. Because of the sexual assault, her unstable relationship with her LDR (and the fears of repeating the same mistake) and her latent social anxiety, she's scared to hang out with me 1 on 1. We had a class in the summer where we hung out, but it's over now. She comes back from a month-long vacation soon. 

We are probably closer than we should be for a 4 month relationship. We keep tabs on eachother and are very supportive and none of it really feels deceitful or manipulative. I'm very untrusting of other people due to trauma and it seems like she is too but there is a strong trust here. How do I convince her to hang out? I don't want to pressure someone who's dealt with so much in a selfish manner but she holes herself up in her room all day and I can tell it's fucking her up, on top of the fact that I like her, and want to see her. I'm gonna assume the best course of action is to just keep asking her to hang out (I've asked a few times) casually just to check if she's comfortable (And to give her an easy yes/no answer instead of hoisting the anxiety of asking on her, which she probably wouldn't do) and just wait but I don't know.",14Jul2018,2
65,"My best friend had a very severe case of postpartum depression. She ended up hospitalized three times for it. It has now been about 2 years and she seems to be spiraling downward. Her family noticed and had her go back to the hospital for inpatient help for a week. After she got out, she has become very erratic. She can’t seem to focus on anything, doing odd things like sitting on the floor at work and ignoring her employees when they directly speak with her, and randomly getting up and leaving to go do something fairly strange (ex: suddenly leaving work and saying she needs to go to a water park). I’m not sure what to do but I feel like this behavior is very alarming.  I know she just got released from the hospital so I don’t know what to do or how to approach this. I don’t have any of her direct families contact information to try to get their thoughts on the situation and she isn’t able to hold a conversation with me long enough for me to be able to get a read on how she feels. Scariest of all was when one of her employees told me today that they don’t know how she even drove into work. Any and all advice would be great. I feel over my head with this. ",14Jul2018,1
66,"I’m British and engaged to an American guy, in the process of getting a visa to move over there and marry him. Things were great for a while, we’ve been lucky enough to have only been apart for two weeks during our relationship, I spend as much time as I can in the US and he flies to England to be with me when I can’t go over there. His family are lovely and we get along amazingly, they’re really supportive of us getting married and having me live with them. Which is nice since I don’t get along with my own family. I’m currently staying with them for the summer until the end of August.

But lately my fiancé has started to be kinda mean and at first I brushed it off as him being stressed over life stuff. But he just doesn’t stop. It’s almost every day now and it’s gotten to the point where I’m almost constantly sad. I wouldn’t call it a full depression but I’m definitely sad most of the time which worries me because I used to suffer from depression really, really badly and I don’t want to go back to that place. He’s always snappy with me and acts like I’m in the wrong when I tell him what he’s said/the tone of voice he’s said something in has upset me. I just feel like I take the brunt of his stress, like I’m an emotional punchbag. And he always apologises yet does it again shortly afterwards and it’s just tiring. I’m tired. Exhausted even. And then yesterday, I spent three hours putting something I’d bought for him together and then the battery malfunctioned but before I could replace it (which was an easy fix), he’d got angry and completely smashed it, something I’d never seen him do before. And that worries me because even though I know he would never hurt me, it’s still a red flag I think. I don’t know what he’s so angry about but everything is different and I don’t want to leave him, I haven’t even thought about it and I wouldn’t go but I just want him to stop treating me like an emotional punchbag. Because every little thing is taken out on me lately and I literally cry three times a day over it because I feel so small and belittled. I just want things to go back to how they were, y’know? Because he used to make me so happy and I know he still can but I just don’t understand what this is and talking to him gets us nowhere. I’m so sad about it.",14Jul2018,1
67,"I see a lot of stories about mistreatment in inpatient hospitals and mental health agencies. Believe me, I know; I have experienced it too.

There is no way to make them stop mistreating you. But you CAN fight back. Don't just stand there and take it. Even as a psych patient, you have rights.

* Upon admission, make sure you receive the proper paperwork. This includes a copy of your patient rights, a HIPAA consent form, and numbers for the patient advocate. You'll receive other papers more particular to each facility and your own situation (insurance, etc) but if you don't receive your rights and HIPAA, you're not being treated properly and you should complain!

* If someone, staff OR another patient, mistreats you in any way or violates your patient rights, you have the right to file a grievance! Ask any of the staff for a grievance form, and if they don't give it to you, DEMAND it or insist to see a supervisor. Staff is obligated to let you fill out a grievance upon request - it's the law! And don't fear retaliation from the staff - it's also the law that you can complain without fear of retaliatory actions by anyone in the hospital.

* Look out for your fellow patients! You can fill out a grievance on behalf of another patient if you see someone else being mistreated.

* There will be a patient advocate associated with every hospital. You should be given their phone number in your paperwork or their number should be posted somewhere. If you can't find it, ask one of the staff. THEY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO YOU IF YOU ASK FOR IT. If you feel like your complaints aren't being heard and your needs aren't being met, call the patient advocate and leave them a message.

* Keep copies of your grievances for your own records! Ask the staff to photocopy them for you if you need to. And hang on to your admission paperwork!

Again, this stuff won't stop the staff from mistreating you or other patients - but it may bring down consequences for it!",14Jul2018,2
68,"Hey there, community. First and foremost, I'd like to talk about my brother's background:
1. He's a 30 y/o tall young looking guy with several issues. He's growing a big belly recently but aside from that he is skinny. He never finished his career even though he was one course left to finish it. We never knew why and he tries to evade the conversation. He had a handful of jobs on his lifetime. He was fired in all of them because he was late everyday.
2. He sleeps around 9 hours during the night, wakes up at 11 am just to have breakfast and go back to sleep for another hour.
3. He viciously washes his teeth three times per day and he takes around 50 minutes each time wasting a lot, A LOT of water. And everytime he takes showers he lasts around 45 minutes. He's obsessed with being clean and using gallons and gallons of water daily. If you ever tell him about it, he gets furious and mad. He may close the door in front of you. 
4. He eats 4 times per day. Pretty well served dishes and gets mad if there's no protein in it. He doesn't seem to be able to make sacrifices.
5. Does not have a single motivation neither that nor money. All he does is sitting on his desk with earphones reading and watching articles on the internet. And he's not willing to spend a single cent on food if it means having a better dish. He is a grasper
6. He loves coffee and prepares cool beverages with our new espresso machine.
7. He's been sent with a couple of psychologists but they all claim he is depressed (already been treated with anti depressant which only made him sleep more) and OCD, but that's clearly the case. My parents are getting older and as his younger brother I really want to help bc I know medicines won't do him any good. 
8. About his intelligence, oh he's really smart and knows a lot of stuff. And I'm sure he has tricked every physician he's ever been taken to.

I feel powerless. I want to change him but he's not willing to do anything. He's very comfortable living in this house. Thank toi everyone in advance.",14Jul2018,2
69,"He smashes his head repeatedly against things - into the wall, his desk, his keyboard - and believes the world is it to get him. He thinks it's not just bad luck, but that something is literally out of his control. For example, his food order was forgotten twice in one day. This apparently doesn't happen to other people, and is an example of how the world is against him.

He logs all the bad things that happen to him, and then takes revenge in petty ways against other innocent people.

It's getting to the point where he's threatened more violent action, though never acted on it. 
I'm scared he's going to hurt himself or someone else, and anything I say seems to just fuel him on. There's no reasoning with him or his version of logic anymore.

He refuses to get help. I have begged pleaded and bargained with him to find a therapist - to no avail. He has looked once or twice, but resources are difficult to navigate in Vancouver where we live.

What can I do? I'm at a loss.
I called a crisis line for advice, but the lines were busy, so I left a message. I don't know what to do.",14Jul2018,1
70,"Throwaway here\*

  I am in a relationship and her son, 8 years old, may have BDP/Bipolar disorder.  The father is in complete denial of the situation.  Dad is also the primary parent so she says she can't take her son to get checked out.  The dad's therapist says he shows signs of BPD, but it isn't ""officially diagnosed"" from what I understand.

  I haven't been a huge part of her sons life yet, but I want to make sure I approach the situation to the best of my ability.  

  She says that her son, we'll call him Joe, will switch from good to hellion in a flip of a switch.  He has to be in control of every situation and can be extremely manipulative.  My biggest concern is that Joe does not respond to authority well.  Mom will tell Joe something and if he doesn't like it, he will say ""Shut up you stupid son of a bitch"" then five minutes passes and will say  ""I love you mommy! you're the prettiest in the world""  and act as if nothing happened...

How should I approach this as I will be his future stepfather?  How should I treat him and punish him for his actions?  She was told to not spank him because he will only feed off of it.  I am a pretty big and well built, but I don't know if my size alone will intimidate him and control him

Brief history about my story: 

I was bullied all my life, I come from an abusive household and I've been abused in other ways by other people, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 in 2014, and there's more. I was abused by my family all my life. I just realized they are narcissists and it explains so much. I  faced hell with bipolar. 

I feel like my family is the reason I attach to things so easily. I feel like I am missing a huge part of me inside. Maybe because my family is so horrible. 

I attached to video games a while ago, then weed, then in relationships, my computer/phone and I help people a lot on reddit with their battles. I help a lot on the depression subreddit. Idk. I feel like im annoying on that subreddit and people hate me. I just have a lot of free time.
