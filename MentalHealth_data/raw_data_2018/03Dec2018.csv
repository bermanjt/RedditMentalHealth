3,My mental health has been severe for as long as I can remember. I’m 24 and for my entire adult life I’ve struggled to hold a job. I’m living with my parents and have nothing to show for. I’ve had exes in the past tell my I need to get on disability. But then my parents turn around and tell me I’m just lazy and a mooch and making excuses. I called out of work for a week straight just to take NyQuil and constantly sleep and shut out the world because that’s as close to death as I can get with out actually killing my self. Not because I just wanna sleep. I just don’t want to face reality anymore or my day to day life ,03Dec2018,1
4,"I am on a waiting list for social anxiety therapy. However, I haven’t been fully honest with my therapists because I am so ashamed of what I did. If anyone could give me some guidance, that would be helpful.

I mostly talked about my social anxiety while I was being considered to be put on a waiting list. But the real trigger came from something completely different.

Over two years ago, when I was 16, I made friends with some people online. They lived in the US and far away in general. I started off by lying to them for over a year, telling them I was 18 for no reason. I was very close friends with these people.

I completely fell for a guy from that friend group, and he fell for me. We had a messy ending to our story, and I sank into depression. I became extremely manipulative to try and express my feelings. I lied about very serious things: I told them one of my friends had died in a car crash just to make them feel sorry for me.

I got into a relationship with another guy online, to try and get out of my depressive state. When we eventually broke up, I started legitimately self-harming and attended A&amp;E a couple of times. I didn’t tell anyone that it was because of the break up, because it sounded so absolutely stupid.

I kept talking to my online friends until April, where I faked my own suicide. They couldn’t fact check it from overseas. I know how serious this is. I don’t understand why I did it, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I know it was also immature.

I acted manipulative and insane. Neither of those people could ever forgive me. I’m not unhappy with my life now, but I feel like it’s only a matter of time before history repeats itself. l’ve done a lot of healing and have reflected upon this.

I was thinking I could possibly have BPD from my extreme mood changes - I went from suicidal to overly happy every day for months. Self-diagnosing is a bad option most times, though. I feel like I might be really crazy.

Any help is appreciated. If somehow, one of the people I did this to comes across this post, I can’t even begin to apologise for my actions. I am so sorry for what I put you through, for making you think you had lost someone.",03Dec2018,1
5,"Don't know if the title is clear. But basically, let's say you're baking a cake and you're not very good at it. No one knows about it, it's just you. Cake turns out disgusting. In that situation, I might get sad, on a terrible day I might have a meltdown, might say I'm useless but those words don't hurt me, and eventually I'll get over it. But say as the cake is baking, every minute someone reminds you of your mistakes, like ""You forgot eggs."" ""Temperature is way too high"". ""That's broil, not bake."" and then those comments turn into ""You're a bad planner."" ""You're too impulsive."" ""You're not good."" Don't you find it harder to deal with? It's like your brain is literally in a cage of fogginess when that happens. It's so strange but it's really hard to get through or ever deal with.

Honestly I have had issues I always considered minor, to gain more and more importance in my mind because of other's doubts about how I deal with things. I know some people view this as ""being unable to deal with criticism"". Maybe it is. But it's really hard to deal with other people's doubt vs. self doubt.

I want to tell my parents but I’m scares because my mom said if she finds out that I’m purging again she won’t let me go to our school trip to Europe in the spring.

Should I tell my friend what I’m going through and get her opinion or should I just make the decision myself?

I could wait until I’m 18 in June and find therapy myself or I could ask for help now.

15,"I've been working with a therapist weekly for about 6 months, and I trust her a lot. We have resolved one major issue with talk therapy, and currently we are tackling the problem that I fizzle under anything challenging, and exhibit self destructive behavior. During my childhood academic life, my mom was overbearing and would constantly yell at me when I would get bad grades, or didn't follow her ""study plans"" and micromanaged everything I did up until I was 17. Fast forward to my Senior Year of University, and I am skirting by with a 2.8 and I am horrific at basic tasks like admitting I need help, admitting I dont know something and following through in schedules and setting timelines. Anything that I cannot succeed in with raw talent I fail almost guaranteed. This is true for all parts of my life, relationships (almost exclusively with women that dont challenge me at all) music (have not challenged myself musically in almost a decade, even though my parents support it) and especially academics (I virtually never ask any other human for help for fear of seeming unintelligent or lazy, but use online resources like crazy).

With that background,  my therapist hypothesized I have a fear of feeling inadequate or failing and suggested EMDR to tackle it since it was so embedded in my personality. She is a certified practitioner by EMDRIA and thinks it will be successful.  

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with this treatment, and if they think it would be a good idea for my situation.

19,"Just a brief background,  
I've had major depressive disorder for about 5 years, chronic anxiety for even longer (it's gotten 5 times worse in the past 2 years though), I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder too, but additionally in the past couple months I've developed VERY bad paranoia and intruding disturbing thoughts like imagining me and my family getting murdered in the most horrifying ways possible vividly, and believing it could actually happen, there's a fear of saying ""no that would NEVER happen"" and then I jinx it and it happens. And with the paranoia I'm talking about thinking people are trying to poison me, even my own family, afraid people are following me and people will come to my house and kill me, afraid when I'm driving I'm going to get in a crash or drive into a river and drown to death, stuff like that.  


So 2 psychiatrists I'm seeing, AND another one I saw when I was in a psych ward in august, ALL want me to take lurasidone. Now I've been on a lot of antipsychotics, and all of them I have either gotten a sharp increase in anxiety, or akathesia, or both. I've been on zyprexa, seroquel, risperidone, saffris, abilify &amp; lamictal. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Seroquel didn't cause anxiety when I was on it 5 years ago for depression with prozac, but now it opens the door for new anxieties I never dealt with prior. So now I can honestly say EVERY antipsychotic I've been on makes things worse.  


But it's the only drug class that these doctors want me on. And while yes, I haven't taken lurasidone yet so I don't know how it affects me, I recently tried risperidone, and I was surfing a wave of heightened anxiety for HOURS. You couldn't pay me to take it again. And from what I understand, risperidone and lurasidone are pretty similar. These doctors are making it clear that this is the only option left (or MORE antipsychotics, vraylar, geodon &amp; haldol specifically), and it's really really fucking hard to have hope to begin with, this is making it harder. And it really is awful when I start getting super paranoid and scared and anxious and start realizing I could be this messed up for the rest of my life.  


Am I really this fucked? Please let me know if there's another way if you have an idea.  


What meds I take now:

Right now I'm just on gabapentin and vyvanse (no vyvanse is not the cause of paranoia, I just started it a month ago. Although it DOES somehow eliminate my intruding disturbing thoughts 90% of the time, I know there's a big risk of making my paranoia even worse, eventually)  


If you want my speculation as to what caused this increase in paranoia, I have some theories, but I am certain it is not schizophrenia. Another reason I don't want to take lurasidone. A medication FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

Just in a constant state of worried tension with ever-changing thoughts buzzing around in my head and this has made even basic tasks fill me with fear and anxiety. Making decisions, filling out forms, planning ahead in any way has all become impossible for me. I've tried getting help from my doctor and researching relaxation techniques, mindfulness, etc but had limited success.

22,"So, under frankly weird circumstances, my now ex-therapist told me she thinks I have borderline personality disorder. 

The reasons she cited were because, based on the email I sent her explaining why I’d like to discontinue our sessions, I am “extremely relationally sensitive.” In my email I shared that I had finally put together why I wasn’t feeling great about our sessions—because of some recent &amp; childhood trauma, certain things she said were triggering me and I was thus struggling to build trust. I also felt she was overstepping her bounds with medical issues I have, and our values were just a bit incompatible.

I tried to get over it but meh, something felt “off” the whole time, like she wasn’t quite taking me seriously, or felt like I was exaggerating. I couldn’t shake the feeling, ironically, that she thought I had borderline, and was therefore thinking when I discussed my recent experiences, I was “just being dramatic.” 

Anyway, so, she suggested the diagnosis (which she didn’t say anything about any more than “It’s often correlated with trauma, and it’s quite stigmatized”) but then later in the session when she was, I guess, trying to say positive things about me, she said 

“One thing I’ve been consistently impressed by is how well you regulate your emotions.” 

....which is the antithesis of borderline personality disorder, no ?!? What. 

I frequently asked my last therapist if I have BPD. For context this past therapist specializes in trauma and is trained in DBT and used DBT with me, which I did find very helpful! But she would always emphatically say absolutely not, rather I am sensitive and pathologize my emotions and intuition (like by diagnosing myself with personality disorders and being afraid I need to be hospitalized and medicated whenever I feel an intense emotion, lol). 

I’ve spoken to all of my friends, family, and partner (who I have stable long-term relationships with!) and they all agreed BPD sounds nothing like me, and I maybe just got written off as a hysterical woman by suggesting she had been insensitive. 

So I don’t know...maybe I should get a third opinion? Has this ever happened to someone else? Am I taking this too personally? ",03Dec2018,1

25,"A lot of things happened to me the last 2 weeks. Last week, I sunk into a depression episode and dont feel like I can get out of it. I have been in a constant state of anxiety, and any new events or situations causes me to freeze up, unable to think. I made the spontaneous decision to see a psychiatrist and managed to get a walk-in session at the local university hospital. In some ways, talking did help, and knowing that how I felt was valid. 

I still feel lost. My brain is mostly in a fog, especially when I am triggered.  Because I am digging up old wounds and trying to get past them, I am in a constant state of pain, confusion and anxiety. I forced myself to get up for work today, and even at work, I could not concentrate. 

My biggest source of pain is that some of my friends refuse to interact with me until I am mentally stable. I am confident they meant it as an advice for me to settle my mental health first and take my time in doing so. But it hurts all the same, and to me, it sounded like they dont want to deal with me when I am in this state. I thought I could go to them for support, but it seems that they are not capable of supporting me. It is a sad and painful truth I have to accept. I constantly think that if I do take time to heal myself, I would end up losing them. It is not logical, but thats how I feel. 

I have accepted that my anxiety and depression stems from my childhood, in how my parents raised me and my experience with school friends, all of which I could not remember a clear happy time. I want to move on and get better, but I dont know what to do now. Everyday is an emotional roller coaster and it is so hard to tell myself that all the doubts and self-hate is self flagellation and overthinking. Im so scared that that is what I have to keep on telling myself until the day I die, which may not be long as everyday I combat with suicidal thoughts. 

On top of that, I have pressure and stress from myself and my parents to land a permanent job. My mom wants to build back a relationship with me, and is putting pressure on that as well. 

I take anything and everything so personally. I freeze up even when someone asks me ""how are you?"" or starts a conversation with me. I keep on thinking people are thinking the worst of me when I know in the back of my head that is not true. I overthink, but cant help it. And when I think about all these failings, I feel even more depressed and useless and think that I am the most useless human being for being unable to deal and think rationally. 

I really am lost. I was even accused of denial when I sincerely dont know what to do anymore. I am only going on day by day now. And each day is as hard as the one before it, if not even more excruciating. ",03Dec2018,1

27,"I’ve been struggling with loneliness and self loathing for a while now. For some time, mostly throughout high school, I hated the world. I felt like like my loneliness stemmed from the fact that no one “understood” me. I’d blame my parents for making us move twice while I was in high school. I’d isolate myself from people and blame them for it. I’d put in no effort to make friends because why the hell should I? They didn’t get me. In my eyes, they were all the problem, not me. 

I’m in college now and I’ve matured a bit more. This should be a good thing and in some ways it is. I’ve grown as a person and I’ve stopped blaming others for my faults. But now I just fucking hate myself instead. I still have an astounding inability to make actual friends. I mean I have a decent amount of acquaintances. I go out with some of them every once in a blue moon. They seem to like me but I just can’t connect with them that well and I hate myself for it and I blame my past decisions. I feel like I’ve become so alienated from everyone that I can’t connect with anyone anymore. 

I see all these opportunities passing by me. Opportunities to make friends and be in relationships. There’s this girl in one of my classes and she’s fucking gorgeous and although we’ve never really talked I’m pretty sure she likes me. She smiles at me sometimes and I often catch her looking at me. I like her too, obviously, but this just makes me hate myself more. I went through a break up recently where I really hurt the girl I was dating and I tell myself I’d just end up hurting this other girl too because it’s what I always fucking do. I fucking push people away because it’s the only thing I know how to do. It’s a viscous cycle: I push people away because I have a history of pushing people away. 

I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal. I don’t necessarily want to kill myself but sometimes I just want to die. It’s exhausting to try and dig myself out of a hole that I’m simultaneously digging deeper. 

The phrase “I feel like I’m drowning” used to feel like a cliche to me. But now I actually feel like I’m drowning. Everything’s piling up and it feels like nothing will ever change or go right. I genuinely feel like I’m sinking and when it gets really bad I’ll have to catch my breath and calm myself down.

The worst part is the sense of hope I get every once in a while. I have a nice conversation with someone or go out with someone some weekend and I feel like everything’s coming up Milhouse. But then it’s back to to my regularly scheduled programming and I realize I’m still a goddamn recluse. 

I hate self-pity as much as the next guy though so I thought I’d end on a positive note. I just recently found this sub and I really appreciate it. I tried r/depression for a while but it only made things worse. People there were miserable and seemed content with being miserable. People here seem like they’re genuinely trying to change and even if they aren’t always successful at least you guys are putting your best foot forward.

This has brought about alot of tough questions and even harder answers as I try and dive deep into my problems. Not only is that tough but it is extra difficult to process things when I can remember or misremember so much of my life. This is really bad guys. I can't really remember names, faces, dates, events, what I used to look like, places I frequented often (school, home, etc), the people who I used to speak with often. On top of that I'm misremembering alot too. Like I'm thinking something is true and after I while I realize that it didn't go like that at all.

31,I've known a person for roughly 3 months now and they recently started cutting her self. She told me about it because she saw a scar on my wrist from when I fell down and thought I was doing the same. She continues despite my efforts on getting her to stop and I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell anyone since I have depression myself and I know if someone told on me it would probably push me over the edge into attempted suicide. Does anyone who has suffered through this themselves or known about someone who has been through this have any suggestions on what to tell her and how to get her professional help without driving her over the edge?,03Dec2018,1

33,"I don’t feel like I’m me when I’m depressed anymore. Feels like my body is just a vehicle for my depressed mind, so I can look at myself objectively, from an outsiders point of view - like how this current version of me is a literal drain on society, my family and friends, and that id have been better off dead the past 12 years. These realities don’t make me sad at all any more, and it would seem batshit to most people, but they’re just conclusions I’ve come to with no emotions attached. 

When I’m ‘up’ I’m full of crazy ideas about how I’m going to get my shit together and how my depression is a thing of the past, even though I KNOW it’s going to come back, I convince myself that I’m either fine, or was faking it. Even though it’s the only time I function as a person (socialise, hold down a job), it feels like that’s when I’m thinking the least clear.

I never posted here, but right now it kinda feels right to me. So to keep it short, my life has been on a constant downfall for 1 year now.

I dropped out of college for him and quit my job. Now Im in high dept(for a 21 y/o) with no will power what so ever and coulndnt get myself moving again since then. Minor Ups but major Downs.


But after smoking yet another blunt instead of working I realized I have been stuck in a constant loop of putting off everything. Whenever a problem came up, I said to myself that it would be easy and is no problem at all just so I can avoid it at the moment. And that continued until I ended up here.

That's where things get dicey. I'm assuming that my 'fight' reaction is so much more likely to take over than 'flight' when adrenaline sets in, and when I'm unable to follow through on it I get some kind of... anxiety or something. It actually has presented damaging results and caused a few black-outs. Worse yet is when I know people are talking shit behind my back or being passive-aggressive without giving me a chance to respond-- It's both mentally and physically draining, probably because of experiences I had back in school. It's as if forcing myself to not stand up for my own hide causes an actual shock to my system, or something.  

The symptoms are as follows:

\- increased body temperature

\- dizziness, or lightheadedness, or both

\- shakes, increased heart-rate

\- probably??? a tightening of the chest??? or expanding idk

\- ringing in the ears

\- distorting or darkening vision

\- needing to sit down/weakness

the above symptoms do not go away even after the person that's yelled at me has left. They only increase until a) a supervisor gets me out of there and sends me home, b) I manage to get myself to a bathroom where I can recuperate in silence, or c) I lose consciousness. And then after that I'm incredibly fatigued, regardless of the solution.

Within the past two months I've had this happen five times because some customer or other got on my case over something (blaming me for coupons not working or sales being over, yelling at me for cleaning up chicken juice from their leaky bags of chicken because apparently that's disrespectful, a card not reading and me having to call a supervisor to help, telling my bagger I'm an idiot under their breath because I didn't count dollars fast enough/didn't just hand it over without counting, etc)... Now I'm starting to be too scared to go to work because it might happen again lol

Anyway does anyone else out there experience this, or at least something like it? Is it actually a condition with a name? I've tried googling it but I think it's so specific that nothing ever comes up. Thanks to anyone that answers.

PS. I would see a therapist namely for other reasons but I'm really scared of talking to one...

39,"I'm currently a high school senior drowning in college applications and stress, but there's been a troubling development in my stress response. It's going to take a lot of effort to see mental health professional, so I'm coming here to seek an preliminary evaluation to help inform my decision. So story time!

Yesterday, with my brain feeling like thick soup with a few chunks of lead suspended through my head and a complete inability to think, I took my car out for a drive. I picked up a friend and we shot the shit as I drove, mostly going in circles but still having fun. Yet, despite that, I felt the symptoms of an anxiety ""episode"" -- blood pumping, my temporal arteries feeling like they're exploding, my heart feeling the pressure, my senses hyper-alert, my head turning to slurry as my thoughts begin to freeze, generally feeling like shit, but with no externally visible signs of trouble. I can still function, my friend didn't notice anything different, but it was not the most pleasant experience. 

This began on on Homecoming night, when I was driving from one party to another (completely sober -- no drugs/vape/alcohol) and I felt the exact same episode happening. 

The problem is, I love driving. It's one of my favorite things to do, and here it is shredding me from the inside. It happens in varying degrees every time I hit the road without a destination. I have not crashed or anything remotely like that. The only possible explanation is that I had a near miss once, but like every teenage driver, I had experienced multiple before then without any ramification. There's absolutely zero discernible trigger for when it happened homecoming night, and it's been happening sporadically every since.

I began with driving because it's the most illustrative example of these ""episodes."" It has also happened with other things I care about: two of my best friends, my favorite extracurricular (computer science), except much more regularly. Its debilitating and miserable. With one of my best friends (lets call him A) and the extracurricular, I could pin down a cause of the attacks, but they're all minor issues. With A, my anxiety also resolved when that issue resolved, but the extracurricular is still ongoing. With my other friend (let's call him B) I swear it came completely randomly, with zero discernible reason -- like my issue with driving.

46,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know where to post this, so hopefully it does not get removed. This is more of typing how I feel &amp; seeking advice &amp; support.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 25 year old male who just got shoulder surgery for my torn rotator cuff, subscap and long-head bicep (most critical was the rotator cuff). When I was a sophomore in high school, I was overweight and chubby, then I realized that I needed to be healthier. Since then, I have refined my diet and started working out heavily, ultimately getting down to \~10% BF. 

&amp;#x200B;

In March of last year, I played 5 hours of basketball, worked out shoulders, got a massage and returned to play more basketball. This was when I was doing 2 a days, combined with a lot of basketball. I realized that my range of motion was hindered so I went to the doctors. They put me in physical therapy for 1 year and also gave me a few cortisone shots to no heal. Now, I am 2 weeks done with surgery - restless and eager as ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I brought up my history of being overweight is that my physical state impacts my mental health as well. My strength has declining, diet is not as strict and the thought of losing my peak is negatively impacting my energy. During college, I was very upbeat, outgoing and refined - now I am a bit complacent.

&amp;#x200B;

I am coming out of this slump, but I need to start now. Starting today, my diet will be stricter again and I will take recovery seriously. However, I just wanted to seek advice if there are any vitamins/supplements that would help me recovery better/faster. Also, can anyone recommend any workouts that I can do? From biking to just walking, please let me know if there is anything acceptable to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, a few of us are actually doctors, and I have consulted mine, but I just wanted to hear more voices/get support. 

  
Thank you kindly.",03Dec2018,1
47,"Posted this on r/mentalhealth already, but the more advice the better.

I have a lot to say, so if you're willing to read this then go ahead. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile while typing this.

  To give some backround about myself; I'm almost 15, I've been aware of the fact that I most likely have depression for about 3 years although I believe it started around 5th-6th grade. I used to be a gymnast (quit recently which made me really sad and I isolated myself for a few weeks after that) and there I was taught to suck it up and deal with whatever the hell I'm struggling with, so I'm not the type of person to open up about emotions and go to someone when I'm in desperate need for help.

  I'd say my depression usually goes on and off, getting worse during the winter months. In 7th and 8th grade I probably missed a total of 30 days because I couldn't even pull myself out of bed in the mornings. I'm really proud to say that so far I've only missed 3 days of school and it wasn't even because of the depression. I wish I could end this on a happy note, but that's not the case. Recently I've only been getting worse... I've been trying so hard to push through the days, yet I'm just so sick of this feeling. The lack of motivation, not wanting to hang out with friends (which some of them think it's their fault... it's not, I just can't express myself properly), having to literally throw myself out of bed so I'll get up. I used to be able to eat in the mornings, but ever since I began feeling this way I started getting sick having breakfast, so I just stopped. I really want this to end because it's seriously affecting me and the people around me. Sometimes I'll lash out at friends because my emotions are so fucked up I can't deal with them properly.

  I crave for this feeling to go away and I desperately want to reach out for help, but my body won't let me. My mother always dismisses the subtle hints I give to her, even when I suggest it's more, as ""PMS"" or ""I'm probably just having bad cramps that are making me angry."" I get it's because her and my father both have some form of depression and she probably doesn't want to believe that her baby is going through it, aswell. She's in denial because if she knows they truth, it'll break her. She'll think it's her fault I'm depressed when in reality it's just genetics, she can't do anything about it. That's part of the reason I just can't bring myself to talk to her about. Another reason is that I'll choke up and have a panic attack when I even attempt to think about confronting her about it... it's horrible. I've been thinking about writing a long letter about how I feel and giving it to her, but I'm terrified of what happens after that. I don't want anything about our current relationship to change because I'll feel uncomfortable. Even if I tell her this, things won't be the same, it's just the way my mom acts. 

I need some serious advice. I don't have any trusted adults and I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my school's guidance counselor. I only have one friend who knows somewhat about my anxiety, but nothing else. I've only scratched the surface of my feelings with her. Unfortunately since I can't drive, I'm also not able to see a therapist without someone else's knowledge of it.",03Dec2018,1

In our senior year of highschool he stopped showing up as often, started smoking weed a lot, and ultimately dropped out and kinda just vanished from our lives slowly. This went on for about 8 months of radio silence until me and a friend said fuck it and drove to his house and visited him, we talked about everything and he pretty much said hes struggling with social anxiety and a bit of depression, from what he thinks. I asked him if hes seen a therapist or anything and told him if he wants help calling one and setting an appt I could help him out, and that talking to someone qualified is okay. Me and my buddy (we were all childhood friends, known each other for 10+ years) went over there once every week or every other week for a few months, talked with him about life and what hes up to, he mostly just stays at home, works on his house (building roofs and laying concrete, hes making a really nice woodworking area etc.) We took him camping with a few of our friends, he seemed to have a good time, but he smokes a lot of weed, like way more than what is healthy, he came out and said he was addicted to it, and I said if you feel like you wanna get off it I can come and help you out, stay at your place with you and take all your weed away, but he said hes not ready. A few of my other friends were visiting him on and off as well after I told them what was up. We had a good conversation, and I asked if he looks forward to us coming over, and he said he doesnt look forward to us coming over, he actually doesnt like it, but he does enjoy seeing us. He said he doesnt enjoy it because he finds it awkward at the start. So after our camping trip, I dropped him off and said message me lets chill, but still nothing, its been about 5 or 6 months now, and I dont know what to do.

I didnt ruin any relationships i couldnt fix, i never pawned or sold anything to support my habbit, but it chaned me, the way i act, the way i see others and the way i see myself. I cut and burned myself, and lashed out randomly at people who didnt deserve it and made mistake which put me in the hospital/mental rehabilitation.

Flash forward to this year and (around spring) and a friend of mine i haven't seen in a while comes to visit and offers me a bump. I accept. Arround 4 months latter i go out with some friends/co-workers and think ""what the hell, its a special night and i do t go out often"" so i do some more bumps. 2 or 3 months later a friend of mine dies (from an overdose) and i do some more at a party at his funeral, i thought nothing of it. Last Tuesday i went out with the same friends/co-workers (minus one...) And do quite a lot. Thursday rolls around and i just say fuck it and buy a bag, because taking drugs from others just me feel parasitic (this is where it gets familiar). I ask a friend (who currently has a serious problem) about a hook-up, and she gives me the talk about not getting into coke and how much it will take from me. I give her all th old ""ill be responsible"" ""ill only do it occasionally"" ""it wont be loke that"" excuses and she knows right away thats a lie and calls me out on it (which angered me, becaus reasons). pull money out of the atm for a bag. As im waiting for my friend to get back my girlfriend tells me its time to leave (because she has to work at 5:00am and shes my ride) so i ask her to stay, but cant give her a reason (red flag), so she leaves and i stay. I get my bag and immediately become paranoid that my friend and her hookup are ""fuckin with me"" and spend the rest of the night agitated and lashing out at her in anger. And get home at 4:30am just as my girlfriend is getti g up.

At some point during the night i lost my bag ,that i swore id be responsible with, and im greatful for that, because i know i wouldnt have been, but i feel like all of my friends and co-workers ar looking at me/treating me different, and have been having... Side effects. And i feel so guilty. I feel ive lost the respect of people i love, and i cant tell my girlfriend because god knows how she would react, which scares me because ever since i met her shes been my reason for stability and to actually try to do something more with my life.

I ficked up bad, and dont know how to handle it. With one friend dead and another who seems to be on the same path, i feel my friends would never believe me if i say ill never do it again, and i dont think i do either, but i hope i wont. I just needed to say it to someone, and put it out there, but i cant talk to my girlfriend about it cause im scared of her reaction.",03Dec2018,1

62,"I know that this is a result of my mental health but it’s eating away at me. 

My partner is attentive and caring. He spends intentional time with me and pays attention  to my feelings. I have wonderful friends. I don’t have as many in my state as I would like (I moved here about 1.5 years ago) but the ones I am close with here are kind, considerate, and we share an emotional connection. My job is shit but I have an out. I have been searching and have some potentials. I need to go back to counseling and get meds but I can’t untimely January when my insurance issues get straightened out. 

I don’t know how to fix this. Seems like bullshit when I have a good life.  I now my anxiety is getting to me but I can’t stop it. ",03Dec2018,1
63,"So.... this really is the most bizarre request. It is a request for advice and assistance, but also I feel I could be of assistance for researchers- I feel like I should be examined and used as a case study as I believe my mental health would be of interest to professionals who are researching Autism, Personality Disorders, ADHD and the likes. The end goal for me is to hopefully try the achieve peace and mental stability as well as an understanding of myself/my behaviours and impulses.

I was Diagnosed with ADHD as a child (a misdiagnosis as my primary issues do not fit the ADHD profile, I likely do have ADHD also as I am inattentive, impulsive and disorganised but there is something else wrong with my brain)

This should be taken seriously. I am reaching out because I really can’t think of any other way acquire the in-patient treatment I need in order to live the rest of my life at peace and to help others who were born with similar conditions/born to families that exacerbated their conditions/created new conditions...

Since I was a child I have hated myself. I have always felt different to everyone else, I have never understood who I am or why I feel the things that I feel so deeply. I’ve always had an extroverted nature but I am very very anxious internally. People gravitate towards me because I am socially alluring but then quickly go away again because they realise I’m toxic. 

I’ll start with, all I’ve ever wanted is to be loved unconditionally, it’s something I’ve said in my head over and over again to myself throughout my life, I have never ever felt that love... from anyone. And I have so much love to give. I empathise with others in distress and I endure an ongoing, ever mounting  barrage of pain every single day of my life. I have spent every day just wanting to (and trying to) be ‘normal’.

So here’s the story as far as I can remember...
My parents divorced when I was 6. I was already having issues in school at this point. I’d never had any real friends, people didn’t like me because I was weird and talked too much (I think!). My mum (who I’m pretty sure is a narcissist) made me feel like I was defective as a human being, I resisted my ADHD diagnosis insisting ‘I’m normal!’ Through school, I was constantly in trouble. I was very bright, however, and this frustrated teachers whilst massively impacting my self esteem. 

I gravitated towards ‘naughty’ children as nobody else would want to be friends with me. I was just so desperate to be accepted and had such low self esteem that any friends were better than no friends. These friendships were always turbulent and/or short lived/abruptly ended, usually by them. I have nobody from either school, who are friends with me still. 

I was sent to a grammar school due to my intellectual capabilities, this was a huge mistake for me in my life. I was met with frustration, shame and anger within those walls and the shame, guilt, despair and heart wrenching pain I endured each day has continued since. I was simply unable to be like the rest of the girls. I would interrupt, behave in odd ways, had no concept of boundaries, I think a lot of people were scared of me (I wasn’t a bully, I was very intense though) have always had issues with authority and would constantly correct teachers. I would experience ‘meltdowns’ when my anxiety became too great for me to manage. I had no idea it was anxiety at the time. I just knew I hated myself and tried my best to be ‘normal’ and stick at life. I must have said ‘I want to die’ 100 times per day on average in my head. This is really difficult to admit and I’m finding it very hard to bring myself to write specifics.

I’m waffling a little now so I’ll kind of bullet point this part.

I feel I have PDA autism as the profile literally fits me like a glove - every single symptom I have. (I have grown out of this slightly as I’ve got older although I still present certain symptoms now, depending on my anxiety levels and comfort at the time) 

I have always been very good at masking my behaviours, however the act is always short lived as eventually I have an outburst. Coupled with frequent displays of inappropriate speech/behaviour. 

I have behaved in shocking ways when people have treated me badly. I have ruined friendships and relationships.

I have had difficulty maintaining jobs.

I get obsessed with people and my mental health and self esteem temporarily seem to ‘repair’ when I have a close person in my life, as I value myself as they value me. And all is right with the world when I have a friend.

I have been called controlling, intense and bossy.

I’m very charismatic initially and whenever I’m relaxed and happy. 

I have always had mood swings.

I have always resisted the everyday ordinary demands of life. 

I do feel like there are 2 ‘sides’ of me. There is me that is where my morals, values and desires lie- this side knows I am good and capable. And there is my emotional self which I have little control over- this side tells me that I am a bad, defective human being who will never be happy and would be better off dead.

I have had substance misuse problems and engaged in risky behaviours.

I have trust issues and abandonment issues.

I do not think I have borderline personality disorder, I do not fit the profile, although I do share some of the traits. Which leads me to...

I feel that I have developed C-PTSD as a result of my perceived trauma. I have certain triggers that cause my mental health to spiral. I am tortured by flashbacks of traumatic situations I’ve faced and the various people who have edited my life. I am driving myself insane thinking of all the failure, I feel completely empty and have no joy apart from when someone is there to fill the void.

I have got to the point in my life where I feel like a complete failure and like I’m losing my mind, I really need intervention but as I have spent so many years essentially pretending to be normal and none of the adults in my life got me any help when I was younger, I’ve gone untreated for such a long amount of time and have lost myself. 

I want to be an amazing mum to my son. I was better when he was younger and things were more stable for me. When me and my ex partner broke up my life was turned upside down. (He lied and stole from me a lot) I am now starting to struggle, especially with him having meltdowns now himself. 

Please excuse the lack of information and all be waffling. I don’t know how I’m supposed to explain what’s in my head as I’ve never told anyone the truth about my feelings or my past, people only know what they have witnessed, and as I’m an only child with a small family and have few friends who don’t know eachother, it’s been easy for me to go under the radar. I’m burning myself out even writing what I have, it’s so so hard for me to actually articulate the things that I’ve experienced or the amount of pain, confusion and shame I’ve carried with me for the past 25 years. It would be easier for me to answer questions really than tell the whole story of my life so I won’t go into great detail, as it’s also very personal and should really be spoken about with professionals.

Each situation that has occurred has caused me so much suffering and added self hatred, I’ve always felt like I was defending myself. I know I’m not blameless but I have asked for help from family on numerous occasions and attempted suicide in my teens (I suspect my mother is a narcissist, she was emotionally abusive and neglectful and remains so to this day, my dad is amazing, so loving, but in denial about my mental health issues as he views me as perfect- and I’m pretty sure he’s autistic too but not PDA. If it wasn’t for my dad, I would not be here today). I have been on antidepressants and anti Anxiety medication, however this wasn’t what I needed to recover, I have still remained the same and although the pattern has got less turbulent as I’ve grown older, the issues do still remain. Maintaining a healthy relationship is a hue, huge struggle for me. And finding healthy, happy people who understand and would support me in my difficulties is damn near impossible, especially since so many are ignorant towards mental health issues and as I don’t even have a formal diagnosis it’s impossible without telling my life story which I can only really see in visions in my mind, forming words of the feelings is so hard. 

I just really want to know whether there’s anyone who is doing research on this condition who would like to diagnose and study me or who offers pro bono support for people like me. I feel like I need in-patient treatment (I cannot afford private) as my mental health has recently declined to the point that every day I think about killing my self. However, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to leave my son, I just feel that I am defective and will never be happy nor be able to be a good mother due to my mental health. I need to be stable so that I can provide him with the best care. I am at the end of the line. Due to having ADHD, attending appointments can be hard, maintaining medical care can be difficult, especially when I am feeling better (I have periods of time where I’m more stable, and periods where I completely spiral, with frequent issues even during my good times) 

Although I’ve done a good enough job of pretending to be normal to not be sectioned and remain free and independent- Everyone I’ve ever encountered knows there’s something not right about me, some of them are aware of the depths of depravity I’ve reached, a lot would describe me as toxic, and my behaviours can be toxic, I can’t live on being toxic and confused and in pain. A diagnosis for me under the NHS will likely take me years, and with my other conditions, will likely be near impossible for me to maintain. I feel that if I don’t get help now that I will end up losing my son and killing myself. I feel like I had so much promise to be successful at something but have never had the opportunity to actually make it happen for myself. The issues with ADHD make it impossible for me to be self employed or run my own business and I have an intense desire to work and be self sufficient.

I am happy to answer any questions you may have, I hope I’ve given enough information and it doesn’t just sound like I’m self diagnosing. I know that I have PDA and suspect C-PTSD. If there is any advice or signposting at all I would be so appreciative. I also am happy for you to share this in other subreddits or tell me which ones so that I can post it in there. Due to my social obstacles, deciphering appropriate subreddits is not one of my strengths and I struggle to navigate reddit for this reason. I apologise if this doesn’t belong in here. If you could point me in the right direction it would be really helpful. 

If you’ve got to the end of this... thanks for reading :)

64,"Hi all! I have a long one but it's an issue I need some real help on! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have depression &amp; some other issues that come along with it that I would rather not share publicly. I want to be a police officer so I am balancing a desire to get my depression under control &amp; avoiding treatment because I don't want it to be counted against me in hiring. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing great lately &amp; hope to get a remission diagnosis soon. But I'm apprehensive about seeing a psychiatrist again.

&amp;#x200B;

 My first psychiatrist *tried* to diagnose me with something pretty serious that would completely ruin my chances at a career in law enforcement, so I asked him to refrain from putting it on my medical record as I didn't think it fit my experience and wanted to discuss with friends and family first. I thought if he was correct so be it but if not I don't want to deal with those consequences that he would never have to see. When I voiced concerns about my medical records to him he brushed them aside and just said ""maybe you'll find something else to do (than police work)!"" 

  
Psychiatrist completely broke my trust and put the diagnosis on my medical records anyway, albeit in the notes saying my depression was ""likely caused by it."" The diagnosis was wrong as confirmed by other mental health professionals. 

&amp;#x200B;

My therapists (I've been to a lot lol) have never expressed apprehension towards me pursuing law enforcement, just agreeing with me that I need to have a very good management of my symptoms before I even get close to entering the field. I like to think this is because they see me as a whole person beyond my depression but not sure if that is the case.  

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to any mental health providers who might be here, or pts with similar experience: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do therapists lie to their patients? If you had a patient who wanted to pursue a career like law enforcement would you voice your concerns or keep them to yourself? Not sure if my therapists are genuinely ok with my goals or just pretending. 

2.   Are psychiatrists really there to help us? Because mine did not help me. If anything he made things worse and I dropped out of treatment entirely because of him (resumed later). Felt like he just totally disregarded my agency as an adult. I feel like psychiatrists see pts as disorders and not as whole people with like, dreams and goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

3.  Any tips on getting better at trusting my therapist? It is a barrier to treatment for me to be suspicious of them and afraid what I say will end up on my medical record. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Psychiatrist did thing that upset me, don't trust mental health care providers are there to help me or being honest with me about my issues, would like insight from providers and patients who've been through similar.  

&amp;#x200B;

It's hurting me inside to a degree that I can't cope with anymore. From the outside I'm doing well, and I have enough energy to do things, but emotionally I'm completely nuts. I don't have problems with regulating my emotions, as in, I have extremely high inhibition and detach it from my actions, but it is driving me to suicide.

My loving and caring parents, supportive friends, and wonderful colleagues who care about me and push me towards greatness. None of them know exactly to what extent how I’m feeling and have been feeling for a long long time. I don’t want to tell them because I don’t want to burden them with whatever my mental illness is.

67,"Okay so I’m a younger person on here, just to preface;

Anyway, I know I have some type of anxiety because I have almost all the symptoms (just started going to a mental hospital or whatever it’s called (therapist?) idk) but every time I go out (which is rare for me) i have to be around a family member or friend or I will start to panic. Also when I say rarely I mean like I don’t go out for a week or two, sometimes three at a time,


But here’s one thing that I don’t know what it is, I get angry pretty easily and I just bottle it up (to not a full on breakdown or explosion but like I will bring it out on like my dad for example) but I don’t know why, and I don’t want to but it just happens, does anyone else do this, I don’t want to name anything cause I legitimately don’t know what it is,

Another thing, I like to be alone and I’m not sure why, but even though I like to be alone (this is only when I’m alone or at night) I get super super paranoid, like for example I’d just be walking around my house just listening to music singing it and I’d see something in the corner of my vision and when I look at it it goes away, that happened when I was in my parents room same thing listening to music just with my cat and I get paranoid that someone’s behind the door and get really shaky, sweaty and scared, I looked it up and it’s a symptom of schizophrenia but I don’t believe I have that cause that’s the only thing I have for it, (therapist has asked if I hear thing and I said no cause I don’t but I don’t know if I should of said I keep seeing things though) yeah.. that’s it.. I just want some answer if you have any.

70,"I feel like this is a stupid question because this is something that I think kids can do but I just turned 20 in November and I realized I never knew that self soothing was a thing until recently. Is it weird that I might not know how to calm myself down when I feel overwhelmed?

I don't think I have any proper coping skills.
Sometimes I'll get a thought in my head or I'll see something that ends up making me feel sick to my stomach and lightheaded. I'll also get weird rushes of emotions. I always start out distressed and crying and then I get angry at whatever is making me distressed and then at myself for letting myself be distressed over something minor. Sometimes I lose my balance but it's rare. By the end of it I'll be shaking and feel nothing like I'm not even in my body or like my body doesn't belong to me. The entire time I also have trouble breathing and because of that it makes me feel like I'm dying or losing control. 

On some occasions I might end up becoming violent and lash out if I'm with someone else or a group of people. That usually only happens when I'm with my family though because they really don't know how to leave a person alone. I don't have much privacy at home. When I'm with friends I can just go back to my dorm and ride it out by myself and then sleep it off. The only thing is it's starting to impact my college life. I feel like I can't even walk outside becuase I might get this wave of overwhelming emotions and feelings of physical sickness. Every time I feel like I can't control myself or my feelings. Especially when I'm not in my dorm, I feel like I don't have a safe place on campus to retreat to if this feeling comes on because my residency hall is so far from the academic buildings and the library (where I spend most of my free time in between classes). I'm basically fucked if I'm with other people. If it does happen, though, I usually try to run to the nearest bathroom so I can be by myself at least. 

But besides becoming so emotionally overloaded that I end up overly tired and sometimes even pass out from the pure exhaustion of bawling my eyes out for 15+ minutes if I become overwhelmed, I don't have many ways to calm myself down. In high school I discovered cutting was effective at redirecting my mind to a physical pain, but I ended up losing all of the razors I used to use so I haven't cut since sophomore year. The only other ways of self soothing I can think of are rocking, shutting down and everything starts to feel weird like I'm floating (I think dissociating?), and a new thing I started doing recently is squeezing my upper arms really tightly and running my dull fingernails across my skin. Sometimes my arms bleed a little, but I pick my fingernails a lot so they're usually pretty dull and worn down. 

I also don't really have any way to prevent these thoughts that cause me to become overwhelmed. My brain doesn't really have an off switch or a calm down setting. Everything is nonstop from the moment I'm awake to the moment I'm not. I don't ever really get good sleep because of this. My brain is either awake or it's not. I've never known a good night's sleep. So I pretty much never know when a thought will overwhelm me. 

The only thing that I can think of that can bring me back to reality is watching Jenna Marbles on youtube and playing a puzzle game or cooking mama on my phone. Listening to music can help a little, but I usually end up thinking too much if I'm listening to music. 

Is this normal? I feel like this is probably something that isn't normal. Are there ways to self soothe that don't involve running to the bathroom to privately deal with my emotional tides? Or completely avoiding going outside in general? Is there something that's causing me to feel sick? I don't think it's my schoolwork I have a pretty easy schedule and I'm not taking a hard major. Moving to a different state wasn't hard on me either. In fact, getting away from my family was probably good for me. They can be a bit too much to handle sometimes. But do you think I could be homesick? Do I need to drop out and go to a state college at home? Am I just overthinking everything?

72,"I don’t know where to post this but I hope I can get an answer here. All my life I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety. I’ve never taken it seriously, due to the fact so many people rely on me and me being me decided hey, don’t worry about your mental health, you have a husband, four kids, parents, friends etc who need you. This was part of my anxiety obviously and I now know sounds stupid. 

Anyways the point of this post is a couple of months ago my pre teen told me he was suicidal and wanted to kill him self because he wasn’t happy. He told me this in front of his principal at school. Because I’ve been such an idiot, I was blind to my son being in severe pain because I was caring about others. All of a sudden, something clicked in my brain. I started blaming my self for every little thing I had done for my son to be in this pain. 

On top of blaming my self, I could also pin point what I had done to my child and what caused it, and I also could understand what caused his pain and why he had acted a certain way before I had reacted to what he did. 

For example, my child would yell at his brother and sister to be quiet and I didn’t understand at the time why he was yell, but now I realised it was because he had seen me yell. But I was yelling at him to be quiet at that time, because I get over whelmed with loud noises. I remember every little thing, from his reaction to my reaction and what caused it. I also understand that it was my anxiety that has rubbed off of him, from me.  I also now, do not get overwhelmed with loud noises, because I know that’s what had caused my anxiety. and I don’t want my kids to feel my anxiety.Before, I could never pin point my anxiety. But now I know what is causing it. Before it even happens? If that makes sense?? I can stop my anxiety from happening. How is that possible? 

I now know my anxiety hurt my child. It’s like my mind and  body have gone into defence mode and is stopping my anxiety from coming? I don’t even have heart palpitations anymore. I don’t have any anxiety symptoms, but right before I have a trigger, I understand THATS the trigger that used to cause my anxiety. 

I’m also recently empathetic, I can feel your pain. I can feel your pain and pin point where the pain is coming from. Your emotional pain I mean. I’ve never felt this before. I now know what my child is thinking when ever they are upset or something happened at school. And they freak out with how do I know. I don’t know! But I don’t know what to do

74," A little background info about me: I'm a nearly 30 y/o, white male in Canada with a decent career in its early stages. I live alone in a one bedroom condo and have a vehicle.  I work a rotating shift at a 24/7 operation and work nights frequently.  The extent of my social interaction is limited to brief, work-related discussions or small talk with colleagues, and occasionally being flipped off by another driver on the commute to work.  Literally all of my spare time is spent smoking weed and playing videogames, and whether or not this is a product or a cause of my current situation has honestly become blurred to me.

 About 2 years ago I fell out with my last close friend, citing his drug abuse and resulting financial situation, which meant I was always paying for us to go do stuff. The few friends I had prior to this I also viewed as detrimental to my mental wellbeing and dropped them for the same or similar reasons.  

 I was never a social adept, making friends has been a challenge for me since as long as I can remember.  I find it very difficult to connect with people, everything feels so superficial, forced, fake and self-motivated.  Naturally, when all of the problems seem to involve one particular thing (myself), you remove that from the equation to try and solve the problem.  Isolationism seemed the best solution, but it feels like that is slowly eating me away on the inside.

 Understandably, my lovelife is also a disaster.  I am extremely jealous and needy, just to name a few of my more serious transgressions against the institution of romance.  No doubt these things stem from my many veiled and few slightly more surface level insecurities.  In a few more recent attempts at dating, I've caught myself being emotionally manipulative/abusive.  Self awareness doesn't seem to put a stop to the behaviour though.  It feels too deeply rooted for me to expel.  Even just thinking about past relationships, those toxic emotions well up and all rational thought just flies out the window and I disgust myself.  I catch myself trying to play the victim in situations where I'm likely causing more harm to the other person than they are me.  I seek sympathy and comfort when rejected, even from those who rejected me.  This is something that bothers me a lot. I don't want to be that kind of person but don't really know how to work on it without practice, and I find that more destructive than anything so instead I just avoid the possibility of relationships entirely.

 My thoughts tend to get muddled and contradictory the more I dig into it so I'm going to stop there.  I should probably seek professional help, but I feel like they won't tell me anything useful.  I already have an idea of what I need to do to at least mitigate some of my issues, such as quitting weed and developing healthier habits etc etc etc.  I don't think that will help me be a better person and so I will still isolate myself.  I justify this lifestyle by believing that it enables me to live this way without letting my depression get out of control.  I personally believe it keeps me relatively level, even if it's only a temporary fix, it works.

 In short, I'm not afraid of people.  I come across as passably confident, well-read and charismatic (or so I've been told).  My hypothesis, based on no formal education in mental health or brain chemistry whatsoever, is that what stops me from wanting to pursue relationships (platonic or otherwise) seems to be the realization that I'm the same kind of toxic shitty person I've been trying to get away from since college.

I have been suffering from what I believe to be severe anxiety for quite a long time-to a certain extent, for as long as i can remember really. I am about to turn 27 and I have been on anxiolytics for about a year. 
When I was 12 I lost my little sister from cancer. She was 5. It was a very traumatic experience in my life which has not really been dealt with by anyone at the same cause my parents were telling me they would simply start crying if we mentioned it. So I got very close friends and instead of going through a healthy mourning period, I think i just considered my friends my new sisters (unconsciously) and made it worse for me that way. 
My mental health has definitely gotten worse since Ive been in relationships. I have tried seeking help from Codependent anonymous meetings as it seemed to me at the time that my dependence on my boyfriend was related to my fear of losing people and needing constant reassurance. 
I go through phases where I am feeling okay and very hopeful that I will forever stay with this person and I even talk about marriage and children, to phases where he doesn’t quite meet the expectations i seem to have from him (or doesn’t show the affection I believe i should get) and there is a voice in my head that manages to completely convince me that I am with the wrong person and then, I lose complete control of myself. I become over the top sad, as if I had nothing to do on this planet if he didn’t want me. I cry for hours. I panic (literally I feel fear!) and it takes me hours to get over it. 
Recently it’s been happening almost everyday and I am just very lucky that he is still by my side to this day. 
I don’t particularly get depressed by anything else than my relationship though which is why I have always thought that bipolar was not what i was but I have come so close to breaking up or hurting myself that I want to be sure and hear people’s opinion. I have not the budget to seek help from a professional. 
Ive done a test on a website called psycom and the questions i was asked to determine whether or not i should consider looking more into it were, if i have moments where having sex seems like a priority and yes, it definitely is a trigger for me when i am being denied sex and im not sure why. I also go from moments of excitement and energy to very low moods where i want to sleep and just forget about the world. Sometimes i feel very confident and almost arrogant, sometimes i wonder what people see in me. 
Please let me know what you think. Thanks",03Dec2018,1
76,"I do not if this is the right place to post this.

I was raped a few year back, and stalked for 1.5  years. I did not get help because i thought that it was my own fault, so I  just ignored all my feelings. I had a burn-out 1.5 year back, i had  therapy for a while, but then i stopped. I did not talk about the rape,  because it did not think about it as a problem.

But now I was still not getting better and again i'm in therapy. And i  started talking and told my therapist last week.Now it all come back,  and I'm shaking most of the day, have nightmares, can not think about  anything else. I had the feeling that he is standing in my room when I'm  sleeping.

​

Last weekend, I was out with my best friend. And told her about it. I  told that I have an image in my head, but that his face is blurred in  that image. Then I try to fill in his face, with another memory of his  face that popped into my head. I got really scared to that second memory  with his face. I remines me of a face/smile you see in horror movies.

The moment I told my friend, I had a feeling that he was standig  behind me and I panicked. It was not just a feeling, but in my head he  really really was standing behind me.

When I turned my head around he obviously was not there. That moment  really scared me, and i have the feeling that i'm getting crazy.",03Dec2018,1
77,"I’ll preempt this with my mental illnesses just in case this helps. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2, social anxiety, ADHD and Aspergers. 

Today has been shit. I was irritable all day with no reason. I get to my parents this afternoon and shit gets worse. My parents start on me about how much I pay for meds (severely subsidised by the veterans affairs) and demanding that the little I do pay, about $26 for $300 worth of meds, that I bill the govt for it. Bill the fucking govt! 

Then my mum, to my face, insinuates that my mental illness is not worth shit by flat out telling me “the therapist only keeping you going for the money”. I don’t know what happened. I have dissociated before but this felt different. It was like everything got fuzzy and the part of me that is me took a mental step back and watched the rest of me start on about my mental illness. My vision wasn’t clear and I felt like I was swaying. My voice sounded weird and was going way quicker than normal. 

The words were coming out in a flood and the part inside was screaming and begging to stop. I told her about how dark I have been, the near suicides I’ve had, the ideation and self harm. Never really got a response. Just like I told them my therapist and psychiatrist highly recommended I go inpatient for a couple of weeks. She just looks at me a couple of seconds then turns around like she never heard me. 

I leave and I’m still like that for say another hour. Afterwards I feel like shit. Hands wouldn’t stop shaking, head spinning, heart thumping, barely breathing, feeling near ice cold despite the hot weather here. I felt like throwing up but couldn’t. I had the same feeling but in my brain. It felt like I was creeping up on a panic attack that wouldn’t happen. I was all but begging for it to happen just to get it over with. This subsided but came on and off in smaller hits for the next 3 hours. 

I am having severe self harm urges and some pretty strong suicidal ideation.

What should I do? I still feel sick and the only thing I can think of is to drink and I really don’t to do that. I really don’t know what to do. If anyone has advice it would be very much appreciated.

Feels like:
- just ‘zoomed back in’ to life after zooming out for a second, although don’t experience the zooming out part, just zooming back in (not a visual thing tho)
- like my brain just recovered from a glitch or a lag
- kinda déjà vu ish, but not just plain déjà vu
- I’m not aware of my brain during the actual ‘lag’ if there even is one, but I will suddenly feel as if I’ve just re entered reality after this ‘lag’.
- it only feels like I’ve been out for 1 second.
- happens a few/many times over a period (hours, days), then won’t happen for weeks. I think it’s related to food sensitivities.

It’s not really a big deal and this might not be the place to post it but it kinda frustrates me that I don’t even know how to google something like that, and no one ever understands what I’m talking about.

Anyone know what this is or have had it before???

80,"Hello all. So, long story short, around 12 years ago in college I started getting panic attacks. They were very physical in nature, beating racing heart, dizziness, intense impending sense of doom, blurry vision, etc.

It was a miracle I actually graduated, and it took me a little bit of time but I finally committed to getting on Lexapro because I knew I couldn't live a normal productive life with those panic attacks.

Lexapro was a god send. I remember the long period I was on it as one of immense productivity and accomplishment, 100% panic attack free.

After a conversation with my doctor, with panic attacks a distant memory in my life, we agreed to slowly taper me off Lexapro late last year. I tapered off over the course of 4 months or so. I didn't suffer any extreme side effects. I was doing well up until a month ago.

So here's where my current problem comes in - I also started drinking around 2010 and that's been a separate battle for me. I'm almost a month alcohol free and want to be 100% alcohol free for the rest of my life.

A month ago I slipped up and relapsed. The mental anguish of my relapse triggered something up in my head and I've been launched into a major depressive episode/incessant anxiety ever since.

It won't end. My head currently feels empty from the trauma of the relapse, I'm anhedonic and have zero interest in anything anymore.
I'm waking up in the morning with tense physical anxiety. My stomach is always in knots when I wake up. My body and brain are exhausted. I've pumped more cortisol through my body this last month to fire a rocket to the moon.

I'm ready to get off this train. Every day is simply unbearable. The emptiness, the hopelessness, the blank mind...I don't feel like myself anymore. I don't even feel human, combined with the intense physical anxiety that's just so uncomfortable.

There is a ""will"", a ""soul"", a ""me"" inside me that wants this suffering to end so I can get on with my life. Right now that ""me"" is behind the wheel of a broken car. I push the gas pedal all the way down to the mat and the car sputters forward. It's not the shiny new Porsche I was driving years ago.

My family is telling me they think I should go back on my Lexapro. They remember how well I did on it...I remember. I do want my old self back.

What scares me is I've read all these articles that say that reinstatement doesn't work. That it can result in something called kindling. That it can make things worse. Honestly, if my depression and anxiety was any worse than it is now I couldn't handle it.

So what should I do? I'm going to talk to a doctor but I thought I'd ask for some insight on here first.

I did so well on Lexapro, but is it true reinstatement doesn't work? Should I try reinstating again? What other antidepressants are good for anxiety and could relieve my symptoms?",03Dec2018,1

I'm ashamed that I don't know what kind of career I want. I'm ashamed that I don't have an idea of what my ideal life would be like other than the vague ""be happy and have a social life.""

86,"Hi! First time user here.
I've been reading stuff on reddit for a while, but i've never actually made an account. Recent events have lead me to post some personal problem here after following other users problems and your responses. 

I've had some mental problems of my own for most of my life without the knowladge of my family (secret visits to the psychiatrist) and recently i've found out my brother has them too. 

Some background first. Our family is one of the most disfunctional families. About 10 years ago, when i was 9 and my brother was 4 our parents got divorced. It was pretty ugly and i was used by my mother to revenge her, because my dad didnt want to live with her. She convinced me to not have a relationship with my dad and made me hate him, as well as myself. She even made me run away from home (her idea). Always me and never my brother. Their relationship is fine now, but it did leave consequences, for example me amlnd my dad don't have a functioning relationship and for the most part it's completely akward, plus my stepmom is a bitch, but thats another story. 

My mom is the main problem here. Apart from the whole thing with the divorce, she is a completely horrible person, with no regards to others. She never admits she's wrong and, if you say she is she'll start yelling at me and my brother for being stupid and making fun of her. She often gets drunk and screams at us in the middle of the night. Whenever one us got a bad grade she resulted in phsycal and verbal abuse. The punishment she and my dad would agree to was never practiced in our house (we mostly live with her), so after the screaming period was over, we could do whatever we wanted without bothering her when watching tv. I could go on, but i'm sure you get the picture. 

A year ago, after droping my brother to camp in which he didnt want to go (he doesnt have great social skills) he told me he wanted to commit suicide. I told my dad, because he is usually the common sense kinda guy, in hopes he is gonna do something about it. He didnt. Another year passed and my brother still isn't doing good in school, he never wants to to things, he cries when given a simple task. He is constanlty grounded and in need of academic help. He would often talk to me about why we exist and the concept of death. That is a lot for a 13 year old kid. But recently he told me again he wanted to commit suicide and i told him we need to tell mom and dad, he needs to get help. He doesnt want the attention and thinks things will get more complicated if he expresses himself. 

I cant cope with myself, if i know he is always thinking about that and is refrencing it whenever im around (gun gestures with his hand, like shooting himself). I'm a first year law student and things are hard for me as it is, with dealing with mental problems. I cant concentrate to study if every single thing i think about is my brother. I really dont know what i can do. I was thinking about telling my parents, but we've had many converstaions about this and NOTHING has changed. The unhealthy relationship with our mom is continuing and he hates our dad for setting boundaries, when having none at moms place. 

I would really appreciate any advice or help, as i am hopless right now.

87,"Backstory: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in high school. I was sexually assault once in college and additionally experienced another time where someone attempted to assault me but I got away. These were both traumatic experiences and I’ve always kind of repressed these experiences/feelings. Now that I’ve graduated and I’m out of college and in the workplace I am starting to think a lot about it. I’ve started noticing my depression/anxiety is acting up again.

There is another therapist I found who doesn’t have much DBT experience  but has availability for after work hours.

93,"Hello,

I am in the middle of my PhD (Comptuer Science/Biology crossover) and feel like I'm burning out.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a bit of history. I have always been a ""high-achiever"", during particularly well in my Bachelor's and Master's, engaging in multiple extracurriculars, always had a healthy circle of friends, etc. Between my Bachelor's and Master's, I was diagnosed with OCD/intrusive thoughts. After my Master's, I started a career in investment banking and was diagnosed (on top of OCD) with mild Autism, ADHD and severe anxiety. The company I worked for was extremely supportive and made all the required adjustments (and more than that, I had a great manager), but I left anyway after a year to begin a PhD. I truly love my research, and a few months ago passed my first year review with flying colors. However, I feel I am at a breaking point. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to my research, I have been doing \~15 hours per week of teaching assistant duties (teaching, labs, marking...), plus \~7 hours a week of my own private giving tuition as a freelance. At peak times, this was more like \~20 hours a week of TA and \~10 hours a week of private tuition. So, between 22 and 30 extra hours on top of my PhD research.

I try to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I go to dance classes 3-4 times a week and to the gym \~3 times a week. I try (and mostly succeed) at getting \~8 hours of sleep a night, and in the past months have made a clear effort at cleaning up my diet and life. In short, I feel I am ticking all the boxes to ""take care of myself"" but, alas, it appears the past 7-8 years of intense work have finally caught up with me.

Lately, I have found it increasingly harder to get up in the morning. This is mostly due to difficulties falling asleep at night (I can't really fall asleep before 2am-3am, my OCD kicks in then and forces me to check things like the door, having turned lights off, etc. multiple times. I see the worsening of the symptoms as a signal something is not right). Further, while before I could really engage with my work and was super-productive I now dread having to make changes to my code and re-run experiments. Even though the worse bit is behind (lit review, getting the project approved, building the initial codebase...) and I even have a paper ready for submission, I feel utterly and completely drained. I find myself wasting a lot of time literally doing nothing...

&amp;#x200B;

I had sort of anticipated this, and have planned a long trip between Christmas and January amounting to about 6 weeks off. (Properly off). This has already been signed off by my supervisor, who is happy with me being ahead of schedule.

I do MMA fighting. I have a black in Jui-Jitsu and a brown in Muay Thai (I don’t like the belt system, I believe in experience. I’m my case 5 years.)I’m  well built and working hard to prove her wrong. But still it’s not enough. 

I feel like I’m worthless and not Love-able. Broken hearted. I can’t be fixed. 

I get denied by every girl who so ask out. Or I just get left at the dinner table with a text saying “Something came up. Sorry”. At least I get in a good meal. 

However, I lost my appetite. And I’ve been losing more battles in life. My moms behavior has gotten worse, with her taking my computer tower, saying I need to go to more church. 

I need help. Please.

108,"I’m in the process of separating/divorcing my husband. As I think back on our relationship, and endure our living situation, it’s becoming more apparent to me how mentally absuive he is. 

Or, am I just being overly sensitive/upset?

As to why we are divorcing, I had reached my breaking point. Long story short, we moved across the country as a unit. I had been saying I wanted to move, he had an opportunity to do so with his job. He actually initiated the move and it happened a lot sooner than I ever expected. For the 2 years in our new city, his attitude has changed. Frankly it seems to me he’a having trouble adjusting being so far from his family and he’s constantly thrown it in my face. That we moved for me. (Last time I checked, there were 2 people here who made a choice.) I feel that he’s been less attentive, less concerned about my feelings and needs, and extremely self absorbed. This has caused us to disagree when it comes to pretty much everything. I’ve asked him if he wanted to move back home, he said no. I’ve done everything I can to be gentle with his possible having a hard time adjusting. He’s traveled back east many times on his own (specifying he doesn’t want me to come). He’s had family visit (at less than ideal times) and I’ve entertained them. 

My breaking point was in the summer  for my birthday. For me, it’s been 2 years of constant change- with the move and chang of career (and dealing with a moody husband) My work life has been nothing but an ongoing transition. I also deal with anxiety so I just needed a break. I really didn’t feel like doing much for birthday (we usually take a small trip for it) but I forced myself to. Thinking it would be nice to get away for a few days and that might be just what I needed. 

I also share the same birthday with my brother in law. Who, for the past 10 years, I have celebrated my birthday with. I’m not the type to make it all about me and I’m pretty laid back so I’ve never had a problem with it. This year, I decided to invite my BIL with us on our trip (which required him to fly across the country) I did it because he has been recovering from a bad break up and my husband is constantly saying how he misses his family. 

We had a huge blowout on the trip. The few simple things I wanted to do were outnumbered. I was also in a mental space of wanting something laid back etc, and when we wound up in a sceney roottop bar, I expressed my disinterest and was told to stop being boring. We had a family style dinner and ,without ranting about it, basically, my BIL would grab food as soon as it was put on the table. Where I wanted to just take my time and not feel like I had to race to eat. I looked up happy at dinner and my husband asked me repeatedly what was wrong. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore and just blurted out that I felt like I was being rushed to eat and I thought his brother was being rude. That didn’t go over well and it was the beginning of the end. 

It would have been nice for my husband to recognize my state and try to make me comfortable. I realize this was an unrealistic expectation (key word) Especially when he’s just been blaming me for moving across the country, why would he care about me?

It’s been a rough few months of me hoping he would come to his senses and he hasn’t. It’s gotten worse. I’m in the process of deciding what’s best for me in terms of moving etc. In the meantime, we are still living together. 

But now, he’s doing all these things I’ve always asked him to do.  Is he doing them on purpose as a mind fuck? Because it’s really making me furious. 

Example 1: He has never cooked in 11 years. Okay, maybe breakfast a handful of times and 3 dinner attempts. That’s it. (I’ve asked him for help before. I do enjoy cooking, but gosh, it would be nice if I were the one sitting on the couch and had a gourmet meal cooked and plated for me once in a while.) 

Now, he’s going to the farmers market and grocery shopping and is cooking 3 legit meals a day. Yesterday he baked cookies. Mind blown. 


Example 2: I enjoy going for long walks near the water, not only for exercise, but for fresh air and together, it’s a nice way to reconnect without sitting on he couch in front of the tv. I’ve had to practically beg him to go wir me. His claim always was that he goes to the gym in the morning and I should exercise on my own. 

Now, he’s enjoying long walks on the beach. 

Example 3:  He never wanted to come to bed at a decent time. Like a child, he’ll refuse to join me at 10-11pm, claiming he’s watching something. If I get up 10 min later, he’s passed out on the couch, lights on, tv blaring (our space is small so that affects me in the bedroom)

Now, he’s laying in bed with a candle at 10 pm ready for bed.

109,"Male, 25

Over the past week or so I've been experiencing odd changes in my mental state. I've been slightly depressed over the past few years, but it usually only flared up once a month or so.

This week though, I've been having massive mood swings. I'll go from being fine, to suddenly thinking about suicide, and how pointless life is. 

I was a complete mess during work yesterday, had a breakdown on my commute home then got home and managed to pull myself together enough to not tip off my family. Normally when I'm not feeling great mentally, I'll go a little overboard with alcohol and get ripped on weed. Last night though, I had one drink, didn't toke, but had another breakdown when I tried to go to sleep. I woke up this morning feeling mostly fine. I'm a caffeine addict though, and I had no urge to have a coffee (and still haven't, 4 hours later). I also have zero urge to have a toke even though around this time the thought starts to pop into my head.

I don't think this is the typical ""depression makes you lose interest in things"" idea though. I played games last night and this morning and still enjoyed it. I also reviewed someone's code last night and had fun. I'm also about to do a workout that I'm pumped for.

This is starting to get exhausting, as I'm on like day 5 of dealing with this. I have no clue what triggered this, or how to ease it. I've never been an overly happy individual, but I've never been this bad.

The only coincidental thing that happened kinda-sorta around the same time was a developed a sore throat two days ago. I've never had an insignificant illness effect me like this though.

113,"Hey folks. I feel like I'm on the make-it-or-break-it point of the most important decision in my adult life. This is going to be a bit of a read. **Please be warned - contains sexual assault triggers.**

&amp;nbsp;

My sister, Abby, was 5 years old when my mother walked in on my cousin (15M at the time) sexually assaulting her. After getting the police involved, we came to learn that the abuse had been going on for over a year, was premeditated/planned, and was much ... much worse than what we saw when we discovered it. My cousin, hereby known as Abuser, confessed to everything and said that he knowingly chose my sister because ""she trusted him"" and he ""knew if he told her to keep it a secret, she would because she's a good girl"". He was charged with three felonies, which got knocked down to a misdemeanor (sexual assault &amp; battery, I think?) when he accepted a plea deal because my parents were so hurt and they didn't want to drag my sister into a court battle. He was originally sentenced to 200 hours of community service and had to take some classes. He contested the charges when he turned 18, which we fought and provided victim impact statements for, but the judge declined our pleas to add him to the sex offender registry - saying that he did not want to ""ruin two young lives"".

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward 8 years. My mom has not spoken to her sister, my aunt and Abuser's mother, in years. My mom's other sister, my aunt, is caught in the middle because she still sees both her sisters. Abuser's mother is in denial about what her son did (and you know ... confessed to) and refuses to attend any family gatherings where Abuser is not welcome. That is to say - any event me and my family go to.  So we have two Christmases, two Thanksgivings, two everything. One for the victim, one for the Abuser. The aunt caught in the middle goes to both.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm obviously pretty fucking livid. Abby is now 13, and she's smart as hell and deserves a stronger family support structure than this. Starting a year ago, my brother and I kickstarted the very painful process of writing our thoughts down - detailing everything that's wrong with our current 'system' and challenging us to do better, especially in the wake of the #metoo movement.

&amp;nbsp;

This has led to some good surprises. The aunt caught in the middle is pretty firmly on our side. My grandmother is broken to pieces, but she hates this too and admits she has no idea what to do. It's taken months and a lot of calls, but they've all agreed to attend therapy. The last step for my brother and I is to reach out to Abuser's mother and extend the invite to her as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Brother and I are not in the area, but we're coming home for Christmas and are going to be attending a ton of therapy introduction sessions to narrow down a short list. I need to know how to assess a therapist's credentials, therapy style, and general demeanor. **I need to know what to ask, or what angles I'm maybe not considering.** My primary goal is finding someone who will work to build a better support structure for Abby, but I also understand that some rifts may not be repairable. But for the first time in 8 years, my family is at least poised to try.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR; I'm going to be in town for a few days to meet with family therapists with my brother, to help heal some long-standing rifts between my family members in the wake of a horrific sexual assault. How do we know when we've found the right person for the job?",03Dec2018,1

116," 

When you see a therapist, it’s good to go in with goals in mind. Those goals can be big or small, broad or narrow. Some of my goals in the past have been “reduce depression”, “cope with anxiety”, “build a healthier relationship with food and lose weight”, “learn assertiveness skills”, “set firm boundaries with parents”, and “minimize psychotic episodes”. At your first therapy appointment, be ready to set one or more goals. Your therapist may ask you directly what your goals are, or they might let you direct the session. Either way, let them know what your goals for therapy are.

It’s important to see a therapist with whom you are comfortable, but most people are not comfortable with their therapist for the first handful of appointments with them. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous and uncomfortable in therapy at first. The hope is that you will gradually learn that you can trust your therapist. If you have a deep dislike or disrespect for your therapist right away, leave. But if you’re just nervous, awkward, or uncomfortable, then try giving them 4 sessions before you decide whether you need to find someone else. Therapy is awkward at first, especially if you grew up in an environment where it wasn’t okay to openly and honestly express emotions. If you grew up in an emotionally accepting family, therapy will be easier to dive in to. If you didn’t, then it might be a little hard to open up, but there is nothing you could say or express to a therapist that would be inappropriate or out-of-bounds. This is the one person who legally must keep your secrets and is not there to get anything out of your relationship other than employment. They are only there to help you, and they have chosen that as their life’s work.

You can say as much or as little as you want in a therapy session. I encourage you to talk about the things that are bothering you, whether it’s something that happened this morning or something that happened when you were five.

How does flirting work?"" Eventually I reached the conclusion that it was due to low esteem.

Over the months I researched how people develop low self esteem. For me the entire thing is abstract. I have never been able to pinpoint anything. There's no clear event that caused it. I did a little reading and came across one suggestion: childhood neglect (which can come in different forms).

* [https://blogs.psychcentral.com/psychology-self/2018/05/childhood-self-esteem/](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/psychology-self/2018/05/childhood-self-esteem/)

If you had a parent who insulted you and berated you then it should be no secret that your self esteem can be damaged as a result. However upon reading these articles it became clear to me that there are more vague causes such as ""**Childhood Emotional Neglect**"".

As for me, I never assumed I was neglected. However I never wanted to assume this because it sounds harsh. If you had asked me a few months ago I would've stated that I had a lonely, isolated childhood and was rarely around people (literally). I realize that sentence alone pretty much points to neglect.

However childhood emotional neglect is more about caregivers being unable OR unwilling to tend to a child's emotional needs. Therapists describe different scenarios where this can happen. For example you have a caregiver who had to work all the time in order to survive. As a result they could not be there to tend your emotional needs. Then there are parents who are selfish and choose not to tend to their child's needs.

&amp;#x200B;

**This video discusses it**

Once I arrived at this point I asked myself, ""What does this have to do with low self esteem""? The therapist in the video, and other reading I've done, paints a sensible picture. A child needs to know their emotions matter. If a child feels sadness they need a caregiver to acknowledge their pain and show that they care about the sense of pain they feel. If a child feels happiness, they need a caregiver to acknowledge this so that the child believes their happiness and joy matters. **As a result the child develops the habit of assuming their sense of self (their emotions) matters in the context of the world around them. This is self esteem.**

I know for myself I basically never assume people, strangers, or the world around me *can* care about me. So it alters my behavior. I don't take certain risks. I don't do certain things. I don't socialize. I don't flirt with women because I assume it is unlikely to result positively.

I don't know if I'm stating the obvious but I have never understood the source of my low esteem. It has always been a default feeling. Now I understand and I believe this is a really useful perspective.",03Dec2018,1

He smokes in the house and it hurts my lungs cause of the smoke and my asthma, I've told her about this but she tells me its no big deal and it shouldn't even bother me. 

All my mom tells me constantly is that I'm lazy and looking for excuses to do nothing. She doesn't believe in my ""mental health"" because I'm still young even though she has mental issues too. She says mine aren't real, even though I've been to a therapist and phycologist and have been medicated. I stopped going cause of cost. 

She constantly brings me down and hits me if I can't get out of bed, such as telling me reasons why I have no friends or why no one will date me. Talking about my appearance or weight. 
I don't know if she thinks this will motivate me to get out of bed or what not but its just tearing me down even more.

I understand she has her own problems, but I feel as if I don't even have a mom anymore other than a bully. She never talks to me when shes home and she constantly wants me to spend the night somewhere else cause she doesn't want me to be home. 

I just recently turned 18, and I'm trying to better myself. I've just turned legally into an adult and I'm trying to get my shit together but there's no one in my life to support me. 

My old friends are telling me I won't be anything if I drop out and get my GED or if I stay a year behind in highschool. (because of attendance) 
My dad I haven't talked to in months and my other family has been distant. 
The only person I see frequently is my mom, but I feel isolated. 

Sometimes I'm glad im alone, but recently I've been feeling like I need someone here for me or else I'm going to rot away in my bed. I've considered going to a mental hospital because of my sucidal thoughts and such, but my mom claims I'm going to make it worse for her if i go and that I'm just going to get her in even more trouble than I already have. 

Anytime I try to get help it seems like she doesn't want me to get it and just blames it on me being lazy, selfish, and says that I don't care for no one but myself. 

My mom has threatened to take away my cat and at this point I'm only alive because of her. She gives me a reason to wake up but if my mom were to take her away i don't know how I'd be. 

At this point i just feel hopeless and cornered. 
This is more so a post of venting and I probably seem selfish and gross. I'm sorry haha. ",03Dec2018,1

130," I have had one anti-psychotic that has worked. It is called Rexulti, and  it is very expensive. I've used other anti-psychotics, but they never  worked and made me feel like garbage at the same time. I was able to  complete a good trade school on it, but right as I was about to finish,  the unthinkable happened: I turned 26 in the United States, was on my  parent's health insurance, and relied on (very) expensive medication to  not be psychotic. So now I'm saddled with the job search while I'm  hearing constant voices, and the only thing that makes them go away is  moderate amounts of alcohol.  (extreme amounts, they come back) And  during the job search, I have to live with my parents. My mother smells  alcohol like a blood hound, and is concerned about my alcohol use (you  know, rightly, because I drink too much). Well, I live in a deep red  state with no expanded medicaid (hence me being off my meds), and my  mother, well... votes that way, up to and including 45. She confronted  me about my drinking today, and I told her (obviously a little buzzed,  as is my default state now) that if she wants me to stop, she should  stop voting for people who want this to happen to me. She went to her  room crying and I just don't know what to do. I don't. How do people  with untreated, or under-treated psychosis deal with it on a day to day  basis?

137,"  

I posted about my case in the past on reddit and several people sugested that I might be mentally ill/in need of theraphy. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I fell in love with a guy from School. I was pretty close to him at the end of High-School. Back then we got along very well. We also sat next two each other in four classes. During this time many people believed, that we should start dating. However we never dated, kissed, or hooked up. (I never had a boyfriend, dated, or had sex. I never went further than being kissed by a guy on my cheek at Truth or dare. However, I had several light crushes before). Neither of us ever asked the other one out. However, many people noticed I fell for him as I showed obvious signs of crushing on him. 

So it was pretty obvious for everyone but me. I genuinely believed that I have no feelings for him.

I only realized that I love him after I learned that he got a girlfriend by the time of our graduation.

However, the next morning I had forgotten what happened and so I did not remembered that he got a girlfriend and that I love him. 

In the first time after prom everything was normal. However I became more and more lovesick. I had trouble sleeping and not much apetite. I lost weight as a result (I lost 9 lbs ;im still barely not underweight). Then I started having more and more intrusive thoughts about him. My memory gradually came back.

I only stayed in touch with him and his girlfriend over text. I was as nice to him and his girlfriend as I could be and I wrote the (far too emphatetically that Im happy for them.). Whenever I was asked by anyone I denied crushing on him.

Everyday I looked for a prolonged time at his social media profiles. I have a folder on my computer with pictures of him.

I often fantasized about our wedding, our kids or just about cuddling him.

But I more and more obsessed over him. And I texted him more and more for ever more made up reasons. I also often asked him for advice on my issues.

One day we ran into each other at the party of a mutual friend. I did not knew in advance that he would be there and I did not went to this party to see him. At this party I talked to him for full two hours, while both of us also knew every other guest, which whom we could have talked instead. 

I said several positive things about his girlfriend. 

However, shortly afterwards our graduation yearbook was published. I was shoked to learn that we won the senior superlative: cutest couple that never was. While I would love to be his girlfriend I was embarrassed that it was written there.

Still I lacked the emphaty to understand how terrible this must have been to them. So I continued to text him for the same made up reasons. Every text I send to him and every text I received by him gave me a high, like If I were taking Drugs.

Then I sent him a voicemail, in which I proposed, that we should meet for coffee to talk. In the voicemail I also said that I do not see this as a date. I genuinely did not meant this as a date. I just craved to spend time with him.

Then his girlfriend angrily sent me a message that I should leave them alone as Im freaking them out.

I apologized to her but did not admitted to crushing on her boyfriend. She accepted my apology.

I never contacted him again.

Now six months later, Im not yet over him but now I do feel guilty for stalking him and for making him and his girlfriend uncomfortable. It was honestly never my intention to hurt anyone but I realize that I have hurt them.

Yesterday I ran into my crushs best friend. I was surprised that he was super nice to me. We did not talked about my crush, but I cut the conversation short, because I felt embarrassed.

What do you think about me and my actions? Do you think my crush hates me now? Do you think his girlfriend does? Do you have any advice what I should do if I run into my crush or his girlfriend ( we live in a middlesized town, so its pretty likely this will happen)?

**TL;DR: I was unable to figure out my feelings and later I stalked my crush.** ",03Dec2018,1

This person commented below me on that sub and it triggered me even more because she was being smart alecky and telling me how to do my job and be more considerate for the workers around you and how would you like it if you were late and they had to stay behind or so and so and I was like what does that have to do with the question?

140,"I’m just looking for advice and options for others suffering. I realize I’m not the only one with these issues but for some reason as I get older they just seem to get worst and worst and I have tried almost everything besides medication to help my mental state. I’ve tried talking to therapist over the years, I had one for a year when I was 16 and I also had another one when I was 21 for almost 2 years. I’ve spend 2 weeks in a hospital being monitored because I was so depressed I didn’t know if I seriously kill myself or not. It comes and goes I waves and sometimes it’s moderate and will pass, other times it sticks with me for weeks and I can’t seem to shake my feelings of helplessness and constantly feeling as if I disappointed everyone in my life or made them angry at myself even when they constantly reassure me I haven’t. I am now 25 years old, I have a 1 year old son and an amazing fiancé that the marriage date is set up for March 29th 2019. She is my all, she 100% supports me in everything I do and makes me happier than I’ve ever been in life. She knows about my issues and has ways she helps me calm down and get a grip. There are other times though when she tries her hardest to and I shut her out, and I don’t mean to, I don’t want to, I want to talk to her and tell her why I feel the sadness I feel, but I can’t, because I myself don’t know why I feel sad. She’s great to me, great to our son, we both work full time and make good money and own a house together and can pay bills, so why do I feel sad at times. I get so overwhelmed in life at the smallest and most minute things. I work full time, 40 hours a week, I go to night school 10 hours a week at night, I’m a reservist in the United States marine corps, I’m always juggling around dr appointments and errands for myself and my child and other task my fiancé needs me to accomplish after work, but if she gives me 4 things to do and I only get 3 done, I stress to the point of being depressed, I feel like I can’t get them all down and I start forgetting them all completely, I cannot focus enough to get them done because I can only remember the last thing she told me, even though I fully listen, and she’s understanding when I forget, but I myself don’t understand and I don’t forgive myself, I beat myself down into a dark place like the disappoint I feel like I am and that she deserves better. Why can’t I figure out a way to get everything done and not feel like my chest is going to explode for anxiety and being overwhelmed with literally everything in life I try and do! My goals is to provide for her and that child and Ik I do but I times I feel like I don’t and it’s hard. Idk what’s going on in my head or what brings me to the dark places I go to that I can’t escape from no matter how much happiness I’m showered with and loved. Why can’t I explain to her how and I feel and that it’s NOT her fault I feel sad and depressed at times, please, someone help me",03Dec2018,1
141,"WARNING: Child sexual abuse

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR at the end

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to turn 24, and I feel I recently started having a mental and emotional breakthrough. It mostly revolves around my self-esteem and finally realizing why I'm so insecure to the point of not being able to maintain a healthy relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I was molested when I was 5. By think, I mean I was definitely touched inappropriately, but I'm not sure if it counts as abuse. My mom was a serious drug addict. She had a male friend who was always over our house for a time. Let's call him..... James. He had a son who would always come over so we could be playmates while my mom and James got high. Let's call the son Kevin. So, Kevin and I would be forced to entertain each other, unsupervised, until mom and James snapped back to some kind of reality.

&amp;#x200B;

We would always play house.

&amp;#x200B;

Kevin was older, but I don't remember how much older. I know I wasn't any older than a 2nd grader, as my mom got arrested and I went to my grandparents then. I'm pretty sure I was 5-6. I don't remember if he went to the same school as me. I know he wasn't any older than 13-14, but he was definitely older. I wanna say 10-11.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember playing with him one day, and he said ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours."", referring to our genitalia. I specifically remember being very annoyed at him for refusing to continue to play with me because I wouldn't pull down my pants. So I did it so he would shut up and be my friend again. I think he asked where my penis was and I said ""I don't have one."" Then he touched me. I think I remember it feeling good. I don't remember the other times he would touch me in detail, I just remember that we no longer played with legos or toys. He said we were like adults now. We would always touch, and he would get on top of me. It never hurt though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember a couple of times that he would pee on my stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

We got caught one day and then I never saw him again. We were in the closet touching, and my mom opened the door. I pulled me out of the closet and asked what we were doing. I told her ""We were playing hide and seek on top of each other."" My mom was furious and gave me a spanking. She locked me in her room alone for a while and I never saw Kevin or James again.

&amp;#x200B;

Kevin also knew some kids I went to school with (kids of another drug addict friend of my moms). He told them we had sex (I don't think any actual penis-vagina penetration took place). I was bullied mercilessly at school because of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this count as sexual abuse. I was 5 and he was also pretty young. I don't feel violated or angry because of it, so I don't know if I have the right to say I was sexually abused or molested as a child. It just doesn't feel like it counts, even though I know it was extremely inappropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I don't know if because we were both very young (I was 5, he was at least under 13-14), that our very inappropriate touching counts as child sexual abuse. ",03Dec2018,1

I have been having some serious intrusive thoughts regarding my ex. We broke up 13 years ago and barely thought of her since. Then, 2 months ago BAM! There she is slammed into my brain and I cannot get her out. Every free second she comes flooding back. To be more specific the day we broke up. Then I start play acting it over in my head and then conversations with her. 

And now it is starting to affect my marriage. Normally I am a master at masking my mental health so everyone thinks I am fine. But it has nearly worn away whatever was left of my sanity. I’m being distant and to make things worse, I nearly called my wife the ex’s name the other day. This has to stop. 

I just don’t get it. I have known my wife for nearly twice as long as I knew her yet this is all I have in my head. I try everything I can think of to get it out of my head but it just keeps shouldering its way back in. I’m starting to feel like I’m being disrespectful/cheating on my wife.

143,"Sorry for formatting, I am on the phone.

So, I have a friend that had gone crazy, he clearly has a mental health problem and he s refusing to get help.

It all started several weeks ago. He was working for a project for a professor from college on a restaurant (he is an architect student) and the prof didn't pay him and they had argued. And while he was working, he would do pills(mdma) and he would smoke weed. The thing is, he says that he won't finish college bcs of that professor cuz he needs something signed from him.

Nowdays everytime we meet(me, his gf[25f], my bf[20m] and him) he would start talking about how he is jesus and his father is God, things about church (because he used to be an active Christian when he was younger and changed his mind), but after that he says he is satan and a lot of things that he clearly mean(at first we thought he was joking, and laughed but nope, he says this everyday on another form) . If he can't find weed he is extremely nervous and starts screaming at everyone. He talks with everyone on the street (homeless people, dogs, everyone) 

He proposed to his gf before he gone nuts and she said yes, and now he is proposing her an open relationship, his gf isn't okay with that. He said that he just manipulated her and he likes to manipulate girls and ""seduce"" them and have sex with them, then returning everytime to her because he loves her. 

Some days ago he was caught hitting on a girl(around 17y o) and insisted that he should drive her to school, the girl refused ofc. He is acting weird on fb also, he shares profile pictures of girls i dont know.

We clearly don't know what to do.. please help.

We tried to talk to him about it but he says he isn't crazy


one time we were at his gf place and again started being nuts and we were going to leave and after my bf exited the room he locked the door, and wanna make us kiss, me and his gf... and started kissing our hands standing in knees and i opened it back and he said to my bf that he tried to kiss his gf hand and by mistake took mine. I was pretty scared... but I know this isn't him and clearly he has a BIG mental problem

And it's always the opposite for the kids in my class, they are always cold and I need to fight with them on the air conditioner.
So today I came to school and was a bit angry from the beginning (because of other reasons) and the first class were in a big room and it wasn't a regular class (we could basically move freely and talk and everything) so I went to the air conditioner and lower it to my face and right after that one of the kids shut down the air conditioner (there is a few minutes pause when you shut it down so you can't turn it back on) like a jerk while wearing a simple t-shirt and then when I asked him ""why would you do it?"" He just made an impression of my voice and kept walking so yeah, I was kinda furious. Then I decided to shut down his computer without knowing that he had a paperwork there and he gave me a hit and started wining about it so I felt bad and showed him that he can undo the shut down and went to my place.

147,"So I've been dying to brag about my weekend but no one in work asked me how it went so I thought I'd share it here. Just for some context I've been more down than usual, despite my best efforts. I'm in a strange city were I know very few people and have been struggling to find somewhere to live, so have been sofa surfing and sleeping in my car for the past three months. It's my last week in the city so I'd thought I'd splash out on an Airbnb.

So Saturday evening comes around and a woman a little younger than me knocks on the door and she's also staying in the house. She's decided to spontaneously visit the city for a night and traveled on her own,and she can talk until the cows come home. I make her a customary cup of tea and I stumble through some small talk. In a conversationly lul I bring up music and she mentions she's into Queen at the moment. I make a joke about how the Bohemian Rhapsody movie is doing its job, but she says she's never seen it and suggests we go watch it and grab some food. Which I I force myself to agree to.

As we're walking to the city centre she's talking and I'm mostly listening. 

 Everything she is saying is so personal and open. Talking about her relationships, how she has to pretent to be straight in her home country because her family disowned her for having a gf, embarrassing childhood stories, and stupid teenage mistakes. We end up going on a small detour in a little Christmas fair and it's packed and children are running amok. I'm really not comfortable and trying to put on a brave face, but she saw through that and, despite only having met me a few hours ago, noticed that I'd gotten a little more quite. She'd been so open about herself so far I'd thought I'd be honest with her and mention some of my mental health issues. She reacted like no one else has done before to it. Made sure I was okay, and made some truly sinsere compliments about the situation I was in. To absolutely no one's supprise a recently open gay who got disowned by her traditional chaltholic rural family also had some mental health issues.

We start bonding over anxiety attacks and getting more and more personal. We're two complete strangers how lived very diffrent lives in diffrent countries. It's clear that we're never going to see each other again, and can talk as freely as we want to. We very quicky dive into stories within hours that I'm still unable to even hint at with my therapist, and it ~~FELT~~ (still) feels SO DAMN GOOD!

We end up sacking off going to the movies and instead I offer take her to all the gay clubs I know. Which I almost regreted as she started introducing me to strangers as her straight stranger friend to other random strangers she managed to start talking to. I pictured myself drinking way to much in order to not freak panic in the crowds and to compensate for a lack of dancing/chatting. I'm delighted to report that was not the case. I had a great time. We both got drinks bought for us, and necked some strangers. Met some terrible people, and many more great people who were also just happy to talk about their shit to strangers. Again, I loved it.

The next morning we wondered around town again visiting a few places before she got a train home. All the while just opening up to each other knowing that our lives would never cross paths again. It was so wonderfully freeing not having to hold back anything, or worry about how they will respond. ",03Dec2018,1
148," EMDR, or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, is a partially physical treatment in psychotherapy used to reduce psychological pain associated with trauma. It involves watching a light move back and forth, tapping your hands on your legs, or holding two small vibrating paddles, one in each hand, while letting your brain relive a traumatic event. The physical component (be it the moving light, the tapping hands, or the vibrating paddles), causes bilateral stimulation. When combined with the brain’s amazing ability to make sense of complicated feelings and situations, effective healing can occur...

These days, my life is pretty much a blur to me, and i kinda just make it through each day without accomplishing anything in particular. However, I feel very sad a lot of the time, and usually there is no real reason.

I often have really bad social anxiety about daily tasks such as speaking in classes in college and even buying things in shops. My self esteem is so low and it’s common for me to think i’m just shit and nobody wants me. 

I’m just wondering if i’m alone in this, there are points in my life where things are better, and other times my mental state is very bad. 

Thank you so much for reading and I hope you’re doing well.

151,"Hey guys,

I wanted to hear your take on what is up with my brother. So for the longest time, I have noticed that we are completely different people. My brother has always played sports but was never doing that well in school. At home, he was always bugging me and making the same jokes over and over. My father would always be behind in about getting his schoolwork done, making sure he is meeting deadlines, and just constantly monitoring so that he could be a self-sufficient person. To this day, he likes to yell out random phrases he thought was funny years ago and is hard to read to someone's face. I don't think he has sufficient emotional intelligence to figure out what the vibe of the room is. Sometimes he will be the butt of a joke and will take it extremely seriously. He is very self conscious and it shows. I feel like it leaves predators an opportunity to make himself feel bad. He routinely takes stimulants for his focus, but whenever I have given him a book that I truly enjoyed he never got past the first chapter. He isn't a complex thinker by any means. I try to have stimulating/thought provoking conversations with him at dinner but it never resulted in anything that he likes. He has had a girlfriend for 3+ years but she recently broke up with him and this definitely made him a little depressed as of late. When something like this happens (it has happened before), I gave him the advice to find himself and be able to comfortable with having to rely on a girlfriend. He has cheated on her before like making a Tinder account and I think he cheated on her at a bachelor weekend party. He never gave me the details and I didn't want to hear them. Lastly, is his soft skills. He is roughly 27 years old and they still aren't refined. I would say he is a bit rough around the edges in terms of being able to converse with casual acquaintances and remember somewhat important details about other people. He is very forgetful in that he would ask me the same question he asked about a week ago for example we were at dinner at an Indian restaurant last Sunday and he asked if I thought has lost weight and then asked again yesterday at another restaurant if I had thought he lost weight. I get that you don't have to keep track of every single detail in your life but he's not really mindful of the things he says to other people. Is it just ADHD? I know plenty of people that have ADHD who are extremely well-rounded and have such an amazing mind regardless. Maybe I am overthinking this and just want to hear another's perspective on this? Would love to hear any opinions. Thanks!",03Dec2018,1
152,"Recently I’ve been having some pretty awful thoughts in my mind. I keep thinking negatively and I desperately think that I need to change myself completely in order for anyone to like me. Often, I get thoughts about suicide and whether I should do it or not, and today it got to the point where I even Googled “What’s the easiest way to commit suicide?”

Now here’s what really makes me upset. When I’m having these thoughts I keep telling myself I’m doing it for attention and that nothing I’m doing is real. My own feelings feel like they’re fake and at this point I don’t even know what’s wrong with me or if this is all some stupid fucking act. I need an answer or even just a reply from someone who may have gone through something similar, I can’t talk about this to friends or family, and I can’t see a therapist without people finding out.

Any comments would be appreciated.",03Dec2018,1

155,"i’m 12. too young to be on reddit. too young to have an account. but old enough to understand when to get help.i live in a safe, happy home with my cat and my family. one of my best friends, X, told me something at school today. i’ve always found reddit to be a community i can rely on, the majority of it anyway.

let me tell you about X

she has been diagnosed with anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, depression and PTSD.

she lives with her mam, who she sees around once a week. her mams boyfriend her older brother (21) other brother (10)

she sees her nan, aunt, uncles, and cousins weekly. she is popular, but admitted to me that she has few close friends.

X’s dad went to prison for child neglect. she can’t communicate with him other then meeting him face to face. he used to bring her to her therapist once a month, more or less. she took lexapro, but has run out., her therapist had an affair with a secretary and has closed down. her dad has been sent to prision in america for something irrelevant. he was the only person who “believed” X had mental health problems.

no one else in X’s family does.

X has always been close to her cousins, especially one. he is 2 years older then her. they used to always play with eachother. then one day he played with her differently. he raped her. he continued for 3 years.

one month later, after he stopped, X tried to commit suicide by overdosing. she stayed in rehab for 2-3 months. she missed a lot of school, but being 8 no one really minded. she had a lot of cuts on her arms where a “a cat scratched her”. she had to go to hospital regularly to get them stitched up.

X hasn’t told anyone about this, other then me and another friend who i have no contact with. she begged me not to tell anyone. this is why it is so hard for me to type this out for you, and may’ve missed a few points. please ask questions and leave advice in comments. i will be crossposting this to many subreddits, to try get as much help as we can get.

she doesn’t know i’m going this, but i did ask if i could ask anonymously to websites for help. if things get worse, we will tell our teacher. but there is only so much he can do. she is afraid to tell anyone in her family in case her cousin beats her up. also, online therapists are only so helpful.

thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.",03Dec2018,1
156,"Hi all,

I'm a 24F, diagnosed with depression, GAD and PTSD at 16 due to a turbulent upbringing. 

6 months ago, I escaped an abusive relationship that lasted two years. This impacted my whole life as I knew it, I stopped going to Uni, I quit my full time job and became isolated from friends and family. 

Since then, I have been in therapy (which has been great) but I am also highly dependant on weed. It helps to calm my mind. 

Lately, I have been smoking less as I'm trying not to numb myself and face what I'm feeling and work through it. I now have a part time job and have begun rebuilding relationships. 

Now I feel like I'm trapped in my own mind. I can't seem to focus on anything, my attention span is basically non-existent, I feel like a complete failure and completely lost. I feel like I failed myself with my education, I'm struggling financially, I feel so completely incapable of being an adult. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. I just want to scream until I can't think anymore. 

Today is the hardest day I've had in a while. I feel like my mind is ripping me apart and I can't find a way to stifle the noise. All I want to do is run and hide.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",03Dec2018,1

159,"I'm 21, male. I lie all my life. Yesterday I try to clean up the mess by telling one of the girls that a made up a story about, about my lie and how just lie for the sake of it. But today it seems like everybody knows that I've been lying to everyone and I just realized that my whole life is a lie. I'm hated by everyone. I really wanna change. But this life is too damn hard. About a few months ago I also realized I've been depressed for 3 years now. But I never knew it. I can't plan for the future. Hell, I don't know how to plan for tomorrow. 

There are days where I'm happy, there are days when I'm too sad. There are days I couldn't face people. They hated me. I seriously wanna kill myself. I'm considering of putting myself in a psychiatric ward. I've booked an appointment with a therapist with the university. The appointment should come soon, I'm going crazy and there's no point of life anymore. I can't trust my friends nor my family. I just wanted to let this out. Thanks for reading. Hope you and me will wake up soon. ",03Dec2018,1
160,"I have been depressed since high school and currently in my second year of college, I am not completely out of it. I have finals coming up and for the past few days, all I have been thinking about is who to talk to about my mental health and I haven't been able to focus on studying. I know there is only two weeks left until semester ends but I feel like I should talk to someone about it. I have a professor who I feel comfortable talking to and I feel like I should let her know how I am feeling. I know she is not a therapist but I would feel better if just one person listened to me.
