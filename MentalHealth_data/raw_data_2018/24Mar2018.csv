2,For the past 4 years I've noticed almost every time I feel stressed out or get into an argument I want to kill myself. Any friends I've ever told about this said I was just being a little bitch and I'm starting to think I am. I just want to know if this is normal or if anyone else can relate. I don't want to tell my parents about this as I don't want to to worry them so really I don't know what to do. ,24Mar2018,82,
3,"Hi all,

Just back from a night out with friends and a topic of conversation really took me by surprise.

Went for drinks with friends and at about 11 we went our separate ways. Myself and a friend decided to go for one more before our bus home together and so headed to a different pub. During the conversation mental health came up and my friend told me about therapist he saw. Naturally I was interested and wanted to hear how his experience was and if the guy was worth setting up an appointment with (I have never gone to see anyone). In this conversation my friend said that the meeting wasn't much use as he felt you would be better having the sort of conversations he had with someone you cared about and can trust. We got talking about our close friends and he said, friend A is very open, friend B is closed off but I can tell by his actions/expressions etc how he feels but you are completely closed off.

That sort of took me aback. I don't disagree with him but I don't like the idea of being closed off to the people I really care about.

It's funny, I would always describe myself as a good listener but now that I think about it, I'm a ""good listener"" because I don't want to share any of my own problems and would just rather try and fix other people's. There's one particular issue that I have been dealing with that I have only told one random person on the street that I met after a night of too many drinks but even with a throwaway account I don't want to bring up here.

I think I need to see someone. Just knowing that they are there to listen to me unconditionally might help. It's not helpful internalising all of this.",24Mar2018,1,

5,"I have not had an easy go of the last four to five years, and honestly my early life was no picnic either. a quick glance through my post history might share a small piece of an overall large and twisted journey through the beginning of my adult life, and in the last year, I've noticed something isn't right. I've pushed it down and denied it for a very long time , but over the course of the past year I've started noticing and trying to come to terms with increasingly alarming mental health issues, not only through my own thoughts but through what the people around me tell me. I'm increasingly paranoid, to the point of arguing with my significant other constantly without valid reasoning, and I don't realize until much later how much of an idiot I'm being. I have mood swings like crazy. My dreams are in the same place every night, and they go on forever and ever before I wake up. I rarely want to get up from bed and the motivation to find a job has completely dissipated. I don't know where I found the angel that is my girlfriend, she works hard to support us and puts up with the problems that I'm having, but even that I know is simply enabling these symptoms. my doctor put me on lorazepam and escitalopram and metaprolol to try and stabilize whatever the issues I'm having are, but those add a whole new list of side effects: now, occasionally, I want to kill myself so strongly that I don't understand the intensity, it comes from nowhere. I have nasty thought about hurting others ( and had these before the medications) and the thoughts scare me, because they aren't something I'd act on at all. before a few months ago I wouldn't have a thought come into my head that made me wince, but now it happens almost every day. I keep wanting to go to a clinic where I can stay and they can run tests and ask me psychiatric questions and figure out what's wrong with me, but I don't even know where to start. I have state insurance. My doctor tries his best, but when drs on duty is your primary care provider, your psychiatric care doesn't necessarily fall top notch. all I want is to be able to access psychiatric care so I can figure out what's wrong with me and hopefully get better. any advice might help.",24Mar2018,1,
6,"Sorry for the long post, I’ve just been thinking about this for a while and just wanted some advice on what to do. Posting from the UK btw.

Okay so I’ve recently left University (six months ago) and moved to a new city for my first full time job, not knowing anyone living there.

I don’t really socialise with anyone, I use to talk a lot with my housemates in my house share but I’ve found them recently saying I’ve become less social with them than I use to be.

I often drink through the week (no more than one can a day). I think it’s just a  “I have a drink to unwind” but I sometimes worry it may develop into something worse. I often just buy a four pack for the week so it’s nothing major, just wanted to make a note of it. Probs just paranoia though...

When I get home from work, I sit in my room alone and watch TV or play games by myself, not even with anyone online. I do this on the weekends too. The only people i really talk to except for my housemates and my family are one or two of my friends from uni and that’s usually once every few days or so.

I’ve found I have poor confidence and organisational skills at work (and home). It’s not a social confidence but more of a business kind, like the confidence to make executive decisions and such. I’ve always struggled with these though.

I’ve recently spent two months not leaving the house except for a few things, the only thing I recently attended was a club created by previous housemates and that happens once a month. I have met up with friends on rare occasions, but they’re often once every three months or so.

I just wanna add I do genuinely enjoy socialising with other people, despite sometimes messing up a little - it doesn’t really bother me though as I’m use to being a little awkward - but often I’ve found I’ve just chosen not to, as I I’m feeling tired and can’t be bothered to make any effort to, especially after work.

Side note - I also seem to dislike meeting new people, as that’s where I feel the most awkward - mostly when they’re around the same age as me. I find myself being very self conscious around them unless I’m with someone i know, then I’m perfectly fine. 

Most of the time I’m a positive, happy person, often joking around and cheerful but often I feel these insecurities creep up on me, mostly when I’m in deep thought. I was just wondering if this is normal or if I should talk to a professional about it. 

Tl;dr I think I might have mild depression or something similar, or maybe I’m just winding myself up over nothing and I’m just lonely.",24Mar2018,1,
7,"This is going to be pretty long so please be patient. 

Let me start off by saying that I’ve had a very traumatic life. Mental, physical and sexual abuse for many years during my teen years into my adult life. I finally left home at 18 and I have never looked back since. I always knew that I had issues with coping with my anger and my emotions. I was diagnosed with major depression earlier last year and it didn’t come as a surprise to me. I am currently on anti depressants and I have not had any suicidal thoughts. However, I still feel very low and very uninterested with life. I do not have a lot of friends and I work an office job that is not very fulfilling. 

How do I change my lifestyle to better my mental state? I have been trying to be more active and eat healthier. My doctor has told me that I will most likely have to be on anti depressants for the rest of my life. She also recommends therapy. 

How do you cope with your mental illness? Do you have any advice?",24Mar2018,1,

9,"When I was a freshman into highschool I made some friends smoking weed outside the school wood's trails. I ended up making a few very shady ""friends"". I was 14, smoking weed all day, skipping school, and slowly getting into other worst substances. I was Snorting adderal and Concerta drinking alcohol taking perc 30's, tried crystal meth a few times, would mix speed with klonopins and valium, and pretty much taking anything I could get my hands on.

At this time i was pretty much wasted 24/7. This is where the ""possession"" story comes into play I guess. What all started out as a joke turned into something very fucked up really quickly (and no I'm not claiming to be possessed I was psychotic). 

I would occasional play this ""exorcist"" type prank on my friends, well it was more of a funny sort of acting thing. At first it was like the funniest thing in the world then it got pretty fucked up really quickly. It all started out as a joke and then all of a sudden I was acting like I was really possessed, like it got dark, really dark. My friend's didn't think it was funny anymore and would tell me to stop.

All of a sudden, I realilzed I couldn't stop. It was like I had tourettes it was a light switch in my brain and I could go on ""auto-pilot"" and act like I was possessed. My so called ""friend"" even recorded a video of it and showed everyone in school.

During this time I finally decided enough is enough and I quit everything and distanced my self from my so called ""friends"". I changed schools, started getting good grades, and stayed away from all drugs. I noticed that my little ""possessed"" sessions dramatically reduced and it was like my friends were my ""possessed"" trigger. 

A couple months I felt back to normal. I have never had a ""twitch"" or ""exorcist"" moment sense then. It's been about 8 years now. But I look back sometimes and shudder with how fucked up the whole situation was and I'm afraid I'm going to go back to that ""possessed drug me"".
This is my deepest darkest secret and I plan to take this one to the grave.

Also, I don't want to kill myself but wouldnt mind dying????? Like Im so confused by these intense feelings. 

One more thing, I've been acting pretty weird for the past few months. Like I wont be hungry for 3 days, and then randomly just devour everything. Or if something is making noise near me, it'll drive me absolutely insane, to the point where I have to pinch myself to not yell at them. I also have been getting angry really quickly and I dont know why.

Even after I expressed clearly and rationally my reasons for not wanting to take it he refused to prescribe any other medications claiming either that I “probably couldn’t afford them” or that they didn’t even exist, and I was wrong about them being an option. I looked it up again after the appointment and those medications do in fact exist and are commonly prescribed. I feel so disappointed and disgusted and hopeless. I’ve never felt so disrespected in my life. Today was going to be the day that I finally got to start meds again. Just wtf.

i'mben...



my age is 34, i had these weird dreams of being in an accident and having my loving family and moving to the uS.

am i in hell? is this the eternal torment the bible told about?

i've been trying for the past hundred years to make this dream my reality, but when I'm at last feeling okay, I get sent back to the past, to the very beginning of it all.

**Listen here: lonliness is only a small part of my mental condition . it's hardly the only stressor. But it's the one relevant to my tale.**

I'm 24, mentally ill, And autistic. I'm without friends and relationships. I'm not particularly healthy for either and I've been going to psychotherapists since I was 6. 

I'm better than I was then, but being lonely sucks. I've asked out 13 women and constantly get ghosted by people I want to be my friend/hang out with. Its not their fault, but it still hurts. I guess I should have learned how to play lonliness off better, because it destroyed my mom today.

My mother and I live together, I pay half of rent and other bills. She was kind enough to drive me to work. Nice of her.  She has apparently noticed me looking at couples a lot more recently And asked me if I was thinking about a romantic life. I said I'd rather not talk about it, but she innocently prodded. Unfortunately my situation Has been very mentally taxing on me lately. My mother understands my illness but all my mental care is on my insurance and terms.

Looking back , she always tried pushing her friends kids onto me in hopes of me developing social skills, probably. Not too assertive mind you, but she'd always ""run to the store"" with her friend and assume I'd be conversing with the Person. I'm sorry it never worked out for her.

 I told my mom everything. I said my psychologist doesn't think I'm healthy enough to form healthy friendship bonds, and that intimacy is at this point is a pipe dream or quite a few years off. I said I've been going to more and more therapy but that shit dont work miracles. I am happy I didn't tell her I don't love myself yet. This was a very big mistake. She's always been concerned at My lack of friendships and relationships but since I became an adult mostly laid back. I think she got overwhelmed by lack of answers. ""You seriously never had like a fling or casual date...adult friends'? I told her no, And apparently is ok for parents to creep on your adult sex life? She thought all of those social skill classes and therapy would fix everything. 

My mother got quiet. We pulled up to my job. She asked me:  'does it bother you""? And she wouldn't take deflection well. I told her ""yeah, it does. What of it""?
""Nothing""
I got out of the car and I saw she started bawling on the way out. I've never seen my mother cry like that. I feel bad now. I can not read eyes, i Assume they were pained

I guess my fixation on trying to cope with lack of platonic and romantic intimacy just meant I set myself up to hurt my mom. I need to Find a way to comfort her when I get off work.  I fucked up bad today.",24Mar2018,5,
29,"So, a little background (which will probably be a lot of background, I can get long-winded when I'm manic [which I am right now {which should be apparent by my overuse of brackets}]):

I have bipolar disorder type 1, general anxiety, and an obnoxious and uncommon sleeping disorder called delayed sleep phase disorder. If you look that last disorder up you will sometimes see instances of people using it irresponsibly as an excuse for just being sleepy sometimes, but mine is a clinically observed irregularity that has affected me my whole life and lead me to generally sleep significantly less than the average person in order to maintain common human hours (probably a lifetime average around 4 hours a night).

As I lay awake at night as a child waiting desperately for sleep to come I began to just start thinking. I began envisioning branching chains of cause and effect, endless scenarios of projection and response. My critical thinking skills developed rapidly, and I was advanced throughout primary school. I became so obsessed with this, due to spending all of my time doing it, that I could barely communicate. I couldn't speak as fast as my mind moved. On top of all that, I have bipolar I and all the delightful quirks that come with that (though it took them a while to figure that one out).

So here's the thing. This will probably come across as rationalizing, but, even so, expressing it candidly is the way I feel I can share where my mind is truly at right now. Years of speech therapy, trauma, and heartbreak later I broke through and made my way into the professional world. 

I've been in my career about seven years now, and recently I've picked up a new skill. While I don't have the issues with obsessive visualization that I used to, and I long ago learned the techniques necessary to translate the disorganization in my mind into something that is usually comprehensible, I realized recently that I can adapt this old obsession into something that resembles a savvy business mind. However, along with this adaptation has come some bad old habits. Overeating, overspending, weird relationship stuff, etc.

Because I've tapped into this old obsession I'm falling down the hole of the aforementioned vices, but at the same time my life has never gone smoother. My wife and I are on the same page mentally and emotionally (though unfortunately not sexually), I'm using my obsessive thoughts to visualize new ideas that are getting me a lot of attention at work and I actually may be in line for increased responsibility soon.

My concern is that this is all built on bad habits, and because of that something will eventually have to give. It is hard to try to make changes to my life when it is, literally, going better than it ever has, but I'm worried I'm setting myself up for failure by using those bad habits as an unsustainable crutch. 

I'm also worried that there's too much performance in my persona. To speak up as I have been and promote ideas that even contraindicate some much higher pay grade opinions, I've had to use a lot of emotional energy. It is like I'm putting on a show, then I have to go back behind the scenes to catch my breath. I'm even getting to the point where if I'm not careful my mind gets too far ahead of my speech and I just shut down for a slightly-too-long amount of time.

Since I am harnessing the power of my unique oddity, am I actually being the true self that has always been within that I have just never been willing to share, or am I playing a dangerous game I am destined to lose? 

So... yeah. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

*Thing I have tried already:
    *Sleep specialist
       *A portion of the people with this disorder do not respond to the traditional light therapy treatment. I am in this portion. I won the lottery. Woo-hoo...
    *Psychologist
       *I've tried a dedicated psychologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist/psychiatrist, but they are never able to provide any insight that I hadn't already considered (beyond whatever new medication to try). I do manage my conditions with medication, but it is managed through my primary care physician
    *Talking to family/spouse
        *I do this a lot, I'm always open to anyone who will listen as long as I'm not too depressed, but it is sort of hard for any of them to understand where I'm coming from. My wife's life has been mostly blessed, and my family is tough, crude, and insensitive. I struggle to find people with a viewpoint that isn't either naive or reductive to advise me.

To create an Instagram account, where people can send in:

1. Positive stories about how they are battling mental health and are winning- either told by themselves or told anonymously through myself

2. Stories about people have gone above and beyond (and there are a lot of them) to support and help people with mental health


Why: 

A family member of mine has suffered from a number of different types of mental health over the years. The other day she spoke to someone older than her who had faced similar challenges, and it had an incredibly positive impact, hearing a positive story from someone who is battling and winning.

I know that mental health can make people feel very isolated, so if there were a place where people could watch videos of people who have been through similar challenges, I think this could potentially be a very positive thing.


How you can help:

1. Please comment if you have any feedback on my idea, positive or negative. Before I do this, I want to get people’s views :) 

2. If you have any positive stories either about people winning in their battles with mental health or about people who go above and beyond (whom you wish to thank) to support people with mental health, I would love to hear them. Either message me on here or leave a comment

Thanks for reading about my idea and I welcome any feedback or support you have for this.

36,"I'm 21 and live with my parents. 
I struggle with real bad anxiety but I definitely don't want to keep seeing my therapist.
Since i was like 10 or 11 I was kinda forced to go, without being told what It really was for at the time so I wouldn't get scared. Then growing up and slowly learning its purpose I've left and gone back some times.
I'm saying this so you see my mom is very used to having me go there... Every time she sees I'm not okay she immediately thinks of a therapist.
Now since I've discovered that my previous therapist broke the confidentiality pact that she had to hold with me as her patient by law by constantly talking to my mom I feel like my last counselling was forced as well... Among other things,she wanted information from my mom because she felt I wasn't very honest.

This new therapist I'm seeing says she would never do that and I think I trust her..
As a grown up, however, I would like to take my own decisions on this matter which is that I do not want to see a therapist because I am not ready to tell her everything and cooperate with her but if I don't I would get very bitter about the money I spend and waste on it...

However there is no way to convince her, if I told her this decision of mine, and I am not exaggerating, she would totally freak out and panic because she says she's found a good one and if I lose contact with her then I'm like very doomed. 

I know my issues cause pain to her as well but for the love of God I'm her daughter and I expect more help from family and friends rather than a professional, theoretically.

Now I have half a mind to lie to her, to pretend I'm going when I'm not... With the bonus of keeping for my self the money she gives me to see my therapist. I'm not proud of the latter part, and it's the thing that mostly gets in my way, but I can't exactly throw the money away, right?

Can anyone relate or does anyone have any suggestions?

- Butterflies like in the stomach when I am good.

-Dark high contrast, low brightness pics of my future, not consious, like stuck in the back of my head, can't see them clearly, they are random, for example at the moment it is like me standing at the bus stop in my university, the image is drone like. And other weird stuff.

- It is usually triggered when I imagine doing something nice or just living a normal life, like a lost feeling? I don't know how to describe it.

- It is like in the end of life nothing happens.(I know it is irrational it is ****ing weird and always accompanied with anxiety.

- Like a flat life feeling. Again, not emptiness like depression.

- Like lost and scared feeling. (Dark Images in the back of my head, like me in 3rd person working in the future or just walking on the street feeling lost and everything feels darker and anxious. Accompanied with those intrusive thoughts. **Can't tell if they are thoughts, it is like a feeling**

- It is strongly connected to working.
Other symptoms include:

**Other symptoms:*

- Irritability when it is bad.

- Sudden feeling of trapped in life, like I want to escape, but there is no escape.

- Sudden feeling like everything I see is too much. Looking at my room for example. Like overload?

- Feeling like if I work in the future I will do it.(For example my mother told me that I can start working at a store and instant images of me working then at the end of working I do it, it is like if i work for a week I will do it. It is terrifying. It comea with a knot in the stomach and mood drop. &lt;---- THIS IS IMPORTANT. WHY DOES IT HAPPEN?

- Feeling like if this condition is gone and I continue to live a normal life I will do it. It almost feel like I want these things to be there, but at the same time I am terrified of them, but at the same time I am terrified of them leaving.

- Feeling like a dark cloud is setting over my future and I can't see my usual future because of those pictures and feelings, again ALWAYS accompanied with anxiety.(Again, not quite like the depression thing.)

- In the morning, before I fully woke up I am in this weird half-awake condition when those feelings and thoughts like attack me? But at the same time it feels super real, like me. Then I can't go back to sleep, I stanf up, make coffee and those things usually last about hours, then I get almost to my normal self. However, when it is bad, it is bad all day and I have multiple times through the day when I feel normal for a couple of mins, then it hits again.

- Doubt if I want it or not and extreme confusion over it. It is more like 'I want it but I am pretending not to.', 'I don't want to admit it', 'Don't fully realise it.' And when this is there it feel legit, like I really want it BECAUSE of those feelings, which is horrific. It feels 100% like me.

- I am avoiding asking myself if I want to do it or if I want to die because:
- When I do it it feels like I do which is making everything worse.
- Or I say no, but with extreme anxiety and then yes appears and feels 100% like me which is scary.

- Gets worse after an arguing. Hits hard and my anxiety goes up all the way. (I thought It was BPD , but I researched a lot and it does not sound like me.)

It seems to have a cycle:

**When I am feeling okay:**
Bad in the morning.
Then I feel fine, then in the afternoon it hits and my mood drops, then usually at midnight I feel okay.

**When it is bad:**
The whole day is bad and I have minutes when I feel okay, then it hits again.

The most scary thing in this condition are **the urges**.

They almost everytime come without any reason or 
after days of worrying, it induces a panic attack in which everything hits at once.

Urges:

When I am close to dangerous objects.(Power sockets, high buildings, medications, etc. You get it.(I know it sounds like OCD, but still, wait, **don't jump to conclusions yet**.)

Urges are caused by thoughts like:

'Cmon, it will be so easy.'(This one is terrifying.)

'Life is meaningless anyway'

'I want to do it.'

'Why don't just give up.'(And it feels super real like I am about to give up.)

Etc. Etc. Etc. 

I am terrified.

**Background description of the urges:**

So, they happen when I am feeling relatively okay, then I can tell it is probably OCD. HOWEVER, when it is bad or hits bad out of nowhere here is how it feels like:
Like a flat life feeling, with the things, I mentioned before. And the scariest thing is that it feels like 1000% like me and like a decision. 

It is terrifying. I can only tell that it was not me when I am fine, but then, it hits again. 

**The scary thing is that it feels like I have anxiety because I want it and resist it or because I know it is not right**

**The second scary thing is that I can't tell if intrusive suicidal thoughts trigger feelings(good.) Or the feelings trigger real suicidal thoughts.**(**bad.**)

Here is how it happens and what it looks like:

**03.03.2018:**

I am watching a TV show, feeling relatively fine, when I decide to see if the feeling is in background. I suddenly get a thought like 'I can't continue living.' With a very ****ing real feeling like I really don't and all of those feelings hit. It feels horrific. I am immediately not sleepy, In highly self aware state, with like racing thoughts(not exactly.) I feel the knot in the stomach, it feels real, I immediately turn off the show on my phone and message a person who has the same thing as me at the moment. I stand up and go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. **IT STILL FEELS SUPER REAL AND 100% LIKE ME** I light my ciggarete and my vision crosses arround the power socket on the wall as soon as I see it thought like 'I want to do it' appear or 'It is pointless' I can't remember the thought exactly it felt super fast. After this a feeling like I want to give up appears like I am about to do it. An urge to look back at the power socket appears. I open reddit and start to write this topic. As I am writing I calm down and it feels less real and turns into 'background' again. As I am writing I have mini hits lasting a few seconds which makes it real again. As I wrote this sentence the same thing happened.


**Panic attacks:**
Basically the same thing, but in more intense way. More intense urges. 
Etc. Etc. I am even not sure if it is a panic attack or something worse.

**After a panic attack I calm down, but the next few days it is so ****ing bad.** 

So I have researched a lot about this topic and they are several diagnosis I want to mention and to say few things about them:

I am extremely scared that it is **suicidal depression.** However I looked at the symptoms here is what I get:

- Hopelessness (I am not sure about this, I can't tell if the meaningless thing is hopelessness. And as soon as I mentioned hopelessness I felt like I am feeling hopeless which gives me knot in the stomach.)

- Worthlessness - I don't have it.

- Guilt - I sometimes have it over the thoughts.

- Sadness - I don't have it.

- Emptiness - I don't have it.

- Depressed mood - Can't tell.

- Lost in interest in usual activites. (I can't tell if I get this, I tend to only research or reread articles about this topic when I am feeling bad, and I am not able to do nothing else. I tend to have moments when I don't want to go out because of this knot in the stomach and the other stuff, I 'preffer' to be at home and reading stuff.)

- Tiredness - After a long day when it is bad, yes.

- Oversleeping - I usually sleep about 8 to 9 hours.

- Low self esteem - I don't have it.

- Feeling burden - I don't have it.

- Lost of apetite - When the knot in the stomach is there, yes, like my stomach is sick.

- Suicidal thoughts (As you probably read already, I get this, however, in depression, it is associated with relief, fantasies, and CONSIOUS THINKING.(As I am typing this I feel like it is giving me relief and like I feel consious about it, which makes the condition worse - the knot in the stomach gets worse. 

**Told my psychiatrist and psychologist about it, they said it is not depression** However I am not sure.

My next fear is **Bipolar Affective Disorder Type 2**:

Bipolar is known to cause depression and hypomania.
I looked at the symptoms of mania and hypomania.
I asked most of my friends and family if they seen any of the symptoms(I showed them a list of the symtpoms.) In me and they dismissed it.
I also analysed my mood and actions while I am fine. 

I tend to do the things I usually do, for the same time. 

I don't sleep less. 

I don't talk faster. 

I am not easily distracted.

I don't do reckless stuff. 
And most importantly my mood does not change completely from the bad mood. Also it tends to change during the day. 

**The thing which is worrying me is that I am more irritable than usual.**

Anxiety symptoms which I have:

- Irritability.

- Sweating and BAD sweat smell, worse than usual.(My hands sweat when I am bad, however they were always sweating since I am young so I don't know if it fits there.

- Knot in the stomach.

- Derealisation.(Sometimes.)

- Restlessness.

- Faster highrate.

- Headaches sometimes.

- Unsettledness

** ! ! IMPORTANT ! ! ! The feeling about working is worrying me the most, sometimes it is almost gone some times it is hard. It is like everytime I thought about working It floods me with anxiety and the thoughts come and it feels like if I work I will feel overwhelmed and do it. Which is fucking terrifying. And it feels REAL.  ! ! ! IMPORTANT ! ! !**

I am sure that I missed something. Feel free to ask questions if you have. Thanks in advance and have a good night.",24Mar2018,3,

45,"Her illness encompasses intrusive thoughts. She will see a simple action or conversation and create scenarios from it where she believes I hate her/am angry/being mean to her and believes I will turn our other friends against her. 
It’s really upsetting firstly that her mind is so tortured. As I love her a lot and am deeply saddened that she’s feels like this. 
Secondly, I’m so stressed as I am constantly having to watch what I say and my actions. I can’t relax in my own home. 
*For example Last week I said that a new outfit was really flattering (she asked my opinion) and was given the silent treatment for an hour. We were driving somewhere together, so it was really uncomfortable. In the end she told me it was because by flattering she thought I was insinuating she was fat. She said that she goes quite because that’s how she deals with the thoughts. Because she knows I’m not trying to be mean.*
Thirdly, it really hurts to think someone could think such horrible things about you. I could never do something like that to anyone let alone one of my closest friends.

This is really affecting me and my own mental health. I have a lot going on in my life I’m trying to deal with at the moment and I feel this is taking over my life. She says she won’t see a psych because she’s not that bad and is not affecting anyone but herself but she does this to all our friends but to a lesser extent as she only lives with me. Our friends will not tell her and there is no way we’re could have an intervention because that will feed the ‘everyone hates me’ thoughts. 
Please help I’m not sure what to do. I’m seeing someone for my own issues but I cant afford to spend the whole session talking about her.",24Mar2018,15,

I’m engaged to be married, but I’m encountering resistance from all directions and I just want to get away. I don’t want to do things a certain way and I don’t want to be controlled and manipulated but no one really wants what I want and no one really cares how I feel. They say it’s about the bride.  No, it really isn’t. 

I just want to run away. I dream about leaving and living in my car, or moving to a tiny house in the country, but I know I would be just as unhappy there because I crave relationship. But I can’t figure out how to be happy and feel content. I can’t figure out how to feel at peace. I honestly can’t wait until I die and this is all over. There’s no relief. 

No suicidal ideation. No self harm. On meds but I don’t feel like they work. Going to counseling. ",24Mar2018,1,

53,"I'm not sure if this is possible or not but it seems like I don't have a personality of my own. When I was a kid I would copy other people's personality whether it was in person, my best friend, someone in our group, or someone I admire on TV. I would act almost exactly like them to the point where people have made comments in the past ""Oh great... he's acting like Keith now..""( a guy in our group at the time).

Now that I'm older, it's not even noticeable. It's not gone, I still feel like I have no sense of self and no personality traits of my own. It's just I am remarkably *better* at hiding it. 

It's almost like my whole identity is solely based on the people around me or that have had a significant influence on me. It's like I am just one big mixture of different personalities I have picked up and copied throughout my lifetime to utilize and this is how I cope.

I have pondered this thought for quite some time now, but was always afraid of the answer I will get. (multiple personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, or some psychotic disorder).

It's really been eating at me the past few days. What the hell is wrong with me?

Also, if it's worth mentioning. I do have a pretty decent confidence level. (I've read that is the contrary towards people with bpd) I want to emphasize that although I have no sense of self, I *do* have self-worth is that makes sense?  I don't feel any resentment towards myself or feel significantly submissive in social settings. It's not so much that I am easily persuaded it is that I just copy other people.

I haven’t even had blades in a year. Mere hours after she left I just decided I didn’t care and went and bought some. The anxiety was torturous. I think a part of me wants to show off the fact that I SH’d to her, in a ”yeah look what happens when you’re not around” way.

58,"Currently living in Reno, NV area.

No insurance.
Having difficulty keeping jobs or steady work.
It's gotten exponentially worse as I've reached my mid-20s.

Have had issues for my entire life, but when I was growing up, I had a very severely autistic little brother, as well as a little brother with other mental health disorders, so because I was seemingly ""neuro-typical"" They focused on their issues and ignored mine. I was good at hiding them, because they weren't as life-threatening or important.

But I am recognizing fully that I am having issues with alcohol and drugs and relationships and functional living, and don't know how to reach out for help, but instead feel trapped in an endless cycle.
I was fired the this week from a temp job because I missed 3 days within a 6 week period - One for my wedding, one for driving my MIL to San Franciso to catch her flight home, and one because I was ""sick"" - I took ecstasy the night before and thought that I could go to work the next day without it affecting me terribly. I was wrong.

I know that there are multiple issues, but I feel like actually having a real diagnosis of whatever is wrong with me could help. I have been self-diagnosing and self-medicating with alcohol. I got into an argument with my husband and basically threw a fit because he didn't want me to have booze.

Something is fucky and I don't have the money to fix it right now. What other resources are available?

Now the case is that ""A"" is known to have past alcohol abuse issues but he stopped drinking...Last time I saw him 2 months ago he would seem like a normal person , now he started posting photoshopped pictures on Facebook with poop mixed with the relatives he hates accusing them of bad things and humiliating them , posts anti-communist edited by him pictures etc while accusing them of things (they are hot even Communists) , posts edited pics with bad stuff with stories against them that he himself has written , and generally he appears to be behaving very weird...Note that ""A"" was also abused as a child I don't know if it has to do with that

I am really worried , what should I do?He behaves so abnormally and I have never seen anything like that before nor I remember him ever being like this..He used to be a Normal person , what's wrong now?He is a grown up person on his fifties

I have spells of an emotion that feels like a desperation and homesickness but I have no idea for what or where it's for. I have a fusion of absolute bliss and sort of separation that makes me so emotional I cry. 

I'm absolutely plagued by this feeling of desperation for something that I don't know. I've fought depression over my frantic want to connect with whatever this is. But I've tried and tried to explain to people what all this is. It's after my latest episode of the longing one that I'm here just trying to get some sort of answer as to what this is. 

I don't even have words for what I'm going through, but I've been like this my whole life. Feelings of desolation when I'm alone were the start of it. But as I've gotten older I feel more things I don't understand and can't really describe. ",24Mar2018,12,
