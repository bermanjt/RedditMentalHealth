0,"Don’t want to dive into too much back story because it’s boring, but I’ve finally recently been addressing my anxiety and depression I’ve had most of my life (currently 31 years old). 

I’ve been in therapy for just over a year now which has been tremendously helpful. Was in a decent routine, exercising and eating right, sleeping well, etc. Still had anxiety, still had days I couldn’t get out of bed, but did notice it was better overall. 

I’ve been out of my routine and feel so unable to get back into it. Been feeling lately like maybe I’ve been just putting bandaids on a bigger problem and am considering meds (per the suggestion of my therapist) but terrified. 

Looking for any advice or support to take the leap. Will it actually help? Am I going to be a different person? Are the side effects terrible? ",10Oct2018,1

3,"First of all, excuse my bad english, this isn’t my first language haha.

Now. For some background I’ve had a pretty violent childhood. My dad abandoned us when I was 5 and I remember running behind his car screaming at him, begging him to stay. But after that, I must admit most of my childhood is a complete blank. I know I was a very angry and rage-filled child and it went on to the end of my teenage years, where I’ve made a conscious decision to become a better person, which I did in the 10 years that followed.

I’m now a 27 years old man, and I admit that I haven’t really cried or actually felt anything since the anger that I felt when I was younger. I no longer am angry, at anything really. Nor am I sad. But the thing is that I don’t feel joyful either. Never. I’m always neutral. Very neutral. Heck, my appartment caught on fire last year and I calmly took my coat and the cats and went out while my roomate was screaming. I remember only wondering abojt where I would sleep that night and the following nights.

Now that’s way to pragmatic. I feel lile I have a problem, like something shut off inside me when I was a kid and that I’ve been playing the part since.

Everybody tell me that I have great compassion and that I have great emotional intelligence, that I have the ability to move people through my work (I’m an artist), I’ve had short and long relationships and never had any problems with people or interacting with them, I love them, but I don’t know, I just feel like in a dream. Like nothing at all matters.

I’ve seen a bunch of psychologues over the years but it never changed anything. I’ve had some breakthrought through spirituality though, as it seem to resonate more with me.

Sometimes, when I watch a movie, and strangely, most of the time it’s during a kids movie, I feel like the urge to cry at completely random moments. Like something really touched me and moved me and I really feel like I’m gonna break in warm weeping tears, but then it vanishes and I can’t find it anymore.

I’m really open to any suggestions, tips, tools, insights, as I don’t want to end up waking up at 89 feeling like my whole life had been a bland dream.

Thank you for reading.

Much love to all of you.",10Oct2018,1

6,"I also posted this one r/legaladvice  I'm not sure which sub would be better.

&amp;#x200B;

My 17 year old child has been inpatient for less than 2 days in the local hospitals behavioral health unit for suicidal ideations. This is not new to us and is his 10th stay across the state. He was previously ""clean"" for over a year and is slipping. He knows when he can't be safe while alone and came to me to let me know he needed to go back. I visited/talked to him both yesterday and today and he is tell me that he still cannot be safe and will self harm to the point of ending his life. He has told his Doctor this as well. They are telling me he is being discharged tomorrow (despite not being ready)

The Doctor is clearly not reporting this to the insurance company as my wife called them and they were very concerned as their notes did not match our conversations. We have dual insurance and they never have a problem covering any mental health needs we have but since the doctor is not reporting the same as what we are being told then their hands appear to be tied. I've contacted every local agency I can including DSS, CORE, and private agencies but getting things rolling is a slow process. They said that since we give him so much support that he is better at home, but clearly us doing everything we can isn't enough. He feel he needs a more long term treatment and we support this. We just want him better.

If we refuse to pick him up we will be ""charged with child neglect."" I know I will lose my child if he comes home, what can I do? Who can I contact?",10Oct2018,1

12,"I first seen a therapist when I was 14 after I had a huge breakdown of getting food on my hands (ocd). I went to a therapist for about 6 months where I was diagnosed with OCD, social anxiety disorder, and GAD. At each appointment she requested for me to gain my parent’s permission in order for her to write a prescription for ocd/anxiety medication. My parents would not consent even after written letters have been sent to my house. I did cognitive therapy and went for 6 months before my parents had me stop going.

It’s been almost 3 years since that and I am scared. I literally don’t know who I am at times, my ocd keeps me from doing so many things, and I experience anxiety attacks daily because of my ocd. It makes me feel extremely depressed at times and I have been worried that I’ll hurt myself. I have burned myself before, first on accident then it became habitual. When all of these newer things started I knew that I needed help again, and after about 2 months of trying to talk myself into it I finally brought it up to my dad. I told my dad that I honestly feel like I should go back to seeing a therapist.

He laughed. He must’ve thought I was joking or something, however I started crying and he then told me he doesn’t think I need a therapist. What hurt the most was the fact it took me weeks, MONTHS to muster up the ability to approach him with this just to get laughed at. 

I don’t know what to do. There’s nothing I can do since I’m still a minor. I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it to 18 years old and finally be able to legally see one myself at this rate. I am truly scared and no one will help me. I’ve been shut out and taken as a joke because of my mental illnesses and I don’t know what to do. Please help. I don’t have several hundred dollars to see online therapists either. I’m scared. ",10Oct2018,1

14,"With today being world mental health day (Oct 10th), I'm reminded by how much of a colossal struggle just finding the right path towards a healthy mind can be.

School can be an absolutely brutal place. Witnessing the naive and often unjust ways alpha girls and boys would exercise their power on the more vulnerable kids in the playground was a constant reminder that school was first and foremost a place you had to survive in order to then learn.

As the only black kid throughout junior school, and one of perhaps three in secondary, it was important for me not to become fixated upon how I differed from other kids, and instead, look for the things we had in common and could enjoy together. I figured that having friends in various different playground cliques meant there should be less chance of me being seen as an outsider who couldn't fit in, and so kids should have less of a reason to find beef with me.

The more I was accepted into peer groups, the more it confirmed that I was similar to them after all, which led to a sense of belonging and safety, a feeling that seemed important to have in order to get the most out of being in a learning environment. Acceptance from fellow pupils became a source of validation and self-esteem, which in turn led to having more confidence and a general contentedness.

As I grew older and my sense of who I was became more defined, problems started arising. Particular groups I wanted be a part of, and thought had things in common with, wouldn't allow me to join and often gave no reason why. The decision to yay or nay my requests resting in the hands of the more domineering kids in the group for whom passing judgement in this way was fun, but for those unfairly condemned it could be a soul crushing experience.

There was an obvious flaw in the soundness of my high school survival strategy. Was it wise for my sense of well-being and self-worth to be at the mercy and whims of the other kids at school? My mental health felt like a commodity on the stock market whose value rose and fell with each acceptance or rejection, reinforcing a hunch the world was just this indifferent and cold arena that rewarded the strong and dominant with the most freedoms.

Why should membership to desirable peer groups have such a powerful impact on my mental health?

I remember being 18, standing awkwardly in the garden of my friend's parents one bonfire evening. One of 10 blokes who, without any prior conferring, had assembled into a perfect man circle on the lawn; the work colleagues of my friend's dad, plus myself. I was shooting the breeze with real men of the world. We were getting to know each other through the mutual exchange of our vast life experience as we flaunted our chequed shirts, held cans of Fosters to our chests like they were trophies, occasionally glancing behind to scoff at the poor excuse for a bonfire while we shooed away any giddy child that asked us to play with them.

By donning the correct costume, performing the appropriate gestures I'd seen other blokes perform, as well as regurgitating stock answers to most of the common ice-breaking questions a bloke will ask another fellow bloke he doesn't yet know, I could tell I was on the verge of entering blokedom proper, and was a hair's breadth away from assuming my position as a functioning member of the privileged patriarchy.

After about half an hour or so of trying to assimilate with these learned elders, I noticed there was one main bloke who did the majority of the speaking, and was the default focal point if you didn't know what to do with yourself; like stand properly, or hold your can of beer with a convincing level of manliness. Despite his irritating braggadocio, he was a welcome diversion that deflected group attention away from my poor quality man acting. Occasionally he would look over to another bloke, who I concluded was his deputy, for those moments when he needed his more audacious claims backing up.

An hour had past, the Fosters was flowing and I'd gained the ability to hear things beyond the cacophony of anxieties in my head. I felt at ease. I could focus on the actual content of what us guys were sharing with each other, and could think about how I'd be able to shoehorn myself into the conversation. So I listened eagerly for an opening in order that I could make my mark.

What I heard was a series of banal accomplishments, mainly home improvement based, presented to the group as though they were scientific breakthroughs. Disdain was thrown at nearly everyone and everything, designed it seemed, to exemplify their own strengths. Their incompetent work colleagues, their illogical and irrational wives they just couldn't understand and regretted marrying, their children who were unaware of what good music was, the idiotic tactics the manager of the football team they supported would use. The weather. Modern life. Vegetarians. It just went on and on... The best I could manage was a couple double-entendres and an inuendo that brought a ripple of chuckles, but it felt completely contrived. I was being a fraud trying to tick boxes to gain status. I did consider the possibility that everything they were saying was valid, but for some reason didn't feel like I was in the presence of 9 Nobel laureates.

At a certain point during the exchange I felt a bit off. Waves of disenchantment about what the hell I was doing and what being a man actually involved began swilling around inside. Then one of the guys began to regale us all with the time he heroically gave a lollipop man a piece of his mind for walking out onto the road too abruptly...

But the downside of that is we get lots of people who feel safe enough to start sharing mental health related concerns and crises, ranging from eating disorders to bullying to suicidal feelings.

Our server is a fandom server. We just not equipped to handle these issues, and discussion of these often make other onlookers/members very uncomfortable or can even trigger people.

However, we don't want to just leave our members silent and struggling without help, especially since many of them are teenagers, or live in countries/places without adequate access to mental healthcare. We do not want to ""abandon"" them, psychologically.

**I will be making a resource list for various topics and concerns - basically almost every topic from the ""Related subreddits"" sidebar here - and am hoping for some recommendations to active communities and servers, ones which my server can direct our struggling members to.

19,"Ive started seeking therapy for my mental issues which I’ve been dealing with last 4-5 years, I went to my GP and spoke about my symptoms and how they affect me but I feel like I didn’t cover everything, my mind went blank about a lot of issues that I have.

I told him how I have severe anxiety and depression and how my mood can change etc but I forgot to mention certain stuff how I do impulsive things for example last year I went on a 20 day water fast I started it on my birthday of all days. I felt like a different person I was filled with purpose and felt euphoric, I lost 4 stone honestly looking back I don’t know how I did it. I started to feel more confident and overall felt like a different person. I started to socialise with people more I even smoked weed with few people and blacked out...

A month and a half later I felt severally depressed, I started feeling worthless again I pinned my unhappiness on weight gain all these years but realised it was just an excuse. I also started having thoughts about how I embarrassed and clowned myself in front of people, I couldn’t even comprehend how I didn’t eat anything for 20 days and felt like I was dealing with a different person. 

Since then I go back and forth, some days I wake up sleeping four hours and I feel absolutely fine and feel so good but then I feel depressed for few weeks after I get racing thoughts and have trouble concentrating, I used to exercise to help clear my mind and also maintain my weight loss but then started purging as I found it better to get rid of my thoughts and also it’s easier in general, this has been going on for 8 months now. 

Forgot to mention I received a letter today from a mental health clinic I’ve been referred to, they sent me a booklet on anxiety and OCD, this is what concerned me as I feel like I’ll be misdiagnosed can someone please give me advice? ",10Oct2018,1

23,"Not a huge falling out, but it's a new therapist so it's thrown me a little.   


I have depression (situational, high-functioning, more running on autopilot than feeling sad but I do suffer suicidal ideation) and social anxiety. This is not my first time with therapy, but my first time with CBT and not sure what to expect.   


One issue I'm coming up against is I'm very socially isolated - this is a huge factor to my depression, it also makes it hard to treat my anxiety as I'm rarely in a position for it to come up to be able to address it with a therapist!   


Talking to therapist today and he's trying to get me to think of things I like to do to find ways of meeting new people, the thing is...A. I have already tried lots of things, it's not like I'm just sitting at home avoiding people, and B. I have no idea what I'm interested in any more and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed something (due to depression).   


He asked me what I like to do and I said 'nothing' or 'I don't know'...because I DON'T KNOW!   


He stared talking like I wasn't engaging with therapy, which wasn't the case at all, he started talking about how if I don't know what I like doing then he can't know. I tried explaining this to him, that I can't give him answers that I don't have and that part of his job is helping me to figure this out - his response was to suggest I was expecting him to figure this out for me, which isn't his job. I just found it sort of confrontational and I didn't know how he expected me to respond.  


We talked at the start (this is week 4) about my having to engage or the therapy may be stopped, I talked to him about the fact that sometimes people who are depressed will struggle to engage and I expect him to acknowledge that and not bring therapy to a stop if I don't engage on one occasion. For him to use this 'you're not engaging' argument today felt threatening to me, as if he's saying that I'm not engaging so he's not willing to work with me (he hasn't said he's not willing to work with me but it's that he wasn't helping me find the answers he was seeking, and it felt threatening).   


I've run into this problem before - I'm long-term unemployed and one barrier I face is that I have no idea what sort of work I want to do or could look into doing, many services to help unemployed/disabled people back into work have refused to help me because I didn't know what I wanted to do and have accused me of not wanting to work (not the case)...thus left me without help, this can also put my welfare at risk if I'm seen as being unwilling to look for work. So maybe this is part of why I was so sensitive with my therapist today - I don't expect other people to do things or figure things out for me, but I need help and to be guided rather than being scolded for not knowing this for myself.   


He asked if our relationship was 'fractured' as he sensed I was annoyed. The rest of the session felt uncomfortable as he asked if there was anything else I wanted to focus on, at this point I was kind of expecting him to take the lead in how we address my problems but this part also felt like there was some implication my issues aren't severe enough for him to know where to focus our attention - again maybe I was being sensitive due to the situation, I also get anxious that maybe he doesn't see me as needing help because I am high-functioning and right now my mood is fairly stable.   


I'm not totally sure he understands the bigger issues for me either, which also added to my frustration, making friends is important but it's part of a bigger picture and also I wanted to try CBT as I want something that's going to give me tools to deal with depression. Today it felt more like he was focusing on 'how to meet people' which isn't super useful to me if the real issue these is that *I don't know how to make friends*, plus he was suggesting going to something for people with mental health issues...it's not that I look down on people with mental health issues, but I want to make friends in normal situations and not make friends with other people just as such social rejects as me. I don't have problems with people with mental health issues, it would be pretty hypocritical if I did, it's just it kind of feels as though when therapist suggest things like this it's like 'Well you're a reject so you only deserve to find friendship with other social rejects like you'.  


I really struggle to tell him what I think or want because as soon as I try I start to cry, I'm too sensitive and find it too difficult to communicate at the time. I'm also struggling because my depression is situational and I see no way out of that situation, sure CBT may be more about changing your way of thinking but it's no use if it doesn't ultimately help me get out of my current situation. I know I only have up to 16 weeks of 50 minute sessions so I'm not sure how to get the most out of these sessions and struggle to see steps to know what issues to address first/as a priority.   


IDK it just all felt off today and not sure how to proceed next week.

25,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a large part of my life. Tried medication for about a year but did not find one that worked well for me and got to a point where I could no longer afford medication or visits to a therapist any more. 
Recently my relationship of 12 years ended. I have never been particularly good at maintaining friendships and about 2 years ago I moved about 3 hours away from friends/ family with my then boyfriend. 

I find myself in a situation where I have an objectively good life (decent apartment, make ok money, job I've always wanted) but terribly alone.  So I think, I should pick up a hobby, volunteer, join a gym, etc. Something to get out, meet people, get involved or whatever. 

The problem is I literally cannot think of anything I'm passionate about. What do I love to do? I have no idea! I like books, but hate the idea of book clubs. I like music but do not enjoy going to concerts. The list goes on. 

I guess my question is how do I know when depression/ anxiety are telling me that these things are stupid/ not worth my time/ pointless from things I actually just don't care about. Am I really this boring of a person that I want to do literally nothing all day? ",10Oct2018,1

It seems like everything I do is just me faking my passion about life. I've been suffering from crippling depression and anxiety for so long that I've basicly become a numb potato. I've become a very cold and jaded person as a result, and I've got a feeling that's only driving my friends away from me. My mother (who I still love) has become dangerously manipulative and psychologically abusive, and I don't even feel safe speaking to her over the phone anymore. My insomnia is only letting me get a few hours of real sleep a night, and I'm always exausted even when I'm not doing anything. I cant even get a job or focus on school because of this. I'm losing the passions I once had, like playing my piano, and gaming, and my friends are becoming more distant. I just don't know what to do any more. 

It just feels like everything I do is meaningless, and the painful numb feeling won't go away.

I did some reading on SSRI’s and found that they can reduce libido and cause weight gain. I am already on birth control that does both of these and I don’t want anything else to impact them because I feel that would make me feel even worse and impact my life more.

30,"Since I could remember I have been dealing with serious ADHD and depression. For years I have been trying different medications and have had pretty nasty reactions to each one. I am getting especially worried because the depression is seasonal and the bad season is winter and spring. As of now the depression is mild, but mild seems like nothing if you have been dealing with it your whole life. The depression only exaggerates the symptoms of the ADHD and further makes me not want to do anything. I'm a senior in high school and I plan to go to culinary school, grades permitted. I constantly misplace things and never do any homework, none of my teachers know I have ADHD or depression, and one of my friends know I have ADHD, but not depression. 

I have deemed treating the depression more important than the ADHD because of some suicidal thoughts in the past (I have never harmed myself or attempted to commit suicide). But the ADHD really adds to the frustration of just living this shitty life. I can only hyper focus on things and when I am not hyper focused on something I have zero motivation to do anything besides sleep. And when night comes around I don't want to sleep because that means I will have to face another day. The only thing that really seems to be exciting for me is music, I don't make or play music but when I listen to music I can't really think about anything else. So I can't let my brain rest, the downside is that I can't listen to music while I do schoolwork or else I will end up spending 10+ minutes just staring at my work and not write a single thing. 

(Is it just me or do other people eith ADHD get attached to one song in particular and never get tired of it?)

I have tried seeing multiple therapists in the past, emphasis on the multiple. I dread seeing therapists because I see right through the cheap manipulation tactics. I tell them exactly what they want to hear and they all say the same thing but it's hard to change your life on a dime, especially when you feel as though you aren't in control. Luckily I have parents that care about me, and i can see that now that i am less depressed. 

I have a lot more to write but i want to make this semi-readable. If anyone is in a similar situation I would like to hear it and what you do about it. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way but it feels like that a lot of the time.",10Oct2018,1
31,"I want to say it here because I want someone to know that I was broken before, but tonight I shattered like glass and some of the pieces went missing. I’m here to say that my suicidal hate has increased in weight that I can literally feel its heaviness in my chest. I’m here to say that I want to skin myself, pick my bones apart to find my tainted being and send it to the wind to carry it to the sky. I’m here to say that I watch as I self-destruct until there’s nothing left of me. I’m here to say that I can feel myself slowly giving in to the morbid whispers in my head.

32,"15m - Being sad or moody is basically my go-to mood at this point. If nothing is going on and I am not distracted then I will revert to feeling sad or lonely. I have friends in school but I feel emotionally disconnected from them and from others most of the time, it just all seems so pointless at times. I do not have anybody to truly empathize with, my friends are great but they are frivolous and my parents basically do not believe that mental health is a real thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also cannot stop comparing myself to others and being content with myself. Whenever something small happens that makes me feel inferior, I dwell on it and cannot get it from out of the back of my mind, although I do not show it on the outside. I feel inferior, although I do not try to show it. I tend to put on a confident outside composure, and I do feel some confidence in myself, but I also feel a lot of doubt and negativity that I know does not truly matter but that I cannot wipe away.

This one girl and I felt really close but then I started showing her my anxious side and how insane I feel on the inside, and ever since then it feels like she's been kinda distancing herself from me. And I've noticed a pattern with it with everyone else who I meet. We are good friends at the start, but once I start feeling like I can be myself, that's when it falls apart.

36,"I was a terrible person in high school. I was what you might call a ""mean girl."" Me and my friends were nasty to just about anyone we didn't like. 

There was one girl in particular who we picked on constantly. Everyday we insulted her and put her down, we spread vile rumors about her, we once set her up to be embarrassed in front of a bunch of people in school. We were awful. 

Eventually, it got to the point that she couldn't take anymore and she ended her life. 

To be honest, I didn't care at first. I came up with all kinds of excuses to convince myself it wasn't my fault, but after I lost someone close to me, it made me understand what her family was going through, and made me reflect on all the awful things we did to her. I reached out to the girl's sister to offer an apology but she understandably wanted nothing to do with me. 

II'm so ashamed of the person I used to be. After all the misery i have caused, I want to do something productive with my life.  I'm in college now and I have thought about working to become a psychologist or a youth councilor, or a social worker, something where I can help people, but I at the same time, I  worry that's inappropriate for me to pursue that when many of the people I would working have been victimized in the same ways I used to inflict on others.

Since then he has been divorced twice, lost all his money and has been in and out of various mental institutions. I've since moved across the country and live successfully. We've really drifted apart and it's painful to communicate with him. 

Back in 2012 he was in two different locked ward mental institutions. After getting out he lived with his brother and took his medication for a little bit, but then went 20!months without taking his medication. As soon as his brother found out he had him institutionalized again (5 months). Since getting out he has moved into social housing complex for the elderly. 

He just told me he hasn't been taking any medication for the past 6 months. He continuously refuses to self medicate.

i was faced with an issue i’ve had for a long time but has gotten worse recently. we were talking about what was upsetting us in the situation and my mind went blank. i couldn’t remember what i was upset about specifically and my emotions were lost. i was left with a blank mind and couldn’t think. this isn’t the first time this has happened. 

in school i’m in a discussion class and when everyone is talking and challenging each other with ideas, my mind goes blank. i get called on and i have nothing to say. it’s as though i’m incapable of coming up with my own thoughts.

39,"I take prescribed benzo in small doses, first I got it from my panic attack, but now it helps my overall anxiety and anger problem, etc,.

I don't think I can quit it for a long while, not because of withdrawal(I don't experience benzo withdrawal for some reason, I went cold turkey several times), but because without it I'm emotional wreckage.

But the real problem is, it is destroying my mental capacity very quickly.

I used to remember nearly everything automatically, I used to memorize entire chapter of textbook before tests, could memorize most of contents in the bible and very long novels without much effort,

But now I forget TV character's name I just saw. I started to forget vocabularies(though English is not my tongue).

If I exceed daily dose, I forget my own doorlock number. And I'm constantly sleepy.

I don't take much, doctor said it's low dose.

Good thing is it doesn't seem I need to increase the dose, bad thing is this small dose is destroying my brain.

40,"Hello everyone,

I’ve dealt with depression/anxiety and currently take Prozac and Ritalin, but this is completely out of character for me. So it is currently 12:30am and I am still in my office because I stayed too late and was scared to go outside in the dark to get home (I take the metro/subway). I considered taking an Uber but didn’t even order it because just the thought of walking the 10 feet from the door to the curb where the Uber would pick me up was giving me terrible anxiety. So now I am in my office freaking out because WTF. I don’t even know if I’m allowed to be here, but now I DEFINITELY can’t leave. 

Has anyone had this happen? I’m in college and will only go outside in the dark on campus but I am terrified to be outside in the dark alone anywhere else, whether it be a big city (like where I work) or suburban area (like where I live). 

Does anyone know what could suddenly cause this? It has progressively become more of an issue over the last month or so. ",10Oct2018,1
41,"I'm in the middle of applying to various top phd programs in chemical and biological sciences. For the longest time, I've had a feeling where I'll never truly belong to cohorts of academics. I find it difficult to relate to most researchers beyond similar research interests. This is most likely rooted in pre-college experiences. Though I have no proof, I would assume most people pursuing higher education began this path early on and had a strong social support system. I try hard to not complain and keep pushing forward, but this fucking sucks. It sucks not having had the resources, not having family support, not having social support, having to figure life out on your own, etc..

Moreover, there is this pretentious elitism that permeates universities. Growing up playing sports, humility and failure were the toughest lessons learned. There is a notion that failure is nonexistent, much like how girls don't poop. 

I don't know... maybe it's just the compounded effects of school. I understand there's always someone out there going through greater difficulties. Despite the bullshit childhood and teenage years, I managed to do well in college, obtain lots of research experience, and network. However, all of this came at the expense of a social life and becoming defined by letters and numbers.

I keep thinking about how it makes no damn sense that I'm conscious and aware, and this isn't an abstract thought, it's a fucking visceral reality and it's like everything is just an image that I'm looking at. I don't know what to do besides stare at the world around me and wonder why I'm being forced to experience things. Every part of me recoils at the experience of being self-aware and conscious. I'm only really okay when I play video games (because I'm too focused on the game to think about anything else) and when I'm asleep (i get bad dreams all the time, but i never seem to actually think about the fact that I exist.) It's intensified when I go to work, and sometimes at work I feel as though someone will stab me or that I have an insect in my sinus, even though I know it's irrational.

43,"I've been in a few bad places before. I think that most notably, it led me to drinking heavily before, but was fortunate enough to realize the slippery slope of addiction(and its tendency to be genetic) and sought help. I think that was the worst point I had experienced, often times taking a significant amount of sleep aid while drinking - just felt like not existing. My brother is struggling with alcohol really badly himself, and I can see the hurt it puts on my parents. I can see his feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Programs havent helped thus far, and we are still fighting with him insurance to cover inhouse rehab. 

I'm not a good person. Or, at least, I am not good enough to the people I care about. I'm wrought with insecurities and rampant jealousy I'm not sure I'll ever get a hang of. I started losing my hair a couple of years ago, which has only made my self-viewed significance and confidence wane even further. I feel alone. 

I've been experiencing weird symptoms since August 2017, which led to a slew of theories about what is wrong with my brain (from brain infection, to central nervous system autoimmune diseases, to old brain damage). Last month I was diagnosed with a rare disease that is an uncommon benign brain tumor. Its is fairly frequently related to a gene mutation that increases my chances of various cancers. I had my genetic counseling appointment yesterday so that they could test me and discuss what will happen if I have this additional syndrome. They had mentioned that they often recommend mastectomies and hysterectomies to women with these two diseases. My symptoms seem to get worse, which makes me overthink and begin to get chest pains from the anxiety. I sold my car today because my symptoms have gotten to the point that I couldn't operate my vehicle as well as before (it was a manual car). I feel like I'm losing bits of myself that I really enjoyed while experiencing these symptoms, and nobody is treating them. I'm scared and feel alone. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that I feel like I'm not worth anything at this point. I have no friends, no significant other, and my symptoms are making me feel increasingly alone. I can't stop crying, and next week I have an appointment to see about brain surgery. I don't know what to do with myself.

45,"First post on reddit actually too. No idea what goes on here just seemed like it would be a good place to ramble. So here it is:

———————————————————————

On a daily basis I am gifted with the burden of fully knowing in my core that I am annoying, ugly, unlovable, lacking some knowledge or something basic that everyone else has, and deficient as shit in a ton of ways. I’ll start coming up with all kinds of scenarios in my head of me just failing at everything I want for myself, feeling completely alienated from everything and everyone, etc. 

And also knowing in my core at the same time that all of that is not true and instead just a part of my brain that happens to be very active, creative, and loud. That there is also a part of me that I can consciously tap into that not only dispels those lies but also uses and converts them into healthier, clearer thoughts and ideas. 

When tapping into this (I tend to call it a light) my goal is never to drive the thoughts out and get rid of them. As far as I’m concerned they are necessary and to instead be transformed and utilized. There have been several times in my life where I had those “negative” thoughts nonstop. And it came with the assumption that that feeling was permanent, which was its own pain point. When I first found that inner light, the best aspect was simply that I COULD feel something good or even neutral. But for that knowledge to have substance it needs that negative to balance against. 

The best comparison I have is like lifting weights. Every time I’m in that dark place no matter how long it lasts it always feels like it’s the only place. The more I pull myself out of that the more I strengthen my ability to do so. It makes me appreciate the weight because it’s that resistance that’s making me stronger and able to recognize that weight, recognize that I CAN lift it, and that doing so is making me that much stronger and having a much better effect on me than just letting it pull at me and keep getting heavier. As I lift it I can recognize that feeling that weight can actually be a beautiful and meaningful aspect of being alive. 

The point is rather than viewing darker thoughts as completely detrimental and trying to get rid of them entirely/permanently, my goal is to recognize them, know that they are not in control, “I am” (whatever that even means) and then use them as fuel for positivity/optimism/balancing my mental state. Every emotion is vital. It’s all part of the same brain, my brain, it just needs to have the traffic directed sometimes. 

And I honestly prefer to do all my mental health work and “heavy lifting” myself. It feels like a puzzle or some kind of challenging project and each step I make in the right direction makes me feel so good in ways I can’t really describe. I am lucky enough to be able to dig around in my own brain be able to identify and work through what’s happening. Also something that I had/have to work very hard to achieve; work that is constantly progressing and changing.

 I never really wrote anything like this out before. Just kind of seeing how it feels. The human mind is so complex. So my mind trying to analyze itself and then articulate it into an accurate and complete written description is a challenge I’m probably going to fail at a little bit every time I try. I’ll never get the full picture cause it’s simply too much. So sorry if this didn’t make complete sense. ",10Oct2018,1

As a part of the recovery process with my therapist I've been working on self care and one of the things I've been doing for the past month is recording what I'm grateful for in the present moment. I realized recently how incredibly grateful I am to be alive and to not have succeeded (and hopefully never) in ending my life. I think I've also come to accept that harming myself or attempting/wanting to kill myself is the worse my life could get and that gives me a lot of strength because literally anything else I do is upwards from that dark headspace (this idea is actually from the book ""Reasons to Stay Alive"" by Matt Haig which has really helped me through some challenging times). I don't want to appear ignorant of other people's struggles because I know all experiences are different and nuanced.

I spent my whole life having doctors tell me i probably wouldnt be anything. I'd be dependent on other peoole.(They didn't say it in a mean way. They wanted me to accept my limitations). I had dropped out of highschool after being admitted for suicide. Ive dropped out of college 4 times. Ive never been able to hold a job for more than 6 weeks because i end up losing my mind. 

I wanted to prove them wrong. I was doing good. I enrolled back in college. 8 weeks later and im super sick again and dropped out.

I guess I have to go back on medication. I'm just frustrated. I'm in my early 20s. On ssi, considered legally disabled. I dont want to be on ssi. I want to be somebody, i want a job. I want a voice. I want to mean something. 

I'm back where I started. I dont have friends, my only sibling lives hours away and wont really talk to be vecause shes successful, my parents dont really care whats going on with me. I have nobody.

53,"Hello, I don’t know if this is the right place but I needed some place to unleash and maybe ask for advice on what to do. 

The “emotional abuse” happened back when I was in high school, by my then-best friend. I call it emotional abuse, because I have no other alternative to call the relationship between us. 

I thought we were best friends but he would not give a shit about what I felt, I’d confront him and he’d blame it on me being too sensitive or “you’re not sad like me, don’t find reasons for yourself to be” and mocking me when he was with people but assuring me I *was* his bff when we’re alone etc. He’d constantly talk about planning his suicide, for two straight years, prohibiting me from talking about it to anyone (which I complied). 

Then I made the grave mistake of falling in love with him and telling him that. The result was... well, terrible. He first criticised me bc how dared I while knowing he loved someone else, then I apologised over and over and he told me to cut it because I was annoying/suffocating him; so I did— then I was accused of showing an attitude and he threatened me with ending my life (not like a death threat but you got it) etc etc. 

It’s been 7 years since we’ve cut contact. 

So as a result I pretty much always assume I’m annoying people with what I say/do regardless of endless assurances, and then I feel bad for needing that assurance, and I know it’s been 7 years and I should get over but I’m still scared my friends mock me behind my back, that they’re hanging out with me out of sheer kindness of their hearts &amp; pity and even though they tell me that we’re friends, it’s ok etc I just can’t convince my brain. 

And I don’t want to blame it on the experience i’ve had because I should’ve gotten over it by this point, like it was high school, i’m a grown adult with a job now, people around me seem genuinely enjoy my presence but i’m also scared that given i’m also an anxiety riddled mess they’ll get bored pretty quick but i love these people so i want to be their friend — you get my point, right? I’m holding back tears as I type these. 

Is it normal, or am I just being too overly sensitive and blaming my lack of social skills on something that was probably not as serious as an emotional abuse? Thanks in advance. ",10Oct2018,1

60,"I have had chronic depression my entire life with some mild anxiety. I was officially diagnosed in my mid 20s and about five years later I'm the happiest I have ever been. The problem is, my SO believes I can get better and I'm not so sure. In fact, I feel like I've gotten the best I can and so I want to try reducing my medication to see if I can handle not having it but my SO is somewhat against it and actually wants me to consider going back to therapy and/or increasing my medication.

Some background, in a normal week I have basically no symptoms of depression. I sleep and eat fine, I enjoy spending time with people and doing things. The only problem is that big parties tend to make me very uncomfortable and socializing really tires me out quite a lot. The other day we went to a big wedding with lots of dancing and talking and loud music and that's probably the only time I had anything resembling symptoms. Sometimes seeing people with really strong emotions makes me feel like there's something still wrong with me because I'm not sure I can feel emotions as strongly (it's not like I don't at all, just...not that \*big\* like some of our friends seem to). I got uncomfortable so I went outside for a walk with my SO and told him why I was upset. We walked for a bit and eventually went back in. I avoided people for a little bit but eventually started feeling better and (almost) started enjoying myself. 

There's also a weekly get together thing my SO goes to that I used to, but I really don't like all that much. There's rarely anyone there who I feel I can talk with or have anything in common with, and there's a few people who regularly go that I actually actively dislike. I think my SO thinks that I don't like it because of my depression/anxiety but I think I don't like it just because I don't like it.

I generally chalk my dislike of big parties and my tiredness from socializing as introversion but how do I know that I'm not actually still experiencing some depression or anxiety? Can I actually get to a point where I enjoy these things and they don't make me uncomfortable or is this just normal for me?",10Oct2018,1

To the people who have mental illnesses and are reading this, you are amazing for getting this far in your life. From what I read of stories shared by others who have mental illness/es, it's difficult to live with them since the battles all happen internally and not a lot of people can tell you're in so much agony until you open up to them about it. However, even if you open up about it, some people will misjudge you no matter what you say.


Despite the challenges you face, you are strong because you made it through the day alive. You are amazing because you can still get out of bed. You are beautiful because you rock that hairstyle of yours. You are awesome because you are you, and that's what matters.

63,"A very close friend of mine had her first thoughts about her mental health when she was just 5 y/o, and as she has never heard of BPD back then, only many years later she realised what those feeling were about. At the age of 13 the first epileptic seizure hit her and for years to come she though it explained what was going on. So right now she’s in her twenties, haven’t had seizures for about 5 years but is acting strange, and I feel it has something to do with BPD again, but she refuses to “get diagnosed” as she thinks she’s been handling it (herself basically) by herself and will do furthermore, and I feel like she isn’t handling it at all, especially now that she talks about “going” often. I feel like it has nothing to do with epilepsy, but I might be wrong as all things are connected.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few years, I've been finding myself occasionally lapsing between completely different mindsets. Specifically,  I'll catch myself being unreasonably aggressive towards certain things seemingly at random. That'd be bad enough, but the bigger issue is that when it happens, it's like my entire worldview changes. I'll think things I wouldn't normally think.

&amp;#x200B;

You know that feeling when you lean over a railing and you feel a momentary urge to just...jump? It's like that. Only it's not really sudden; it lingers for a bit. One moment I'm pleasantly talking to my best friend, the next I'm thinking about how much of a bitch she is and how I really resent her. I, a mixed-race man who identifies as black, catch myself thinking \*really\* racist things, toward my own race and others. It's like I go from center-left to extreme right and back in a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt has cancer, and she's going to die. My mom is devastated. I am, too. But sometimes she'll cry, and I just want her to quit being so annoying all the time. It makes me feel like pure shit.

&amp;#x200B;

These feelings aren't consistent, they don't last for terribly long, and I don't externalize them when they occur in any way, nor do I wish to.

I don't have anyone to dump this on because it isn't fair to them and realistically regardless of if they care for me no one wants to be dumped with such stupid baggage. I rely on rationality and this is the epitome of irrational and i just don't know what to do.

I consider if it is anxiety or something obsessive/paranoid but all i can think about is how others have it worse, or if i were to see someone they would say nothing is wrong, leaving me wondering why. Not sure if i am looking for validation or just need to unload, but there it is.",10Oct2018,1
68,"Note: Before you guys start reading I'd like to point out that yes I've seeked for medical help already. There's also a tl;dr at the end for those who don't have the time to read this huge block of text.

Hi, I'm Nytrite (19 years old, Male, 5""3, 61 kg, Filipino) a college student and normally I would not do this but I'm tired, stressed and on the verge of just giving up. I've been experiencing a chronic headache that lasts 24/7 for almost 10 months now and I don't know what to do anymore. If you're wondering what do I feel if I don't have extreme headaches - my head just feels heavy or I have this needle-like pain on the back of my head/neck area. I haven't experienced feeling at peace for the last 10 months or so.

It started a bit before or after (I can't recall the exact date) New Year's eve and I had this throbbing sensation at the back of my head that never seemed to go away. Resting and sleeping properly never seemed to help and stressful situations or facing a screen for long periods of time worsened my headache. But I thought it was just the stress of school work considering I was graduating high school so I never really gave it much thought. Not to mention that I could still handle the pain.

Then February arrived and the headache still persisted. So I finally convinced my parents that maybe I should see an eye doctor. So we went to the Optometrist. We thought that it had something to do with my eyes since I had instances back then where my head would hurt so much (or feel dizzy) due to eye strain that I would end up puking and just end up sleeping for the whole day. I also went to a Ophthalmologist back then but she would just tell me that I had perfect eyesight and that all I needed was rest. But this time it's different. Unlike back then where it would only last for almost a week and maybe a day or two of pain. Now it just hurts everyday.

So we met with the Optometrist. He diagnosed me with a little bit of Hyperopia (not sure what the right term is if the Hyperopia is not THAT serious or grave) and told me that I had to use these specialized glasses whenever I read or use gadgets. He added that I should probably return on October to check if my eyesight worsens and if I needed new glasses. What I'd like to point out is that I never had cases where I had blurred vision or trouble reading or even seeing. But considering he's the doctor we followed his advice. I just felt relieved that I now have a way to relieve the headache.

So I've been using the glasses for a few days initially and I thought it helped. That might have been the placebo effect since the doctor told me what it would do. But after awhile I started to notice that the glasses only made my headache worse. My eyes would throb (or feel like it's being squished) even more whemever I wore the glasses, so I decided to stop using it.

I finally graduated and my headache never went away and I continued to avoid using the glasses. Summer time came and I finally got to rest. I went back to sleeping an average of 7 to 8 hours and everything was chill. But the headache still persists. From the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. It's only when I'm dreaming do I get the sense of peace that I used to have before this dilemma. 

So now my parents decided that maybe I should see a Doctor of Internal medicine, and so we went. She suggested I had my blood tested. Results came in and everything was normal (hemoglobin, bad and good cholesterol, etc.) so she just prescribed me pain relievers for migraines and told me to rest. The pain relievers weren't much help considering I had to take them before bed. So I still had to spend the whole day with this god awful headache. It might be important to point out now that I never had trouble sleeping even though my headache persists.

Around June or July I decided that maybe I should see my old Ophthalmologist again. Seeing as my mom and I were never aware that Optometrists and ophthalmologists were actually different. And so we went. She checked the pressure of my eyes (she pressed it after applying anesthesia or something) and checked my vision (which was perfect by the way) but everything was normal. She did not want to prescribe me meds seeing as I didn't need anything. She just wanted me to rest and possibly see a Neurologist if I really wanted to be sure.

After my check-up, I began trying to find other hobbies that didn't involve much use of my eyes. Which is why I took an interest in drawing. Drawing became my destressor. But even so, my headache never stopped. After almost a month we finally went to the Neurologist. He did some motor tests on me and told me that I was good. So just to be sure he wanted me to take an MRI. Which was expensive as hell in my country. So I decided to wait it out. 

After a seemingly stressful session editing our yearbook (in the middle of summer.) It was the last straw, rhe pain of the headache was too much. I went home crying from the stress, and pain. The place where I was editing my yearbook had a blackout and it was hot, all the while I had to face a computer screen for possibly 3 hours straight. I was groggy and exahusted and in pain when I got home. I was also still having these crappy headaches that no one can figure out how to fix and that idea just made me all the more stressed, scared, and exhausted. 

And so we finally returned to the Neurologist, a different one this time. After the usual motor tests, he suggested that I should take a CT scan, the regular one. Considering that CT scans are almost 4 times cheaper than an MRI, we finally agreed to do so. It took me almost two days (possibly more I can't recall anymore) before the results were finally in. Shockingly enough it was clear (well, save for a minor sinusitis problem on the right part of my nose, which my doctor said was insignificant.) I was both relieved and disappointed. A part of me wished there was at least something that we could have worked on but all I got was nothing. He prescribed me meds (I can indicate them later if necessary) for pain relieving. He basically told me that it was just muscle contractions and that I had some form of migraine but less severe. The meds would probably work for an hour or so, reducing the gravity of the headache but never really removing it altogether. Even as I drank it I still had this heavy sensation in my head.

So I spent my 5 months of summer before college, figuring out how to fix my head which never amounted to anything.

So here I am now. With my headache possibly now worse than ever. There are even instances in class where if I tried to think too hard (or if I got too stressed) my head would just feel like it's being compressed forcing me to stop listening and I would end up bowing my head to try and regain my composure and calm down (which rarely works by the way.) Also (although again, this might be just me or the placebo effect) I find it harder to think mathematically and I'm having way more slips and ""brain farts"" than usual. 

I could be hanging out with my friends but even then my head would sometimes just randomly hurt so much that I'd have to stop and just pause for a minute or two.

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure which doctor I should go to. I'm stressed, I'm exhausted, and I'm desperate. Can somebody please tell me what I can do? I'm planning on going to a different Optometrist this weekend (I'm far away from home now because of college, so I'm in a different place) since I'm scared that if this continues on I might flunk my Midterms exams just because I can't think straight.

Some facts about me that might help: 1. I read a lot on my phone. But recently I had to stop because of school and this headache of mine. 2. I used to play a lot of games for long periods of time with minimal breaks. 3. I have motion sickness. I usually feel dizzy whenever I travel by airplane, boat and sometimes even in cars. 4. My course requires me to work with computers most of the time. 5. I don't smoke or do drugs.

What I generally feel when my headache gets too much: 1. If it's too much my head would just feel too heavy. Most of the time it feels like it's being squished or compressed and I can't think straight or do much when that happens. 2. There is a needle like pain on the back of my head or neck area which would last for an hour or so. 3. My head would feel numb but not exactly numb? Like the sensation feels like it is numb but I can still feel when my head is being touched. Sorry if I can't explain that properly. 4. My headache would sometimes cause me to be irritable and gets me frustrated and a bit short-tempered. 

When does it occur: 1. All the time 2. It gets worse when I'm stressed. Doing too much work or school work. When I'm overwhelmed by what's being discussed (trust me I never ever experienced this happening before.) 3. When I face a screen for maybe more than 5 minutes it would sometimes hurt my eyes. If it does hurt, I usually have this throbbing sensation in my eyes. Or something that feels like it's being squished or tightened. 4. I easily get groggy or lightheaded when I face down (or something close to that position.)

My current medication: 1. Gabapentin, Neurontin - 300 mg capsule. Before bed time. 2. Baclofen, Trilaxant - 10 mg tablet. Twice a day, when my head hurts.

I really hope I could get some form of help. Any tip or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Body confidence and mental health are closely linked. Look at eating disorders as evidence of this. I know how not feeling good about myself can affect my mood and it can make or break my day if I feel good/bad about my body and my appearance.

## THERE IS HOPE FOR THOSE OF US WHO STRUGGLE WITH BODY CONFIDENCE:

The best thing you can do is get familiar with your body shape as it is NOW. Get naked and get in front of a mirror. Go on…take a good look. No doubt, your eyes will be drawn to what you don’t like about yourself. Acknowledge that you are doing this and gently draw your attention back to your overall view. Learn to look for what you do like. Sure, we can all improve upon what we have but we are far kinder to ourselves when we accept ourselves as we are presently.

When we look at ourselves, we are our worst critics. Someone that wants to get naked with you won’t be standing their with their cliboard marking down all your defects. They’ll be happy to be with naked-you! Don’t draw attention to what you don’t like. Get comfortable in your own skin.

Do the ‘naked mirror exercise’ regularly until you get to the point where you can look at yourself non judgementally and possibly even with positive views about yourself. It can a while to ‘de-programme’ yourself but if you keep at it, the way you feel about yourself will improve.

We all come in different shapes and sizes. Self confidence covers many sins – get happy with yourself!

70,"Hi I'm u/ClutzyGothDragon and I live in America.

It's been years since my mental health problems began ... at the time a closely related family member was having ""more serious"" mental problems so I didn't really pay attention to mine.
It started with not really wanting to talk often and before I knew it I barely wanted to leave my bed. I didn't even have the energy to eat more than once a day or get myself something to drink most of the time. No one in my family noticed because it was something that happened over months and they were always there so it became ""normal"". Then my dad came home from deployment and asked why he hadn't seen his daughter leave her room more than once in 3 days. Suddenly it was clear that I had created a nearly indestructible bubble of seclusion. I never smiled, I stopped listening to my favorite music genres, I didn't want to do anything but sit in bed and watch anime, and I randomly cried. It took nearly 2 1/2 years for anyone in my family other than my grandmother to be able to interact with me more than about 2 times a week. It wasn't that I got better so much as I got sick and now needed people. To this day I suffer from horrible social anxiety and go non-verbal in almost all new situations.
I have been officially diagnosed with Severe Depression, Debilitating Anxiety, PTSD, and High Functioning Autism. I have good days and bad days. It just seems lately the it's 5 to 2 with the bad days winning. I don't want to be so broken but parts of my past messed me up phycologically and some things have been completely blocked out as a result. I was abused mentally, phycologically, and occasionally physically by someone who was supposed to care about me. I have problems loving myself because he made me feel worthless. 

If you read this far thanks.

71,"Exactly a year ago today, I coincidentally got diagnosed with GAD. It was the most terrifying day of my life. I knew I had anxiety, but it was never checked out or monitored by a professional. Before this, I had done everything I could to help myself because I was - for some reason - scared to take medication. I was prescribed a low dose of Lexapro. It took me 2 hours of me crying in my bed, terrified, staring at that bottle of pills to finally have the courage to just take the first one.

Taking care of my mental health, and getting it into check has been one of my biggest life accomplishments. This past year was spent regularly taking medication, focusing on myself and reading an array of self love/self help books. Aside from being a mother, I don’t think I’ve been proud of myself this much for anything.

12 months later exactly and I’m medication free (stopped in August) and my anxiety is at a minimum almost every day. It’s still mind blowing to me that I took that step, and that I got myself and my brain healthy. 

If you’re struggling, you’re not alone. When you feel like giving up, don’t. Getting to a point where you want to be mentally is so difficult, but trust me - if I can do it, you can too. Surround yourself with a good support system. And speak up. Your health is so important, and it starts with your brain. Don’t ever give up hope, as much as you want to. You’re important and you’re loved.

In the begining, it was a normal thing, but slowly everyone improved, leaving me behind. I thought I was going to fail 11th, I honestly still have no idea how I passed it. Now I'm in 12th, I've been failing chem a lot.

When I failed for the 2nd time, I was called to the principal's office.

75,"So for world mental health day I would like share something personal with you in the hopes you learn from it and take away this piece of advice; be kind to everyone.

So March 2017 I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after attempting suicide, although it is prevalent from a young age it was now an official diagnosis. 
Borderline personality disorder is described as; 

* Having an unstable or dysfunctional self-image or a distorted sense of self 
* Feelings of isolation, boredom and emptiness
* A history of unstable relationships that can change drastically from intense love and idealization to intense hate.
* Black and white thinking; there is nothing inbetween ‘good’ and ‘bad’ someone or something is either one or the other:
* A persistent fear of abandonment and rejection, including extreme emotional reactions to real and even perceived abandonment
* Intense, highly changeable moods that can last for several days or for just a few hours
* Strong feelings of anxiety, worry and depression
* Impulsive, risky, self-destructive and dangerous behaviors, including reckless driving, binge eating, drug or alcohol abuse
* Hostility and paranoia especially in periods when stressed
* Intense periods of disproportionate anger
* Unstable goals and aspirations
It is estimated that 80% of people diagnosed have suicidal intentions and that 10% commit suicide. DBT is the preferred method of therapy, although it’s bloody difficult to get an appointment- brilliant in a crisis situation. 

As you can imagine, this is not fun having to deal with especially when you feel or experience the majority of these EVERY DAY. In my case it’s guessed that it was from being bullied in primary school that triggered it and then being bullied well into academy that then made it worse. This also included friends who turned their backs on me (Basically don’t be a dickhead and teach your children not to bully cause it can fuck up people’s whole lives). 
Because of this I can feel inadequate and i can need a lot of approval and reassurance, god forbid if someone doesn’t reply immediately if in having a bad day and I’m then stuck in a spiral of ‘what have I done’ ‘they hate me’ etc, which is then seen to be overreacting even though the worry is quite real, and you can be seen to be ‘clingy’ which ends up pushing people away, which is the exact opposite of what you are trying to do. Trust me, you can’t win.
In a month I would say I have about 7 ‘really bad’ days when nothing is okay. In these days, almost every one of the symptoms are amplified. Therefore I’m not being a bitch if I’m walking around with a face like thunder, I’m trying to deal with everything going on in my head, as it’s at this point the suicidal thoughts are at their highest (even though they are always in the background in day to day life) also dealing with emotional whiplash is a bitch, being high as a kite and overexcited to the lowest you’ve ever felt in the space of ten minutes is tiring especially when it happens multiple times a day for no reason at all 😂
Being tired also amplifies things like the paranoia, if I hear people in the next room talking it instantly has to be about me, and they are taking the piss or generally talking bad about me (which in all honesty is probably in my head), Which then leads me to be off with the people, then they wonder why I’m being off with them then it may actually cause them to talk about me therefore it’s a self destructive cycle you can’t seem to get out of. 
Relationships with people are hella tricky, and I just can’t get my head round them. Friendships are difficult because I’m not good at reading people and have a tendency to read them wrong, which causes me to believe people have bad intentions and hidden motives and that has ended many friendships. In conversations you try to use your own experiences to connect with others when they are telling a story or talking about their feelings, however people can see this to be ‘trying to top their story’ or ‘self centred’ even although you are trying to empathise and show the person you understand them. 
Anger is a shite and difficult emotion to deal with. People diagnosed with BPD are  seen as violent and aggressive, as they can lash out depending on how they deal with their anger, however I don’t believe it is fair that there is a stigma that EVERYONE who is diagnosed is like that. For me it only has to be something small to trigger it such as my eyeliner not going right or that I tied up buttons wrong, however the anger in that moment is so bad that you could just scream. That can set me off for the whole day which in turn can cause me to argue with people close to me or ‘self isolate’. I’m of no danger to anybody and would like for people to change the way in how they view bpd sufferers.
All in all I’m also fed up of the stigma attached around mental health issues the main ones here are ‘manipulative, aggressive, attention seeking’ THIS IS NOT THE CASE.
I’m not going to cover every single symptom and emotion but hopefully by now you realise that there is more to people that meets the eye, that even if people don’t talk about their mental health that they can be suffering.
I am not my diagnosis. This is but one disorder and the way it effects one person. Think of the thousands of people who have the same thoughts and feelings day in and day out and this is only for ONE disorder. I am just thankful for my partner, my family and my friends that have stuck around and supported me when I need it most and how understanding they are. 

The moral is to be kind to EVERYONE, because you have no fucking idea the battles people have going on in their head.

77,"Hi all,

I am finally at that point where I try to start eating healthier to improve my mental health. I always thought once I'm better, once the meds get me better or therapy or my life just gets easier I will be able to do more exercise and eat better, lose weight, be happy. But I finally come to accept that its all linked.

I'm at it the last six weeks now, lost a few kilos, have a bit more energy... and then the last two days life falls apart again, nothing in particular, just me... and then their is all that comfort food back. But I start to learn to be less frustrated about them episodes, just ride them out and then keep going. I can't even remember a life without depression anymore but I am so sick and tired of it. There gotta be a way out otherwise what is it all for.

&amp;#x200B;

So I try to keep my mind occupied, doing research and trying to find some good sources.

I thought I share if anyone is interested. Please feel free to give some input too. I am always open for ""easier"" ways... not trying to make it to complicated ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have the time watch that first video. It is quite long and to me it appeared really weird at the start but the longer you listen the more familiar things sound and you realise they know what they are talking about. Her case seems extreme but I think it gives an interesting inside to what extend diet can influence mental health. Give it a go.

78,"Although I told him I don't want to get serious with him, I grew very fond of him since we got very close during our dating. He first told me that it's okay, and that he accepts my decision, but now he is telling me that I am the most beautiful thing that happened to him and he has to ""get some rest"". This isn't the first time he mentioned suicide, but this time he turned off his phone after sending ""drunk"" love messages, caused by sleeping pills. 

He lives in another city. How do I cope with this? I feel like I will die every second. How to cope with being the probable cause of suicide ????????? I cannot breathe

80,"My partner was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD when he was 16 (he's now 36) and was prescribed lithium which he took for a couple years and then stopped. He hasn't been medicated or sought any mental health support since then. He regularly uses cannabis which helps slow him down a bit and keep him pretty level. I 100% believe the ADHD diagnosis but the bipolar seems incorrect to me. I'm not a mental health professional but it seems to me that his moods are fairly stable and when he gets upset or agitated about something, it's not an extreme reaction and it's most often about something that any person would get upset about. 

We're talking about having a baby in the next few years and he doesn't want to continue using cannabis when we have a baby in the house and he's not sure where to start. His plan is to go see a psychiatrist and just ask for meds which I think may not be a great idea. I think he should try talk therapy or yoga or something else to center him a bit before jumping into heavy psych meds which would significantly impact us both. 

Anyone have any tips for supporting a partner with their mental health stability? ",10Oct2018,1
81,"Simply not giving a f*ck seems to be benefiting my mental health. Not caring what people think of me, not caring if I am anxious etc. Something I have noticed is some of the people who do appear to have better mental health are the people who don't care about what other people think of them. If they have done something wrong they don't worry about it, they simply don't care. Better off doing that than making you self ill with worrying about what other people are thinking. ",10Oct2018,1
82,"I have never been properly diagnosed with anxiety, depression or anything of the sort. But I still feel the symptoms.

It's draining. Constantly feeling on the edge. Breakdowns every week, not knowing how to handle my emotions. Getting mad at silly little things. And no one seems to understand.

I have lost friends over petty arguments. They say that all I think about is myself. I didn't even know I was like that until my friend told me, which brought me down lower. Now I feel like I can't talk to anyone without feeling scared of being seen as self-absorbed or attention seeking. 

I have even resorted to writing 'goodbye' letters to my friends and parents. It's how I handle things. Having that constant thought of whether I'm going to do it or not just puts me right on edge. My emotions are heightened, but at the same time I feel numb if that makes sense. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. What's the point, if all you do is cry yourself to sleep every night and feel like sh*t 24/7.

83,"I've always suffered from depression, and while it's affected school I've always been somewhat able to manage passing. This year of college has been particularly rough however, and I find myself failing and crying daily, unable to work, unwilling to see friends, facing constant suicidal thoughts and a desire for drugs. I don't even know where time goes as I haven't been able to enjoy any of the things I once did in months and I don't ever leave my suite, much less campus. I'm just perpetually in a horrible mood (irritable, hopeless, and stuck on traumatic memories). 

&amp;#x200B;

I vaguely mentioned dropping out to a friend, and he said I should try and seek antidepressants before I consider dropping out. Both scenarios require me going home and telling my mother my situation, which is extremely shameful as she doesn't understand these things. She's told me in the past antidepressants aren't a magic pill and instead fog up your mind and alter your personality, and come with life endangering side effects like obesity and heart problems, and actually cause suicide. This makes me scared to ask for them much less take them, so I'm not sure what to do.",10Oct2018,1

85,"I see the phrase ‘It’s ok to be not okay’ floating around sometimes and it’s in full force today. Personally, I really don’t like this. The thought is there but the wording is very off and it rubs me the wrong way. 

For me I’m not okay with being not okay. I don’t think it’s right. It feels like saying “You’re depressed? That’s fine”. It’s NOT fine. Rather than sharing and posting that viral sentence everywhere and saying it’s fine, take action. Don’t think you’re helping by posting that. 

It’s NOT ok to be not okay, let’s do something about it and get the help we need. And for those of you who are of sound mind, help the people around you rather than sharing something like that. 

By sharing that shit all you’re saying is “It’s ok to be depressed. It’s ok to be suicidal. It’s ok to be self-harming. It’s ok to feel worthless, to be a burden”
People sharing this obviously have ZERO understanding of what it’s like to be mentally unwell.

ITS NOT OKAY

86,"This past Saturday at noon I wanted to go out for lunch, but I was in a big city and on Saturdays there are soo many people walking around literally millions of people and it made me feel soo confused that I didn't know where to go. I first went to Starbucks but I just felt like I was in everybody's way and just walked out. 

At that point, I just wish to be dead right now. My head is a full blown mess. I don't know what to do or what to think or what to say, I just don't know why I hate myself so much. It's soo hard to put it into words

I then tried to go to McDonald's and there were so many people, and I thought I didn't even deserved a seat because there are so many people sitting with their friends who deserve a seat way more than me, so I walked out again. I really started to hate myself while I was walking out because I was even too fucking stupid to get something to eat so I decided that I deserved to starve and not eat anything that day because I'm too dumb to even buy a meal so I just went home and didn't eat that day.

While waiting for the suburban train, I just felt like crying. I just wanted to punch myself so hard in the face because I'm so stupid. 
It's also important to note that I always go out and eat alone because well I don't have someone I could call a friend, so I try to be happy without friends and go out anyway but it's so difficult. 

Why do I have to feel this way? What did I do to hate myself so much? I just don't think I don't belong here anymore. 

I also have to go to work tomorrow and I really hate my job it's like a 40h week before my school starts in a couple weeks and I'm 17 year old guy. It's very robotic and very soul-sucking. 

I don't even know what to do after school like I know 0% of what I want to do. Given the fact that I hate my job I feel like there's no job or degree that would interest me or bring me any kind of joy, so I feel like I'm not even supposed to be here. All I want is just a little satisfaction to make the time I'm spending working for someone else worthwhile, is that too much to ask? :/ 

When I'm on my break and I sit in the lunchroom, I just feel so empty, my soul feels completely drained, to the point where it sometimes feels like there are demons in my head and I just want to dissappear, but I have to pull myself together because there are a lot of people there so I just stare out the window and try to hold it in. Even the people sitting in the lunch room don't even want to be there, I can really tell. 

I'm really trying to have self discipline but I thought yeah maybe you could make some money and go out and eat and be happy but that day I just realized even if I had a million dollars and I could buy the fanciest meal in the world I would still hate myself and be so unhappy so why would I need money? I don't. I used to know that money doesn't buy happiness but now I really get it, it gives you 0% happiness.

I do have some good moments for example this past Monday a little kid gave me a chocolate ball on the train. He was Asian so he had these really sweet eyes and when he smiled, my whole face lit up and I had a really bright smile on my face too and I said thank you. He was really sweet. 

I really envy people who are in their late 20s or early 30s or 30s in general who just enjoy living life and be happy and know how to handle this stuff and it makes me just wanna punch myself in the face even more. 

I really start to think, I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm just in everybody's way and I need to disappear.

Whenever I say to my friends ""I'm so depressed"" they just respond with ""Me too lol"" and that is the furthest I can pursue anything because I'm not fucking worth the time honestly.  I was really seeing an improvement in the Summer but once I returned to the country I live in and am not from everything went back to shit.

89,"Lets take a moment today and remember that many of us Veterans out there suffer from some sort of PTSD or TBI. Along with those usually comes Depression, Anxiety and other forms of Mental Health Issues. Thank you for joining Stand Down Gaming on this journey. If you would like to contribute please see links below. 

I would like to discuss today why I started Stand Down Gaming. I am a 3 time suicide survivor. For years I thought I had nothing to live for, spent my time in and out of hospitals. Trying all sorts of medications from 2011-2013. In January 2013 I was medically retired out of the US Army. I stopped my meds and dug myself deeper into my depression. Around this time I met my significant other, she is the best thing that has happened to me! She took me in, even though I was a drunk, sloppy, no care in the world for anything. She helped me get back on my feet, helped me learn what it meant to be around people who cared and opened their arms. For 3 years we were basically homeless, living in other peoples places when we could and renting a basement or a room here and there. We went through a lot with each other in a very short time. In January of 2018 I admitted myself to the VA Psychiatric facility. I was having a bad year in 2017 and I was going to change that for the future! I talked to the doctors, got back on a couple medications and walked out a few days later a changed person. 2018 has truly been a great year for me, I finally went to The Gorge Amphitheater in George, WA to see Dave Matthews Band. It was a surprise for my SO, she wanted to go so bad previous years but my PTSD stopped me. This year we've been to two great outdoor concerts! Now it is September 2018, I wanted to reach out to other Veterans to get together and play games with me, be around like minded individuals again, a support group! I have had an out pouring of help from every corner of the US. From Board Games, to Card Games, to Video Game Accessories. I want to thank you all and let you know how much this means to me and to the Veterans we are helping! If you'd like to reach out and help our group feel free to message me.

91,"I don't even know how to start this, but I will start by saying that I am 47 and a mother to 5 kids. Hubby and I have been married for 24 years and we have a house in Pennsylvania (East Coast US) where we have lived for nearly 10 years now.  


To summarize my childhood: I don't remember a lot of it. My step father was abusive to my mom and to us, and I was bullied in school from elementary to the day I graduated because I was always different. I was immature. Have lots of diagnoses...MDD, GAD, Alcoholism (2 years sober now, but I have had a problem with alcohol since my teens), Anorexia (in remission but it had gotten REALLY bad), and self-harm, which I still do unfortunately when I am super stressed and I can't relieve myself the way I like to. I have tried to commit suicide so many times over my lifetime that I've lost count. Also been hospitalized so many times (once in a state institution for almost 6 months which made me miss most of my senior year of hs so I graduated at 19) and the most recent being in 2015. That was the time I made 2 attempts within 6 weeks of each other. I remember vaguely burning stuff as a young teen in the woods to calm myself down and I remember the pure love of that flame. Then life happened. I got married, had kids, didn't think much about it until recently...and that is where my story begins.  


I fell in love with a first-person-shooter game on Steam called Team Fortress 2. I have been playing for almost 2 years now. I started playing around Halloween in 2016 when our then 14 year old son showed me it. I quickly found which character I identify the best with: a mumbling delusional guy (we think) in an asbestos suit who has a flamethrower as a weapon and other fire-based weapons as secondaries and melees. I quickly got good at playing him, and he is my Main now. I also Main a couple others too, but that isn't important. There was always something about him that REALLY appealed to me. The flamethrower made me tingle when he (I) used it. I didn't realize it, but something was awakening inside me--something that had been sleeping for at least 3 decades by then. I decided to write a Fan Fiction story about this character, but I put it in the 1st person point of view, which essentially put myself in the story as this character. I had to imagine the weapon and how I would use it, and I described some battle scenes, taken out of my own experiences on the Casual servers (playing against real other people).  


I had awoken it.  


I realized that I was getting very very excited when I thought about fire...and everything that had to do with it. I wanted to write MORE and MORE about it. I eventually finished the story, and all of a sudden this desire exploded inside me, and I went and I lit a fire. I almost died from pleasure...the relief I had felt, the years of repressing it...all came out and I fell deeply in love with fire once more. I now start fires several times a day, whenever the urges come. I am safe when I burn (except that one instance where I had gone a little wild and almost started a brush fire on purpose) and I make sure that nobody is around when I do so. Well...I have been ""caught"" but not by anyone important. Mostly goofy kids who think it is fascinating to see a lady burning stuff with a huge grin on her face.  


Living with this is hard at times. There ARE times where I can not safely burn, so I do not. I have enough self-control (advantage being older than the typical fire-starter) to know that there are times I have to hold it off. I watch a lot of videos on YouTube and I play with a lighter in secrecy during these times, but it always comes down to me eventually going out and burning something.   


When I am sitting here like now, I can feel it building and building and building. It is like an anxiety attack, but a little different. It feels like the exciement you used to feel as a kid at Christmas or when you know something good is coming your way like a vacation or something. Soon, though, I start craving the flames and they start showing up as images in my mind. Then the real urges start...a nagging ""voice"" telling me to burn. It compels me to move and if it is safe, I give in and burn. If not, it builds some more and I try my best to hold it in. As I said, it does come out eventually. Sometimes it comes out as anger (I get really testy and mean when I am fighting the urges) or it comes out as self-harm. See exhibit A on my left forearm. That was because my kids were all around me and I couldn't get away to do what I do (rain dang it) so I self-harm to at least shut that voice up a little. I also do a lot of visualizing. I see buildings on fire in my mind and it makes me tingle with excitement. That helps shut the voice up too.

&amp;#x200B;

During a burn, I get a rush in my head (sorry about this) that feels like an orgasm. Total and absolute release. It is not physical though, just mental. My thoughts all quiet and I am able to breathe again. I feel that tingling sensation all over and then it becomes a physical thing, but in the form of a total relaxation of my whole body. I look at the flames and they consume my whole being for a second, and I feel the love you feel for a relative or a spouse or child.  


After the burn, I look at the charred remains and feel satisfaction...happiness. A calm feeling. I am able to think clearly and the urges are quiet again.   


Then, it depends on how distracted I get, but after some time passes, the anxiety/excitement starts building...  


And it starts all over again. Several times a day. Sometimes several times an hour.  


I am going into therapy, but I don't have high hopes since the statistics are already against me. I am not supposed to have developed (though I think it was more of a re-awakening) this at this late age, so treatments may not help, and remission is pretty much not likely. There aren't a lot of studies, so maybe the therapist and doctors I work with can learn something from me as I learn from them. I hope to be able to address the anxiety, but that really isn't the problem. There is often no trigger for these urges. They just are. They come without warning. I accept this. This is my reality.  


This is a middle-aged woman with Pyromania.  


This is me.  


Thanks for reading and I hope everyone can find peace and comfort today. I wrote this (and it took me FOREVER since I kept getting distracted and pulled away by this and that--stupid phone ringing ha ha) to just tell my story and show you why this is affecting me so much and why I talk about it here. It is a burden, to be sure. It hurts me.   


Have a great day all!

94,"hi, first time finding this subreddit and first time posting here.

i can't tell if my experiences are anything serious or if it's just me being a dumb scaredy cat, so i hope i don't waste anyone's time reading this haha. anyways, there's a couple of related points, so I'm gonna try to be as organized as much as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

* sleeping at night: so this is something that's been progressively getting worse over the years. when I was around 10, I could sleep with the lights completely out and the door totally closed. later, I had to turn on the hallways lights and open my door to let the light come into the room. now, when I sleep, one of the lights in my room is on, the door is open, and the hallway light is on. i also can't fall asleep unless I'm dead tired or unless there's music playing on my phone. if I don't do all these things, I just have this feeling that there's someone looking through the windows, someone looking through the walls, some presence at my back. I still feel these things every night, but the music usually distracts me enough to help me sleep
* at night: when everyone else is the house is sleeping, I can't get myself to get out of my room. naturally, as a student, I would stay up late to finish homework and I would get hungry and need to go to the bathroom. but when there's no one downstairs, I can't get myself to go down and get a snack or water. even if I do go downstairs, I turn on the kitchen lights, get what I need, and end up running upstairs without turning off the lights. similarly, the bathroom is right outside my room. sometimes I'd convince myself I can just go in the morning, but when I really need to go, I would go, and do everything as quick as possible (do my business, wash my hands) and run back to my room
* in the day: I thought this might've been me just being scared of the dark. but even during the day, when I'm the only one in the house, I can't get out of my room. similar to my concern above, I'm gonna be hungry and need to go the bathroom. I usually don't go downstairs until someone comes home. with the bathroom, it's easier to do in the day than in the night, but I still want to go back to my room as much as possible
* overall, these feelings were worse during summer break, but they got slightly better after starting school. in the past, I used to get really scared by the smallest sounds (prob just wind outside) but now I just try my best to sleep
* what got me to ask on this subreddit was because of what happened last night. I was really tired and slept early for my standards (10 pm), but I woke up in the middle of the night. when I opened my eyes, I didn't ""think"" about anything. like I wasn't imagining anything scary, but I just felt fear for absolutely no reason, and just started screaming. I got up and just instinctively opened my door and ran to my mom's room on the same floor. 

ik it sounds really stupid, and I also feel really stupid because I'm basically already an adult. But I just felt really miserable after what happened last night, and I'm worried that this problem will persist when I go to college. any suggestions or tips would help to solve this problem. thanks for reading through this long mess lol",10Oct2018,1
95,"Today is #worldmentalhealthday, I've been dealing with mental health issues since I was 7 years old. ADHD as a kid, as a teenager I started having panic attacks, I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression. Then at 26, I found out i had this. I was pissed, angry, sad and confused. I didn't know what this meant for my life. I couldn't understand why it had to be me. I'm realizing it's because I have a story to tell. So, most of my days are ok, some of them suck. The depressive element sucks the energy out of me. The mental breakdowns are awful, because essentially you have to start your entire thought process over from scratch. All the things you would normally be able to do, you just can't. You baby step your way into interacting with the public again, and it takes time. If I'm manic (overly hyper), I do entirely too much and I crash. I'll sleep for 4 hours and be up for 30 or more. It's hard waking up not knowing what mood I'll be in, or if my anxiety will make it so I can't function that day. But I say a little prayer, take my medicine, and live my life. Medicine has helped me a lot, but it's not a cure. People seem to think that once you start taking a pill, you never have episodes again in your life. Not true, they simply allow you to function enough to keep you out the hospital. I still have shitty days, and sometimes shitty weeks. Recently, I broke down in my car crying and screaming. Why? Extreme Moodswings. My Point? I'm not perfect. I have this, but I refuse to let it take over me. The day I stop fighting is the day I stop living. I may wake up with a level of uncertainty, but I wake up knowing that my sanity is worth the fight, and every good day outweighs my bad. I can only imagine where I would be if I never got help. So, if you need to reach out to someone, please do without hesitation. Hell, you can even reach out to me 😊 If you need a support system, find one. Life is too short to let it waste away...#mentalhealth #mystory #mentalhealthawareness #loveyourself #youreperfect",10Oct2018,1
96,"I'm a very calm person otherwise (at work, at home, with my family/friends). But I feel like sometimes I just turn into a monster when I drive. I don't think I put myself in any danger when I drive but I don't know if I'm being objective about that.

If I had to come up with any rationale for my anger, I happen to be a very, very defensive driver and I lose my temper if another driver is anywhere close to putting me or my family in danger. Basically everyone on the road is a moron / threat to my life except me.

I think if I continue this behavior I will set a bad example for my son as he gets older. I just have a really tough time controlling my language and emotions when others are not following the rules of the road. Also does no use their god damn turn signals?!",10Oct2018,1

I have depression, PTSD, and unspecified mood affective disorder. I went to egypt at the beginning of the semester to serve in a medical clinic for refugees and fell behind in school. Catching up has been so hard and my grades are bad. I also work. I am really hard on myself and have recently been succumbing to the stress.

98,"Yesterday I skipped class yet again for like the 3rd or 4th week in a row. Every day I end up saying ""oh I'll just go tomorrow"" and it snowballs. I decided to take a bunch of LSD instead, and tripped at home. Lately I've been coming more to terms with my depression and anxiety, and how it's negatively affecting me. How I can't talk to people, how I abuse various substances in an effort to make it through the day, how I'm alone and sad and angry and lazy and unmotivated all the time. How I can't put the past behind me and move on. How I neglect my friends and have pushed away people I care about.

I've never done therapy before, but today I decided to setup a counseling session at my university. I've wanted to for a little while but never knew how to get the ball rolling. But earlier I called, and they made an appointment to fill out paperwork later today. I'm heading out shortly to do all that and finally get started.

I didn't even really realize I had these problems for the first couple years. Looking back it's easy to see but at the time maybe I was just in denial, idk. Recently it got worse and I realized that I'm either going to end up killing myself and or get better, and I chose I want to get better. I want to open up and talk to someone about what goes on in my head. To get some guidance in life. To be put on whatever meds I need to get my brain chemistry back in sync. I don't want to keep living emotionless, like a shell of who I used to be and who I could be.

Today I decided I'm done dealing with all this. Today I decided I'm done dwelling on the past and want to work for a better future. Today I decided I want to be happy, I want to be more social and outgoing and able to understand what's going on in my own head and use it productively instead of destructively. Hopefully this will be a good way to move towards that, because today I realized I need help.

Funny enough, I honestly think a lot of Uncle Iroh's wisdom from watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (especially on 300mcg of acid yesterday lmao) helped make me realize I don't have to live unhappy like this anymore.

101,"im a 16 year old female and i almost drowned back in july. i was at the community pool on a busy day and an ice cream truck showed up. Both kids and their parents sort of stampeded to get in line and i was standing by the edge of the pool looking for my younger cousin. i got pushed and i slipped and fell into the 12 foot deep end and because i was never taught how to swim, i panicked. i was in the water for atleast 2 minutes before my cousin noticed, and because he's only 7, he was confused and just gave me his hand to grab on. if he didnt notice, im sure i wouldnt be texting this right now. problem is, im still having flashbacks of the pool and being underwater and not being able to breath. i cant take a shower without getting all panicky and shaky and i cant watch a video of someone in the water or a boat or anything to do with bodies of water. a few days ago, i started having dreams that i was screaming  as if i was underwater and no one could hear me and then i woke up all shaky, once again. i dont really know what to do or what this is but i dont want to self diagnose because it just seems so small compared to other people problems.",10Oct2018,1

103,I’ve always been curious as to who can diagnose mental illness. Is it therapists and psychiatrists or just psychiatrists? ,10Oct2018,1
104,"I’ve had over ten therapists in my life. Over the last ten years, I’ve heard almost all of my therapists and psych doctors say this phrase to me:

“I’ve never heard of anything like that before.”

How can my issues possibly be so unique that no specialists have heard about them before? Unsurprisingly, my doctors can’t agree on a diagnosis for me, either. (Anxiety? OCD? Atypical Bipolar? BPD?)

I feel really alone in my issues. I don’t want to say “nobody understands my pain” but it’s becoming increasingly obvious that whatever I have is super rare.",10Oct2018,1
105,"So this isn't one of those cry for help posts, I'm done being said; as last year the exact same thing happened, at around exactly the same date.

So my girlfriend of 10 months just dumped me, yet I'm still very confused as she stills has sex with me ect; and tells me she's into me. We're just friends now, but it's obvious that she's already over me, in such a short period of time.

Now, she's being talking to other guys, and one of them likes her, and she's wondering whether to let him down easy or to go on a few dates to humor him (she likes him as a friend).

The thing is, it's likely that she'll get a new boyfriend, or she may get back together with me, but do I really want to deal with seeing her with another guy? She's was very vocal about our relationship, so it would be all up in my face. We're still best friends, which may give me a chance, but if she does get with someone else, do I really want to be around to experience that?

I'm not going out there and say that I'm going to hurt myself in any way, although it has crossed my mind, from a logical standpoint is there any point in me sticking around? Or should I just hit the switch to avoid the emotional pain?

This is probably just me in a bad mood, but the thought has crossed my mind a couple times; so don't worry about me, I'm 90% sure that I won't do anything like that, I just want a second opinion.",10Oct2018,1
106,"I’ll start out by saying I don’t feel sad particularly, or depressed, or even tired most of the time. I just don’t FEEL, anything really. All I want to do is lay in bed, most of the time I’m not even tired. I have a boyfriend I love, I have great friends, work is stressful but not too much, I honestly don’t know why I feel so numb most of the time, and why I have no motivation to even get out of bed most days. I also workout 3-5 times a week. It feels like somethings wrong but also that nothings wrong at the same time, if that makes any sense. I’m not in a place where I can afford therapy or medication. I just don’t know what to do. I feel fine enough that I’m not sad or miserable but I just feel numb and empty. What do I do?",10Oct2018,1

108,"So I started a new job 2 months ago. And I cannot say I like it, mostly because I hate my manager. Lately I realized that I cry very often, and very easily. It's weird because in the past I only cried when something extreme happened.

I function fine, my diet and sleeping are fine. I go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I control myself well, I only cry when I'm alone or with my girlfriend, so not like it really interferes with my life or anything.

However, it gets too often lately, like once a day now, and I don't know if I should be worried about this. ",10Oct2018,1

110,"I'm 24 and have been on various antidepressants since I was 14.

I asked my psychiatrist to get me off of mirtazapine and risperidone. I was on 15mg of mirtazapine and she said I could stop taking it. She then lowered the dose of 2mg down to 1mg of risperidone.

Ever since Sept 28th, when I lowered that dose, I've been going through an absolute hell. I have trouble sleeping. Always sweating. I feel vibrations and tingly feelings which are very unpleasant throughout the day and night, especially when I sleep.

I've been feeling a very massive depression that just hurts. I feel like I'm in a lot of pain. Everything hurts. Nothing makes me happy. Music doesn't sound the same. Everything just hurts.

I asked my psychiatrist and she said ""Oh I don't think it's withdrawal, it's probably the depression coming back and you should go back on 2mg""

She was also recommending being medicated for life.

I'm just sick of all these drugs. I just want to be free and normal and away from these horrible drugs. My therapist has said that Risperidone has helped me in the past to focus, not sure what he means by that.

I feel like I'm slipping and losing touch. Things just feel weird and off. Nothing feels good. I'm in a lot of pain.

Is this really just withdrawal and my psychiatrist is lying to me? She said she really didn't think it was withdrawal, but still. I feel in my heart that it's withdrawal. 

I don't know what to do. I'm just in a lot of pain. Will vaping CBD help in anyway? Will drinking kratom at night help in any way? Will taking CBD oil help in any way?

I've been running everyday. I've been drinking kale smoothies. But everything just seems so dark and painful that I could just start crying from the pain.

I went to the pharmacy, and they said there was nothing they could do.

And my psychiatrist doesn't think CBD does anything. I don't know if it does anything either really, except maybe help me fall asleep.

I've been on 2mg of risperidone for years. Is this just withdrawal that I'm going through? Is this just part of the process of getting off these drugs?

I'm scared of going forward. The pain just keeps getting worse and worse each day. I have no energy. I can't focus. I just can't do anything. And I go to work tomorrow and I'm scared because of how painful it will be. I know I need to keep working, but still.

Things are just really fucked up right. My friends and family think I'm normal and don't need this medication. They all support me in getting off this stuff.

But just how long is this pain going to last? I feel a deep pain within me that just HURTS. I feel so uncomfortable and everything is painful and unenjoyable. Nothing makes me feel good at all.

Can smoking weed help with the withdrawals or will that make things worse?

I feel like I'm going through depersonalization. Things just feel off and different. I'm really scared right now.

If you have any advice, please tell me. I just want to get off this medication as soon as possible. I was going to see my psychiatrist on the 23rd of October, and then she will lower the dose again, and then after that I guess I will be drug-free perhaps?

111,"I am going through one of the hardest mental and physical health journeys of my life readjusting to not taking Zoloft (on it for 4 years). Due to my lack of a relationship with a PCP, I'm doing it on my own. I now know this was ill-advised and I am working as hard as I can to find a therapist to work with from here on out. That being said, I was on a 100mg dose and cut in half for 6 weeks before I stopped all together and that was about 3 weeks ago. I feel like a shell of a human, and am sooo much worse off than I ever was on it (again, physically and mentally). I have read that some people have no side effects and some people are never the same again.

118,"My mother has been battling severe mental illness, drug addiction, and homelessness for at least 6 years now. She lives in Hawaii with no friends, family, or any kind of a support system. I moved away from Hawaii to Utah to be in my grandparent’s care when I was 14, and haven’t seen her since (9 years ago). 

She has been mentally ill for as long as I can remember. (Probably schizophrenia, but I’m not sure). I have countless vivid memories of her having full on conversations with herself, and was convinced that this was just a normal thing that adults did for almost all of my childhood. Her siblings even noticed her abnormal behavior as a child/teenager. Obvious body dysmorphia, and an extreme abnormal need for secrecy and privacy, even for a teenager. Both of these are things I also noticed growing up. But for most of my younger childhood years, she was functional enough to hold a job and take care of herself. But she has never gotten help, seen a psychiatrist, and she gets extremely defensive and angry when anyone insinuates that she might need to see someone. She avoided doctors at all costs, even for non-mental issues. Her severe tonsils problems almost killed her several times, but she’d always avoid going to the doctor, and never even considered having them removed. 

When I was 11 we moved to Hawaii because she wanted to be even farther away from the family than we already were (we lived in NM, and the rest of our family lives in UT). When we moved her mental health deteriorated even further, and she got heavily into crystal meth and probably other drugs. Since I moved to Utah at 14, I haven’t seen her and we’ve hardly spoken at all. Mostly due to my resentment, anger, and the fact that she can’t even hold up a conversation, as everything she says is gibberish. 

Over the years in Hawaii, she’s been arrested several times, but always ends up back on the streets, homeless. 

Right now, my grandparents are in Hawaii, trying one final time to get her help but they seem to be at a dead end. She’s constantly hearing voices in her head. She’s convinced that everyone is putting stuff into her brain, that they’re plotting against her, and that everyone is out to get her. She’s terrified of computers and was covering all of their laptops with blankets because she thinks they’re dangerous, and apparently the voice are telling her that their hotel is dangerous too. 

She locked herself in their bathroom for hours, so my grandparents called the police, who escorted her to the hospital. My grandparents were hoping that they could admit her for 72 hours, because they acknowledge that she’s extremely mentally ill. But unless they can prove that she’s a danger or herself or others (which they can’t), there’s nothing they can do. 

1. How can you help someone that’s so mentally ill that they don’t even realize they’re ill and need help? 

2. Even if she somehow agreed to an evaluation or any form of treatment, she has no support system in Hawaii, so I don’t know how that could be maintained in any way. 

3. I’m not even sure if my grandparents could attempt to bring her back to Utah with them, as I don’t think she’d be allowed on an airplane. I’m not even sure if she has an ID.

4. Seeing as how she’s already homeless and has nothing, any sort of ultimatum or bribe to convince her to accept help seems unlikely, since she’d rather live homeless and alone than even entertain the idea of getting evaluated. 

I know I’m not the first person to be in this situation, and I feel there must be some sort of a solution, despite the indelibly flawed mental health and judicial systems in the country.

TW self harm, suicide, ED and abuse mention 

————

Idk when my mental health mess started, there’s seemingly always been something going on in that way, whether it’s daring myself to eat poisonous plants at age seven, playing with kitchen knives at age eight, distancing myself from friends at age ten, twelve, and again at age fifteen. My sad angsty teenagedom came to a peak when I fell into an abusive relationship, in every sense of that word. He loved me in the same way that I loved myself. He didn’t. I became bff’s with blades, an empty stomach and self destruction; passing out in the bathroom of my family home repeatedly on the hottest night of the year. You find your coping mechanisms in the strangest of places. I did all of this while still remaining a top student, and not a soul realising. It’s disturbing how much you can hide when you hold yourself to the highest standards of perfection. 

Things got better by eighteen, I found requited love in somebody who understood and cared. I moved to London away from ‘Sunnyside Bridge’. My wounds healed and I slowly but surely repressed what I needed to. We became codependent. He was hurting too, and we filled each other’s voids with compassion until we couldn’t anymore.

At twenty one I’m living with myself now. In ways I still feel like that (L)only child, I’ve finally received the counselling and assistance that I’ve fought with myself and medical professionals to get since I was sixteen. When you’re a high functioning mess who can talk stoically about death idealisation with a polite smile, you’re rarely believed. My coping mechanisms have gotten more nuanced, I find myself picking at my skin and putting myself in purposefully unsafe situations. I’ve recovered horrific memories and derealised, and felt that hunger again, and managed somehow to not relapse into my older worser ways. I keep busy, I’m scared that if I slow down that the depression will stop me entirely, I’ve found a way to use my anxiety to keep moving forward and doing what I need to do. Don’t let that fear paralyse you, I know that I’ll sink if I do. 

I’m painting again, it’s a self portrait. It’s pretentious and self pitying and full of pretty patterns and it helps. Although I enjoy the decoration I’m pushing against all of my muscle memory to break the recurring design of self destruction and salvation. I’m paying more attention to my boundaries, what feels natural and comfortable isn’t always what’s best for us in the long term. I’m trying to be more honest about my feelings, and I’m attempting to experience them when they happen. I’m starting to reach out.

Maybe this will work, maybe this is just another stint in self salvation. Maybe I just like a good depression_meme too much, mostly I’m just trying to be kinder to myself and others. 
No matter how today went, you did well for getting this far

127,"Hi,

I'm a 34 year-old man living with manic depressive disorder.  I was diagnosed 16 years ago, and it's been pretty up and down, as it tends to be, but one consistent thing, has been the lack of ability to understand what it is from my friends and family.  I've had a tough time expressing it, and I found that often times I couldn't demonstrate with any existing piece of literature or art that I'm aware of, and so I didn't have much in the way of tools to be able to make them understand.  Then a couple of months ago, I had an idea and I started making a short film, in which I would use the visual metaphor of a map, to help them understand, and surprisingly, it seems to have helped.  
I've been writing, and making movies to try to express myself the entire time, but haven't ever connected it as well as I did with this experience.  I strongly suggest this as a possible tactic for anyone struggling with people who cannot grasp what they're going through (it worked because my family has been desperate to understand the whole time, I imagine someone who wants to ignore or act like it doesn't exist would be more difficult).",10Oct2018,1
128,"Hey internet strangers,

Welp, never thought I'd be here.... 
I've had some issues for a few years now. Most prominently voices in my head, etc...
That being said, for the most part I've been able to survive and live on with it. I've worked on keeping myself busy and having my mind occupied.

I was actually making some progress I think...

Recently my gf of over a year dumped for another guy out of nowhere and thus I have been flung deep into this terrifying bottomless pit of madness and despair. I am incapable of hanging out with people without getting super paranoid and have grown completely detached from friends and family. 
I've tried to kill myself in the last month and failed.
The voices in my head have grown more prominent and a lot louder and more frequent making it difficult to concentrate . 
I've grown depressed to the point that I am near completely unable to function. I constantly feel like I don't matter and an individual and do not belong anywhere nor am I wanted any where.
I tried a therapist who quit on me and literally told me that I couldn't be helped or she could not help me (This contributed to the attempted suicide I mentioned earlier) 
I'm trying to find a doctor more specialized but it is crazy how hard they are to book, find, and pay for....

I experience rampant suicidal thoughts constantly and my environment as begun to act strange.
The walls keep breathing. Sometimes it feels like I'm falling and I lose balance - I keep seeing darting movements that only reference to objects that haven't moved. I think I've actually lost it this time and I'm genuinely afraid.

Is there a way to actually cure this?
I can't function.
I can't form any social connections anymore.
I'm losing my mind and I'm beginning to have a hard time discerning what's real and what's in my head.
Will I ever be back to normal and return to an ordinary world?
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to go on like this...


Antipsychotics are a no - from what I've gathered on how they function - the side effects would far outweigh the temporary benefits - or potentially even worsen.
I need a permanent fix. Someone has to have come out of this in one piece. 

I'm so alone. I'm so alone.
Is anybody out there?
I don't know what to do.

129,"I have a problem where if I’m hurt by someone, I’ll say the absolute worst, and I mean ABSOLUTE WORSE, things to them. I usually never mean what I say, but will say whatever I can to get the worst reaction so they feel what I feel. 

Every time I’m overcome with anger, I will say something I regret, something that permanently damages my relationship with said person, then promise not to do anything like that next time. Well, next time it happens, I get upset, not care about wanting to change, then feel regret once the argument is over, realizing that what I was mad about was never that deep or serious. It’s almost like my brain can take a normal, every day problem with someone and multiply my reaction/anger by 1000.

I try so fucking hard to change, but I just can’t. I feel like something in my brain won’t allow me to have a normal reaction to problems. I always have to turn a problem into a worse problems by saying the worst things. When angry, I just want people to feel as hurt/angry as I am.

132,"Hey All,

I just want to gauge your thoughts on something that happened to me recently. Last month, I was really struggling with depression and anxiety due to overwork and unrealistic expectations from a former employer. It got to the tipping point where I needed to request off work to go to a counselor or hospital. When I initially called, my employer said no despite the fact that I said it was for a personal emergency, and I was considering going to hospital.

Later, my supervisors pulled me into their office and asked repeatedly, ""So, what exactly is going on?"" I felt pressured into telling them about the extent of my mental health issues. I felt ashamed and humiliated even though they let me go get the help I needed.

They even called me during my time recuperating away from work. I felt increasingly humiliated due to this treatment, and I later found out they violated HIPAA in asking me repeatedly why I needed personal time off. 

I since decided to resign from the toxic environment, but I'm now left wondering how to let go of this terrible situation. The hospital I went to also was incredibly disorganized, so I'm now a bit at a loss: I left a high-stakes but toxic job, I no longer have health insurance, and I am not getting as many offers as I'd hoped despite having a Master's degree and extensive experience in my field. I was wondering if anyone has some words of encouragement or just advice on how to deal with all of this. 

Keeping my head up but just wondering if these circumstances will change.",10Oct2018,1
133,"So I don't know what's going on but this has been happening since about April 2018. This has always happened before where I have lots of nostalgia but this year it is more extreme. I used to be on cipralex but I went off it since the beggining of the year, and seem to be doing fine overall. I have been trying to lose weight (lost 30+ pounds) and have been living an active and good diet life medication free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless since April I have very detailed nostaligia. As a University Student I used to sit in different empty classes and just sit on a empty chatroom in IRC on my computer. I used to hang around that chat room so long I noticed people like me in that chat room that also were there almost all the time. I stopped going to that chat room about 9 years ago, but I finally went back recently at the beggining of April as I missed those people (odd given that I never really even chated with them) just gave me a warm feeling they were there like me all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless many of those old usernames in that chatroom are gone, and I asked someone who was still there, and he said they never returned for 5+ years now. It makes me sad I will never see their names there again, I wonder where they are in the world, what they are doing, I wish I could search and restart a connection with them again. It makes me sad that they are gone to never return. I also sometimes return to my university and visit those rooms where I would spend hours as an undergrad surfing the computer all alone. SS109 is the room I visit again and again and again. I remember what I was doing there when, who I noticed in the hallway, how I was feeling, the orientation of my laptop. These minute details and the fact they are gone, I am older (30 years old now) and that I will never go back haunts me. Those people I met I will never meet again, those days are gone and forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an introvert, no girlfriend ever, and perhaps my biologic failings are making me relive my past which was suppossedly sweeter (though I'm not sure it really was). Another pecularily I have is I keep noting the passage of time from an small significant even and even insignificant event. For example say and Event happens at time t1. I will mentally keep note of how long it has been since that even and the passage of time from another even prior to t1. Say the past event prior to t1 is t0, and a today is t2, I mentally constantly calculate (t1-t0)/(t1-t1) ? Also I keep track of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, and even decades since an event.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone let me know if they have similar feelings and similar moments or even an idea why I am having these extremely detailed moments and why now?",10Oct2018,1

135,"Hi everyone, 

First off happy mental health awareness day! This is my first year with my mental health issues so I kind of wanted to share my journey. This time last year I was suicidal. I was in a job I hated, I had isolated myself from the world and I just didn't want to exist anymore. I felt like I wasn't existing and that I hadn't existed for a long long time. However earlier this year, after changing job, trying to make new friends, and pushing myself I was still unhappy. Unhappier than ever really. I had been hospitalised over a sudden illness, I had let the anxiety grow and as a result I hated literally everything. 

So standing on the platform in April, waiting on my train, I thought about jumping. I felt myself being like just end it, but instead I picked up my phone and phoned my GP and asked for help. 

It is now October and I am proud to say, I am happy. My boyfriend, family, friends cannot believe the difference. For the first time in a long time, years, I feel like me. I am happy to be me.

So if you are out there, and you feel like life is not worth living, please I am begging you, go see a mental health professional. I know it sounds clichéd but it honestly does get better. Trust me, I'm a random stranger on the internet why would I lie to you? Contact Samaritans, contact a gp, a friend, a relative, anyone. Anyone who will listen and help get you back to who you are and who you deserve to be. If there's one thing I learned from CBT it's if you wouldn't say it to someone else why are you saying it to yourself (or if youre a rupaul fan, if you can't love yourself how the hell is somebody else going too). 

Happy mental health awareness day, hope you feel good about yourself because you're the best you there is ✌️",10Oct2018,1

Me, inside, when there's something wrong with me, mostly related to feeling unloved/unwanted/no SO or anyone: WHY CAN'T YOU STOP RUBBING YOUR EFFIN RELATIONSHIP IN MY EFFIN FACE, JUST STOP

Friend who happens to have a boyfriend: hey, I tried X today. It's very nice.

138,"I was abused as a kid pretty badly for most of my childhood. I had suicidal thoughts from a very young age but once I got to high school and was no longer around the abuse, it subsided. I was relatively fine through high school and my first 2 years of college.

My junior year of college, I went through a really hard time. It was too much for me to deal with all at once and it brought back the suicidal thoughts with a vengeance. Although things got better and I’m a grad student now, the anxiety attacks and frequent suicidal thoughts never stopped. I still feel very strongly about all that happened back then, it’s like I never healed from any of it.

Before I was fine at work and school and I would only have issues with negative thoughts in my free time. Now it’s started to be an issue throughout the day.

I’ve recently started seeing a councilor through my university but it’s extremely difficult for me to be honest about exactly how bad it is. This is partly because I don’t want to start balling my eyes out in the middle of the appointment but I’m also so afraid that if I’m completely honest about it that I will end up being institutionalized and ruin my career and schooling.

I won’t reply to any comments but I want to know what I should do. I’m not afraid I’ll kill myself, but I’m so afraid that this could ruin my life. Is it to the point where I for sure need medication and/or to be institutionalized? Am I in denial in thinking that maybe if I keep up therapy and get more attention from loved ones (which I’m not getting nearly enough of right now) then maybe I can get through this without it?",10Oct2018,1

140,"Its a long post... sorry.

For context, I've been battling anxiety, depression, and trichotillomania since early childhood. I've been in counseling off and on my whole life. Ive tried all sorts of meds to no avail. I started a job last month that gives us 10 counseling sessions a year covered by them. I plan on using them, but this has been eating at me.

I've been feeling forgetful for months now. Nothing severe, but I do forget bits of what people say, parts of tasks, etc. I know its worse when ive been stressed. I just got married Sept. 23rd. We planned a whole wedding in 4mo. 95% of the planning was me. I also started a new job in September that took me nearly a year to start bc of the long application process. So yeah, September has been taxing. 

The day before our wedding, my now husband and I had a fight. The reason why is water under the bridge now, but during the fight he said ""wow you really are just that stupid arent you?"" It cut deep and even though I cried, I defended myself. Big step coming from a girl who grew up with a toxic family dynamic and 6yrs of abusive boyfriends before finding my husband. He felt awful and apologised. He admitted he was wrong and that it wasnt me, rather it was his stress with his family and the wedding. All very legit and i forgave him. 

This new job is very new to me. Something ive never done before and in a feild ive never been in before. Its been amazing in many ways, but i cant help but feel so slow. Like im not learning fast enough or being good enough. Ive been trying my hardest. I was and still am really hurt that my best friend and husband ever thought I was stupid. Even though i forgave him, it still plays in my head on repeat. I think bc of this, my brain is telling me that my co workers think im stupid too. Like im just some daft, idiotic, woman. Afterwards i realize that they give me no reason at all to think this. 

I just feel so weirdly self concious and like im trying so hard to put up this perfect wife and coworker front. Im always tired and feeling like im fighting my own brain. Im not sure how or if i should talk to my husband about it. The last thing i need is feeling bad for bringing up old shit that ive already forgiven and its from weeks ago. I just want ro let it go and move on. I know my situation is unique, but has anyone experienced something similar? ",10Oct2018,1

I don't think it's ""proper"" depression per se and most of those times I'm firmly in the ""water off a ducks back"" type of people and super chill. But I'm just super down in the dumps atm and I don't know, just wanted to see if anyone else has this passing, being down feeling at all?",10Oct2018,1
142,"This is a long post
I first started dealing with mental health issues my junior year of high school. I had just injured my back in sports and had to wear this bulky, embarrassing back brace everyday for 6 months. I couldn’t work out, so I was out of shape and also going through a horrible bout of acne. My depression/suicidal thoughts stemmed from this period of my life, but it continued off and on until I had it under control around December of my freshman year of college. 
However, as soon as I felt comfortable with my depression, I started having pretty consistent anxiety and occasional panic attacks throughout the rest of my first year of college and into the summer. I’m still currently dealing with it, but I felt like I’ve found the tools to help prevent and deal with my daily, personal anxieties. 

Now, once my more personal anxiousness has subsided, I’ve noticed a growing anxiety coming from social situations, whether is be strangers or friends or family. This is my second year of college. I have a solid group of friends that I really like a lot. I have a girlfriend I’ve been with for two years, and we live about 4 hours away while we are in college. Although I have friends and family I enjoy, I still feel likes it’s important that I should meet new people. The problem is the idea of talking to other people I don’t know seems absolutely draining and horrible. I’m afraid of telling people my interests and hobbies, but then I’m afraid that they will find me boring and dull if I don’t tell them interesting things. I have no urge to branch out and meet new people. I find I simply just don’t care about what others have to say, and I don’t think they’d care what I have to say either. I hate small talk, I just feel awkward and uncomfortable the whole time. I get worried I’m losing a lot of opportunities to meet interesting because I feel so closed off from the people around me. I feel normal and boring but at the same time weird and unapproachable. 
I also feel like I neglect the relations I have in my life. I want to care for others and see how they are doing, but I have no idea how. I don’t think connect with them enough on a surface level to talk to them about more personal things. I don’t want to be a oblivious friend who doesn’t help other out when they need it.
I have no confidence in my self at all. I always here people talk about how important it is to focus on the small victories in your day to day life. I’ve been playing the bass for about 2 years, and have reached a lot of goals I wanted to accomplish. I can play with other musicians well enough, and even recorded an album with some friends and released a song on Apple Music and Spotify. Despite reaching this accomplishment that I though I’d feel proud of, I can’t help but focus on all my insecurities. I feel like I’m not really that good of a musician and that I’m not making progress. I can’t make music on my own without others help, and I get really discouraged. I’m even self aware that I’m being too hard on my self, but it doesn’t shake the feelings I get that I’m never going to amount to anything because I’m unmotivated all the time. College doesn’t help, because I’m constantly surrounded by people who have big goals and aspirations, and everyone seems to be talented in whatever they pursue, while I have no idea what I want to do with my life and can’t help but feel insecure that I’m a failure.

I’ve tried therapy sessions but I always end up minimizing my problems and talking them down like they aren’t a big deal. I can never tell if I’m over reacting or really struggling , and I hoping I can find some help here. Thanks",10Oct2018,1

144,"I've been prescribed Adderall to treat ADHD for 3 years now and it's been a godsend to help me through school. I also have a sleep disorder (delayed sleep phase syndrome) which causes me to stay awake until 5am almost every night, only a couple hours before I have to be awake.

I've been misusing my Adderall by taking a dose in the morning and continuing into the next day instead of sleeping. Then the next night I'll be exhausted and able to sleep rather early without incident. I went an entire semester doing this, sleeping only every other night.

I also started abusing Adderall for the high for a few months. These months are the only periods I've ran out of my prescription before I should. I quit for 3 months and then started taking it as intended again, and I'm now trying to not misuse my medication. I'm on light therapy and sleep aids but still find myself pulling 1 or 2 all-nighters per week. I recently started seeing a psychologist and don't want to fall into the habit of lying to them, but I'm pretty nervous that he'd immediately consult my psychiatrist and I'd be taken off Adderall.

For the past few months I've been having some weird irrational thoughts right before I fall asleep that keeps me up later than I'd like. I usually have to throw down some melatonin and put earbuds with music or podcast in to somewhat drown it out. 

Basically, I worry that my teeth will collide with each other while I'm sleeping, breaking them or that I will get them stuck together. Every now and then I worry that I can ""feel"" my bones and that they're going to break. Again, it's always the teeth thing my brain comes back to. I would love for it to just end.

I won't do it and I know that pretty well, so don't worry, any of you. The thing is, I went to therapy for like a month but I stopped because I was so sad that I couldn't leave my house. I have never been diagnosed with anything, but I have been dealing with this since I was 12, and now I'm 19 and I think that I'm worse than ever, I feel like I'm too young to give up but I kinda have already. I have too many responsibilities and I can't do any of the things I have to do. I feel so alone, even though my mum knows all of this, I can't feel but feel that she deserves a normal daughter, she deserves the world. I constantly feel like a burden because my family are all so happy all the time. I can't ruin that.
