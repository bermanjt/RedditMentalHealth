0,"I have had a few instances in which I have gone to/contacted a doctor about some sort of issue and have not been treated or listened to the same as someone without anxiety/depression meds. 

Example: I had what I thought was an allergic reaction to an antibiotic, when I called the doctors office, instead of thinking it could actually be a reaction, I was asked (again) about my medications and told I was fine, it's just anxiety. It wasn't, I know anxiety and how my body responds (and my mind for that matter), but was not taken seriously. I ended up at urgent care and was told never to take that antibiotic again. This is just one of several instances with different doctors.

My question to you is if you have had a similar experience? I am trying to collect stories of those who have experienced this and bring an awareness.

If you are a medical professional, have you ever done this? What do you learn in school/training? I don't think this happens out of malice, which is why I think an awareness would help.",15Jan2018,2,
1,I always felt like I have something about me that can ward people away. I walk past someone doing charity in the street and people never approach me. Nobody wants to talk to me. How am I ever going to find more friends or have a relationship is people are uncomfortable around me. I blame my own body language. I don't want people to be afraid of me I want to be happy with other people. I don't mind people wanting polite conversation with me. I get anxious and I make other people anxious as well. Feels like I was supposed to be a introverted hermit but I want to be like other people. ,15Jan2018,1,
2,"I recently asked my current psychologist , ""Will I always have depression?"" He said, ""No, once you remove negative thoughts, people, and situations from your life, you will no longer have depression.""  Part of me hopes and wonders if this is true. I have suffered with depression for 8 years. At this point in time we have relocated to an area that is sunnier than where we were and I have stopped working. I am also taking my medications regularly and for the past year have had very few, short mood swings lasting no more than a day, no panic attacks, and no suicidal tendencies. With many health issues there would be talk of reducing or removing medications with such improvements.  No such talk has occurred with my depression.  If depression is mostly a situational thing as my psychologist suggests, then it should be with some work be simple to remove it from your life and no longer be in need of medication and such.  To be honest the above doesn't seem right. I feel there is something missing to this idea.
Part of why I feel this is because I have been considering going back to work. I don't collect SSI or any type of disability as I have been turned down multiple times and even disability lawyers won't take my case. I am not disabled enough, what ever that means. I am however disabled enough to get job counseling from vocational rehabilitation for free. I am not mad about this or feel that I am necessarily entitled to Social Security. I was just looking for help while I got my head on straight and figured out how to handle what was going on in my life.
Anyhow with working with my job councilor we have settled on a job goal, and I am steadily working towards said goal. However, when considering going back to work I don't feel depressed I feel scared, so scared that I am reduced to tears and near panic.  Is this a part of the depression even though I have not shown any real signs of it for the past year? Is this some form of mild, I don't know, PTSD due to chronic stress from when I was working? I am honestly afraid that my depression and panic attacks will come back if I start to work again. I've only really stopped working for a year, and even then I have been caring for my young son, volunteering, and doing small temp jobs just to get out of the house. For some reason the idea of working full time scares me, or even working a regular part time job.",15Jan2018,4,

7,"Hi. 
I (F,30) am normal looking girl by today's standarts, have very nice bf, normal family, I am pretty good (workaholic) CG artist and have a lot of ideas, but something is missing in my life.

I left my job 2 month ago and have a lot of free time to think about my life and personal stuff, but I found out that I just don't want to do anything at all. 0 ambitions, 0 motivation, 0 goal. I am becoming more introverted and existential crisis attacks. I realised all my life I was living as others wanted me to live. Now I can't make decisions, I contact with people normally, but hide all that toxic stuff inside me, I react at their stories as normal people do,  but its fake, I don't find much sense in anything at all. 

I like science , but its already late for me to try it. It feels like all this years I ve been living someone else's life and that makes me hate myself more. By blaming my surroundings and family, I am not sure that I love anyone anymore. It hurts so much that Sometimes want to end it asap. I feel lost and lonely.  I wish I could gift my life to someone who really deserves and would appreciate it.I am really trying to find anything to live for.

9,"Hey!

I’ve had long periods of ups and downs. A down started a couple of years ago when I was bullied by a couple of my ”friends” in class in middle school. I then started high school in a fantastic class and soon after that turned myself around. I was talking, joking and laughing, I was who I wanted to be - myself. Half a year after beginning high school I started cutting myself. Im not entirely sure why, but I think there was a mixture of reasons for it. A year later Im much better and have started to do all the things I want (except exercising, will start that when it gets warmer). Ive almost finished one of my half done projects, played the piano and my results in school got better, but Im still not myself. The funny talkative and energetic guy I am at home is nowhere to be found at school. It feels like Im back where I were in middle school. 

I just want to do what Im doing now while being like I was when I started high school. I mentioned this with my counselor but I dont think she quite got it. She said that were all different at home and in school/at work. 
But I just feel too different to what I find normal. At home Im the familys clown. I jump around, sing, drum with my fingers and Im almost never still or quiet. At school its the complete opposite.

How can I become like Im at home/were before in school and is this some kind of anxiety thing or something else? ",15Jan2018,3,
10,"I'll spare you the details of my mental health history and keep it simple and direct. I'm bipolar 1, I've had dozens of episodes in my life, many resulting in hospitalization. During my last two stays, I was experiencing psychosis. My mother told me today (rather put of the blue) that ""they"" (the doctors treating me) said I may not come out of it, and to look in to long term assisted living arrangements for me.
Due to the often strained dynamic between my mother and I, and just who she is as a person, I am skeptical of this. I feel like she just said this to spook me in to being med compliant, and that doesnt actually happen to people.

I have every intention of asking my psychiatrist about the validity of her comment at our next appointment. 
I realize this is a broad question, and should be looked at on a case by case bases, but I'm curious-

Tl;dr Can a person experience lifelong psychosis? Or in my case specifically from a manic episode?

11,"Awhile ago I was apprehended by police for suicidal thoughts and taken to hospital for observation. I didn’t have any criminal convictions or outstanding warrants on file but I had a Police record from 2008  for “assault” that was actually a matter of self-defence where I was never officially charged or convicted. I managed to overhear a psychiatric nurse talk to the psychiatrist about the incident in the most vague way possible. Something to the affect of “it looks like there was a violent incident in 2008 involving a weapon”, and that was that. Now, without knowing the details, it would be easy to get the wrong impression and wrongly assume I’m a violent/aggressive person. 
I’m actually extremely irritated that the policeman passed on non-conviction information to a psychiatrist and slandered my name like that. 

I also find it extremely alarming that people can say anything behind your back to a psychiatrist and there’s no way of being informed of the accusations against you while in their custody and therefore no way of contesting it. Not just criminal matters but behavioural accusations that may not be true either.        

Edit: Why the down vote? It’s a legitimate question and concern. ",15Jan2018,2,

18,"I understand that there are voluntary and involuntary reasons someone would be admitted.  I'm talking specifically about voluntary.

I have been under their care for a decade, and as far as treating what ails me, it's not perfect, but I am convinced that it's far better than any of my other options.

But, if I get to the point where, like any responsible adult with mental health issues, I feel I need to commit myself, what is that process?

19,"What a year 2o17 was. 

For me, it was a bad health year. I was constantly over tired, grumpy and annoyed at every single little thing. I was constantly in pain, every-time I turned to the left. It turns out that my pain could be caused by a trapped nerve in my spine somewhere, but the doctor's have only just refereed me to neurology. 

I grew constantly fed up of being in agony. I cried every night. Three years of unknown pain, caused me to go mad. Constantly going back and forwards to Doctors, who tried their best to help, but I don't think, even they, knew what was going on with my silly body. We initially thought it was my foot that was causing me pain, to cause me to waddle like a penguin, because that's where it felt like the pain was coming from. I'd been waiting for a foot scan but we never got it until late November 2017, when we were promised in January 2017. 


Daily walks with my dog Sonny was even becoming a bit of a chore. I skipped horse riding lessons, which I loved, and days at my day center, because I felt too embarrassed about waddling around like a penguin or having no voice, or having to say that I needed to look after my dog because no body else bothered to get out of bed. How was I supposed to say that to people? 

It didn't help that I was running around aimlessly after able people late at night (half eleven pm to be exact) then getting shouted at for not making them the sand-which or meal they had asked for, when I insisted that it was too late for them, because they were more interested in watching the tv. It was like that Episode of Steptoe and Son, Upstairs Downstairs. xD

Anyhow, in early March, I'd been suffering from a bad chest infection, I couldn't see very well and the pain in my left side grew worse, especially in colder weather. The pain spread down the left side of my body. It felt horrible, like no pain I'd ever felt before. It drove me quite mad.

During March, I completely lost it. I told people I was doing no more for them, because they'd practically laughed in my face when they said they hadn't got out of bed to feed Sonny, (our doggy) or taken him out, since I'd been out since 8am that day. 

As you could imagine I was furious. I hadn't come back home till half three pm. My poor Sonny was desperate to go out. After all, he wasn't just my dog, he's everyone's dog. I'd asked for help if someone would come with me, but even my sister said that I didn't need to take him.
 
I was fuming because no one had taken him out the few days before, and they were all perfectly capable of taking him out. I felt the pressure constantly. I then proceeded to get the blame for being annoyed that I wasn't taking him out, when in reality I was annoyed no one had taken him out, especially when he hadn't been out for a walk two previous days. I hate it when people just put him out the back field. Then they wonder why he put on weight?

I grew angry at people. I lost it completely. Then I got shouted at for being annoyed for caring about Sonny when no one seemed to be taking their shared responsibility. How is that fair? I was also very worried because Sonny was over weight, and I got blamed for not taking him out for walks, when it was actually people over feeding him. Feeding him things he shouldn't have like gammon, sweets. I caught them out one day because they gave me a sweet (JELLY BEAN) to give to Sonny, and even when I'd said no, they chirped in and said one will not harm him, but how many others had he been given behind my back? I couldn't risk being shouted at, so, Irresponsibly, I caved in a gave it to Sonny, much to his delight. (Not chocolate though, he didn't get that.) I was almost ready to throw the Jelly Bean at said person. 

Because I was struggling and recovering from a chest infection, I'd been told to rest before and after I'd been at my day center. Only too come in the door, afterwards, asked where I'd been, as if they didn't know, then asked to make a cuppa xD. Of course, I let it slide as I didn't mind, but only to learn that Sonny hadn't been out for a walk....again!

I instantly put his collar on and took him out for a good, long walk, which took almost two hours. Don't get me wrong, I love taking Sonny out, but I grew annoyed when he hadn't been out for walks the previous days, when I'd been told to rest so I could go to my day center the next day, as I'd missed quite a lot with being ill. 

As you can imagine I wasn't in a very good mood. I tried so hard to communicate with people that March, but I just got so frustrated and angry that I couldn't speak out loud because my anxiety was all over the place. Plus, worrying about Sonny didn't help. How many times had this happened before without my knowledge? I beg to differ. Several times I couldn't see very well, and tried my hardest to speak, but all I could do was furrow my brows, in deep frustration, shake my head or squint my eyes. I didn't know what to do. 

Several times I thought I'd need to take days off work (volunteer) because people couldn't be arsed to get out of bed. Scuse the language. 

I grew frustrated. I didn't know where to turn. Blinded by my own fury and pain, I struggled to communicate with people. My voice had gone completely. I panicked a lot. I felt trapped. 

I hated it. I hated people watching me struggle. It was a bit embarrassing, not being able to talk, or show how you feel without getting shouted at for stating your values. 

I eventually lost the plot and fell out with two family members who didn't take responsibility, because it was just getting too stressful. 

But then I just got the blame for not helping them, or shutting them out. Was I right to do this?  It had just happened way to many times and I lost it completely. 

Maybe I was over reacting, but I'd had several comments about Sonny's weight. I even heard onlookers say out loud, boy he's a bit over weight isn't he? I gave them an innocent look, but I don't think they were very impressed. Neither was I. 

It wasn't just about Sonny though. Some things got out of hand and I just lost it. If people had expected me to run around after them late at night, then wonder why they're poorly the next day because they'd eaten late. And for the other to just not be arsed to get out of bed, or moan of a headache when I knew they'd been out partying several nights before hand, then I'm sorry, but people need to take more responsibility. Am I over-reacting? I really don't know. 

Sometimes I feel I can't talk to people about my mental state, because I just get shut out or shouted at for being different, for stating my opinion when others should be helping out more.

It didn't make me feel at all good about myself. It come to the point where I would avoid going out. Avoid people. Try to recover my illness by delving into projects on my laptop, but never being able to finish them because my mind was set on my worries. 

At the beginning of Early December, I finally got refereed to Neurology, where Doctors thought that my pains could be refereed pain, coming from a nerve that could be trapped somewhere. It's now a waiting game. 

I'm slowly starting to relax a little more, now we have help and understand what's happening. My voice is coming back a little, but it's hard to talk to people from a distance. It comes and goes, but I believe it's to more to do with Anxiety. 

Through this last year, I've struggled to communicate with people and it has really bring me down. Almost to the point where I gave up. There's been several times where I haven't been able to see very well, because of the sun, and it panics me when I try to say hello and people have thought I was getting annoyed at them, but I just couldn't see or speak. How could I explain this to people? Back then I had no way of communicating, even when I tried to apologies by closing my eyes, they thought I was being awkward. Which probably was true.  There's several times I've no idea who the people are and wished I had my new mobile so I could've apologized to them. 

Sometimes people think I'm being rude, staring at them, not realizing I have little voice. But then I feel awkward because I haven't been able to say Hello. So all I can do is squint my eyes or shake my head, or look away. For this I apologies. 

I even had one person come up to me on a walk, asking if Sonny wasn't responding, only to realize that he wasn't responding because he couldn't hear me. He was kind and apologized. Made me feel guilty that he thought that way. I often get funny looks when I bend down, trying to catch Sonny's attention, especially when people don't know me. 

Light at the end of the tunnel: 

I now have a new mobile which allows me to say how I feel in a form of text. My voice still hasn't recovered but it's a lot better now since the chest infection I had in March 2017.

It's been a long 2017, but 2018 has been a helpful boost for me in a way.

I had my first horse riding lesson of 2018, which I loved. And had managed to go to my day center where I attend two times a week. 

I still can't stop worrying about Sonny, but I know it's not in my power to be responsible for him when i'm not there. People still don't take him out on days when I'm not there, but I try not to let it get to me so much, as it wasn't helping. 

2017 has been a bit of an eye opener. And has taught me to stay away from negative people, and not let negative people control your way of thinking. I still get bad days, but I try and control my anger. 

My motto for this year is: Never give up, you are stronger than you think, no matter how bad things become. I've beat DiGeorge Syndrome before, I can do it again. 

DiGeorge Syndrome is a ""rare"" condition, was is the most common disability out there but not many people know about it. Which is why it is considered as rare. 

I suppose the moral of this story is: Believe in yourself, don't let others actions annoy you. The right people will help you. Hold onto those people, and you'll shine a brilliant smile.  There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

30,"Tomorrow (or later today, technically) I go in to my GP to see a psychiatrist. As a teen, I only saw one a few times to ensure I was properly diagnosed and medicated (depression).

I'm now 22, and over the last year-ish I've developed some concerning new symptoms (auditory hallucinations, intrusive thoughts), so I'm going back to be referred to get help for it. My worry is that if I say that I hear a voice saying I should act violently I'll be committed, even though I've never felt any real urge to listen to it.

This is especially worrying after hearing the horror stories of people who were committed like that. Part of me knows it's unlikely to go so awry, but I can't stop worrying about what might happen if I say anything.

31,"Not really sure when all of this came about.   
Freshmen year and every year before that I had emotions. Freshmen year I was pretty anxious and shy. I think towards the end of the year is when my emotions started going away


not really feeling anything at all (no             sadness, worry, excitement,etc) ex: not       caring about my birthday or Christmas, no excitement about waking up early or opening up presents 

Brief moments of anxious feeling or butterflies(as in attraction)

No desire to run cross country or track

No desire to shower or brush teeth( I made a New Years resolution to brush my teeth twice a day and have stuck with it)

Naturally crying at moments someone would be expected to cry such as sad scenes in a movie, but not feeling any emotion behind it. Like my mind knows it’s supposed to be sad but just isn’t 

Caring about school and doing work because I know I should, not because I actually have any feelings about it

Laughing and feeling like I fit in but not sure if what I’m experiencing is actually happiness. I slip into a mood where I can laugh at jokes etc but if I consciously think about it it stops. Some conversations and days I can’t slip into and I find nothing funny",15Jan2018,2,

Things have gotten better now but my main issue is my new way of coping,   I’ll post on “trying to conceive” subreddits pretending that I’m trying to have a baby or ill post things on similar sites like “my symptoms for this month” it just brings me comfort to pretend I’m like these other woman who’re trying to start a family, when in reality I’m on birth control and avoiding pregnancy for my boyfriends sake.

36,"I went to my first therapy session ever this past weekend. The therapist asked general questions and basically gathered basic information on me, my past and current home life. I don't want to jump the gun too fast, but how do I know if this therapist is a good fit? 

She seemed to listen well, but I noticed she jumped to a few conclusions after I told her about my past and patterns of behavior. Also, at some points, she closed her eyes for a few seconds at a time while I was talking to her.  I'm not sure if she was still actively listening and trying to formulate a response or just tired? I suppose the experience didn't deter me too much. Once I sat down, everything I'd been holding onto just poured out. In the next session we will be trying CBT so I'm interested to see how that works. Just wondering if my experience is in line with others on here, and if I should give it another chance or try someone else? Thanks.",15Jan2018,1,

The nightmare: A huge spinning spiral wheel. My mom crying beside it. My dad screaming so loud while running towards the wheel. He phases through the wheel that acts like somewhat of a portal. Then it starts again. Something like a loop.


Not really good at describing especially since I'm panicking and hsaking right now. It was a recurring dream when I was a child. And no, I dont have family issues.

46,"Hi everyone. Sorry if I do not use correct terminology here, as I am very new to all this. I am in high school and in my country/culture mental health is rarely discussed, so I have been avoiding this for a while. But I am really not sure whether what I am experiencing is just stress due to the general high school academic stress/family pressure or something more. I feel like my problems are completely fake and superficial but I have been feeling 'down' for a while now, and I have done some bad things to myself to try and temporarily feel a bit more content. I was not in a good shape when I was a child either, but I think this really got worse last year when someone I was close to passed away, and I started having panic attacks. I suppose I've had some periods of time where I've felt really bad, but there have been times where I've felt a lot better. Also, I am always doing many activities and trying to aim for high grades, always smiling, trying to mask what I really feel. But I feel that in the community I am in, if I try to say what I feel, I will be labelled an attention seeker as it has happened in the past. 
I suppose what I am trying to say is, how do you guys know when to ask for help? And what sort of techniques do you use to cope, especially in periods of high stress? Do any of you identify with anything I've said above? Thanks. ",15Jan2018,3,

48,"I'm not a therapist or a patient, but I was married to someone for a few years here in VA, and never bothered checking his email/messages/files on our shared computers - until we started to get a divorce. I knew he was indulging in self-harm (cutting, mostly) and was pretty cruel to me sexually and otherwise, and then he coached my minor son into saying he wanted to kill his bio dad multiple times, threatened to report me to social services for neglect if I didn't have him treated, so my son was hospitalized twice. Then... I went into his user on one of our computers, which I realize now that I should have done long before: I found saved chat logs spanning years/decades of him coaching suicidal people (not sure if they're clients or not) into self harm including cutting, swallowing batteries, and more. This man is currently a therapist in a mental hospital in Virginia, dealing with inpatient treatment, primarily of adolescents and adults struggling with Suicidal Ideations and self harm. I'm not sure what to do, because being his ex it would look like I'm merely being vindictive, and I'm unsure if the people he's had these chats with are patients.

I still didn't feel any better and wanted to take another dosage, but thank god I only brought 2 pills because I would have taken more.

61,"Hi guys,

I come here feeling absolutely helpless and heartbroken. My wife has been experiencing what I am starting to think is clinical anxiety and depression and I truly do not know what to do. 

Here's some background info:

My wife and I have a very healthy marriage. We are each other's best friend, have an excellent system of trust and communication, and are happy with our marriage. We have a good home, are both employed, and the future looks good. Family relationships are great, we both exercise avidly and are in excellent physical health. Looking at our life, you'd never think anxiety or depression is possible. But I understand that's not how this works.

My wife started experiencing pretty severe anxiety about one year ago. She would near on the verge of panic attacks almost daily. I spent many nights consoling her for 6-8 hours until she fell asleep. The anxiety was about anything and everything - matters presumably insignificant (like a restaurant she wanted to go to being closed, resulting in a 'ruined day' and endless crying spell), and matters very significant (worrying about finances, feeling undervalued at her job, etc). 

About six weeks ago, things got really bad. The anxiety has seemed to transition into full-blown depression. My wife used to be an energetic morning lark who was often times a bit overwhelming in how loving and affectionate and excited she would get. 

Lately, she tells me she hates going to the gym (we are both in the fitness industry and have been doing this for years) as she is tired, anxious and just doesn't feel motivated. She sleeps in until last minute and dreads waking up. Hates going in to work (a job she used to love).

The last few weeks, the episodes have been daily: we might not be able to get the breed of dog she wants, I accidentally ate the last of the special bread we bought, her favorite coffee shop got her order wrong...point is, anything and everything sets her off into a downward spiral of fetal-positioned crying spells that last upwards of 8 hours. Every single day now, I pick her up from work, have to cancel our workout and take her home and console her until she falls asleep at night. The crying and listlessness is incessant.

As a husband, I love this woman more than anything. It brings me to tears even writing this. I need to add the disclaimer that I have:

- never shamed or faulted her for this
- never invalidated or questioned her reasons for being unhappy (including interrogation, and other harmful, abusive tactics)
- consistently remind her that I do not resent her, feel differently, am never leaving her
- I admit I keep the stress to myself. I don't want her to feel guilty. But I have been losing sleep, been performing poorly at work and at school (MBA student), and have watched my fitness goals go down the drain (competitive bodybuilder, so its kind of an important avocation to me). I will never lose patience with her or take it out on her...just not the kind of man I am. But I am personally exhausted more than I have ever been.

I'm at a loss. I am afraid. We are young (mid-twenties) and don't have tons of money sitting around and can't afford therapist-shopping. I am willing to pick up an extra job if needed so she can get help, but even then I don't know where to start. 

I'm thinking she might be experiencing onset adult depression or anxiety. But I'm no expert. I do know that she doesn't have a tangible 'reason' to be this upset (and she says this, too), meaning it is presumably biochemical.

I made a vow when I married this woman. I'm not giving up and will never ever leave her for this. It's neither her fault nor is abandonment an option. Ever. 

That said, I am exhausted, guys. So many sleepless nights, so much negativity. It's wearing me down. I'm losing weight, look like shit, and have zero energy. 90% of it goes toward damage control and trying to help her. I need to remain strong for her but often wonder if my consolation is sufficient at all, that maybe she needs to see a doctor. I am somewhat distrusting/wary of pharms/drugs but recognize that some people have chemical imbalances, period. Besides, I don't give a shit about my opinions when my wife has lost the quality of life she deserves.

One last bit of vital info - she is very healthy/fit, on no meds...except Implanon. I have considered that perhaps the Implanon might be the culprit. I just don't know. What do you even do in a situation like this (especially when money is tight)? Where do you begin?

If anyone read all of this, thank you. Truly. Again, I feel helpless watching the light of my life go through this. 

tl;dr 26 y/o wife is experiencing sudden severe depression and anxiety. Daily episodes that endure in excess of 8 hours. Finances are tight. What can I do beyond the usual emotional support and validation? How do I get her help?",15Jan2018,5,

63,"Background: Pure OCD, Anxiety, Depression etc. Not related to this post.

Long story short. Every time I have a cold, especially when related to the sinuses, I get into an almost euphoric state of mind. With almost exclusively positive memories, music sounds better, I get more creative and things smell better (everything smells the same but better). I feel like I become the normal me and it feels great.

Ideally I would like to stay in this state of mind but it goes away once the cold or sinus infection has passed. No one that I have talked to has heard of anyone with a similar ""condition"".

64,"I know the title is shitty but I simply cannot sum up how I feel in such a small amount of words. Let me give you an analogy, and this is just an example, but it describes how I feel.

Imagine somebody is pointing a gun to your head. Nobody else can see this person, but to you the threat is very real. You shove him away, he is unphased and continues pointing the gun to your head. Everywhere you go, work, shop, etc he follows you, with the gun firmly placed against your head. He never goes away. So now, you have to live your life, go to work, do shopping whilst repressing the fact that there is a man pointing a gun at your head 24 hours a day and you always have the feeling in the back of your head that, at any moment he could shoot you in the head and kill you.

I have various thoughts about everything that could go wrong, but it doesn't just give me a spike of anxiety, it lingers in my head and ruins any interest I could ever hope for. All I can think about is when I can stop doing said activity so the feeling will stop. My oven will explode, my car will break down in the middle of a highway, my video game will crash, etc etc etc. It has truly destroyed me and made me miserable. I am in the process of seeking help from mental health professionals so maybe this post wont matter in a while. Is there anyway I can cope in the meantime? Or prevent it from worsening if possible. Thank you.
