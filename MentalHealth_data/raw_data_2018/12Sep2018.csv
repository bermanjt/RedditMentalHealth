0,Just need to get this off my chest. So I live in New Zealand and we have one of the worst youth suicide rates im year 13 which is our last year of high school and we have just been told that a student in my year committed suicide last night this is the second one this year both in my year group. This is also from a school with only just over 1000 students and about 230 in my year. Thanks for taking the time to read this just needed to talk about it somewhere to someone.,12Sep2018,3
1,"Hi all. I've made a throwaway because I'm ashamed of actually posting my problems to my main account, but still need to vent. I've got a lot of shit going on at the moment and not sure what to do and frankly all I want to do is to lay down and die.

Though it all started this week, when at my job, which is in retail, which I'm sure plenty will agree is an absolute chore, though us millennials don't really have a choice in this matter do we? Anyway I digress, my job is in the busiest department in the store, I was in the more relaxed department but because someone quit, and the manager liked me, they transferred me over. For the most part, I can speak to customers about their needs and wants, but the manager(s) are all pushing me to engage in conversation, literal conversation with every single person who walks into the department. Even if its busy and I'm working alone (which I often am as several people quit and now I'm known as ""Han Solo""), they expect me to have several conversations at once and its just tiring because I just want to help the customers, get what they want and move on. I mentioned when I was hired that I struggle with mental health issues and they seemed okay with that, but this week when I was feeling down, I was brought to the managers' office and given a verbal warning to ""be more cheerful"", and when I explained my fragile state to them as I pointed out before their response was ""well fake it"". 

For what its worth, it is a sporting equipment (although mostly clothing store) and when I expressed my distaste for the latest Nike ad campaign (because I find it disgusting to market activism for profit), I definitely rubbed some feathers the wrong way (and I'm not even American).

I don't know what to do. I was unemployed for a better part of a year and just happened to land this job, but now am absolutely sick of it and the people, and know I'm not cut out for it. But if I quit I have nothing to fall back on and my ultimate fear of becoming homeless may be realised.",12Sep2018,3
2,"I've looked online about not feeling comfortable in your body and what I find isn't entirely the same as what it's like for me.

Let me start with some background. I wasn't like this 2 years ago. I started using lsd and I did have some bad trips. The last time I took it I didn't actually trip, I took half a tab and went to sleep. When I woke up, I felt changed, permanently. It's as if I'm more aware of my body and surroundings, like I can feel what I see as if there's friction between myself and things that I'm not even touching.

It's been about 2 years since that time I woke up, and that symptom hasn't gotten better, if anything worse. I twitch and move to counter the feeling of friction, I find it quite disturbing. It feels really bad sometimes, and it makes my thinking quite negative at times regarding my mental health. 

I was clean from drugs (excluding only alcohol, which helps the feeling) for a long time because of this, but there was no improvement. I now take cocaine again, which worsens the symptom, but it also makes me feel good so I continue usage.

I really do have a lot of hope still and I do my best to think positively, but it's getting hard and I do want to see if anyone else is like this or knows any way to help it. I've rarely been one to reach out, but now I am. 

I've had a session with a psychotherapist once recently but I didn't like it. I didn't speak about this, I spoke to him about other stuff but I felt anxious and paranoid with him. Perhaps it would be different with another person, I don't know.

Thank you if you've read this far, and despite including a lot about drugs, I feel like this would be the best place to find the advice I'm looking for.",12Sep2018,4
3,It may not sound like a big deal. But I’ve spent years thinking I can get through it on my own and today I realised I just can’t. I took a big step and put myself forward for counselling. It’s not going to be easy because I find it hard to open up. But I’m determined to get better. ,12Sep2018,27
4,"Hi. I have an extreme case of GAD and I also have major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I’ve been using earbuds and music since I was really little to escape from my own mind. I wear them in any crowded place in any form of transportation, especially the car, when I’m reading and studying and texting and everything. I feel like I need music or I can’t live. I nearly broke down when my earbuds broke in the cafeteria today. My parents are angry that I push away the world and them with music but I’ve tried tried many many other coping methods this is the only one that makes everything go away. Does anyone else have this?",12Sep2018,9
5,"I have an overwhelming sense of being excluded. In the past I pretended I was interested in sports, to fit in. Eventually I stopped doing that and actually started investing time in things that make me happy. This is good, but a side effect of this is having no friends or meaningful relationships with others my age. All my life I was never popular, but I’ve never felt this disconnected. I often speak to my parents about things, but I can tell they get annoyed, and when this happens, I go into a state of depression. However for me suicide is out of the question, I still see myself having a future, eventually having friends with similar interests. I don’t know if I can endure at least 4 more years of this though. I’ve bounced around with online friends, but I can never find someone I really connect with. Even when I can’t see or hear people, I can feel them disliking me. I feel as if nobody loves me, nobody cares about me, and sometimes feel that nobody ever will. I’m not asking for answers, just venting since I couldn’t think of anywhere else to do so.",12Sep2018,0
6,"I've been on the road for about a year now. Fancy term for ""homeless but I shave so I don't look like a bum."" I've been piecing together work where I can, but I just lost my third job in three months. I left home because I needed to get away from there... I was depressed, suicidal, starting to get into some hardcore drugs. I'll be honest, mentally I feel a lot better now, but I'm starting to relapse. I've been sober for a few months, found out I actually like that better. No risk there. But I'm living out of a tent and running out of money. I can feel all the old stuff creeping back. I won't go back to my home city, I refuse. If I do it will destroy me. I will fall back into everything I got away from. I won't do that again. But, I have no friends who can help. No family worth a damn either. My mum's a saint, but she's back home and I can't ask her for money. It's not right and she doesn't have it to give
I'm 19. I'm out of options. I'm out of plans. I've got one last shot but odds are it'll fall through. I don't know what to do next. I'll probably end up moving to the next small town and trying to find work. Again. Every time I get my feet under me I feel the rug getting pulled out. I just want a normal life. Hell, I kinda want to go to college. I'm tired of constantly wondering if this or that will fall through, if I'll have enough to eat today and tomorrow, where I'll sleep and not get kicked out.
I've been on the edge of snapping 24/7 for a while. But I can't snap. I always have to find a way to bend more. I'm out of mental energy, but I have no other way of staying afloat. It's all real zen until you remember it's real. I just don't know what to do. I know I'll figure something out, I always do. I'm not dead yet. But I'm tired. I'm tired of being tired. Everytime I get something I can latch onto whoops! There it goes and I'm back to square one. I'm on the verge of tears but I can't make anything come. 
I feel like I did this to myself. I told everyone ""Don't worry! It's an adventure!"" That's what I tell folks when I get lifts or jobs. Somehow it's more comforting than ""yeah, I'm a homeless kid trying to patch his brain together."" I'm running real thin. I just don't know what to do anymore. Even this feels dishonest, because theres a bit of me going ""dude, you've been in worse. Quit bitching to strangers and pull yourself together.""
I just feel out of the mental energy to do even the most basic things. Somewhere rattling around in my brain is a bit that remembers there are homeless shelters or something but I don't even know where to start with that. And there's yet another part of me saying ""that's not for you. You chose this life. You chose to leave. This is just life, so fucking suck it up.""
I just don't know",12Sep2018,3
7,"My 33 year old brother has had a terrible couple of years. He's an alcoholic, but I think it's more than that. He tells me that when he's sober (like weeks or months sober, not just during withdrawal) his mind races, he can't sleep, he can't ever settle down and relax. And even when he's sober, for the last several years, it feels like he's suffering from delusions, or something. Like, according to him, someone is constantly ""trying to stab"" or has stabbed him. I can't tell you how many times in the past 2-3 years he's told me stories about random strangers either trying to or actually stabbing him (I've never seen any physical evidence of any of the stabbings.) And the mob is out to get him. As are the police. I mean, we live in a decent sized city, so I suppose stabbings and gangland activity do happen, bht until recently he lived in a nice, safe neighborhood in the 'burbs, so how is he encountering all of these stabbers and gangsters? Just stuff like that.

I love my brother dearly, and this whole thing makes me so sad. Until a couple of years ago, he had a wife, and a daughter, a job, owned his own home. And then a couple of years ago, things just went off the rails. As of yesterday, his wife had left him, he can only see his daughter for supervised visits, and he was selling his car to live one more week in a terrible motel in a terrible part of town. If he told me yesterday that some random person tried to stab him, I would probably believe him. 

And then this morning at about 3 am, he got admitted to the ER because one of his last remaining friends called 911 after talking to him in the middle of the night and hearing a credible suicide threat. (I think it was just a threat, he won't tell us exactly what happened or allow the hospital to talk to us about it.)

At 7 pm today he was placed on a 72 hour hold ""pending placement"" which the person I spoke to said that they are using that 72 hours to find him placement somewhere and then he will be there ""for quite a while."" 

I want him to get the help he needs, and he does desperately need help. But tonight, I'm gutted at how everything went so far astray.

I don't know if I'm asking a question or for advice. I guess I mostly wanted to tell someone and get this off my chest. My heart is so heavy tonight and has been for so many nights before.",12Sep2018,2
8,"So, a bit of rant and a bit of asking for advice

These last few months have been hard. For reference, I'm a 15 year old living in New York, with 3 siblings (10, 11, 18) My family has been going a few short Vacations lately, which have been mostly good, but my last one which I just went to was by far the worst vacation ever. 

It was 7 families from my younger brothers school district. All of them 11-12. I hate kids like the ones that went. Begging for fortnite vbucks, insulting literally everyone there, talking back to everyone, just makes be hate those kids. 

But that was something I could over, which I did. The problem came with my parents and youngest brother. 

My parents constantly berate me. ""go do this"" ""you did it wrong"" as the weakest example. My family goes to a restaurant. I don't like anything there, so I get pasta. Pretty normal. I eat it fast. I was hungry. My 11 year brother says, ""I guess you were hungry?"" But before I can even answer, my 10 year old brother says ""or you're just fat"" yea thanks, that's going to help my current state. 

Before that, my parents have been hypocritical and biased, using the excuse ""you're always bad"" which, how? I sit at my computer, not doing drugs and drinking. Would you rather me do that? 

My mother yells at me repeatedly for stupid shit. Oh, my paper was graded, and handed back? I have it give to my teacher again to make sure. My father is fine. He takes me out to dinner. We go out alone. He's an amazing father, and he's not an issue

Later on, after the restaurant incident, we're pumpkin picking. We go early because no one is there. As expected, nearly empty. We're talking, and I'm fine. My parents have always told me to tell them if my brothers are assholes and not to deal with it myself. So what do I do? I tell them. But what's my response? ""Deal with it"" cool. Thanks.

That's it for now, I may follow up with a second post if I feel like it

9,"Hello everyone. My mother and I have always struggled with depression and anxiety and we have both recieved treatment including medication and therapy. While i've gotten better I can't help but feel like my mother has been using suicide as a crutch. 2 years ago she attempted suicide but luckily I was nearby to stop it. Since then she has been in and out of therapy and inpatient and has gotten the help and now is on disability. Ever since however she will threaten suicide over the most mundane things, (where as before she didn't ever threaten it). For example, we could he having a civil disagreement but if we don't agree with her she goes right back to suicide. She has threatened it so many time that there isnt any edge to the words anymore. I feel like she is using it for attention and to get her way. Its really causing a lot of stress and I'm not sure how to handle it. Any advice would be appreciated. ",12Sep2018,2

11,"I have had OCD for awhile now, officially diagnosed a year ago but have struggled with it for a long time. Typically my themes revolve around my relationship, contamination, counting things because I fear people are going to die if I don't do it right, etc. So, now I have this golden retriever puppy who I love more than life itself. Seriously, she's my entire world. I never thought I could love a dog this much, it's insane.

Anyways, a couple of months ago I had this intrusive thought that I wanted to hurt her. That I wanted to choke her. That I wanted to harm her. And it bothered me so so so badly. So, in order to I guess... prove to myself I didn't want to hurt her and I wouldn't get enjoyment out of it, I put my hands around her neck and squeezed. I literally couldn't stop crying after. I never want to cause my baby harm, I couldn't even believe I did it. I felt like a total animal abuser. I keep having to ""check"" if I was enjoying it or I wanted to do it. It was so horrible. I can't believe I was capable of such a thing.

Eventually, it went away and I never had the thought again. Until this week. I'm withdrawing from Lexapro because I've recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2 and SSRI's can make it much much worse. Which is what had been happening to me, unfortunately. So, this week, I randomly had the thought again and tested it. I can't believe I'm back to this thinking. I feel like a shit dog mom and like I need to find her a good family that doesn't have someone as evil as me in it. I love her more than anything and I want her to have the best life possible. I want to say it's OCD but people with OCD DO NOT act on their thoughts. And I acted on my thoughts. So, I really must be an animal abuser. And I literally want to kill myself over it and I've been thinking about it for days. I just don't know how to do it and don't know if I have the strength to do it. I'm scared but I am a terrible person and I don't deserve to live. I can't blame OCD for this one, because I acted on it- and like I said, people with OCD do not act on it. I'm this close to ending my life because I feel so terrible.",12Sep2018,4
12,"I don't really know what else to say, I already have depression anxiety and fucking PTSD and my nutritionist diagnosed me with anorexia and i just feel like a fucking mess right now, like at this point it just feels ridiculous that I have so many issues, and no I wasn't misdiagnosed, the only one im questioning is the anorexia diagnosis. I just feel weird, and confused. ",12Sep2018,10
13,"It’s been about 11 years since I had an anxiety attack, and I had one two and a half weeks ago. It lasted for two days, which is longer than I’d ever had. 

My symptoms were irrational fear, tightness in my neck and chest, feeling trapped etc. I rationally knew it wasn’t “real” fear, but a real physical reaction. That tightness in my throat and clenching of my jaw lasted for two days. 

I spoke with my doctor and he referred me to psychiatric care.  I can’t see anyone for months.  It seemed as if our large medical group has a policy against family doctors prescribing anything like Xanax, for example. 

I’ve had anxiety attacks before and from counseling from years ago I have some coping skills, but I don’t have any meds this time to help. Those coping skills aren’t working alone. 

I’ve had more attacks yesterday and today and I’m exhausted. I’ve missed work for half a day yesterday and today. My boss has panic attacks and is extremely sympathetic.  My family is supportive. I’m aware of what’s going on, and I’m not irrational about it. I have so much going for me in this situation that I didn’t have years ago. 

Since I’m not established with a psychiatrist I think I’m screwed. Are there any resources for people with sudden onset anxiety?  I can’t see anyone until November or December. I won’t make it that long. The fatigue is tremendous. I’ve been trying to arrange psychiatric help and counseling for a couple of weeks, but they don’t seem to be able to amp things up. It’s getting worse and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve done everything right to get help and nothing is happening. 

For the record, other than being way too busy, life is OK. This whole thing makes very little sense.  My anxiety from before was from a job related issue which has long since been resolved. 

It’s like I’m having an out-of-body experience; I don’t understand what’s triggering the anxiety. 

Anyhow, I’d been hydrating well, trying to exercise, and controlling my breathing (coping skills from before). But it’s not enough. Any advice (even tough advice) is appreciated. I’ll try anything. ",12Sep2018,3
14,"My whole life I’ve been stuck in my head. I’ve been an overthinker. I didn’t grow up in the best house and my parents were split before I was even born. I’m an only child. My grandparents have been my rock, “raising” me my entire life. I say that with quotes because I didn’t actually live with them, but they did everything for me. My grandpa is 90 and my grandmother 87. My mom had a drug addiction to cocaine her entire life. She was clean majority of my childhood. She even married my step dad when I was 3, who had his own kids, both older than me. When I went into high school though my mom relapsed. She had been a heavy alcoholic before that, her and my step father. Always screaming and getting physical. That was something I eventually got use to, Me and my brother. My step siblings were from South Carolina but my brother ending up moving with us, my sister didn’t. We went through a lot of the same stuff but he didn’t deal with it to the extent i did. My step dad moved out when I was a junior in high school, when my moms cocaine addiction was the worst. There would be days and nights I wouldn’t see my mother. She would be gone for 4 days straight sometimes, not even a phone call. I would eventually call her to ask wheee she was And she would say she’s coming home soon. I’d wake up at 4 am and she still isn’t. I eventually got use to it. She would steal my money and jewelry to fund her addiction. She even called in my prescription one time, had it filled and then sold it to get money. I was out of my ADhd medicine for an entire month because my grandparents insisted I didn’t press charges. That same year my mom went to rehab for her 5th time. She went for a month and came back. I still to this day don’t know if she’s done coke again, she was very sneaky. But the drinking sure did not stop. She was always an inconsistent role model in my life, someone I strived to be the complete opposite of. I somehow still did decent in school, even played volleyball all four years, was captain. I partied a lot though and got heavily into smoking weed, something still to this day I can’t break.. not that I’m trying. My dad was present in my life as much as he needed to be. He never supported me emotionally in any way. Just the basic financial support. I would see him weekends, but only til it was my choice, about 12 years old. I would still see him so often, but I wanted to spend weekends with my friends. He never knew the entire story of my mom while I was in high school and neither did my grandparents because how the hell can someone let their child live in those conditions when they have all the power to stop it? When my mom was out binging all night I would sleep with a knife by my bed because I was always home alone. The plus side? I could stay out as late as I freaking wanted. I came home at 4:30 am on a school night one time and you know what my mom said to me when I walked through the door? “Hey” ... I literally couldn’t believe it. It did not phase her in the slightest that I was coming home that late. I always threatened to move out of my moms but for some reason I felt bad for leaving her? When I would tell her I was gonna move out, she would start acting like a real parent. The house would actually get cleaned for the first time in months, she actually bought food to eat (something she rarely did) and she would do everything in her power to make me change my mind, but only for a couple days to a week. This cycle repeated for awhile. Fast forward to me finally accepting my fate.. I graduated high school with okay grades. Enough to get me into a state college. That year was the year I officially decided I couldn’t live with my mother anymore. I finally ripped the bandaid off and moved out when she wasn’t home, so I didn’t have to deal with the all of the sudden “good and caring mom.” When I finally moved out, I never resented someone more in my entire life. I despised my mom, hated her with every fucking being of myself. I couldn’t believe what she had put me through when I needed her the most. I ended up moving with my dad for a little, but we have absolutely no chemistry so that didn’t last long at all. So I moved into my grandparents. This was my sophomore year of college. The best decision I had ever made. I literally love these people with my entire heart. I can’t imagine I would even be alive today without them, I really wouldn’t. My mom had put them through even more hell than she had ever put me through, so I really felt connected with them. Me and my mom took a very long time to get better. I probably would talk to her once every 6 months and shit talk her ever chance I got. Even when I moved out she still managed to ruin my life. She financially drained my grandparents, but they were enablers. Even at 56 years old my mom has her house, car and everything else paid for by my grandparents, while they are also supporting me because my mother never could. My mom has been jobless for almost 3 years now and I guarantee you she will never have another. It makes me so mad because these amazing people don’t deserve it. My mom is a full blown narcissist, so it doesn’t even phase her, nor does she even realize it. I’ve learn to accept these things about my mother and try to salvage any relationship we could possibly have. When she divorced my step dad finally about a year ago she received half his pension and has been living off that, as well as giving my grandparents money for her things. So she’s gain a little respect from me. I try to help my grandparents every way I can financially but I am fresh out of college with an okay job. I can’t afford to move out nor can I, they need me more than ever now. Tonight my grandpa could barely walk to his room. I went outside and completely broke down. I’m starting to realize I’m losing the people that mean the absolute most to me. And then what? What do I have when they’re gone? A mom I still resent to this day and a dad who I barely talk to? They have been there for me through absolutely everything and it’s so easy to forget how old they are because I see them as parents. It’s heartbreaking. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to feel. I feel like I should be out experiencing life but I will never leave their side because they never did for me. I owe them that. I’m just so lost in my life right now. Like I know what I want for my future but I don’t know how to deal with what’s going on right now. I have friends but I’m realizing they aren’t the friends I need / want, minus a couple. Which is expected at this age but it sucks when you really need someone. I lost my health insurance a few months ago or else I would be seeing a therapist. But since I can’t do that , I am turning to reddit. If anyone can offer any advice or thoughts or even support it’s greatly appreciated. I’m feeling super down and I don’t have anyone who could understand.

I\&amp;#39;ve had depression and anxiety since I was 12 but it wasnt a major concern. It gradually got worse until 18 when I started getting bad suicidal idealization episodes and mood swings. High doses of antidepressants numbed me out and the extreme thoughts. Well at 20 I cold turkeyed one of my meds and ever since ssris have caused suicidal thoughts and homicidal thoughts, then it got to the point where I was getting minor delusions and hypomanic episodes because of ssris. I went to the hospital and they said I had bipolar type 2. The meds were horrible so I stopped em. Well my mental has gotten scarily bad. My mood swings are bad and I dissociate when I get angry or feel rejected. I feel this extreme painful empty void in my soul when I have an episode. I can barley talk or think days after. I feel this bad despair emotionally and mentally. Now Im emotionally numb and im just scared, now doctors are saying its just depression. Nobody\&amp;#39;s taking me seriously.

24,"Hey there, new to the forum! Hope this is the right place to be posting this type of inquiry.

I've recently started getting back into ""brain training"", or exercising, through Luminosity. I've used it off and on over the past...let's say, 3 years? But I rarely exceed a week's worth of use before dropping it for 2 weeks to 7 months... There's no inbetween.

I never really notice anything changing in terms of my memory, vocabulary, even my concentration, really the only change is a minor shift in my time management, in that I always do it before bed or when I wake up. I know it's hard to see a change in a week's worth of use (if any change at all), but I can't get myself to stay interested in it for very long unfortunately. 

Nowadays I find it too full of ads (can't blame them, gotta make a living!), But it is very distracting, so I'm wondering if anyone has any good apps they use on the regular (to semi-regular) where they've noticed a difference in some aspect of their lives. For myself I'm targeting memory loss prevention. 

Hopefully someone has some suggestions, everything is appreciated and respected. ~

25,"Really would like to try to understand what just happened. We are laying in bed right now and I’m very anxious. The vibe is really weird. I can tell something is bothering him or is on his mind in some way. He was spooning me and I could tell he didn’t feel very relaxed at all. So I just am laying there too, in silence. I start hearing him whispering very softly under his breath. At first it’s kind of inaudible but I start to make it out. He’s whispering stuff like “fuck you motherfucker” and “answer your fucking phone”, lots of variations of “fuck you” and “shut up”. Keep in mind he was saying it right under his breath, I barely was able to pick it up even with my ears, but I did. 

I finally roll over to stop it. But I do it gently and onto his chest. He is quiet and I can tell we both feel anxious. I say are you okay? And he said I’m fine. I said okay. Just making sure. He said why? I said just asking. Didn’t mean to make you upset. Because he answered me in a kind of rude voice.  He hasn’t said anything. I told him I love you.

Not sure what I experienced/am experiencing. He has diagnosed PTSD and OCD if that can kind of help. Can’t find anything online about the whispering, can somebody provide some insight?

He is the type I need to just leave alone if he is going through something, so that is why I am consulting here instead of talking to him.",12Sep2018,1
26,"Well I know I need to seek professional help, so keep that in mind. I know this is long but please read if you want. I had to make a reddit to ask around here( if there’s any other subs lmk).

 But here’s the thing... I go through these constant ups an downs, it’s like a rollercoaster in my mind. I don’t even really know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m the most confident and other times I want to die so bad. I feed off the energy of other people, and it happens so quick. It’s like they determine my mood. I can go from the happiest to saddest within minutes if something is said about me that makes me feel inadequate. Same with sad to happy. I can be complaining about why I feel bad to my best friend then within minutes be ok. And it’s kinda like I forget what I was feeling afterwards though. It’s hard for me to be alone at night most days so I downloaded tinder to help with the need for attention. One night I didn’t want this guy to take me back home( so dark, lonely there) so I gave him a blow job to stall time. 

I know I’m not depressed because I’ve been there, but I’m pretty certain I’ve had anxiety since a child but it has become manageable. I’m writing this to try to figure myself out and I know you aren’t professionals but to see your point of view. Also, I have put off going to therapy for awhile because when I’m in a good mood I forget the bad for a second and I feel I might leave out so much in a therapy session they will think there’s nothing wrong with me. So I’m kind of conflicted. What to do? Do I even need to go to therapy? Maybe what I’m feeling is normal, Its just not expressed by others..Any advice would be kind.",12Sep2018,2

30,"Hi.. So I'm 19 years old, I've been suffering with clinical depression and many terrible symptoms due to my anxiety disorder as well. I also suffer with ADHD which I take medication for. I've experienced a lot of trauma throughout my life in which are the cause of these symptoms. The most devastating being the death of both my parents. About a year ago I moved from Florida to attend college in Tennessee and now live with my boyfriend's family. It's been very lonely up here and I'm quite homesick. I worry about alot of things due to the fact that my oldest sister suffers with a brain aneurysm, seizures, and delusional and disorientating panic attacks, my uncle as recently been diagnosed with cancer, and because many things are happening while I'm away from my family.. 

After my parents passed away in 2014, I rescued my first Emotional Support Cat as a kitten, her name was Kira. And she became my entire world. She helped me cope with the death of my parents and my dysfunctional family. She also helped me cope with my suicidal and selfharming urges. She changed me in ways I never thought a pet would. So her existence in my life meant a lot to me. Before I left to Tennessee, which has now become one year, she was attacked and killed by one of my dogs when I wasn't home.. And my life was never the same after that. I thought I could heal and move on but being away from everything made things feel alot worse. And due to the stigma of mental health I was too scared to talk to anyone about how I felt because I didn't want them to think it as crazy..

I've experienced hallucinations, voices, delusions although I'm self aware which scares me very much. And my anxiety is just terrible. And it's so hard to control my emotions. So I decided to talk to my oldest sister, in which I see as my mother figure now. Though I didnt want to stress her out due to her medical issues, she was the only one I felt would understand.. And she cheered me up and understood and suggested I'd talk to my psychologist. After speaking to my psychologist she understood that I was experiencing many unhealthy symptoms and suggested that to improve my mental health that I should get an Emotional Support Animal and wrote me up a letter.

So after doing some research on ESA's I felt it was a great source of therapy for me, seeing as my last cat made such a huge improvement in my mental health. Sadly my boyfriend is allergic and I had to look for a hypoallergenic breed and due to his not so understanding parents the only breed I could have a chance getting is a Sphynx since they have no hair, and which are very expensive.. I tried so hard to find rescues that had any cat of the breed or any place I could find them cheaper. But it was impossible.. So my sister suggested me to create a GoFundMe, and so I did. I started to advertise it and started to get people messaging me being suspicious thinking I was lying about my back story and asking me many questions in which I answered. And then I had people who started to harrass me telling me I was just trying to scam others and that ESA's are just pets. And this really started to hurt me..

They started to make me feel like I was a villian even though I felt I was trying to help myself.. Even one of the only friends I made here yelled at me over the phone saying my campaign was dumb and that I was scamming people and that I was being stupid and such and it hurt me alot.. It was to the point in which I had an anxiety attack and cried. Why do i feel that what I'm doing is wrong.. and why cant people be more understanding.. even though I'm being honest and telling the truth in my campaign people just seem to bully me even more about it. 

I do support all the friends, my boyfriend, and my family who support me I guess i just feel as if I'm being attacked for the worst reasons..

I'm very sorry for the long rant.. this has just made my mental state alot worse and i feel people dont care about how i feel. And at the same time, I feel like giving up on my campaign.. please help..",12Sep2018,3

The other cook often works along side me but has so far called in every weekend since being hired which has been the last couple months, which is around the same time I was hired. Often I am left with his hours on top of my own. I originally applied for a part time job and to receive no more than thirty hours so I would have time to focus on getting into therapy and college. Often at this job I'm stuck in front of the stove by myself for 8 hours on end making a constant flow of orders and often making mistakes because of the stress and just the volume of orders I have to remember. I haven't been able to eat or sleep regularly because my hours are all over the place. My boss expected me to work until 12 am tonight then go to work at 9 Am tomorrow.

A Depressão e um transtorno mental que afeta as pessoas de forma negativa. Praticamente ela afeta vários aspectos importantes e fundamentais do seu dia-a-dia. Por exemplo: Nas relações familiares, com os amigos, no emprego, na vida escolar e na saúde em geral como sono, e o apetite.

Para ser diagnosticado com depressão de acordo com Manual Diagnostico Estatistico de Transtornos Mentais — (DSM V) – 5 sintomas tem que estar presentes todos os dias durante duas semanas. Sintomas como baixa auto estima, perde interesse em atividades que antes eram normais, tudo parece vazio e sem sentido ou sem importância, a capacidade de sentir prazer e alegria na vida praticamente acaba. O mundo e visto em “preto e branco” não a cores e alegrias, a gente sente uma dor no “coração” na “alma” sem uma causa definida.

A depressão atinge 5.8% da população Brazileira. O Brazil e considerado o país mais deprimido da America Latina. Segundo a Assoçião Brazileira de Psicanalise 9,5% das mulheres e 5,8% dos homens sofrem de depressão. Entre 2% a 7% dos adultos com depressão cometem suicídio.

A depressão também atinge crianças e adolescentes: Mais de 21% dos jovens tem sintomas de depressão e 5% declaram que já tentaram o suicídio. Em crianças e adolescentes a depressão se manifesta através da perda do humor e eles ficam irritados “rabugentos”, ao invés de triste.

Ninguem sabe ao certo oque causa a depressão. Em muitos casos não tem uma causa identificável. Muitos acreditam que vem de uma combinação genética e de fatores do meio ambiente assim como dificuldades psicológica, alimentação, stress – estilo de vida, rejeições, problemas na escola, significativas mudanças na vida do individuo, problemas familiares, determinados medicamentos – problemas de saúde e consumo de drogas e bebidas. E vários outros fatores estão relacionados com o surgimento ou agravamento do estado depressivo.

Os neurotransmissores (principalmente serotonina, acetilcolina, dopamina, adrenalina e noradrenalina) estão ligados a depressão.

Por esse motivo, os antidepressivos (que agem nos neurotransmisores) podem ser prescritos para ajudar a modificar a química do cérebro. Estes medicamentos não são sedativos, ou tranquilizantes. Eles não são formadores de hábito. Geralmente, os medicamentos antidepressivos não têm efeito estimulante em pessoas que não sofrem de depressão.

Os antidepressivos tendem a produzir alguma melhora na primeira ou segunda semana de uso. Os benefícios completos podem normalmente são vistos apôs dois / três meses. Se não houver uma melhora do quadro depressivo dentro desse tempo e aconselhável conversar com o seu psiquiatra para ele poder alterar a dose da medicação ou adicionar ou substituir outro antidepressivo. Em algumas situações, outros medicamentos psicotrópicos podem ser úteis. É importante informar ao seu médico se um medicamento não funciona ou se você tiver efeitos colaterais.

**Exemples de tratamentos para a depressão:**

Medicação

Psicoterapias

Suplementos alimentares

Atividades físicas

44,"So since I (23F) was 4, I would occasionally get short periods of time where I'd get this feeling -- for lack of a better explanation I called it the 'Gray feeling'. I called it the gray feeling because when it happens, everything I see and feel are a slate gray. It comes suddenly and can last anywhere from seconds to minutes. It feels like time stops, all of the color drains out of the room, the air gets stale, and there's this heavy sense of abject dread. It's not a terrorizing feeling of something scary but rather a strong feeling that something very wrong has happened. Something evil happened and I feel the air around me pressing on me with what feels like hundreds of pounds. Ive been at family gatherings where I was sitting at the table and all of a sudden everything stopped, and I felt such a strong sense of shame. And with the shame I also felt like I was being watched. Less so in a spectator sense, more so it's like I walked into work naked. Like I'm exposed and everyone can see me. I feel ashamed, dirty, and unbearably uncomfortable. 

When I feel this way there's nothing I can do that will help. When I was little I thought about hugging my mom, but touching anyone would make the feeling so much worse, like walking on wet socks. I thought about removing myself from the situation, which is better than staring off into space in public until the feeling passes, but it doesn't make it end any quicker. I just wait for the feeling to end. 

Ive talked to my therapist and close family members about it and they say it's just anxiety. But I don't know why I would feel this way at 4 years old? My earliest memory of the gray feeling is sitting in a bathtub at 4 years old staring at the shower tiles and feeling so ashamed and alone. It feels like im alone in the universe, while also knowing to my core that something is very wrong. 

To be honest it feels like I'm being undressed with someones eyes, like I can almost feel what their imagining theyd do. I feel vulnerable and small. And there's no explanation for this. 

I've considered the possibility that I was molested when I was little but I don't have any specific memories of outstanding physical trauma or any sort of flashback memories. I doubt that I was molested but I have no idea what this feeling is, why I get it, and why I've had it for so long. 

Has anyone else experienced this or know what it could be?



Tl;Dr : Ive been getting the ""gray feeling"" since I was 4.

50,"So I've got this *thing*, and I don't understand what it is. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  


I got some news that I didn't want to hear today. It made me sad and angry. The only reason I know this, is that 1) that's how people feel when they get bad news, and 2) when I first got the news, I felt my face go hot for a second, before feeling sort of ""blank"" again. You wouldn't be able to tell that there was anything wrong or off with me face-to-face, because my problem is that I can't seem to get the emotions out. This ""blankness"" is kind of my default state, especially apparent when I should be shouting or crying and I just can't seem to.   


It's like my emotions are stuck inside me. Like they're there, but buried under a huge mound of dense fabric or wet soil and I can't get at them, but I so badly want to get them out and feel them properly. I want my rage, and I want my sorrow. Instead I don't really feel anything much surface-level. I know that I should logically be feeling something, but I can barely feel anything at all. I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I look totally neutral. I spoke out loud, and I sound normal. But in my head I want to smash everything in sight. I tend to bite myself, hard, on the arms when I get like this because it's a blunt, grounding sensation, and it enables me to feel something. It's as though I can feel rage or pain on the outside of my skin rather than just the inside. It isn't something that I'm proud of, but short of breaking things that I can't afford to replace, I don't know what else to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what this is? I've had depression for years, but had gotten mostly ""better"", and am at least functioning nowadays, so I don't know that it's that. I think it might be some form of dissociation, but I feel it so often that I'm unsure it's that either. If it sounds familiar, or like a symptom of anything, I'd appreciate if you could also point me to any sort of relevant subreddit. I just want it to stop. I can't stand it.",12Sep2018,2

And its not like im incapable of being happy, so my brain chemicals arent messed up, though with the life i have right now it just makes me depressed.   


I've tried to change my self-destructive habits but i feel trapped in my own head. I've had issues with self esteem for 3 years now, but for the past few months it's gotten.. pretty bad. To the point i start self harming regularly.  


Also, I've been withdrawing socially a lot. When i try to socialise though, i just end up hurting myself more, because i feel ignored all the time. And when i feel ignored, i just get.. really frustrated and angry? (which also makes me self harm.) Socialising makes me feel so terrible now that i don't want to go to school, i just wanna stay home all day.   


Speaking of school, over there im all quiet and shit. Everyone assumes thats just my personality now because when im asked if im okay i used to just say ""yeah, im just tired.""   
 At home though, i act different. One moment im having an emotional outburst then the next im totally fine and socialising with my family, which are the only people that i feel comfortable with.  
I feel like all these problems are my fault and im just being delusional. I want to hear that my problems are ""real"" and ""acceptable"" not some stupid shit i over-exaggerated in my mind.

However, my work is very isolating, and I've been noticing it's been having a detrimental effect on my mental health.  I'm there 8 hours a day, every day, and there just simply isn't enough work to keep my occupied. As a result, I'm forced to sit there and just go on my phone and browse reddit, facebook, insta, or whatever.  Whenever I start to feel lonely, anxious, or depressed when I'm at home, I can usually get up and go for a walk or do something, but at work I can't.  I'm trapped where I am.  The best I can do is open a social media site for the 60th time that day.  The effect has generally been for me to sit there and stew over it.

I definitely feel like on days where I've been busy most of the day, I feel a lot better than days where I've done almost nothing.  There are a lot of small things or side projects I could be doing, there is almost always *something*, but the thing is they require a lot of brain power.   I simply do not have 8 hours worth of being ""fresh"" in me per day.  Some days I can push it out, but certainly not everyday. Even if I asked my boss for more work (which would then add stress), I just could not force myself to be productive for 40 hours every week.

Back when I was in a relationship, it wasn't so bad, because I would text my ex all day, but now I really talk to no one during the day.  I have my friends, but they all have their own lives so they can't talk much.  My coworkers keep to themselves, and when I started I tried talking to them, but we really don't have anything in common. 

I'm noticing this is having a horrid effect on my mental health - I'm irritable, I feel hopeless, the future to me seems bleak, and my anxiety and depression are through the roof.  I've always had anxiety, but the depression is somewhat new for me.  I begin to feel better on weekends - I can get out and about, see people, but Monday morning I'm always back to square one. 

I feel like it's cumulative - hour after hour, day after day, week after week, it chips away at my mental state.

Taking someones dignity and integrity away, penetrating their body with needles and medication, and denying their feelings by declaring them insane when they're not is *not* a morally justifiable action. It is cruel and violating a persons body and mind on the most fundamental level. Denying innocent people their liberty and dignity is one of the most disgusting crimes humanity committed, and claiming it happens on moral grounds or for a good reason is even more disgusting. And I'm not even talking about the people having their lives or ruined or taken away by the police that was called on them.

Yeah, we're far away from becoming an advanced civilization, horrible things happen all the time, but ffs stop acting as if it's something good.",12Sep2018,1
61,"I've been dealing with some problems for the last three years and I honestly don't know what happened to me. It started in '15 which was a very difficult year for me and my family. During the Fall I made a very dumb decision to trip on an NBOMe that I thought was LSD. My friend told me it was and I was stupid enough to believe him also completely unexperienced/unaware of other substances being put on blotter. Luckily nothing bad happened during the trip and I came back to reality feeling just fine.

About one month later I came back from a vacation and smoked some weed which activated my very first panic attack. I was a very experienced smoker before this and this traumatic panic attack activated some kind of underlying anxiety disorder and I haven't felt the same since. Constant anxiety symptoms such as shaking, head pressure, twitches , depersonalization and others that have been waxing and waning over the years. What confused me most at the time was that after this experience I could not smoke marijuana the same way without making these feelings way worse. Also after this point life just seemed different, it might of just been the depersonalization or maybe it was ego death but everything was just numb to me even things I used to think were beautiful such as cities at night or nature. Like I can't remember If I have experienced true happiness after all of this began It's usually just an ""ehhhh"" feeling. 

As the months and years went by I got better and after a while weed was a little easier to handle. I began smoking again daily after about 6 months (1-2 hits) but I couldn't smoke the huge blunts or joints that I used to, also drinking a few nights a week to numb the anxiety. I wasn't cured but things were slowly getting better and around the 2 year mark I felt awesome. I had managed to overcome most of my problems and the only ones left were slight anxiety and minor depersonalization. At this point I completely forgot about all of this bullshit and just focused on finishing school, this was the closest I felt to normal since my issues started.

Now this summer I got a little too crazy with the drinking and had some very uncomfortable panic attacks again. This brought out a lot more anxiety, stress, depression and I began noticing my visual static more. This caused a mental breakdown where I convinced myself I must have HPPD from the one tab of NBOMe that I took years ago (I know it sounds crazy but it seemed like a good reason for what I've been going through). Literally for 3 months I was on reddit reading about HPPD (a lot of negative stories) and trying to find the answers to my problems like some kind of hypochondriac. I wasted my entire summer and came to the conclusion that the only explanation for my symptoms was hppd and that my brain has been fried/permanently altered this whole time.

I fell into a very deep depression and I'm still in that hole right now looking for help. I've been to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists but none of them really understand what I'm going through and I haven't been diagnosed. To be honest I'm not sure I have it either since my only visual symptoms are blinking static(mostly on walls), sometimes ghosting (when I'm tired) and the carpets/walls look distorted if I stare at them. I've never had afterimages or trails which are some of the main symptoms that people report about who actually have HPPD.

These issues did slow down my extreme addiction to cannabis and I was able to function well enough to finish my degree at a pretty tough University. I know I'm not mentally impaired, my vision is almost perfect and I can function just as good as anyone else, it's mainly the anxiety/dp symptoms that make life hard but I've learned to control them for the most part. The diagnosis for HPPD states that visual symptoms must be distressing enough so that you can't function in a social or occupational setting, mine are mainly just background noise. For some reason I can't let go of that one trip even reading the words ""LSD"" or ""NBOMe"" gives me so much fear and I keep blaming myself for causing damage to my mental health. I really scared myself after learning about how dangerous NBOMe is and I am truly ashamed for taking it, also the high rates of HPPD reported make me feel even worse. When I believed my anxiety disorder was a combination of multiple factors I could deal with it, but realizing that every horrible symptom that happened was possibly because of one tab makes life unbearable.

I used to be a happy stress free young man and now I'm an anxious, depressed and depersonalized mess who feels like he threw his life away with one poor decision. I feel like I lost part of my soul after all of my anxiety symptoms set in and it's almost as if I've been in another life for the past few years. I can't figure out what the exact cause for all of this is because my problems began 5 weeks after my trip. (Seems way too long to be related but I honestly don't know) 

Could I get some help in understanding if this is actually HPPD? 

Did the NBOMe cause this or was I predisposed to an anxiety disorder that came out on it's own? 

Why was cannabis never the same for me again after my first major panic attack could it be because psychedelics change the weed high?

So many questions and thoughts run through my mind on a daily basis that I might not ever be able to explain. I would give anything to go back to the old me.

63,"tl;dr Ex boyfriend's behavior has drastically changed, is this a mental health issue or his way of saying he's done with me?

I 28(m) briefly dated a 19(m) with schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. We broke up because he said he wasn't that into me. That's fine that happens. However his behavior previously told me he was lying, it was like a switch went off, I let it go because I know he is struggling. We said we would try to remain friends because I truly care about him. Not once was I anything less than a decent human being or try to make my cordiality seem like an attempt to win him back. Now he is ignoring my texts (sent one at a time) and phone calls (less than one a week). I suppose my question is: is this the behavior of someone suffering from poor mental health that I should ride out or is this truly his way of saying he no longer wishes to speak to me? I am worried about him and I do care so my instinct is to want to ride it out but it could be I'm reading into it and I should walk away. I need and outside perspective.

65,"Hey all. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.
I am a college senior and i am not diagnosed with any sort of mental health issues, but i certainly have been feeling mentally unhealthy.
For as long as i can remember, ive had a depressive, self loathing side to me. I tend to make assumptions about what people think about me and behave accordingly, which kind of brings it around full circle as a self fulfilling prophecy. Ive tried to be a positive person in my life, but recently ive struggled with realizing that i am actually rather passive aggresive and i invite a lot of negativity.
Despite the fact that i am very high preforming in my studies and my passions, i feel worthless and weak. everything i do is for other people, or from fear of external consequence from other people, like judgement. I am highly afraid of being alone and feel as though i live vicariously through other people, though i certainly push people away and neglect intimacy. I am truly an antisocial extrovert, doomed to seek the validation and company of others, allthewhile inviting others to take advantage of me and despising the dynamic.
I feel as if i am a social idiot. As my social anxiety builds i can feel others being weirded out which just exacerbates my anxiety. I tend to overcompensate by giving too much in relationships, whether it be my time or even physical items.
I have never had an intimate relationship, romantic or otherwise. I know its not my right to have people close with me, but i find myself feeling jaded and deprived. 

The reason i post this is because recently i have found myself obsessed with the idea of suicide. I know i will never do it, i am far to weak of a person and people are counting on me. My parents are divorced and are putting themselves in a world of debt to allow me and my younger sister to attend university. They don't put undue pressure on me to succeed, but i feel indebted to them. They have provided for me and loved me in the way a parent does, even though i dont love myself. The only thing that keeps me tethered to this world is my want to return the favor.

I desperately want to improve my relationships, my self image, and my life. Despite this, i can not stop romanticizing about ending my life. Everytime something bad happens to me or i am wronged it is my first thought.  Everynight i lie in bed for several hours before i fall asleep, hoping that i wont wake up tomorrow. That is in my twisted thoughts my greatest wish. I would no longer have to feel this way, and yes those who love me would grieve, but they wouldnt look to themselves as the culprit like if i commit suicide. 

TLDR: I hate myself which invites others to do the same.

What can i do to break the cycle? Is there a hope for a system that is its own worst enemy?

I think they are somewhat correct but I think I’m just on the spectrum and not bipolar 1. Ever since she diagnosed me she has literally refuted everything I do and every little thing I say. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t know what is my illness and what is just my personality/me. I’m honestly afraid to text her and I have to literally think about what I’m going to say before I talk to her. I’m afraid she is going to analyze what I say and refute it or question my mental health. She has honestly been awesome and the most productive therapist up until this point. Better than any other therapist I have seen. The one issue is she has somewhat of a complex.

70,"Hey everyone,

Just sharing a letter I sent to Circle K Atlantic Division. It's sad to see that the way mental health is still treated in different work places. 


Store: Highfield Park Circle K
Manager: (manager)
 


Good day,
 


I am writing you today to express my dissatisfaction with the current management at the Highfield Park Circle K in Dartmouth NS.
 


My Fiancee started a job there mid summer, and when she was interviewed she was extremely upfront and forthcoming about her mental health issues, including but not limited to PTSD, Anxiety and Depression. 
 


This week she was fired without notice because she had to take a few mental health days. She was not in a good state, and neither was I. We had just found out that my mother is in the beginning stages of heart failure among other personalissues.
 


While talking with (manager) and explaining the situation, my fiancee was told that she was making it up, and that she was fired.
 


Mental health is a serious issue, and it can be extremely debilitating when a person is suffering symptoms. Obviously if a person cannot function properly at the time, than they are not fit to be in a store alone. 
 


The Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission states the following:
 


Employers must not discriminate against employees based on protected characteristics, such as disability or gender. In fact, an employer has what is called a “duty to accommodate."" This means they must do what is reasonable to allow aperson to get, or keep, a job.
 


Both Circle K and Couche-Tard have made various references to mental health and how the companies support those who suffer. For example:
- In 2017 Couche-Tard raised $375000 for youth mental health research at McGill University.
- Circle-K itself has mental health as an essential health benefit in its 2017 Benefits guide.
 


How can a company that prides itself on helping others achieve wellness, put down its own employees for their illnesses?
 


I myself worked for (manager) many years ago, and she was a completely different person than the one I see today.
I encourage you to talk to some of the employees that work at that gas station, or reach out to some of the former staff. I am confident that you will find the management is not up to the standard it should be.
 


To sum things up, it is not right for a manager to treat their employees as lesser beings, we are all human and at some point we will all have challenges to overcome. I firmly believe that people do not deserve to be kicked while they are down.


 
That is what (manager) did to my fiancee.


 
Thank you,

74,"Trigger warning: car accident


He was on a bike and was hit by someone making a right turn during a red light. I was a few cars back waiting for the light and only noticed once the light turned green and no one moved for a few moments. I looked to see why they weren’t moving and saw this guy in the middle of the road, not moving, and a bike with a front tire that was completely bent and busted up. A second later he shakily got up, brushed himself off, grabbed the bike and walked  onto the grass on the side of the road. His head and mouth were bleeding but otherwise he seemed okay. A few people pulled over to help him. I considered stopping as well but decided not to, and I’m honestly glad I didn’t because a few minutes later when I had sort of processed it, I started having a massive hyperventilating panic attack, more intense then any I’ve had in years. But then there wasn’t anywhere to pull over so I was panicking and driving and starting to feel light headed like I might pass out. Thankfully I have been practicing talking myself down from panic attacks for years and years so I was able to calm down enough to drive the rest of the way to work. 

I am terrified of driving and car accidents but I have to drive a lot for work now. I go through periods where I feel pretty good about driving, but then something happens like car trouble on the highway or a minor accident and I kind of go back to square one with my fear of driving. 

It could have easily been me who hit that guy. And as much as I logically know that these things just happen and that the guy was probably okay (I hope), my mental demons use anything like this as an excuse to confirm that all my unfounded fears are real and my PTSD hyper-vigilance is necessary. Now they’re all throwing an evil party in my head chanting about how the world is a very unsafe place and that if I so much as leave my front porch, bad things will surely happen to me and the people I love. 

Luckily, I’ve been through this enough times to be able to recognize that those thoughts aren’t ones I actually believe but instead ones that were triggered by something that is a well known trigger. I just hate how out of control I feel when something like this happens and suddenly my entire sense of safety and trust in the world goes poof. Can anybody relate? ",12Sep2018,6
75,"I’ve had anxiety for a while, along with PTSD from an abusive relationship where I was left in constant fear. Finally the fear is dissipating but ever since I was in that relationship my connection to any normal emotions has been either nonexistent or very warped. Ex I am much more reactive to certain behaviours. Some of this is good as I think I can trust my instincts, but some of it is unhealthy and feels extreme and I don’t manage the reactions well. I’m aware of all this, but I feel like I’m spinning in some direction I don’t like. 

I feel like I was working so hard to get through life on a daily basis that I became good at faking things, but now that I’m feeling somewhat better I feel like I don’t know who I am. I do know what I want in a relationship but I realized I may be terrible at finding it or navigating the beginnings of trust. I’ve lashed out in texts while drinking or wound up verbally vomiting about emotions that I realized may intimidate or confuse people. Drinking has become too much of a habit, it started off as self medicating for anxiety, and using it as a way to feel connected to myself, but it’s spiralling a bit and I’m worried. Even without it I am worried about my emotions and reactions to men I’m getting involved with. I don’t know how to trust myself and I am having reactions that are leaving me feeling embarrassed and in a cycle or trying to repair damage (whether or not the guy is worth it really). 

I am in therapy and I go weekly, but today I just feel awful and tired and like I’m destroying all new relationships. I don’t like my behaviour. Thankfully my friendships are good, but I’m starting to see some things more clearly and I want this part of my life more under control.

I am hurt and angry. I am afraid. 

He said he didn't want to live anymore because his girlfriend broke up with him. Or attempted to rather. He basically pulled the ""if you break up with me I will kill myself"" line. She ended up coming to the hospital to be by his side.

He is currently on a 72 hour hold and we hope he makes the most of his time there. He is on medication for his depression and anxiety. He needs to see a therapist, but how do you get an 18 year old to realize they need help and to get the most out of that help, they need to be willing to open up. Opening up means vulnerability. Opening up means trusting the person, and he has a lot of trust issues.

Anyway, I know I will be the one going around asking if they need a third wheel. (This did not stop in school and in an University you really cannot ask the teacher to put you in a group) So when this happened again on Monday for a project I walked around feeling dizzy and asking everyone. I found a pair that was generous and took me in. I even talked with them about stuff that was not related to the project. The pain eased, but was still there. I thought ""Finally! My social skills are kicking in"" but it did not last long. On Wednesday the guy was sick and could not come that day, the was stressed out because everything went wrong. The expensive computer software just was not doing what it should be and shredded our project for the day. She only talked short sentences to me and I felt it coming. After the teacher said we should form groups of three I knew. After lunch the talked to two other girls and was telling stories. Yup, that was her new group. But I sat with them in denial til I asked her something for the next project. She informed me she was with them now. I just shrugged and said ok, but internally I was crying.

It sits on my shoulders and keeps me a social dwarf and drives people away like and unpleasant smell. Sometimes I even see him (not sure if I go crazy) and since 2 years he has a name: \*Ralff\*. Not a very impressive name, I know. He just seems like a Ralff. I never knew what he is or if I am the main character of a bad and boring TV show. I really see him on bad day like today, when I am sad enough to cry. In the corner of my eye I see him, not in the mirror, not on photos. Only in the corner of my eye. I think he is the incarnation of my selfdoubt or my  subconscious that wants to drive people away from me when I start talking.

86,"So I was in a kitchen at school today with my class and there was a big knife sitting on the counter. I stared at it the whole class just day dreaming and fantasizing about picking it up and stabbing someone. No one even did anything to me, I just really wanted to do it. It wasn’t the first time I’ve wanted to do stuff like that for no reason. I looked into it but I really don’t think that I’m a psycho, or that I’m insane in any way. So does anyone else relate? I’d also like to hear your opinions on it if you don’t mind. 

I actually posted this same thing just a few days ago but it got buried and I still would like to get more opinions on it. Thanks.",12Sep2018,2

89,"I’m looking for anyone who knows some information on the topic. I’m quite curious because the Dsm-5 labels pedophilia, sadism, masochism, all under the same level/severity of psychosexual disorders. Which, I don’t tend to understand.

91,"I’m having a really hard time. My mom passed away unexpectedly five years ago. I’ve been doing okay since then, but yesterday my dad was admitted to the hospital because he was feeling light headed. He’s also been suffering from nose bleeds for a while. Long story short, they suspect leukaemia or lymphoma.

I don’t really know how to deal with this news. He is in his 70s so this really won’t be a good diagnosis. 

I haven’t seen him or spoken to him very much lately and the guilt overwhelming. I’ve been at work trying not to cry all day. I’m really struggling with this and I’m not sure what to do. ",12Sep2018,5
92,"So I posted this elsewhere but I feel it appropriate to post it here so I will. Sorry it's a bit long but if you manage to read this until the end then thank you because it means a lot to finally be able to share this dark part of my life. I haven't spell checked this so if there are any mistakes sorry but I don't know if I'm ready to read through it myself as it's something I don't really want to think about too much again. But here goes...

Story

Depression. Depression is the bane of my life. It is the dark cloud that dangles so persistently above me. It is the voice in the back of my head telling me you're not good enough or you'll never make it. But many if not all of us will go through it at some point of our lives and overcoming it is the main thing. Although it is hard you do the best you can. This is my story dealing with depression, suicide, eating disorders, ect...

When I was 13 I started to self harm, I use to slit my wrist and watch as the blood oozed down my arm. Why I did this I do not exactly know. Maybe to feel something? That's an answer that a lot of individuals give when they are asked that daunting three letter word 'why'. For me I guess, to some extent, it was to 'feel' but also because I wanted to punish myself, that ever growing voice telling me you're never good enough so why try? Then one night I snapped. I decided I didn't want to do it anymore. No. I couldn't do it anymore. Live that is, not because I necessarily wanted to die, I just wanted to stop feeling so hopeless, so worthless, so alone. Humans do the worst things when they are desperate and that was one of my most desperate moments. Long story short - I had overdosed on a cocktail of pills and woke up two weeks later in hospital. All I remember about that night is wanting so desperately to stop feeling and moving and breathing, until the last second when I was certain I was about to die that I wanted to live. 

And so I lived life after that night, falling deeper into depression, trying to do the best I could. I self harmed every night until my arm - always my arm was covered in cuts. For the next few years I would always doubt myself, tell myself I wasn't good enough. I felt so weird and all I wanted to do was feel normal. But that's the funny thing, what is normal? That concept of 'normal' is a strange one but more on that later.

I went in and out of therapy - it's good but I'm not one to talk about my feelings. Things started to get better.

Until year 13. Of course, everyone was stressed as it was the most important year of your academic career. However, I decided to get a job wthlist studying so I was either at school, studying or at work which made things even more stressful. So I fell even more deeper into depression. However, I stopped cutting and I swore I would never go back, the urge was still there. So I started taking antidepressants. For some, they work, would I recommend them? Maybe but for me it was hell. I had never felt more suicidal and I started to dissociate and withdraw from reality. In my mind nothing was real and therefore I stopped caring about school, about me about life. I figured I didn't need to eat because I wasn't real and this wasn't real life. This brings me into another topic. Food. My relationship with food has always been weird, like many of us food was a comfort. If I was sad I eat food, hungry - ear food, happy - food. Basically, I'd eat a lot which resulted in me putting on weight. Anyway, as I entered this state of 'I'm not real' my appetite reduced and reduced to the point where maybe I'd eat in the morning and then live off an ice lolly and water. And that was sometimes because most days I wouldn't have time for breakfast. Then enter bulimia. Let me clarify,  I am not and was not bulimic, however I was using similar tactics and if I hadn't stopped I truly believe that I would of developed some sort of ED. For instance, I would eat my ice lolly and maybe some snacks and then stick a toothbrush down my throat and throw it all up. I was doing this 2-3 times per day.  Until one day I realised I was literally killing myself. So I decided to stop which was hard because when I wasn't purging I wanted to cut and having the urge to both these things and not being able to made me even more suicidal.  Then one night as I did before all those years ago, I snapped. I didn't want to live life like that anymore. So I hatched this giant scheme to kill myself. This still scares me to this day and I've never told anyone this before. I planned to hang myself and I knew when, where and how I was going to do it. So I wrote a note and told the people i knew I would hurt that I loved them and cleaned my room. Then I said a prayer. The next day after school, I brought some rope, watched a tutorial on tying nooses and made my knot. I planned to go to the park near my house to this quiet field where I knew nobody really went. I planned to do it on a Thursday three days from then. However, during the those three days something clicked and I thought to myself I don't have to go through with this, I can beat this and what if... So I decided to stop taking my meds and it was the best decision ever and now I feel a lot better, it's safe to say that the worst of depression is over although I know it's a life long battle.

95,"It has been a rough year, especially these last few months. I just started my first real job out of college in June as a consultant dietitian. I’m working under a limited permit and have a month left to take my registration exam (which I failed the first time) and can’t seem to motivate myself to study. The job is very stressful and I often feel overworked. 

I keep getting involved with guys who treat me like a girlfriend for 5-9 months and then at the turn of a hat decide they don’t want anything serious and cut things off. The most recent one of 5 months ended things 2 weeks ago.  I’m still strung up and super hurt about this one because we connected very well. I hate being single/alone. I know I’m a great catch and a good person.  I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong and why I keep attracting jerks. I’m so afraid I’m never going to find someone.

I’m so depressed all the time. I have no motivation or desire to do anything other than lay in bed or go to work (because I have to). I hardly ever eat (and I’m a dietitian, I literally preach the importance of eating on a daily basis).  I hate burdening my family and friends more than once with the same problem so I often internalize everything. I did schedule an appointment with a counselor but it’s 2 weeks away. 

Somebody please just tell me that they have been in this position before and that it will get better.  ",12Sep2018,6
96,"I broke up with my LDR partner 3 years ago because I was paranoid he was gathering information about me to use against me. I have severe paranoia with various things - people poisoning my food, reading my thoughts, wanting to kill me, etc.

We stayed in touch as friends. I eventually told him about the paranoid feelings. He is the only person who has ever understood everything about my mental illness (BPD, Anorexia, Schizophrenia) but he was upset and offended that I would think he'd want to hurt me.

He took a step back from me, our contact has significantly decreased. I still love him so much and I think about him everyday. I'm down because we're not together and I blame myself for messing things up.

It's his birthday soon and I asked if I could visit. He said he'd like that, but my paranoia is just in overdrive again. He seemed a bit unsure. We've tried 3 times in person to make it work and it can't seem to. Am I being obsessive? I'm 35, it's not a teenage crush.

I'm determined to go visit. I jokingly announced to him that I will be. He didn't respond to that.

I just go to bed every night lonely and sad and I imagine he's here next to me but at the same time I'm terrified of going there to face my fears and my paranoia. I try to reason with myself but I can't. There is no motive for him to hurt me. But I can't stop being paranoid.",12Sep2018,2

99,"Hi, I'm 16 and from Portugal. The ambient I live in is not bad, I have nothing to complain about my life. Even though I don't live a sad life I sometimes still feel miserable and sad. I don't discuss it with anyone because I don't have the right to be sad, It would be petty of my part to complain that I'm sad. What makes everything worse is that I already tried to talk to my mother about my feelings but all I hear is the same nonsensical bullshit that I'm just complicating life and that I need to snap out of my imaginary complications because life only gets harder... :(",12Sep2018,2
100,"This might come off as a little bit wild but it’s too embarrassing to see a doctor about and it’s affected my life way too drastically to brush it off, so here I am. 

I identify as a bisexual female and have since my early teens. However, this is only because I have the potential* to be attracted to more than one gender - I can’t actually, no matter how hard I try, be attracted to more than one at the same time. This constant change in sexual orientation is confusing, and I don’t know any other bisexuals who have the same problem. I understand that sexuality is fluid, but it has seriously affected my relationship. 

What makes this more concerning than a sexuality crisis is that there is a pretty noticeable shift in my personality too - and I swear I’m not trolling! For example, I lean toward a more lesbian stereotype when I’m attracted to girls. I feel really really uncomfortable in feminine clothes and I’m more dominant. I’m reckless (driving), impulsive (with money), and really immature (doing dumb shit). I become more possessive and protective of crushes, and I fall a lot faster - it’s all lust and no regard for the future. And I absolutely hate eggs. 

When I’m “straight” I feel pretty comfortable in feminine clothes. My goals are more grounded, as in, I actually have goals. I’m not as over the moon happy as I am when I’m “gay” but my mood is pretty constant (not happy, not sad). I’m less confident, less dominant, and will definitely not impulsively drop $3000 in one shopping trip (I play it safe). I don’t “feel” as much. I don’t fall fast and my kind of love is settling down with someone I care about. I’m cynical, and I’m more judgemental of other people. I spend a lot of my time regretting my other self and what I’ve said and done. I also like eggs. 

And I think it goes without saying but I feel zero sexual or romantic attraction for women when I’m “straight” and for men when I’m “gay” even if I try. 

I get that this is really fucking weird so save your judgment, I’ve got enough of that from myself. But I’d just like to know if a) there’s someone else on here who can relate, and b) if I’m just a moody bisexual or I if I have some weird personality issues that need to be looked at. 

Or it could just be because I’m a Gemini. Who knows lmao.

101,"Almost 15 years ago I noticed lumps, like glandular tissue, around my right nipple. The left side also seems to be affected but much less. I know about gynecomastia in men. I had taken some common prescription drugs used to treat hairloss. I thought I caused this trying to keep from going bald. 😕

No pain and not really visible, just really uncomfortable! Had some imaging done and my general practitioner didn’t know the cause but no doctors involved were concerned about anything like cancer. I was told it wouldn’t go away without surgery which would be considered elective/cosmetic and therefore I’d pay the full cost.

I was on several meds for depression at the time. Stayed on basically the same combo for years including a high dose of Seroquel.

Went to a new psychiatrist who changed my diagnosis to bipolar depression and changed almost all my meds. Chest thing totally went away!!!

Later on tried to add a new med and it came back. Told my psychiatrist about it. He did some lab tests including prolactin levels. He expected prolactin to be elevated but everything was normal. We switched to a different med.

Years later we try another med change and it happens again. Psychiatrist says surgery to remove whatever this tissue is should be able to be covered by insurance because it is interfering with treatment. But I just try a different med.

Just added Ritalin and was fine for a few months but now trying to tweak my low dose. 24 mg extended release in the AM now supplemented by just 5 mg of standard in late afternoon and this chest shit starts again!

If it continues if course I’ll go see my psychiatrist. Really hoping it stops. The Ritalin was really helping.

Has anybody else reacted to meds this way???

102,"I've been under a lot of stress lately (and also have a dx of depression,  anxiety, PTSD). The first thing that had me teetering on the edge is that my car broke down. The very next day a close relative was found dead and that sent me over the edge. Everytime I close my eyes I have voices speaking/yelling at each other. I can't sleep because they're so loud! I keep telling them to shut up but they just won't. Even after taking a muscle relaxer they kept yapping.  Last night I slept about 2 hours. This morning I took a benadryl hoping for sleep and got 4 hours. I don't know what this is or what to do about it. Can anyone help me?
