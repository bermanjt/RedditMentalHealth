0,"I’m a piece of shit. I don’t wave at people when they walk by. I want to die.

Today I’ve don’t nothing but masterbaute, and play Minecraft. I’ve done about 3/4 of my homework. I originally wanted to finish my homework, then teach myself some math (I like to do that everyday) but school tired me out, and now I’ve done nothing productive. I have a lot of issues, and some of them I will list here. 

-Weird fetishes (voyeurism, scat, piss, BDSM, shame) They interfere with my life, and that is when they become issues. This is the number one thing I struggle with, and would be the most likely reason I would kill myself. If all of these fetishes went away, I would be able to deal with the rest of the things below this paragraph. 

-I think I have anxiety and/or depression. My grandma has Bipolar depression and she may or may not have passed it on to my father. (He gets really angry at least once a day so I’m leaning on yes) i Get mood swings, but it just might be my horemones. My little brother might have anger issues, because he gets enraged at little things, and my mom talking to him. I’ve tried to talk my parents into bringing them to a pcycyatrist but they say that they are “all liberals” and that “what they do is bullshit.” 


I fear if I mention these issues the following will happen:

-My friends will overreact, and start pouring love and stuff onto me. I don’t like that attention. Many will start praying to God for me, and I fucking hate that. Might aswell talk to Santa. 
- my parents will start crying and blaming themselves. The will then blame my phone, and my friends. I will then kill my self, over the guilt I will have. 

I recent revealed to my friends that I am a weeb, and most of them started making fun of me. What if I told them I was scuicidle? Would they have to same reaction or would they switch to being affectionate like above. Humans are compelx so I can’t predict. 

School has been awful. I hate everyone there. I hate homework, and I just want to work on math. (I should be teaching myself Calculus 1 by the time Spring zbreak starts) Everything I do will affect my entire future, so I’m always thinking of what I did wrong. I’m sure there is a way to fix the school system, but no one has the balls to put foreword change. 

My goal in life is to become a Theoretical Physicst. It’s a lofty goal, and chances are stacked agents me, so that also adds to this pile of shit I call my life.

Overall, I can’t take the weight anymore. I wish I could just fall asleep forever. I just want to be at peace.

1,"I've been diagnosed with every kind of psychiatric disorder with the exception of schizophrenia. Bipolar with psychosis, dysthymia, major depression, agoraphobia, social anxiety, ADHD, dissociative disorders, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD... The list goes on and none of my mental health providers ever agree on anything. I see someone new (if I say, move) and they'll disagree with my old diagnoses and then give me a new one. The only sure thing is the PTSD and some unspecified dissociative disorder which is linked with my PTSD. There's confusion concerning whether or not I was actually psychotic or just suffering from a high level of anxiety. I'm not exactly sure either. 

Why is it so hard to be treated properly? A lot of these diagnoses are dependent on what the interviewer wants to see. I've came to the conclusion that there's a confirmation bias working against me. Many of these disorders can look the same and some contain symptoms that can look like something else. I know for a fact that I'm not bipolar and I've never experienced mania. I do not have social anxiety. The OCD is probably just the PTSD (including panic disorder). The ADHD can also just be the PTSD as well, e.g. distraction, poor memory. And can also be due to dissociation, e.g. zoning out or cataplexy. 

How does someone like me get the proper care that I need? ",04Oct2018,1
2,"After literally years of saying that I ""want to find someone to talk to"" I am ready to do the legwork and find a therapist I can develop a relationship with. I have health insurance through the state (Medicaid). My problem is that I don't know where to start. Every referral I have gotten is for ""addiction and mental health care"" services that primarily deal with hard core substance abuse issues and mental health issues that result in homeless, which is a huge problem where I live. I would rather not get help than sit in one of these waiting rooms to see a provider who is over worked, underpaid and deals with drug seeking behavior constantly. The primary care clinic I go to is already like this, and it's caused me to stop seeking medical treatment for other issues.

That is my big deal breaker, other than that I don't have other major requirements. I'm just finding it overwhelming googling therapists in my area and calling each one to see if they take my insurance. I cannot find any legitimate referral list from my insurance either.

If you have had a positive (or informative but negative) experience finding a therapist, I'd love to hear it. ",04Oct2018,1
3,"My shopping habits have become more frequent in the past few months. I'm not in a position where I should be spending a lot of money but I feel like I have so little self control lately. I know a lot of it is linked to my poor self-image and feeling emotionally empty right now. Getting new stuff and feeling cute temporarily makes my depression more bearable, but in the long run it's not worth it. I'm supposed to be saving up to move, and I am, but not as quickly as I could be due to my clothing obsession. When I want something, I can't stop thinking about it until I buy it. And once I have an item, it's very hard for me to part with it, therefore I have a ridiculous amount of stuff (especially clothes). How can I get myself out of this bad mindset? I feel so guilty for spending money on sweaters when I should be putting every penny into my savings account.",04Oct2018,1
4,"I'm writing this as i'm eating ice cream i tried to sneakily take from downstairs (currently living back with parents and they would *hate* to find me stealing ice cream, stoned at 1am). But, 10 minutes ago as soon as I had the idea I knew I was going to do it.

This goes for anything unhealthy whether its booze, harder drugs, weed, binging (usually when baked but its still bad considering i find it hard to eat during the day due to anxiety).

What can this terrible impulse control mean about me? I'm in a really bad spot right now, have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety many times but its bad now.

But I'm really starting to wonder if there's soemthing more I need to consider before I see my CBT counsellor the second time...

I worry it could be something like asd or bpd but i dont really trust my judgement of myself to know, especially since im in a particularly unstable place right now.

Sorry for the rant, felt like adding context.
Anyone else relate? 

As soom as I have an idea I know is terrible i'm practically planning the next thing.. It's expensive, to say the least. This has applied to everything with me that I enjoy in any way, sometimes, or at least I'm noticing I do that right now",04Oct2018,1

7,"Hey I posted this in r/depression but thought I should post here as well. So I've had both depression and anxiety for 7 years now and recently it's gotten very bad. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything and can barely get off my couch. 

On top of this I've been dealing with some health issues recently and my doctor doesn't know what's going on. I've been thirsty and lightheaded 24/7 and it's been making me miserable. My doctor thinks it's either due to a medication I'm taking, she thinks it could be Diabetes Insipidus and she's also wondering if I have POTS but I still need testing done. I've also been having issues with sleep and having no energy even when I do get sleep. I take 1 mg of Xanax a night which could be the cause of feeling groggy in the morning and I would like to get off of it or on a different medication.

I also live in a pretty toxic environment right now. My brother used to physically abuse me as a child and my parents pretty much just let it happen and even threatened me that if I told anyone something bad would happen. He doesn't physically abuse me anymore but he's is verbally abusive along with my parents. My parents look at me like the black sheep of the family for having depression and anxiety, they make me feel like a failure. I'm trying to find a job and move out but the problem is I don't have a lot of job experience so a lot of places won't hire me and I'm also lacking a lot of independent skills. I also don't have a lot of support besides my doctor and therapist and I don't have a lot of friends who could help me get away from my family. 

I just feel like a mess right now and I don't know where to even start to help myself get better ",04Oct2018,1

9,"Ok, I was curious if anyone else has this. My depersonalization is rooted in trauma and anxiety. I've had these episodes a handful of time before getting dp and for a week at a time or randomly since getting depersonalization. I have been in an episode for the past few days now so I thought I would bring it up. I get this sense of ""hyper awareness"" of myself, my thoughts, my movements, the stuff around me. Everything seems more intense, louder, etc. Earlier I was playing video games as a distraction and suddenly became really aware of myself and almost had an anxiety attack. I don't know. I just know that I get this at times and am paralyzed. Literally. Sometimes when I get up to get ready for the day it will happen. I will go and stand at the bathroom door and feel rooted to the spot. It’s like a weird few minutes of slow motion where I zone out and focus on my action. I ALWAYS avoid looking in the mirror when I'm washing my hands, and hurry out. I've also had this when taking a shower.",04Oct2018,1
10," Normally, when I feel acutely suicidal it's because I'm having a panic attack. Not this time. I'm just done with all this shit.

I'm in high school. Yeah, I know, 16, young, and dumb, got so much to live for, blah blah blah. I have GAD (which mainly manifests as social phobia, but it's generalized enough that I got the broader diagnosis), MDD, and ADHD. I know all of my problems must seem so trivial to all of you who have some actually serious shit going on, because I'm just a naive teenager, right?

I'm in my junior year (11th grade) and I've been working really hard on coming out of my shell and meeting people. How gullible of me, haha. Thinking people actually like me.

My last class of the day is a cooking class (just a filler tbh, easy A and I needed an elective), and in that class especially I thought I was fitting in for once. Until today. We were making pumpkin muffins, and me and some other people were fucking around and having fun.

Then I got pantsed. I'm a girl. And I'm on my period.

Then they dumped an entire gallon of pumpkin puree on my head.

Then, while I was curled up in a ball in the floor in pure humiliation, they all took turns giving me lap dances while the others stood around and posted everything on Snapchat. The teacher just laughed right along with them.

It doesn't help that my period hits me so hard that I was in so much pain that I could hardly even stand up straight.

My mother's reaction to all of this? ""Just don't let them get to you."" Yeah, because that's so fucking easy when pictures of my bloody, pumpkin-y ass are going viral on Snapchat all around my school.

She then proceeds to force me to go to my martial arts class despite the amount of pain I'm in, both physically and emotionally. Because I don't matter so long as I'm doing whatever she wants me too.

I've been completely, utterly alone for 16 years. My first memories are of my father beating my mother, of my parents separating, of my father repeatedly calling CPS for no reason just because he wanted custody of my sister and I, and then of them getting back together because my mother was broke and refused to get a job. Then there was the screaming. The constant screaming, yelling, fighting. My mother walked out on us on my 9th birthday. My fucking birthday. Because my father got things confused and tried to take us to the pool before dinner instead of after. She came back, she always does, because that's just who she is. She loves to tell us she's leaving and never coming back, only to go for a drive and come back the next day. God, I can't remember how many nights I spent in my pajamas in a car with nothing but my American Girl Doll and a Bible driving around town with my mother after my parents were fighting.

Now, my parents like to pretend that everything's ok. It's not fucking ok. I'm not fucking ok. I don't talk to my parents about shit because they always try to shove their religious bullshit down my throat as if that's going to solve all of my problems. The fact that my mother threatened to disown me if I get hospitalized again doesn't help any.

I'm so alone. I'm so fucking alone it hurts. I have absolutely no desire to wake up in the morning. I'm so damn tired. So god damn tired.

Over the past couple of days I've managed to sneak enough junk food up to my room to have one last binge before I end it, because that's just the kind of fat fucking pig I am. Finding a blade was hard, but I managed to unscrew one from an old pencil sharpener. Now, I just have to finish up my homework (funny how my mind works, haha) and that's it. I'm done.",04Oct2018,1
11,"Background: I grew up in a conservative middle eastern household. I was really restricted as a kid But eventually found some independence by doing things behind their back. I have a loving boyfriend and go to college, have a job. But my family life is so depressing for multiple reasons. Its giving me anxiety and I constantly have dreams where I am trapped or suffocating. I love my parents and lately I cannot stand them. My family sees me as selfish, disattached, and secretive. 

For one thing, I am 20 years old and don’t have many choices about what I can do. I am forced to change what I’m wearing, the idea of me having a boyfriend is taboo (to my dad, my mom can deal with the concept), and I am always, ALWAYS questioned when I decide to go out and do something fun. I can never just have fun without being called selfish or irresponsible. I also am the oldest and am basically responsible for my two younger brothers. 

My mom is a major source of anxiety for me because she is a part time narcissistic mother. She can’t accept me growing up and gets vicious when I make my own decisions. She belittles me by saying that I have no friends because of my personality (I have friends that I rarely see because I can’t go out without them being on my back) She thinks I’m slutty for not being modest and dating. She is jealous of me (I feel) and hates that I work and go out because she doesn’t. It’s like a constant power struggle, where she compares herself to me. If I go out she blames me for abandoning her. To her, i don’t care about her or help her. I feel bad because she acts more like a kid and she’s like 23 years older than me. She’s also my mom so I love her unconditionally. But her behavior hurts me. She’s constantly depressed and spiteful towards me. I fear that one day I’ll lose her (she smokes a lot and drinks energy drinks even though she has high blood pressure) I want her to be healthy and have a life outside of the house. I always think about her dying and me never getting to show her love because she is so mean.  I want her to love me. Idk 

My dad is just strict and kind of a misogynist. He’s a hardworking dad though, but puts me down a lot. He hates to see me dressed up or having fun.

I just want to gain my independence and I am constantly working towards it. But how can I stay sane until then? I feel overwhelmed. ",04Oct2018,1

Tonight I am streaming on [twitch.tv/askanarttherapist](https://twitch.tv/askanarttherapist) from 10 to 11 pm est and my topic tonight is 'finding a therapist'. I am going over the basics of where you can find therapists, what to look for or ask, and to answer your questions. I am hoping to cover the differences between different types of therapists, the basics of using insurance, versus paying on your own, and what are some things to look out for when it comes to finding the perfect therapist for you.

I have started streaming on Wednesday evenings to help start the conversation about mental health and my goal is to work towards sharing correct information and ending the negative stigma.

17,"Bit the bullet today and called the most promising looking place in my city (i.e. doesn't have a ton of reviews all over the internet talking about the terrible conditions and lack of treatment like the majority of mental health facilities in my state do). I like their holistic approach  and the price isn't that bad after insurance ($1200 at 21 sessions, 3 sessions a week, hell that's cheaper than any therapist I've ever been to that wants friggin $100+ for each weekly session, sliding scale MY ASS)

I'm super nervous but also know this is something I need to do. Never done group therapy or taken psychiatric medication but I am very nonfunctional at adulting so I'm taking my hard to swallow pills that whatever I get on isn't going to fuck up my brain chemistry beyond repair (because I've already done that myself!)

Also don't know if I should do the IOP focusing on mental health or the dual diagnosis one. While I do have a substance abuse type personality my main and pressing problem is weed addiction, and I feel like it will be hard to talk about comfortably when everyone else in the group will likely be dealing with ""harder"" addictions (which I technically do as well, but have been clean for almost a year from hard shit)

18,"I have struggled with OCD and anxiety nearly my whole life. One of the hardest parts for me is falling asleep at night, when all the worries of the day attack you with no mercy.

At this time, I use a little strategy I call “upgrading” my brain. 

I pick one aspect of myself that I feel deserves some betterment or attention— for example, my self confidence, my attitude towards my work or a specific project, my relationship with food (really anything!)— and I will upgrade it using the good things that I did during the day. 

By that, I mean I will go through all the good things I did that day— such as held a door for someone, bought my friend a coffee, complimented someone, or anything of the sorts. It can be something major or something teeny weeny.  The good things I do to help others then come full circle as I apply them to myself and “upgrade” some part of me that needs a little more love. 

It may sound dumb, but it has been a mindfulness practice I have used for years to calm myself down and get me feeling excited to get up and face yet another day struggling with mental illness. It also has made me more aware of being kind and considerate of others. I feel more inclined to be positive and helpful. 

Let me know if you try it or if you like it! As always, strategies don’t always work for everyone, but I thought I’d share something that helps me in case it may help even one other person. ",04Oct2018,1
19,"So I've been struggling on-and-off with depression since I was diagnosed when I was 14. I'm 18 now and going through my freshman year of college and my anxiety lately has been pretty bad and I've been having what I think are manic episodes so I decided to schedule an appointment with my school's free therapy program to try to see what's up.

So I got my initial screening with this lady and she was super nice and recommended that I see a psychiatrist that works at my school's health center and gave me a referral letter so that I could see them sooner.

In my next session, I got a man who looked like he was recently graduated, and he asked me the typical questions that a therapist does. However, after hearing my questions and talking for a little bit, he said something that took me by surprise.

He told me that the reason I'm feeling the way that I am is because I like the idea of me being depressed and sad. I told him that that isn't true at all, and he went on to explain that I seem to be associating myself with depression and anxiety, because I described it as ""my depression"" and ""my anxiety"" and said things like ""I have depression"".

When he said this, I almost immediately broke down. Why would I want to feel like this? Why would I want to have mental breakdowns anytime any inconvinience in my life happened? Why would I want to ignore going out with my friends because I felt like everybody judges me and hates me?

Then the meeting ended and he asked me when I wanted to reschedule. I awkwardly told him to fill me in whenever he had an opening and I now have an appointment with him again in about 2 weeks.

This whole thing happened yesterday and since I have been a total mess because I now feel like this is all my fault and that everything is in my head. So my question is: Is it worth it to continue meetings with the same therapist? Because I feel worse now than I did before the meeting and I feel like I've lost what little hope I've had for my future happiness and that the silver lining that's kept me afloat has gone away. Because if this is what most therapists do and it helps other people then I'll keep going and hope that it works eventually, but it seems like a weird approach.",04Oct2018,1

23,"I’m very heartbroken and confused about the whole situation, but I’ll start from the beginning.


I’m a 16 year old who’s been caring for this cat since August 2012, I noticed a few months ago he started coughing and I kept complaining to my mother that he kept doing so but she insisted that they were hairballs. Every time I said this, I would get shut down with that same exact answer.

Last week on I believe Monday or Tuesday, I noticed his right ear seemed a little lower and he would periodically shake his head like he was trying to dry off (can’t think of a better way to describe it) but not after getting wet, just randomly. I began seeing articles online that this could be ear mites, so I told my mom that we need to take him to the vet tomorrow, she told me we would and we never went. I noticed the same behavior and finally took charge and told her that he needs to go to a vet right now. We took him the following day after I was finished with school.


The day I took him I noticed he didn’t come to the door like he usually does and he seemed to be hiding or sleeping somewhere I couldn’t find him. He does this sometimes so I didn’t think of it much. After making the sound that usually attracts his attention, I took him with us to the vet.


The vet checked him out and confirmed that my suspicions of his coughing were not “hairballs”, they were coughs. He checked his breathing and the doctor said it was a little raspy but not too bad. He recommended an anti-inflammatory shot that we ended up giving him and he also said that there were no ear mites. 


I was finally relieved because I thought it would be over now and I was willing to take extra care of him, unfortunately it got even worse. Around 10pm I noticed he was having trouble breathing, it seemed like he was gasping for air and I got seriously concerned.

I kept telling my mom that this doesn’t seem right but she once again, tried to write it off as “Oh, it’s probably just a side effect of the shot, it’s an anti-inflammatory it should work”. I waited around 8 minutes until I noticed he went into my sister’s room, and tried to stay in there. 

My sister wouldn’t comply saying the cat was fine but I wanted him down here in my room to monitor him, but she wouldn’t let me she said if he wants to be there let him. I kept fighting my case but nobody in my house was on my side. Eventually she said “I think the stuff is working, he’s coughing something up”. He wasn’t coughing though, it was more like a yellowish, mucus but also similar to when an animal is foaming I guess. That’s when he came down, tried to lay down, then fell onto his side. 

I immediately forced my mom to get in the car and I tried to rush him to the emergency animal hospital. During the whole car ride I stayed with him trying to comfort and do whatever I could. He eventually stopped responding 5 minutes before we got there and all I could do was watch him and comfort him until his dying breathe. I tried to rush him inside and I told them to do immediate CPR, but after 3 rounds of CPR they told me he was responsive and he was gone.


I’m really confused and upset here, I don’t know if I should blame anyone, like myself, my family, or the vet. His death just didn’t feel right to me, I don’t know if the vet wasn’t being a good vet and should’ve done a more thorough checkup as how do you miss something like that as a vet? The emergency doctor told me that there could’ve been an underlying heart disease or fluid in his lungs that only an x-ray would see. 

This has been bothering me for a while, it’s starting to subconsciously affect me a lot, I don’t know if I could’ve done any better or if the vet was being careless by not noticing this. My sister wants to sue the vet but I can’t even figure out if it was the vet’s fault or if it was coincidence that the day he passed was the same day of the shot they gave him. I just really want a do-over of everything because I feel like if I had manned up sooner I could’ve saved him. He was 10 years old officially but may have been older.  ",04Oct2018,1

This camping trip I'm going on with my class next week, however, is going to be about five hours from home. So, obviously, it won't be so easy to escape if I start having a panic attack.

In class one time, barely 14 years old freshman year, me and my buddy were joking around. I had this bigass sweater on, and pajamas, and I said to him holy shit i could totally masturbate right now and no one would know . We thought it was hilarious, and I tried, but couldn't get turned on because i was in a classroom and nothing could do it for me lmao. I'm pretty sure i was hard , but at 14 thats not a surprise. We thought the whole thing was hilarious for some reason.

Anyway, I stopped and we laughed about it. That was 10 years ago, have never done anything like that before or since. It popped in my head the other day for the first time and it's been driving me crazy. I feel like some sort of weirdo even though i was so young. Can't get it off my mind. I know it was extremely wrong and disrespectful, I've never acted like a pervert in my entire adult life, never assaulted, respectful to everyone. But for some reason it's still fucking with me really bad.",04Oct2018,1
26,"Hi, I'm a student and I'm experiencing something irritating that's been happening for a few days. I keep starting to self-doubt myself on the littlest things, like if I fulfilled all the requirements of my assignment or if I read that passage correctly. It leads to time-consuming and wasteful activity and I'm not sure why this is happening. Is it because of confidence? or just stress because I am sleep deprived",04Oct2018,1
27,"I've been on SSDI for 3 years for a severe chronic depression. I went in for my usual psychiatrist appointment today after not seeing him for a few months. He immediately started to pretend that he was reading notes off of his computer and said ""the last time you were here you said that you're feeling better and ready to go back to work."" At first I was confused because the last time he saw me I was at a point where I could barely get out of bed and leave the house and was suicidal. Then he said that he was ""just kidding."" After I left I realized he was deliberately screwing with me. I've been with this doctor for the past year but now I'm starting to have serious concerns about his behavior. He's generally a bit of a jerk but this is the first time he's done something that really made me uncomfortable and seemed to be threatening my disability status. What should I make of this situation?

29,I’m at my wits end with the job I’m working at. All my clients are happy. They constantly come back and ask to see me specifically. But for whatever reason behind the scenes I can’t seem to keep my coworkers and boss from not being angry. I know I make mistakes but it’s gotten worse over time. It’s now to the point where once  a month I’ll make some mistake or say the wrong thing to a coworker and then get screamed and cursed at by them. Yesterday was the worst it’s ever been I said something in the heat of the moment when venting to a coworker about an incident that had recently occurred involving something I was 99% sure my coworker had said. That other coworker found out and that’s when the claws came out. He told me I should kill myself that I was a liar and a coward trying to get out of trouble for a mistake I had made. That whatever I thought I heard or saw I was wrong and that he had witnessed to back him up for what he said. I even told him I was sorry maybe I did mishear him and that I’ve accepted the fact I’m always in trouble for something that I would gladly own up to my mistake but he didn’t care. He took our spat to my boss and now I’m supposed to meet with her in the next few days regarding the issue.  I only have a few months left on my contract and then I’ll never have to see these people again but the anger  and whispering behind my back is getting to be too much. After the spat with my coworker I couldn’t breathe and I started having a panic Attack and crying. I begged my coworker to let me go home cause I wasn’t doing so hot and she told me I deserved to be feeling the way I was. I’ve spoken to upper management In the past and told them I suffer from anxiety and depression and that when I constantly hear people whispering about me or making rude remarks to me that I can’t handle it and want something done about it; management just brushes me off or says they will look into it but it still happens. I’m mentally worn thin and I’m scared to show up to work half the time for fear of getting screamed at not by my clients who I love dearly but my own coworkers and management. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m trying to be strong and power through but these last few months have been devastating. Please help. ,04Oct2018,1
30,"I kept this secret for years and finally told my therapist about it when I was sixteen, who then told my parents. Since then I’ve been told a million different things about the situation to the point where I’m more confused than ever about it. Here’s what happened:

When I was eight years old, my parents went out of town, along with my aunt and uncle. So it was me,, my two teenage brothers, my nine year old cousin, and her two teenage brothers, all staying at my house. Things went well the first night. Me and my nine year old cousin slept on an air mattress in the living room while the boys slept in my brothers room. On the second night, however, me and my cousin were woken to the sound of shouting, and sat up to see her brother (not the oldest one, we’ll just call him B for now) running down the hall, ass naked. That was pretty disturbing but we thought whatever, they’re just goofing off, and went back to bed. Things went fine for the next day or two (I think my oldest brother gave B shit for what he did). Then, the day before our parents were going to be back, me and my cousin were having fun singing karaoke, when B walked up the stairs and sits in the living room watching us. After we finish the song, he asks if we want to play a game. We say sure. So he tells us the rules are this: we sing the songs, and for every wrong note he hears, we have to take off our pants. We don’t think much of it and say ok. So we sing the first song and when we’re done, he says he heard ten wrong notes, so we have to take our pants off and pull them back up in front of him ten times. We laugh, but I remember feeling uncomfortable and kind of awkward as we did so, because a part of me knew what we were doing was inappropriate. After the next song, he decides we hit to many wrong notes to count, so we have to sing the next song in our underwear. At this point I know it’s wrong, but he’s older than me and I was supposed to do what people older than me want, at least that’s what eight year old me thought. We get about halfway through the next song when my oldest brother (we’ll call him C) walks up the stairs and starts shouting at B, wanting to know what the hells going on. I remember C telling us to put our pants back on, but I don’t remember what C did to B or how B tried to defend himself. I do remember, however, C telling me and my cousin never to tell anyone about it, because we’d all get in trouble. So, we never did. Not until I was sixteen and my therapist coaxed it out of me. 

It still fucks me up to think about it, but what bothers me the most is the different reactions I’ve gotten from mental health professionals that I’ve told. My first therapist, the first one I told this to, told me point blank that it was sexual abuse and that what B did was wrong, and that C was wrong in telling us to keep quiet about it. I’ve been told by other therapists ive seen since that it was just kids being kids and I shouldn’t feel upset about it, or that he was just a teenager exploring his new feelings and that it wasn’t sexual abuse, that all teenagers did things like that. I’ve gotten so manny conflicting responses about it that I don’t know what to think about it anymore. Was it really sexual abuse, or was I just over reacting to something innocent? I’ve gone back to not talking about it because people just shut me down and it’s just destroyed all the work me and my youth therapist did to help me come to terms with it. 

So I guess I want to know, is what I experienced actually sexual abuse?",04Oct2018,1
31,"He is 28 male. He was an honors student in high school, and all around was a very intelligent guy growing up. Understood things really quickly, was always extremely logical, and was always described to be very smart. Lately, he has been experiencing memory loss, trouble focusing, and a slew of other small signs that his mental health is not right. He recently re enrolled in community college, and the first week assignment he received in his biology course of 6 pages of information was too much for him. He could not keep up with the reading, and was overwhelmed at how much information he was expected to retain. He also has episodes of depression, loss of drive, and told me he was becoming convinced all of these symptoms are signs he will not be mentally present when he is older. But I am afraid that is happening now! How can I get him help? Does he need it? He forgets little things like things I say in conversation, and sometimes asks me about things I have already mentioned to him many times. He always loses his keys, forgets where he parked, and generally just seems to be a lot less cognitively able recently.

32,"I have no social skills and talking to people doesn't really help because it all ends in pleasant smiles, politeness and then never seeing each other again. Rejection hurts like a heated iron rod. Don't tell me to join a club or volunteer, done that dozens of times the result was always the same. My face is very blank most of the time, have a really hard time smiling even when I'm happy (except when I find something funny). I have no idea what to talk about with anyone, no idea how to react or what to say in different situations. Emotions don't come naturally for me, because I've repressed them my entire life (I'm in my 20s) to cope with others disapproving of them and making fun of me (especially laughing when I smiled as a kid). I have problems with trusting people and can't relax next to anyone - I always come up with hundreds of ways they could betray me. This was probably the result of my nearly decade long isolation from the outside world by playing video games non-stop, as I used to be weird, but still had friends for a bit back then.. 

Is there a book of how to learn to be social from the basics? Because most of them just say to 'put yourself out there' but how is that helpful when you have no basic skills to begin with? I try to talk, but it always end up awkward as hell and afterwards people just tend to avoid me. I'm afraid I might develop schizophrenia because of this, please help!",04Oct2018,1
33,I have mild depression and I was feeling down in the dumps today. I started thinking about the universe and how it doesn't care what happens to people. It's not a fair system because every single person has problems and many have had severe depression much longer than I have for like 10 years! My desire is to find a way to alleviate the pain of depression for others in any way. It sounds like a silly question because I can barely help my own depression but the random chaotic nature of the universe and how some people are cursed while others are blessed makes me really want to help people tackle their issues. I'm still a young dude 23 yrs old but this is the perspective of the world I currently have and I wish it were different.,04Oct2018,1
34,"Hey I posted this in r/depression but thought I should post here as well. So I've had both depression and anxiety for 7 years now and recently it's gotten very bad. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything and can barely get off my couch. 

On top of this I've been dealing with some health issues recently and my doctor doesn't know what's going on. I've been thirsty and lightheaded 24/7 and it's been making me miserable. My doctor thinks it's either due to a medication I'm taking, she thinks it could be Diabetes Insipidus and she's also wondering if I have POTS but I still need testing done. I've also been having issues with sleep and having no energy even when I do get sleep. I take 1 mg of Xanax a night which could be the cause of feeling groggy in the morning and I would like to get off of it or on a different medication.

I also live in a pretty toxic environment right now. My brother used to physically abuse me as a child and my parents pretty much just let it happen and even threatened me that if I told anyone something bad would happen. He doesn't physically abuse me anymore but he's is verbally abusive along with my parents. My parents look at me like the black sheep of the family for having depression and anxiety, they make me feel like a failure.

I also don't have a lot of support besides my doctor and therapist and I don't have a lot of friends who could help me get away from my family.

36,"This is going to be like vomiting all of my emotions down onto something tangible, so excuse any hard to read sentences or bad spelling as I'm also on mobile.

Ablut half a year ago, I was dealing with a small bout of what I'll call mild depression just for the sake of attaching a name to the feeling. But essentially, I was essentially unfeeling for the most part, and sent myself into a self-destructive spiral for a while, letting my grades (sophomore on high school at the time) suffer, and forcing myself to interact with more and more random people out of the fear of losing anyone. I eventually fell out of that spiral, and in an effort to try to undo some of the damage I did to friendships and others who relied on me, I mentally chose 5 people whom I deeply cared about and made an internal promise to give my lives for them. The big issue was that I never really fell out of the pit of unfeeling and numbness that I had fallen into.

A bit later, the symptoms of that new situation I'd put myself into started to manifest, especially over the summer. I stopped putting much work into bettering myself and preparing for the new school year, and instead spent more time being available 24/7 on discord, hangouts, and for certain clubs in the event that anybody from the five that I had chosen would need me. I began to sacrifice sleep for the sake of trying to ""help"" others, as I'd convinced myself, and tried to make it a habit of contacting them often due to both a worry that they might leave me and also due to that feeling that I had go be there and give my life for them. 

Recently, this has began to take an even greater toll on my mental health than ever before, and I've essentially lost touch with most of reality due to this false idea that I'd give up my lives for others and not care for myself. I've only really succeeded in not being able to care for myself, since I now barely have any motivation to get up in the morning and consistently find excuses to procrastinate or even skip homework entirely. I've lied to my psychiatrist telling her that I've felt relatively happy since school started, whereas I'm suffering more and more ever since. And to tell her that I'd lied in the first place makes me feel like I won't be believed or that I can't be trusted in the first place.

I'm starting to go (and there's really no other way I can think of to phrase this) crazy right now, trapping these thoughts inside me and doing my best to pretend that I'm fine. I'm actually the ""weird kid"" at school, mostly by choice, but I've progressed to the point where most of the weirdness now comes from a lack of self-control and no sense of self-preservation, leading to me doing whatever comes to mind first. This impulsive behaviour now leads me to continue spiraling out of control and to become more and more destructive with what seems to be no way out.

I really need help, but I don't know how to get it. I'm worried that I'll push away any friends by asking for help, simply since I've been noticing myself getting more pretentious and possessive lately, and I'm concerned about telling my psychiatrist because I'm afraid that suddenly revealing a lot of what's actually going on might make me seem like a liar. I don't know where to go from here.",04Oct2018,1
37,"We found out Tuesday (10/2) what's going on after a lot of testing. He's been acting more and more erratic and out of control the past few months, can't remember anything that's not written down, can't follow a conversation, and is having bad almost temper-tantrum like episodes (he was mad my boyfriend's laundry was in the wash when wanted to use it so he pounded his fist on the lid until there was a dent - 10 minutes later he had zero recollection of doing it or being mad). The brain scans show his brain's blood vessels are considerably shrunken.
He has alcohol induced dementia (there are 3 stages ages he's in stage 2) with early onset rapid advancing Alzheimer's. He was fine at the start of the year and the doctor is really concerned at the speed of his decline. She said he's done in 9 months what most people do over the course of 5-6 years.  He's had to stop his job today and he hates that. The absolute worst of it is how scared he is about the whole thing. It breaks my heart to see him cry. 

A little back story: 2 years ago my mom got really sick (dead for a total 17 minutes on the table from 3 crashes sick) and asked my boyfriend and I to move in with her since my personal health wasn't great at the moment either. So she got a house big enough for all of us, we all chip in with everything and now everybody has support too - since then she's had two more episodes that would have resulted in death if she lived alone. My dad also moved in when we moved - the kicker there is my parents had been divorced for 15 years at that point, but my dad was really struggling to control his bipolar disorder and his paranoid schizophrenia (he takes all his meds like he's supposed to) and live on his own. My mom still loves him even if she doesn't want to be married to him so she took him in. Add in our 6 cats, 3 dogs, and 1 lizard our house is full but also full of love and support and equal contribution to the household upkeep. This might be too much to add. I just wanted to paint the whole picture of his situation and I'm a little frazzled.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice. ",04Oct2018,1
38,"Every since I heard of it, it all started to make sense. Ever since I was around 3-4, I would have a lot of unusual behaviors nobody could explain. I have a history of trauma.

I am in and out of a daydream all day, every day. What actually happens around me is choppy, as in, I am phasing in and out of the real world, all I remember is highlights. My memory is horrible for that reason. I can't even remember what I eat 3 hours ago, it's all fuzzy, but my daydreams are so clear in my mind. 

I have been daydreaming about the same handful of characters for over 9 years, every single day. I feel like I know them better than I know any real life person. All of the characters I created are representative of different parts of my personality or what kind of person I want to be. Like if need to be social, I can call I feel attuned to them and as if they are part of me, and I can ask them what to do if I need help with a perceived threat. I don't think I have multiple personalities, I feel like I or someone I know would have noticed by now.

Some people I live close to find my behavior unsettling. Sometimes, I'll be ripped from what I'm doing by this irresistible urge to basically exit reality at complete random. I have been known to pace the floor, walking in circles endlessly. Sometimes I am so trapped in my daydreams, I'll walk in circles for over 2 hours in the living room. When I ""come to"" I don't sense any passage of time. It's less like a daydream, but more a powerful trance. I'll speak, I make faces, I will swing my limbs wildly, and it's very hard to break out of. 

The smallest little sensations or thoughts will trigger vivid daydreams that go on for a couple minutes or hours. Fear and stress are the biggest triggers. When I feel even a little fear, I shut down and lose sight of reality completely. Imagine if everything around you just froze, like your brain hit the pause button, you can't move, you can't speak, you nearly stop breathing entirely, you stop being aware of everything that's happening, you feel nothing and your thoughts cease. You can see things scary happening around you, but your brain stops processing any of it. I got scared by a loud noise, and my boyfriend saw me freeze. He started begging me to say something for minutes but all I felt was the cold, gray void when my consciousness used to be, it took all my strength to come back. It might be some kind of coping mechanism my mind has for coping with stress.

I don't know, I just feel like I had to get this out there.

TL;DR: I frequently go into a sort of trance as a coping mechanism regularly for long periods of time. These daydreams are very powerful, I do a lot of strange repetitive motions, I talk, and make faces. I see the same handful of people in my daydreams, all having some tie to me and feel like part of me. The ""pull"" the daydreams have is so strong, the right word is more like ""possession."" Like if I feel scared to talk(I suffer from social phobia), I can summon up the strength of one of my characters in my daydream to get through it.",04Oct2018,1

I planned writing a blog a long time back but couldn't gather enough courage to share my story. I'm a 24-year-old girl suffering from depression , anxiety , social anxiety , personality functioning flaw and borderline personality disorder. I'm undergoing treatment since a year. I consulted a lot of psychiatrists before settling down on one. There is so much I want to share with the world like my first session with a psychiatrist , fight with the pills , side effects of the pills ,  the whole journey from knowing nothing to googling and digging deep into the pills and illnesses &amp; the final relapse.

&gt;**DEPRESSION**  Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistently low mood and a feeling of sadness and loss of interest.

Sadness, feeling down, having a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities - these are symptoms familiar to all of us. But, if they persist and affect our life substantially, it may be depression.I didn't realize this for a long time or I didn't want these tags to be associated with me. I battled with these feeling for years thinking that may be this my nature , may be I was born like this only , may be I'm not like others but when these symptoms grew and started affecting my daily routine then it rang a bell in my head and I started thinking about these as a big problem.

I have a real weird personality. I'm a person who loves having different hairstyles from waist long hairs to pixie ( all according to my moods and impulsive behavior) with shades of all kinds of colors from red , copper to blond. Getting crazy tattoos all over my body just because I want something new to obsess over . I carry a total of 10 tattoos right now. I'm a complete shopaholic , I shop to make myself happy , on days when real depression strikes and I have the courage to fight back , I go and shop.

I never shared my thought processes with my friends or family . I always had a different mindset. I have an aggressive personality &amp; I'm  really rigid with my thinking. Yes, I'm an introvert but at times i switch my self to be an ambivert . I prefer having few people around me , few true friends are better than many fake friends. I like to keep things to myself and I talk to myself a lot in my head , its like I'm my own best friend , its weird  but actually its pretty awesome. People tell I'm quite stubborn which I believe I'm. I'm really an impulsive decision maker. These qualities define me.

My journey ,  it all started with basic feelings which every one of us experience often in our life but with depression these feeling are persistent and they grew inside you without you even realizing.  Sadness , emptiness , not wanting to wake up , not wanting to talk to people , not to face people , zero appetite , sudden burst of crying , locking myself in a room for days , sleepless nights  these are some basic feelings I experienced in my case. These feelings lasted for years and I kept pushing these on until one day when I couldn't bear them anymore and then I decided I need help , some professional help.",04Oct2018,1

45,"Gonna try and make this quick with no obsolete details. AMA.

So I have been diagnosed with BPD and I don’t think it’s responsible for this but anyway, here goes.

I’ve always avoided relationships because I was afraid of expressing my emotions. I was always very scared of rejection up until 9th grade.

Around the end of 9th grade I decided not to pursue relationships because they would inevitably fail once I moved to college. Once I got to college, I decided I would try my hand at dating. I messed up a bunch and got really weird and essentially was kind of r/niceguy material. 

Things went on and I ended up joining a group at the school. I thought one of the girls was interested despite her denying it (she later confirmed I had been correct) but I wasn’t particularly interested in her. Things went on and the people from the group kept hinting at the both of us getting together.

I think this led to me thinking I had feelings for her or that I had a chance with her. I’ve always been told that you’re supposed to “love someone through thick and thin” and as a result when she told me she wasn’t interested anymore I kept chasing after her. That was the “cute” and “romantic” thing to do. 

Long story short, a month or so after getting rejected I snapped and went more or less crazy and was more and more unpleasant with my entourage. Eventually, after months, me and the girl started dating. 

She was my first girlfriend and it lasted two or three weeks (depending on how you count it) before I realized I had been going crazy all that time. 

Upon learning that I broke up with her and felt fine. I actually felt amazing for the first time in forever (not for hurting her, but because I felt good about myself and felt complete). During the time between my first move on her and our breakup (7ish months) I underwent group therapy for Personality Disorders and briefly took medication for depression which I quickly stopped. 

Basically, now I’m in a position where I truly believe I like a girl, and that she likes (maybe liked at this point) me back. Problem is, I’m having problems with my family (BPD will do that) and I am terrified I’ll end up hurting this new girl, or that I’ll drag her into my drama.

She’s really amazing and I don’t want her getting caught in the crosshairs of my unstable life/brain. 

So, what do?",04Oct2018,1

I realized that I was only using other people to build up my ego or for some benefit to myself. But near the end of the shroom trip I felt happyness for the first time, and empathy. I felt that I wanted to change for the better and not have such a cynical and careless attitude. And now I want as much of it as I can get. It was such a wonderful feeling to talk to a friend afterwards and actually care about him, to share his joys and hapiness. I don't understand how or why i wasn't self aware. Maybe I didn't know what good really is?

But now I'm scared. I become much less empathetic when the mushrooms wear off, but I still feel a small twinge of empathy. I notice that I smile more and try to make people feel better about themselves, and do small things like buying food for people. I don't want those old though patterns to return. I truly want to change, but it's so hard for me to understand now how to have meaningful interactions with people. My whole life I've only thought about my own ideas while someone else was talking, and eventually either waited or interrupted to say what I was thinking. I catch myself now where I used to say the truth to someone's face with complete disregard for their feelings. I only viewed relationships as black and white. if something happened that was bad in the relationship, that person was gone for good. 

Can I become normal? I really want to feel emotions and care for other people. It brings a new dimension to my life that I never though existed. I realize that life is better when you don't only care about yourself. But I still tend to slip back into old habits of thinking once I'm sober. I'm very lost now ",04Oct2018,1
48,"I prefix this by saying I was kind of a emotionally detached teen and child, these fantasies are rare if come at all by this point. I've spoken once to a counselor a little bit about these thoughts, but haven't talked about the entirety of them. I would say they started around 16, around one of the lowest points in my life. I grew up in a very hostile home life that continued until I was about 18, and have now accepted a lot of what happened since I've moved out and grown up a bit, but growing up I was very angry/depressed/unattached. Currently now, I involve myself in BDSM pretty regularly when I do have sex, but I rarely feel comfortable being intimate with other people. My counselor from what we briefly talked about said that it might be something relating to wanting to connect with people on a closer level.

~Warning, I'm just going to be blunt and graphic.~
These fantasies would consist of me digging my hands into someone's stomach and basically just feeling their insides, they wouldn't be in any pain, usually the body would just be a inanimate body. As for the cannibalism fantasies, those consisted of me again not so much hurting the other person but just the idea of destroying something like that so completely and also just the ingesting of human flesh was something that made my mouth water. Another concerning fantasy that I've only had once, but that has stuck out specifically was when I was dating my first boyfriend and I had a nightmare one night where I saw him having sex with a living corpse.

&gt;**Taking a first step is a hardest part to begin your journey towards change but once we take that one step it turns your life in a better direction and the first step for me was visiting a psychiatrist.** 

All of us are somewhere reluctant to visit a psychiatrist , so was I. It took me weeks to prepare myself to go out and seek help , talking to a complete stranger about my problems , feelings and illness especially if you have never let anyone enter into your zone before. But this is important and I realized it before it was too late and thus my journey toward the change began.

When I decided to come out and meet a professional , the most difficult part was finding a doctor with whom you actually feel comfortable. Since I have started my treatment I have been to 5 psychiatrists &amp; Psychologists until I found the perfect one.

From my experience I realized few things one should keep in mind before meeting a psychiatrist. We need to be open about sharing our problems without any fear of being judged , doctors never judge you. Never hide any of your feelings or emotions from doctors , you never know what can help them to treat you better. Always have faith in your doctor , they are professionals and they are there to help you.

When I started looking for help , I met doctors who took just 15 minutes to diagnose me with *Obsessive Compulsive Disorder* , some said its **just** *anxiety* ,  some said yo*u should have come to us earlier*. Some of the doctors declined treating me without my parents.In my initial days I met doctors they prescribed me handful of anti-depressant and that's it they had no interest in my past , my present nothing . They just gave me pills and I took them , felt worse than ever **but never lost hope.**

But then I gave up because I thought if this is how the treatment works , I don't want to continue and then one day when I had a real downfall I met a doctor , who is still treating me and he is the best I have met so far . We had a 1 hour face to face session in which I shared every aspect of my life with him . Yes, this is difficult to do but it is the most important thing.Remember , change doesn't happen overnight , it take months to change without us feeling but its people around who see and understand these changes.

After our session , he was really supportive , calm and he just told me that "" Tanvi ,  it's just a chemical imbalance in your brain."" I was really relaxed after that , he also gave me pills but they were far better than what I took before and so my treatment began.

Its has been more than a year , I have had variety of anti depressant , some made me feel good some made me worse but it's just ups and downs , your doctor is always there for you. There were times when I was asked to get hospitalized , I had seen worst days while undergoing treatment , medicines , CT Scans , MRI and what not just to find the actual problem.

Always remember ,the most important thing while taking a psychiatric treatment is patience. You need to give yourself and your doctor some time. Any disorder cannot be diagnosed in few minutes , it take months to diagnose your actual problems and while this time all your doctor wants from you is your patience. It took my doctor almost a month to diagnose me with ***Endogenous Depression*** *&amp; almost a year to* ***diagnose Borderline personality disorder.***

&gt;*Some people become depressed after losing a loved one, ending a relationship, or experiencing a trauma. However,* ***endogenous depression*** *occurs without an obvious stressful event or other trigger. Symptoms often appear suddenly and for no apparent reason.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Borderline personality disorde****r is a mental illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships. People with borderline personality disorder may experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from a few hours to days.*

There are time when we lose hope , give up our faith on doctors and treatment and want everything just to end but this is the time when we must understand this is a part of our journey. We get better , but the change is like one step at a time , when I look back I realize I have changed for better. Several small steps make up for big change .

&gt;*Patience is the key.*

I’ll be sitting around, minding my own business - nothing in particular on my mind or bothering me, then this feeling starts to creep up on me. It starts with uncomfortable breathing, my stomach turning and eventually I’m struggling to get a breath in otherwise - it’s to the point I’m usually sick to my stomach (literally running for the bathroom) I know exactly what it is when I feel it - but am afraid to call it an anxiety attack because...there’s no trigger? There’s not a reason for me to feel this way? It happens at home, in the car, at work - any time it feels the need to pop up and throw me off balance it seems. 

But when it happens it feel like it will never end, in reality it’s only a few minutes long - if that.

Now, this has become a constant. If I think about who I am for even a second, everything gets confusing. It seems as if I'm not or am not supposed to be a part of this, that I'm just some sort of empty shell. I don't feel that I have a personality. Everything seems fake. I don't know how to sit or talk because I can't understand how *I* should do these things. I googled this a bit and most answers were about social pressure pushing us to not be ourselves, or us becoming *too* self-aware. Or maybe it's a mental health condition? This year I graduated and got into a new school, so there have been changes to my life. Maybe I was used to being a certain person at my old school and now my brain is confused about what to be with all these new people around. But I felt this way before, too. Now it's just gotten worse. Perhaps it's just me becoming more self-aware because of my age?

60,"I am unsure how to begin, but brief about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a mess in my youth, half way houses, trouble etc, never got into drugs or drinking but did have a child young but her mother cheated then moved away, was sometime before we reconnected (she wanted child support and that was fine) but by this time I had moved to another country to get myself out of the existence I lived in. And this was going well, great career, started a family etc, all awhile building a long distance relationship with my eldest (not easy as they kept moving around).

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward some years later, my eldest has attempted suicide due to many things but one being Aspergers making it hard for her young mind to cope with teenage hormones, so I made a choice to return to the US, to help her. I had to change careers, and try starting from scratch, brought my young family over and at first seemed all was fine. Eldest was getting better and I started a new career. We were living in a one bedroom share house (not eldest but other two children and missus) but we had to go with lease, and thought be fine until I did the right thing which in the end screwed me.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss was sexually harassing a staff member, I don't mean joking or compliments, I mean rubbing up on her, saying things that even my really unfiltered mind wouldn't consider saying. So when she had enough of crying end of most shifts, she wanted to report it, but scared and knew I had witnessed it myself and I wrote up a report of only what I saw and how I observed it made her feel. After an odd and longish process he was let go - this would be the beginning of my downfall. A relief GM was sent from corporate, and they would go at me hard on everything, I mean even following policy - suddenly policy would change. I discovered after overhearing something that due to me backing my co-worker they considered me a trouble maker and wanted me out. So they found a small thing (Arguing) and put me on administrative leave, I tried fighting but it only made it worse and I was harassed etc. By the end, doing the right thing costed me a good job. It took me time to find another (not having a lot of work history in the country and not going into the field I once was in made it harder). I finally landed a great one - but starting from the bottom as most do. We had to move out of the place and for the past 6 weeks been living in a hotel, a nice one but I owe them money as its expensive but they been ok about it for now. I cannot afford to pay that (way more than rent and bills) and save for an apartment.

I am at my wits end, everyday trying to find a solution, how to make enough to get into a place and make sure my family is safe, I apparently make too much for assistance yet...sigh. I do not know, I am not even know why I am here but to reach out to people, I have no friends, no actual family. I am lost and frightened for my family. Such wonderful children and I have done nothing but let them down; I told missus to take them back if got ticket money and she can start a new life with someone useful and I got berated.

Do you believe that general absent-mindedness, lack of observation and awareness of your surroundings is something that can be improved upon?

I’ll give you some background.

I am a 22 year old male, I’m creative and contentious (temperamentally)

What I’m struggling with is maturing properly, and finding a path in life, the chaos of my mind is drowning me.. 

I’ve got a great job for my age, making good money, it feels like all my material needs are being met, but psychologically I’m broken.(maybe, idk)

I grew up overprotected, but this didn’t stop me from exploring the world. Maybe a bit **too** much. 

In the last few years I’ve changed from a curious, creative butterfly type teenager ready to take on the world-
-to a depressed, anxious, angst ridden adult scared of his own self.

My temperament has led me to search for the answer, but I’m afraid I’ve searched too much...hurting myself.
I’ve a history with psychedelics, studied the mind extensively, deconstructed/reconstructed religion and myth in my mind to make sense of it, read the great psychoanalysts books searching for meaning. 

But I’m still lost, I’m stuck alone feeling like I’m spinning my wheels in life and not getting anywhere. 

I’m afraid all the potential I felt I had as a kid is being threatened by this stage of my life and I’m digging myself a bigger hole.

So what I would like to do is **stop** thinking so much....and **start** acting.

I’ve talked to psychiatrists and therapists, but in the end it wasn’t that useful, they would end up simply giving me stimulants (bad idea) or going in circles over things we’ve already unpacked. 

I’ve tried goal setting, I’ve even written down all the goals I want out of life, made plans and all but it still doesn’t seem like it’s worth doing...

Psychically I’m healthy, I eat well, I sleep well and on a schedule, I plan out my days in advance but it’s not helping...

70,"Hello I have the last couple of weeks started to have some very weird things going on. In late august I started to have very vivid dreams. Strange dreams which entailed anything from me killing someone to being kidnapped by small chinese girls. These dreams are extremely realistic and I remember them 100% percent after I wake up. The dreams are either very uncomfortable or very amusing, but mostly uncomfortable. This is affecting me emotionally as I have had very disturbing dreams that I can't get out of my head and the memory gets triggered by seemingly common things. I had this bizzare dream where a guy had fungus growing out of his body triggered by a parasite. For some reason whenever I smell plastic or new electronics I get the disgusting image of the guy laying there with fungi growing out his back and yellow pus seeping out of them. The dreams are not the only thing. About 2 weeks ago I started to get auditory and visual hallucinations. The visual hallucinations last less a second. They are hard to describe, but they typically go something like this. I am sitting occupied with something typically my telephone or computer, something in my side view like a plant which I have on my desk will suddenly morph into something, but they only last like 1-2 seconds. An example can be at my school when I was reading a book preparing for a test. I sit at the front row and the teachers desk there is a metal basket with ballpoint pens, calculators and other stuff which we can take as we wish. As I was reading my book the basket in my side view suddenly had little small guys grabing onto the basket like It was a jail cell. When it comes to auditorial hallucinations it is usally my parents calling out my name or subtle whispering where I can't make out what is being said. I also sometimes hear jackhammers and power tools when i shouldn't be hearing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

These vivid dreams and hallucinations are extremly frightening. The dreams which are so weird make me feel ashamed of myself. I don't know what would cause this. I don't do any recreational drugs except weed and valium. I don't drink alcohol or any caffeine. I have taken performance enchancing drugs. I did take 200mg of testosterone a week for 12 weeks in late march. From the same date to present day I have taken 300mcg a day of GHRP-2. And from late june i did a 12 week cycle of epistane 20mg and 300mg of testosterone. I also have aspergers and OCD, but never been treated for it. I was prescribed zoloft for a couple of weeks when I was 16 for my OCD, but the side effects were unbearable and it made my OCD worse so quit that.

75,"Posting for my girlfriends brother who is going through very tough times regarding his mental health. Don’t know what to do to help him as he is going through a lot and we don’t know how to help anymore. We have tried, he says he’ll get help but then refuses to and is just stringing his parents along in that sense. He is 21 years old if that matters. 

So basically what is going is that  he has a very irrational fear of asbestos and believes his home is contaminated with asbestos. This all started when paramedics and fire fighters came to the house for about an hour because he was choking. He believes the fire fighters had asbestos on their clothes and they contaminated the house. He refuses contact with any of his family as he believes they are contaminated and won’t see them and is living in a hotel and has been on and off for the past couple months. It’s really tough on his parents as he’s physically threatened his father and his mom and sister feel helpless to him. They don’t know what to do and he is showing signs of severe OCD in regards to the asbestos. He will agree to get professional help then just push it off to another time and he is very scared of contact with anyone he believes people are contaminated and asbestos is out to get him. He refuses to flush the toilet because he thinks it will have asbestos or even use a towel after he showers. It’s really bad. 

We have tried countless times to talk him out of his fear and have tried to have professionals come to the house and test for asbestos to prove there is no asbestos, but he would not let them in as he believes they are also infected.

Everything in my everyday life feels bad. Talking with people freaks me out, I suck at everything, I hate working. I'd rather die than go through the stress of buying a car, I'm not socially adept enough to get into a relationship; not that my anxiety makes that pleasent in the slightest.

I've tried to tackle the world, crack open the oyster. And all I want to do is cry and sleep hoping I won't have to wake up. What can I do if everyday life is like this? What can I do that won't result in crap or make me feel like shit? I really don't know.

77,"Throughout most of my younger years I was always  near the top of the class,but I would often find myself drifting off into daydreams during classes no one really minded however as I would always have good grades. 

As I progressed through the education system I started  doing less and less work, getting through years based off of natural ability and a reputation as a fairly clever student. 

As I began doing a levels my grades declined rapidly as a lot of additional study was required. Currently I find myself unable to push myself through even the most basic of maths or physics study for anywhere longer than 10 minutes ,before I find myself daydreaming. My mental health also began to suffer and I have recently been diagnosed with depression. All of my friends around me are planning what they will do after the finish this academic year and I just want to get out.

80,"As the ""observer"", I don't identify with the person I'm strapped to.

I'm the king of dweebs. Only capable of awkward or more awkward, zero personality, never know what to say in basic social situations. I'm slower than my peers on situational awareness, learning things at work, common sense, and figuring out when to ask for help. I seem incapable of forming basic strategies or coping mechanisms without help, or maintaining routines in my life. I can't keep my mouth shut and only realize it seconds too late... and have extreme discomfort and difficulty in contemplating how other people see me. I see and experience my life as a long disconnected chain of events with little meaning, feel I have difficulty just corralling my own thoughts, and even if I manage to plan out my day I'd be lucky if I can actually force myself to follow the plan. I'm all enthusiasm to help or be a ""great person"" but no action. When motivation and drive do finally kick in, I think the shit I have enthusiasm for is stupid. My coworkers can fire off jokes and puns all day, and while I get them, my mind is completely blank if I ever try myself. It's like there's this inherent friction between me and the world.

Is this ""the human condition"", or is there some kind of disorder at play? I've had co-workers tell me I ""Look lost"" all of the time, and sometimes just do a thousand yard vacant stare.

When she sees me she’s usually all smiles and that makes me feel guilty. I do most of the chores for our household and I don’t think that she contributes as much as she should. She and my mother would get into shit because of that, so to mediate I would just do the chores myself. There were times in the past where I would mention that she should help and I would get the impression that she thought I was annoying and echoing our mother. I love her and so I don’t want her to feel that way about me, but that leads me to be quiet in all the instances I’d want to ask her for her.

Now I’ve stopped mentioning it, but when I do chores around the house I resent her. Sometimes to the point where i feel like I’m going to implode.

83,"I'm not sure if any of you have had an experience with counselling apps such as 7cups or betterhelp etc, but I seriously hope that you were more fortunate than me. 


I've suffered from serious depression and anxiety from childhood, and dealt with my condition by masking with hard drugs and alcohol. 6 months ago, after a suicide attempt I was detoxed in hospital and I'm currently 6 months sober of all drugs and alcohol for the first time in 10 years. Unfortunately, this means that there is nothing to take the edge off my depression, so in an attempt to find healthier ways to heal, I downloaded 7 cups and was soon connected to some ""listeners"" who are there to talk to you and listen to your concerns.


Every listener I connected to was an Indian male who had no interest in anything I was talking about and would either give one word answers such as ""ok"" or rattle off something on the lines of ""you just need to be happier"" or ""cheer up"". I can understand that these are not trained therapists and probably don't know what to say in this situation, as I found it incredibly awkward and an overall stressful experience. 


Okay, they offer a FREE 3 day trial for access to trained therapists. I will try this and see if I have a better experience...it could genuinely be a really helpful tool for me and something I might continue in the long term. I entered my card details in as you would for any free trial, and through the checkout for £0.00. Then waited to be connected to a therapist. Over an hour later...still no therapist.


Furthermore, my card had been charged £114 (nearly $150)...For a free trial.... still no therapist 

Furious I contacted 7 cups customer service about the charges and their response was basically 
""We had many people signing up who did not continue after the free trial so we now just charge them anyway so that we don't lose money"" Then they just denied taking the money at all.

85,"My mam has struggled with anxiety and OCD most of her life. She's 65 now. Ultra caring all her life, would do anything for anyone. In fact she's so over the top with friendliness it's sometimes embarrassing taking her out as she almost goes out her way to say hi to a sad faced stranger or even hug a helpful shop assistant.

Her anxiety makes her stay in the house most of the time. Usually goes to bed. She goes to see a psychiatrist ever week. She changed as a person approx 3 months ago. The psychiatrist told her she also needed to help herself. This seemed to be the downfall. The day after she rang them back and was very abusive on the phone to them. Asking why they would say such a thing.

She only had one real friend, she would ring daily. Hearing she was in bed. She said she should get out for some fresh air. My mam lost the plot and told her never to call again.

She has now disowned me. She needed to call her sister after a doctor's appointment which I picked her up from. I offered her my phone and asked if she knew her sisters number. She went crazy. Calling me all the names under the sun. Asking me why I would ask such a stupid question. Fast forward a few hours and she calls me at home. She's been thinking about it ever since and brings it up again. Wondering why I would ask such a question. To me, I was just simply asking if she knew her sisters number. To her, it was the greatest insult ever and now she has said I'm not to ring her ever again and basically I'm no son of hers.

The week before she wanted something from. Supermarket. She lives smack bang between two. Maybe 1 mile if you turn left. 1 mile to the other if you turn right. Both identical almost. She wanted a plug air freshener. I was taking her to both locations for different things anyway so to me, which supermarket we chose to buy the plug in from was irrelevant. When she asked if I could take her, I said.. ""ok, no bother, we will just pop into supermarket B""
She went off it again. Asking why I want to question her and Change her mind. She had obviously decided she was getting the plug in from supermarket A but not disclosed that info to me.
Again. That night. She rang me going off it. Telling me how I don't care about her and I think she's mental.

It's these irrational thoughts that are the problem.

What's going on ?",04Oct2018,1
86,"For background: I am 22F and finally have an appointment lined up to see a psychiatrist because there is reason to believe I have Bipolar II. 

I can name a handful of times where I’ve experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. The very first time was when I was maybe 3 or 4 years old and I kept hearing my name being called but no one was calling it. Sounded clear as day and my mom would just say my ears were playing tricks on me. 
When I was around 7 or 8 years old I woke up suddenly and I just remember hearing a voice chanting. It started out slow then got more rapid and aggressive saying over and over “I know you want me I Know You Want Me IKnowYouWantMe IKNOWYOUWANTME IKNOWYOUWANTMEIKNOWYOUWANTMEIKNOWYOUNEEDMEIKNOWYOUNEEDME” and it sounded so clear and enunciated and like the person was right beside me saying these things 600 times over. My parents are extremely religious and they said that it was the devil trying to break me. 

The next time I recall hallucinating was when I was sleep deprived. I don’t take it to mean anything. I was 16 and going through a massive depressive episode and would only sleep 3-4 hours a night and one night there were two people in my room with no faces. A woman in her late 20s and a 10 year old boy with a 1920s character. I wasn’t scared. I tried talking to them but they didn’t respond. 

Those times I wasn’t taking any medications or smoking weed. I now smoke weed every night because it controls my migraines that I frequently get (triggered by bright lights). I rent a house and I was home alone last night and slightly on edge because whenever my neighbours close their car door or front door it sounds like it comes from my house and my house rattles. I did a walk around of my house and was satisfied that no one was there. I went to sleep a few hours later and was sober by then. 
I don’t remember exactly the order of events. As in, I don’t remember if my alarm woke me up first and then I saw my classes cancelled and then went downstairs to turn up the heat and then had this episode or if this episode happened before I had to be awake. I want to say the latter. 
What happened was I was awoken and my fish tank made a noise that made me think OHMYGOD THERE IS SOMEONE STANDING OUTSIDE MY DOOR AND THEYRE OPENING IT AND THEY HAVE BAD INTENTIONS and I had some sort of attack or rush where my heart was beating out of my chest, my senses were on high alert, my ears rang so loud that I could not hear a thing (I have tinnitus so that just amplified to the max), and I was paralyzed in fear. Couldn’t breathe. It lasted for a couple minutes and then I started to hear voices like before. But this time it was a group of young boys chanting something that I can’t remember. And then a white mask kept flashing in my face (it was my pillow) and it terrified me. And then another episode started again and the next voice I heard was one man chanting something. And then it went away. During these times where I was paralyzed with fear I was making a very strange noise that I have no way of recreating. It was a real noise coming from me. Almost like a humming but my mouth was open and I was repeating certain vowels? I had no control. I felt like I was being possessed even though I am non-religious and non-spiritual.

 I think what happened next was I went back to sleep, woke up from my alarm, went back to sleep, and then hallucinated again thinking that my brother was home because I heard the shower running. I was calling out for him irl but he couldn’t hear me. And then I think in my dream (but it could have been real life) I opened my door and called for him and he walked up the stairs and I saw him at the end of the hallway and he was fine, but I had no pants on (I had pants on irl) and had to go back into my room. And then I repeated that scene again where I heard water running, went to investigate and found my brother at the stair case. My brother is 2 hours away so he definitely wasn’t home. 

I can’t make any sense of this. I’m just feeling unnerved and exhausted today. ",04Oct2018,1

88,"I have strugled with a lot for a very long time.  I have seen therapists on and off since my childhood.  My general doctors have given me medication but have never properly diagnosed my mental illnesses.  Last time I went to the doctor, they said that if I want to continue my medication, I need to start seeing a psychiatrist that will dianose me and take on my medication prescriptions.  I am also a college student.  I have left college and come back over and over due to these problems.  This year I will finally be graduating with my degree.  I cannot afford to let anything go wrong so I decided I wanted to get services and testing accomodations from the services offered to students with disabilities at my college.  In order to get this approved, I need a proper diagnosis.  

I need to see a psychiatrist to continue my medication and to get an official diagnosis for paperwork.

Every nearby psychiatrist I have worked up the courage to call (that is covered by my insurance) have horribly rude front desk associates, are booked up until January, or lead you down a spiral of ""press 1 to leave a message."" 

Is there a way to speak with a licensed psychiatrist online? Or is there a way I can get these people to see me sooner?  I have exams coming up so I need that diagnosis ASAP.  ",04Oct2018,1
89,"This is my first post, so forgive me if this is in the wrong spot. Also, I will try to make it quick.

I have never been diagnosed, but I have a long history with depression/anxiety (who doesn't?), and I'm 99% sure I have BPD. I have always suffered from mental health problems, just never went to a doctor because I was afraid to and didn't know what good it would do, considering I refuse to get on meds.

So, I can remember having this happen a few times when I was younger, and then once when I was a teenager, but I was convinced it was after effects of smoking pot (which was not good for me when I was younger, it made my anxiety worse, triggered panic attacks when I hadn't had them in years, and caused me to trip like I was on meth.) And now I've been experiencing it off and on for weeks. 

I'm not sure if I'm dissociating or what, but something isn't right. Basically it feels like I'm not in my body. Kind of like I'm in a first person view of a video game, where I can't physically feel hardly anything. Kind of pins and needly, like everything is asleep. I can feel intense sensations like if I touch something cold, or I'm in the rain and getting wet, or if something hurts. But it's not enough to even cause discomfort. Because of this, I feel like all my movements are forced, because I can't tell if I'm really doing it or not. So it feels like it takes an immense amount of energy to do anything. I have sliding pocket doors in my room and went to open one today and was so rushed and forced that I hurt my finger somehow and made it bleed, but hardly even felt it.

And then because of all of that, my anxiety about it gets worse and my heart starts to feel heavy and my breathing is labored. I don't know how to describe all of this well, but something isn't right and I don't know what it is, but if you have experienced something similar I would love to hear about it.

 I've been through depression(mostly caused by a toxic relationship and broke up eventually) six months ago. I would say I'm fine now, I didn't take medications, did CBT exercises.  Before depression I've no problems with caffeine  drinks. and would drink upto 3 cups of tea a day. However, recently since that depression, it just messes me up. Just after having a cup of a tea. I soon have problems like severe attention deficit, extreme urge to fidget and move, makes me walk a lot, talk a lot.  I have a lot of problem even writing this because had cup of tea just hour before.  
It doesn't me sad or anything, I can't even feel sadness or  happiness, during this ""caffeine attack""- I would say. I'm really fine without Tea or caffeine drinks. I don't know what disorder is this called, but I'm afraid if there is some problem with me.  
Thanks.

TL;DR Caffeine causes hyper activity, fidgeting, can't study, can't calm down, urge to move hands, talk a lot. I've been through depression six months ago, now I'm fine but without caffeine.

98,"I just don't know what to do anymore. Most of my life has been struggle, as a kid I was always the ""problemed child"" the one who was talked about behind his back by the at holidays, it felt like nobody but my parents and Grandfather had faith in me. Then I want to being someone that everyone seemed proud. Now I feel nearly hopeless 

 I guess this is kinda a mix of a success story and a tragedy. Have fun

 As a child was kicked out nearly every school I was sent to because of anger issues, mostly brought on by learning disabilities in the class room (dyslexia, dyscalculia, ASD, we didn't know about these til I was much older), seven schools in total. I felt No one understood me, they thought I was a devious child just trying to get out of work. Because of this I was home schooled. Don't  get me wrong I'm thankful for it, but because of being home schooled I mostly grew up alone without friends. 
During this time I felt like I was toyed with by the people giving me medication to ""fix"" me. I hardly  even knew who the real me was through all the changes the medicine caused. So many side effects, from them causing eating disorders to depression to uncontrollable verbal ticks. I wanted to be done with it all So I slowly stopped taking it, gradually taking less and less until I wasn't taking it all without the knowledge of anyone around me.

I felt like I was finally myself.

Come 8th grade I had found a school that I felt understood me, only for a teacher I ended up on the bad side of to put a hole in the wall and blame me, getting me kicked out (long story)
In high school  I was put into a school for people  like me, those with potential who are held back by things we can't control. It was a fairly normal school, a bit small, but willing to do what needed to be done to help those in need. 

The classes were no longer the issue, my new hurdle  to climb was socializing with others. For my first semester I was mostly alone, keeping  to myself, drawing in my little note book. One day someone  attempted to bully me, they insulted me, mocked me, and laughed with their friends about  it. So what was a socially inept problemed child to do? I stabbed  him with my pencil. Stuff like that happened a few times my first two years there.
Fast forward to senior year (if I were detail every noteworthy events in high school this would be waaaay too long) I had become Student Government Association President, Set builder and designer for the drama team, assistant to the principal, head of the art team (I took up blacksmithing+getting my art in city all was a highlight) I had blossomed into someone that felt like he understood otheres and was unstoppable In his goals. That people were proud of.

 But then came my next struggle, Love. I had never had any real want to be with someone till I met her, she was something different and by what felt like divine intervention she became my high school sweetheart. If only I had known what I was getting into. She'd constantly hurt me, pull my hair, jab my sides, she nearly got us both killed by grabbing my hair and yanking  my head down while  I was driving. But I was bound with this feeling that I had never felt before, I knew I needed to escape from the relationship, but every  time I was about  to I was dragged back in. I just wanted to make things work. Our relationship continued into college 

In My first year of college I had enlisted in the SGA  here too (made it in), I was shooting for a political science degree. Classes were going well till near the end of the semester. My Girlfriend was now trying to push my towards something I never had any interest in and I made that clear. She wanted to have s*x, I know this isn't exactly something unusual, but it was something I wasn't comfortable with at all. She mocked me because I didn't  want it, she tried to coax me into it with what she thought would tempt me. She had become a sex addict. Ultimately I never gave it to her. 
Not long after this started, her mental health took a down spike. She was sent off to a few different mental hospitals. During all this time I was broken, the one thing I foolishly loved was being ripped away only to return for a few days then be shipped of to somewhere else. I felt like I had to be there for her, because if I wasn't  who would be? So I did everything  I could to help her through it in any way I could.
One of the days she was back she ran away. I panicked. I threw together a search party, we searched for hours. Finally finding  her I took her home for what is the worst night of my life. 
She had a fallout with her family and was carted off in an ambulance due to mental instability. 
Her parents then told me of how she hadn't been loyal. She had cheated on me to fulfill an addiction I refused to feed. Honestly I should have seen it coming. 

My life broke down, I dropped of college. I isolated myself from everything I could only to be blind sided  by the death of my Grandfather. The person that I truly felt like always believed in me though it all. Everything  had fallen apart. I was in a state of intense pain and grief I had never felt before. I felt myself slipping backwards down the hole it took me all of high school to climb out of. I was becoming  more violent, angry at the world, I felt alone again.

 Eventually I found refuge with one individual, a girl that I had been friends with for years. We started  hanging  out more and more to the point where we spent  nearly  every day of that summer together. It felt like through all the pain I had found the one I was ment to be with.
 I was finaly feeling myself again, I was finally feeling  happy  for the first time in what felt like so long!

She cheated on me too.

I was back where I started. I had my first true violent outburst in years. I destroyed my closet walls, shredding the skin on my fist in the process leaving me with physical scars that reflected inward. As I broke down crying,  I got a call from a friend. They needed my help with something. Honestly I don't  think I mattered  what they needed, they pulled me up and gave me something to do. I think they may have saved my life.
After that point I through my life towards my friends, refusing to let my self slip into isolation spending every moment I could with others, I was afraid to be alone.

Some time had passed and I was feeling better, but despite that it was around  the first time I noticed what felt like a dark hole bored into my chest. Thinking back I feel like the hole was always there, just not as noticeable.

I tried relationships again later only to be cheated on again. I'd write it out, but I feel it would  be redundant at this point.

All the time the hole I felt in my chest just grew.

Now come to modern day. I've lost touch with a few friends sadly. I live between two towns as I constantly drive back and forth to town I go to college in and the town my parents live in because the loneliness of living alone full time is too much for me to bare. I'm studying Aerospace technology because its interesting and lets me think while I work with my hands.

So yeah, there's my story. Up till now it is anyways. I'd  honestly be surprised if someone actually read the full thing, a bit embarrassed too haha.

Just before we moved in he had a brief relationship with a girl we used to work with, it ended badly and he took it very personally. We had to see her last week as part of a meetup, from last week till now he has been incredibly withdrawn, eating in his room not speaking much, sleeping loads.

Yesterday he missed work because he didn't feel like it/ had a minor cold, today he turned up at 11:30 and left early. He is someone who sees the world as a very fucked up place, I think because he feels messed up it gives him comfort to cast everything and everyone else in a negative light. He is very into psychedelics, which I think he finds an escape in and he took the days we had to meet up with the girl he had a relationship with.

I'm incredibly worried about him, I keep asking him how he is/ what's up and he simply won't talk back to me. I don't think he will seek help if tell him to get it, but going behind his back will could things worse. Last week we got drunk one evening and he sort of opened up, the way he spoke was incredibly dark. He mentioned (which I didn't previously know) he had self harmed in the past and the way he said it indicated it had been relatively recently. I don't think he is suicidal but he is going downhill fast and I'm going on holiday from next week.

I was planning to speak to our manager privately about this and make him aware, potentially contacting university services, but I don't know what is best.

If anybody has experience of this/ has helped someone through this in the past, please give advice; I don't know what the correct thing to do is.",04Oct2018,1
100,"Hello. I need some advice. 

I’m a 17 yr old M. I have PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Social Anxiety. 

I was diagnosed with all these mental health issues 3 years ago when I sought help. 
I no longer suffer from depression as I am out of it, however I still think I may be dealing with PTSD. 

I always “hallucinate” such as by seeing things that aren’t there, random shadow figures or some demon like creatures. I used to have voices in my head when I was 14 but my doctor said it isn’t schizophrenic/ schizo related. 

I saw myself die 3 times last year by 1) A shadow figure killing me 2) a big beast like creature (wolf like) killing me and 3) me killing my self (that 2 of the same me killing me) 

As for my PTSD. As much as I wouldn’t like to disclose what happened to me, I think it’s necessary. I was raped (by a woman) at the age of 6 and it happened for a while till I was 7 (sexual abuse) and my pants got pulled down by a group of teenagers when I was 11. 

I got extremely depressed when I was 14 because I was cyber bullied for posting YouTube videos and I was bullied severely in High school. (Physical, mental, emotional bullying.) Also at that point in time I had a very unstable relationship with my Mother as we were always arguing, almost every single day. 

Life has changed now, I am in Pre-University but my “hallucinations” are still there as I see those demon like things and I still have trouble sleeping because of this. 

The problem is, my psychiatrist did not tell me what I may be facing as I assume whatever I am seeing is viable hallucinations or psychosis. 

I would be really grateful if someone can tell me what I may be facing (like if it’s psychosis or visible hallucinations) and if it’s present in PTSD. 

Am I dealing with complex PTSD ? Also one more thing, my mom thinks I’m fine and I’m not mentally unstable since I’m out of high school where I was bullied severely and had severe mental health issues (I still have anxiety and PTSD but it didn’t drive me to multiple suicide attempts like in High School) How do I tell her that I’m still facing these issues ? (I come from a conservative Asian family)

Any advice will help me out.

Thanks in advance ! ",04Oct2018,1

102,"Tw: suicide

My feelings for this friend were always conflicted, because he had a complicated life and had made some bad decisions, but in the end I had deep empathy for him. His story was a tragedy, beginning to end. I always thought he was the kind who would continue to bounce back, who was in life for the long haul. He caught everyone by surprise when he killed himself in the past couple weeks.

Because of the nature of the relationship between my boyfriend and me, and him and my boyfriend, it wasn't really acceptable for me to befriend him. My boyfriend didn't want me to get attached to him, especially because he was getting into partying and harder drugs, questionable people and scumfucks. I was more afraid of, ""what if the wrong people realize I'm talking to him"", rather than, ""what if he needs someone to talk to"". I feel such remorse for having these feelings and never conveying them in any way, for holding back positive feelings.

It might sound delusional, but I cared about him in a way that made my heart feel warm. He had a dark sense of humor, a warm smile, and a gravelly voice. I was looking forward to spending time with him, his new girlfriend, and my boyfriend. I thought he was on the up and up. I wish we had made some plans that he could look forward to, something to keep him going. 

Now all those dreams are dead, along with his body. There's a void in my chest and stomach that just hurts. ",04Oct2018,1
103,"Practically any time that I know I have to be home alone for more 2-3 hours at a time, I get really uneasy and somewhat depressed. The problem is, due to life circumstances, It makes most sense for me to live alone in a studio apartment, so this happens quite regularly despite my best efforts to always be busy.

I hang out with friends 2-3 times a week, and hang out with my SO 2-3 times a week. I have a full time job and have work related events to attend on about a biweekly basis. I am about 45-50 minutes away from my family, and see them about once a week. I also work out and obviously have to run errands, etc. I don't see how I could add even more social stuff and I don't really want to.

Even with all of that, when I get a few free hours, I often dread being alone in my apartment to the point of almost being depressed. I'd like to be okay with living alone since my parents live far from my job, and my SO and I aren't ready to move in together for another year or so. My apartment is in a great location, in a great building, and it's not cheap to rent either. What the hell is wrong with me??",04Oct2018,1

107,"I don't know if fantasizing is the best word for this since it isn't pleasant, but I find myself constantly ruminating about tragic scenarios. My mom is traveling right now. Last night all I could think about is how she would cope if me, my dad, and my siblings were all to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. What would she do with herself the rest of her life? How would she live on? Would her life have meaning anymore? My dad left the house the other day and I didn't say goodbye. I caught myself thinking about what would happen if he were to die of a heart attack that afternoon. What would the immediate aftermath be? How would I reflect on the event years down the line? How would I cope? What lessons might I learn? I sometimes weigh various tragedies and group them into categories of a) my life can still have meaning after this, or b) that would be so tragic, I might as well kill myself afterwards. 

There's definitely an element of anxiety, but it isn't just that. It almost feels like I'm preparing for something? I would say that every day I'm mentally preparing myself somehow for all sorts of tragedies, just in case. *Not* doing this feels like I'm letting my guard down. 

I've come to realize recently that I see (or look for) signs in little things. I try to bat these thoughts away but it's hard to not engage with them. Reading stories in the same vein of ""the day my grandma died, I just knew something was wrong, I had a feeling"" have seriously spooked me. All the time I question if I'm getting that sort of supernatural-esque feeling, and if I should be doing something with it. Last words said on the way out the door, the context of situations, dreams, even the time of the year, etc. - it could all potentially mean something bad is about to happen. I'm not religious at all, so it feels ridiculous that I would be seeing/searching for signs in anything.   

Viewing the world through this lens is exhausting. I was pretty morbid as a kid, but I don't think things were ever this bad. Around the time I was 18/19 things started getting much worse. I started viewing the world as a very hostile, threatening place. People can't be trusted, bad things are happening all around me, bad things could happen to me at any moment. I have lots of fears about things that none of my friends or family members worry about - be it a family member getting attacked by a rapist/murderer, or anything related to the surveillance state and being secretly spied on. I would describe myself an extremely private, untrusting person who tries their hardest to appear open and carefree to the people around me. 

I'm not sure what to do. I've tried taking antidepressants and they really didn't do much for me except make me anxious and agitated (granted I've only tried atypical ones, but so many people in my family have responded terribly to SSRI's that I don't even want to bother trying them - being dulled in any way shape or form is an absolute hard NO for me). I worry that these thoughts and feelings are going to get more and more intense as Winter approaches. Last Winter was very hard for me. I remembered crying almost every night because I was so preoccupied thinking about stray animals. I almost felt responsible somehow, like I could fix the problem if I really wanted to and just choose to turn my attention elsewhere (I know that's ridiculous). I avoided leaving my house after a certain hour because it was easier to pretend the weather wasn't so bad if I couldn't feel it. I felt guilty and somehow wrong when I sat down to eat good food, so much so that I'd feel sick afterwards. You get the picture.

It’s not someone specific, just a random. He also has no physical absence (I don’t see him), he’s just... there. I know he’s not real but my actions still get influenced when he’s around.

When he’s absent I have an urge to impress and do everything with caution.
Sometimes I’ll even “act” for the person like I’m in a movie and I’ll do things in a really pretty-ish way (this is the best explanation I can do lol I’m not really good with words).

I hate this because I feel like I have no freedom to be myself, not even when I’m alone.

I’m even suspicious someone follows my activity on reddit and my other social accounts online to the point where I am afraid to introduce myself online, *anonymously*, and talk like a normal human being. I feel like some princess that has to be so polite and perfect all the time to not ruin her image.

Even now while I’m typing this I am thinking to myself “I wonder what he thinks about me posting this”. I’ll just avoid doing whatever will make ‘him’ think negatively about me and I will always be concerned about his opinion.

I can never feel safe and be truly myself nowhere in my life. Not even when I’m around real people, I like to distance myself from others and be by myself, but that’s not the life I desire. I used to like being social before.

But one thing that irritates me (I have done it my whole life) is I rehearse memories out loud by myself and replay the memories in different scenerios. Most often they are negative memories and I'm saying things I would have wanted to say or did say adding more emphasis on it. Sometimes I even create scenerios as ""what if this happened instead"" and play out that. None are positive emotions or memories.

I genuinely get angry and sad about it and I cant seem to realize I am doing it until I start to get angry. These memories are with strangers, family, old friends and new friends.

My only contacts are medical professionals, therapists, or distant family I don't have much to do with.

I've developed chronic pelvic pain but despite ER trips, doctor visits, and expensive physiotherapy (over $100/hour) I can't undress in front of them. I can't let them evaluate or touch the pelvic area. The fear gets too high and I experience body tremors, strong dissociation. It makes the pain worse too since that is what is causing it (anxiety, PTSD).

My therapist and I have talked about my fear of nudity before but they just say remember you are in control, doctors see it all the time etc. That isn't helpful. I don't care if doctors see it all the time, I haven't been undressed in front of someone since the last time I was forced to be more than two decades ago. My therapist always tells me just take small steps and don't overwhelm myself yet then here they are telling me to take a flying leap off the cliff since I have to just do it. Where are the small steps to that? Where is not overwhelming myself in that?

Is there any way to safely practice nudity? Some kind of therapy approach? I don't mean out somewhere like a nude beach or anything. Nowhere that I am not in control of who sees me, and nowhere with a bunch of people. Just one person. Two at most. Practicing alone isn't helpful for when I am around others because it is when it's around others that is the problem, not alone.
