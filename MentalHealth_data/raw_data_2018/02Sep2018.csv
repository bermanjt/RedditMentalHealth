0,"Violent hair-pulling, smashing their head into the wall and cutting/slicing have been popping up on my mind. The worst is I picture myself doing that to my *family*. I'm weak as hell so I wouldn't achieve any of those- and that thought angers me too.

I feel rage, guilt, sadness. I fantasize about my own neck/abdomen/legs/arms/toes/anything getting cut off. I keep all of it inside. Sometimes I'm so angry I get *horny*. No, I never masturbate.

Idk what I'm expecting with this; just wanted to put these feelings somewhere.",02Sep2018,1
1,Hey so about a year and a half ago I met my best friend. We talked on and off at first and In January we finally got close and began to talk every day. We’ve been FaceTiming every day since then (long distance friendship) whenever I can’t FaceTime due to work or family life he gets anxious and upset I can’t talk. I realize this comes off as controlling or abusive and he feels he is. I want to help him but I don’t know how. We’ve been through a lot together and I can’t imagine life without him. Any advice?,02Sep2018,1
2,"It feels like I don't matter. Like I've never mattered to anyone. Like I'm nothing, worthless, not important, even just a little. I was never good enough for my parents. Never strong enough for my siblings. I didn't mean anything to the girl who was my best and only friend from first grade all the way through my senior year. Worthless to the girl I dated for three years. Both of the places I've worked for started out treating me almost like a person, but later on shifted to treating me the same way everyone else always has.

It's been 23 years since I was born. 23 years, and I've never been good enough. I have friends now, and they care about me, but it's hard to tell if they mean it or if they're lying. I'm so tired of this feeling. I hate myself for not being enough, for not trusting anyone. The problem has to be me, I recognize that. If everyone in my life is doing this, then the problem can't be everyone else. I know I'm broken. I just don't know how to fix it, how to be a good person.

I just want to make people happy. I want to not feel alone and worthless anymore. I don't want to hate myself so much. I wish I didn't exist, that I never had. My siblings might have had a better life. My parents might have loved them more, might have been able to be good parents. I know it's not good to worry about might have beens, but I just can't stop thinking about it.",02Sep2018,1
3,"Recently I have been getting really angry and it just feels like I can't control it. Usually something small will 'start' the whole thing and make me really angry and frustrated inside. This part I don't really have an issue keeping to myself or not overreacting to but then sometimes other things keep happening and it just makes me more and more pissed off and I just don't know how to not express it but there's no way for me to express it to make me feel better without negatively expressing myself by doing stupid stuff like yelling at people, hitting things, and tossing/throwing stuff around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to do to fix this because anytime I've gotten angry like this in front of someone so far it's just been my parents and they've only seen me do this type of stuff during arguments except a few times and when it's happened during an argument they have just gotten mad at me and usually I get in trouble for it. I don't mean to do it out of disrespect for anyone and I try to only hit things that won't break so that it won't cause more problems. Other than them it's only been when I'm alone so I don't really have a reason to stop it but even after yelling/hitting stuff I still very frustrated. Such as if I have a fit (idk what to call it) and then my parents come home and do things that annoy me then I feel pretty angry/annoyed by it while usually I would barely care at all about it if I hadn't had a fit earlier. I don't know why this keeps happening and it has been happening for the past 3 or 4 months. I'm not sure if it is because of my age (I'm a 17 year old guy) or if something is wrong with me or something. Any advice or help would be great ",02Sep2018,1
4,"So, I'm a 26  yo guy, I have no job and don't feel I'm able to work a ""regular"" job. I have no friends, and I am still loving with my grandparents.  

I have been diagnosed with add combined type generalized social anxiety, and bipolar type 2. At least that was from the perspective of a psychiatrist I went to until a couple months ago.  I had a rough childhood, my parents were addicts, and there was neglect , and abuse  physical, verbal, and more.  Until my grandparents took myself and siblings in and.got custody that is. I went from being in that situation to not being a caretaker for my siblings any longer(i was the oldest) . 
That situation was rough as well . I butted heads a lot with my grandparents at that time. So i was behind in education and schooling. I was homeschooled for a while by my grandmother which was.. Not very good.  I excelled in some places but had huge gaps in my fundementals. I was then then thrown in from there in 8th grade to a Catholic high school. It was pretty traumatic for me honestly. I was bullied and teased. I dreaded classes like math because I still did not even know stuff like my times tables.  I got through.. By shutting down emotionally and pretending to be a clown. Playing football helped.. I hated it.  The physical contact and getting screamed at by coaches and messing up plays. But helped me get through school anyway.  Of course I was always failing and behind and barely made it but I did. 
Went from there to college, dropped out after a semester. I couldn't keep up with the classes. I'm always so muddled mentally and afraid because of the anxiety that it did not happen. Some classes I was the top of the class but the ones where teachers were not to my liking or it was stressful speaking out and stuff with the anxiety i failed miserably.  
I tried working at a couple gas stations and a couple retail stores. It went terribly. So afraid that I couldn't function having panic attacks i couldn't even remember my own name so. When I.got thrown in and expected to perform I could not handle it. I either left in tears not.knowing where I was driving to or got let go.  My grandmother wanted to help me.. So she forced/convinced me into opening a business. It was a shipping type place in the local town I love in. Went absolutely horribly . I was technically the sole proprietor.. But the girl that was working for me had more to say in what was going on then I did.  I had constant panic attacks, and got bullied by any customers that were in a bad mood. Because well people can obviously pick up on my lack of confidence and fear of conflict . It was the same way in the previous workplaces with bosses and co-workers.  The business failed .
 I was traumatized and my health had taken a hit. With my stomach and all being torn apart  from the panic and stressing physically i was diagnosed with ibs and have been hurting from it ever since.  Fairly sure I have an ulcer but. The fun part is about my stomach and my teeth ( they were messed up from the lack of brushing and diet when I was younger, had a few bad experiences with dentist and root canals half finished and now it's a mess,)  I'm 26 now and losing insurance this month so . I waited to long..
Getting back to my life I was to messed up to try work again after the business closed and had a relapse being anti-social and in my house. I lost the few friends i had while I had the business thing going on that I had no choice but to work or have no one there so. I sought out therapy and counseling for about a year . Having panic attacks driving there to therapy.. Nothing got better .  Psychiatrist put me on all kinds of drugs , adderall, anxiety meds, anti seizure meds. They really messed up my stomach worse as well as the adderall skyrocketing my bipolar mood swings and developing paranoia. But I was to afraid to confront the guy so ..  I stopped going there a few months ago. I just never showed up. I was being pressured about stuff from my grandparents at the time. Not being able to work and everything. That's why I went in the first place.  and now I think I have some lingering affects . Like besides my stomach I feel like it must be nerve dmg.  My left leg gets weakness, my necks always stiff, my head twitches if I hold it in certain positions.. I get facial numbness. It feels like my head is split in half its very uncomfortable. Combined with the anxiety it's much harder to go out now. 
So since I stopped going there I have done a few things. I started working out and weightlifting. Well it's been at the house but I've been super dedicated to it and intensely giving it my all.. I also finally found a way to earn a little money from my computer. It's called amazon mechanical turk. Not much money but I am. I've made about 200 now from it. It's terribly boring and low pay . I feel like I could make 500 a month if I stay dedicated tho... Also was taking classes online for game development with Unity. I learned a lot.. But found it hard to make anything cause I had no art skills to work with after the couple hundred hours of beginner classes and projects.. yea. 
I'm not happy or anything despite the progress I've made.  I'm afraid.  I feel a healthy mix of guilt and uncomfortable living here. Indebted financially but it's not a good environment. Treated either like a child with no respect or yelled at... My siblings see as basically a loser and disrespect me. We never had a close relationship after.. Because I feel awkward interacting with them.  yea. There 19 and 20 now. Just the other day my little sister was talking to me about not working and stuff saying I'd regret things later on. I found it pretty hurtful. She's has a part time job and is in college now still living here herself atm.. 
I'm afraid of what I'm going to do, I hate myself a lot.. I want to learn how to make decisions for myself. I'm afraid that even if I make money and can afford it I won't be able to live on my own because. I don't know how to do anything.. I don't know how to make my own decisions. Taxes, bills, doing stuff like laundry and household chores... setting up utilities, dealing with neighbors.. Interacting socially with people shopping for myself. It just gives me a panic attack thinking about it.  My grandfather treats me like I'm 5, he's  nasty.. demanding controlling, codependent .. The way he "" cares about me ""is twisted. He constantly evaluates me,  and asks stuff like "" what are you doing"", etc. He has me do stuff for.him a lot which I'm fine with but it's not asking me for help as an adult it's, trying to be controlling.over me and demeaning towards me..  I can't stand up to him as it is obviously. I just have to tolerate.. I realize he cares about me and don't get me wrong. I'm indebted to him for the support that has been given , especially the money and all.  My grandmother is the opposite. We have a better relationship but, she sees me as lazy , or oversensitive and is dismissive of my issues . Lashes out at me about money and a job a lot but I get that.  
In any case that's my situation right now,  I'm trying hard to ignore everything and everyone and focus on what I can do.. I'm scared , lonely, and I hate myself. I'm dependant and I hate that to but .. yea.   If anyone actually read this then I should already be thanking you. Maybe this has just been a way for me to rant and I shouldn't post this.  I don't want to be rich or popular.. compared to people my age married with kids and careers. I can't even think about that because it's depressing. All I want is to be able to support myself, be independent, maybe a few friends and not be terrified of everything hurting constantly.  Really at this point I have desperation. I have something to prove to myself. It's the only reason I've been able to do what I have recently with the working out and job despite being here. .. But it's not good enough. I truly feel that I was not ever meant to be able to make it in this life.  I'm just tired and want it to stop

5,"I'm sorry if this is horrible to read, but I just need to get these thoughts out without overthinking it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel broken and alone. I have an alright job, and I still live with my parents who are pretty well off. But growing up I was always underweight and looking back I had clear mental issues. If I was born with them or they were brought on by my dad ...I cant really say. My parents relationship was a shit-show before I was born, both were married and divorced before they met, and I have 2 (half) brothers on my dads side. Who were in custody of their mother because of alleged child abuse, which my dad claimed was a lie. But I've started questioning that to myself.

I can't even remember a good portion of my childhood and it just feels like static. My mother is an emergency vet so she would always work weird and long hours...and I cant even remember what my dad did , he bounced around jobs a lot I think. I always dreaded being alone with him, and I cant remember why. I remember screaming matches, but not the content. But one memory sticks out clear as day, and I just recently told my mom about it who never knew.

When i was probably about 8 or so, I was taking a bath and having fun as kids do. And in that fun I may have gotten a good amount of water on the floor. And that's when my dad came into the bathroom, picked me up by my fucking neck and threw me against the wall, and I've always been a thin kid. I tried to call 911 but he stole the phone from me and I just remember sobbing myself to sleep, still naked, wrapped in damp blankets. 

One weird memory I have is him asking me to go on a car ride with him, and during the car ride I honestly thought he was going to kill me. What a healthy relationship. 

Fast forward several years when I was probably about 12-13, we were on Vacation and I was using the jacuzzi that was in the master bathroom in the villa-thing we were staying at, and my dad walks in to grab something. And all I remember is just screaming ""GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT"" and throwing a wet rag at the mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to high school years, my first time in public schools, I went to 3 different schools in the same county, and only really put effort in junior/senior year. Obviously this caused a fair bit of arguments, but besides some punches in the arm nothing physical.

But the constant demeaning remarks on stuff, really tore at my confidence. Even if he was trying to be funny, he never was. He was just an ass. One solid memory when he noticed my teeth. Now I can count the number of times I've been to the dentist on one hand, partially due to the fact my mother is phobic of dentists. When he noticed my teeth he said ""Your teeth are disgusting!"" and the look on his face, such twisted contempt over goddamn teeth. And what did he do about it after? Did he arrange for his child to have dental work done? well yes, I had one tooth fixed, and a plan for the rest to get fixed, but he just didn't bother scheduling another appointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now here I am at 23, introverted, social anxiety, and god knows what else.  Every time I think of how to pull myself up and become more social I always just shrug backward because of my teeth, to the point it affects the way I speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was plenty more I wanted to vent , but I need to go to work.

Again sorry about the writing.

6,"Hey. I’m not really diagnosed with anything yet except for a really lazy ADD diagnosis I got when I was 10 for spacing out in class.

But anyway, here are the things I notice about my own behavior: it feels like I’m wired to live in a world where no one else is there — like whenever people come into my space, I lose my sense of self and fall apart, immediately wanting to return to solitude so that I can feel like the amazing person I’ve designed myself to be like again. I am most comfortable in the absence of people, but value achievement and status in a self-reflective sort of sense.

I have a hard time relating to happy or emotional events in life when I’m with a group and often fail to comprehend the significance of such events to the extent that I actually remember them. Adults in my life would jokingly attribute my lack of caring to adolescence, yet this conflicts with my own observations as my whole life I’ve seen many people experience more excitement than me. Plus, I’m growing older and nothing is really changing.

Speaking of adults in my life, I did not have a very good childhood. I was isolated and put through what seemed like a lot of confusion and trauma. My mother had a very tough career that pushed her to the brink of exhaustion and made her emotionally unstable almost whenever she was around me. She was also paranoid and accused anyone who had me over at their house for too long (including my grandparents) of trying to steal me from her. Sometimes when she was really angry and I was trapped with her in the house or car or something, I had to use my imagination to block out what she was saying, but every time I didn’t respond she’d yell louder so I’d have to try even harder. I would often end up alone in my room crying and whenever this happened, I would tell myself “she doesn’t love me” over and over again until I believed it because it was the only way to rationalize what was happening to me. Slowly, I became less sensitive and learned to stop crying after her outbursts, but also felt less emotion in general.

Overall, I don’t really feel attached to anyone in general. Sometimes I like the idea of making a bond in theory, but in practice it is horrifying and uncomfortable. It just feels like I’m losing myself and everything I am. 

The funny thing is, I’m fine with talking in front of crowds and can come off as kind of confident since I don’t care— it’s just closeness that scares me.

Right now, I’m not really planning to spend my life in any sort of union such as a marriage or tight group of friends. I have a group of people I hang out with sometimes for now, but I’m not sure how long it will last given the way I am. My default plan is to go through the motions of life without company.

How I’ve learned to cope with things in life is to make my ability to not care stronger every time an increasingly difficult thing happens to me, so now smaller conflicts have no bearing on me whatsoever and I usually appear very emotionless and uninterested, accurately so. My attention span can be very small for some things, but I’ve found that if I gain a sufficient amount of adrenaline I can feel temporary interest — but it’s like a drug because next time I’ll have to try an activity that’s even more exciting because if I try the same one that gave me joy the last time, I’ll just be bored.

In general, the amount of joy I genuinely gain from social interaction is almost too small to acknowledge.

10,"Hi all. First, a little info. I am 31, and as far as I know, perfectly sane. Most people see me as pretty intelligent. I was a smart kid in school and was significantly ahead of most of my classmates. I am well adjusted, I live with a couple of roommates, and have a daughter from a former marriage.

This started happening a couple of years ago. Whenever I recall something embarrassing from past, or humiliating, or when I recall a particularly stupid choice or missed opportunity from my past, I compulsively blurt out an obscene insult. The weirdest part is that the things I say are NOTHING I would ever normally say. Don't get me wrong, I have the mouth of a fucking mechanic, but the things I say go against everything I believe in. I will blurt out something like ""You're a fucking slut,"" not even with any person in mind for it to be directed toward. I don't like the term slut, I believe we are all horny motherfuckers, male or female, and that's perfectly OK. Another thing I often blurt is ""You're a dirty faggot"" or something like that... Again, this is NOT me. Though I am straight, I am a strong advocate for gay rights. Other times, it's just random obscenities like ""fucking cunt"" or whatnot. These things blurt out of my mouth before my filter can catch them, and I quickly look around to make sure nobody heard me. I don't yell these things, often they are fairly quiet, but certainly audible to anyone within several feet of me. 

This ONLY happens when my mind recalls an embarrassing event like I mentioned. I have not said a word about this to a single person, and so far, nobody that I know personally has noticed.

Recently, I've been doing some sleuthing on Google, and I've found, much to my comfort, that I am not alone. Apparently this if fairly common, I see forums where tons of otherwise sane people are complaining of this exact same issue, but nothing I've found has offered any sort of insight or explanation. I'm worried that one of these things will slip out at my job and sabotage me. I mean, what if I say something like that in front of a customer and they think I was talking to them? Everyone at my job sees a normal person every day, they wouldn't believe me if I said ""I couldn't help it, it was because I thought of something embarrassing from my past."" 

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. ",02Sep2018,2
11,"I suffer from severe anxiety disorder, bipolar and major depersonalization and possible schizophrenia (haven’t been formally diagnosed for schizo, therapists have just hinted at it).

14,"*TRIGGER WARNING*
*This post includes semi graphic details of self harming. Please proceed with caution.*

Hello, I’m a 20 yr old female who has struggled with depression and bipolar disorder for years. My mother has also struggled with those and also has struggled with suicidal tendencies. 

Today my mother found out that my little brother (14 almost 15) had started cutting himself. They just moved into a new house in the same city and my brother (I’m gonna call him “E”) just started high school and has never gone to this school before, but has a few friends that go there. 
My brother is “always wearing hoodies and long sleeves,” and today my mom found out why. E had cut himself 9 times on the top of his arm. My mother tried not to get upset and asked when, how, and why he did it. E said that he did it at school with a part of his pen. (I am not sure if he was being truthful, but I don’t see why he would lie about it.) My mom let it go for the time being, then called me a few hours ago close to having a panic attack and sobbing. She couldn’t understand why he did it and didn’t know what to do. Immediately I start sobbing because my brother is the most precious person on the earth. I told her that she needs to convince him to go to therapy and get some help. We talked for an hour and the whole conversation felt like a blur. Eventually we hung up so that she could go talk to him. She INSISTED that I don’t give him any hints that I know. She said that she doesn’t want anyone outside of immediate family to know. So, she talked to him and called me back. She said that he explained that he was “fine” and that “it was dumb.” She asked him to please go talk to a therapist and he finally agreed, but stated that he really didn’t want to. E is VERY socially awkward, so I feel like it will be hard for him. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I can’t let him know that I know, because he will hold it against mom. I just want to drive hours back home just to hug him and tell him everything will be okay and that I understand a little about what he is going through. He and I have extremely similar personalities and people make jokes that we are actually the same person, but different genders. I was the same way at his age. I lived with our grandparents who were very old fashioned and I never got any help and never had anyone to talk to. I DO NOT want him to feel that way.. 

I made this post for ANY advice. What should I do? How do I approach this? I don’t want to make things worse. I don’t want him to feel embarrassed if he finds out that I know. I really want to help so that he doesn’t have to go through what I did. I want to be the best support system that I can. I will do anything for him no matter what it is. So, please if anyone can help in anyway possible I will be forever grateful. Please don’t hesitate if you feel like you have some advice on how I can help better this situation, help my brother, and help my mother understand, process, and get through this as well. She is struggling with this too and I want to make her she isn’t going too far unintentionally.

16,"My need for validation and security just takes over and I say so many things I regret. I hate who I am. 

Although I feel like crap when I'm alone, *sometimes* I can get to a pretty optimistic, or even powerful place in my head. In this space I'm not so self loathing, I can forgive the amount of times I've let people walk all over me, I can forgive all of the embarrassing crap I've done, etc etc...but as soon as I'm out in the world, even just walking out of my house, or thinking about doing so flips me in to a mild state of panic. I imagine people watching me and mocking me. Every social interaction is characterized by a desperate fear. 

I want to feel centered in social situations. I know that no one is ever 100% free of anxiety. That's not what I'm after. I get it, humans are flawed. But I DON'T want to be ruled by this shit anymore. I don't think everyone suffers with this level of insecurity. Sure, lots do, but that doesn't change much. I just don't want to live like this anymore and I've been trying for years but it feels like my efforts are so ham fisted! I want results but don't know how to stay centered in life.

Snide comments send me reeling. Rude looks, real or imagined, does the same. Even when people are being friendly with me I hate the things I say and feel like a pathetic, submissive idiot who's just constantly embarrassing myself like a perpetual awkward teenager.

This is one of many mental health issues I have. It's been so painful for so long. Some things have been getting better, but some have only compounded. This is one of them.

To think 'I'm not going to give away my power anymore. I'm going to speak my mind and stick up for myself when necessary, and just be quiet and not need to speak when it's not necessary"" and then IMMEDIATELY think ""nope, I can't stick to that, I'm too pathetic and I always fail at it"" ......is so torturous. I feel like I've been trying to scramble up an icy mountain in shoes with no grip and only making it about 10 feet before falling and smashing my face on the rocks for my entire adult life.

I actually have bought really into my own lies enough that I feel like I really lived that even though I know I didnt. But at the same time I do love people. I love my mom, I would want to take care of her if she was ever unwell. But with my friendships and romantic relationships I know that I manipulate a lot. I know I want friends and romance. I guess I dont know if what I want in those relationships and how I experience those relations is genuine or how other people do.  I know that I have to force a lot of my social interactions. 

I dont want to be a sociopath, but also I feel like I have enough tendencies that it is worth asking and finding out.",02Sep2018,2

When I was 11, I looked into a mirror while washing my hands and a funny thought occurred to me. Is that really me? At the time it freaked me out a little but I brushed it off.

I had a bit of a breakdown triggered by some pot and a panic disorder. Looking at the mirror today is an incredibly uncomfortable act. It's almost like stepping on hot coals. You have to do your business as quickly as possible and get out. Fast.

22,"I am doing a little bit of research on the mental health effects living in a bunker or in isolation can have on your brain, not only on your intelligence but also your emotions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the situation. Alex and Samantha are locked in a bunker, There is no daylight, no outside influence and no clocks or calendars. The entire space is lit evenly without the ability to darken or brighten the bunker. Alex and Samantha are the same age and have not known each other previously. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are as follows

1. Will Alex and Samantha get along or will they get sick of eachother.
2. Will Alex and Samantha succumb to their natural instincts and procreate?
3. Will Alex And Samantha's sleep scedules stay in the normal 24 hour time period or switch to the more natural 25 hour cycle or the even stranger 36 hour cycle?
4. Will the two bond over mutual issues?

There are a lot of variables here, but What happens in the brain is something that I am completely interested in. I have read a lot of research papers of a few people that have actually spent time in isolation. One of my favorites being Siffre, Who spent months in a cave alone, stating that he was awake for longer than 24 hours naturally, eating and sleeping only when his body told him to.

&amp;#x200B;

I would think that Alex and Samantha would not get to know each other initially, well maybe a little in the beginning but then start to bond over a shared space or shared depression or feelings towards being in the bunker. After that I would assume that they would get annoyed with each other, as most people do, while spending that amount of time with each other. Only after they have separated from each other do I think that they would give in to their natural urges and attempt to procreate. ",02Sep2018,1

Long story short, I dated a guy for three years, the relationship was extremely toxic and every kind of abusive. 

It would never take him long to snap, if I was out too long I was greeted with glazed eyes and violence. This along with an obsession with death and knives, he would dance a knife around his hand the same way people jiggle their leg during conversation, so casually. He used to have visions of him watching himself commit suicide repeatedly and had a fascination for extreme gore and told me he felt a cool and calm sensation when seeing blood and murder. 

He wasn’t on drugs, had very violent tendencies that he couldn’t control. 

The thing that made me realise he would kill me was when I called the police during an episode, as soon as they arrived he was unbelievably calm and cool and actually convinced them I was erratic and made it up, THAT’S how quick he could switch.

My older brother has always been a kind, gentle but extremely lazy guy. He doesn’t want to work and has been on the doll for about 5 years now, just recently his social worker has made it mandatory for him to see a psychologist, as he said to us. But in fact he has been seeing a psychiatrist who last thursday admitted him into a public hospital. He admitted to his psychiatrist that he uses drugs, ice to be specific and that he has been hearing voice inside his head since he was 17, vague voices but only recently it has gotten worse, and now the voices tell him to kill himself. He is currently under strict supervision at a mental hospital and is in the process of rehabilitation.

31,"Hello,

I just want to release by writing this post, I feel so lonely, nobody understands me and my family doesn't even believe me that I'm having these problems, they just keep shouting at me and saying that it's not possible and that I'm just too sensitive. I had a walking pneumonia (mycoplasma pneumoniae infection) 3 months ago and ever since then I' have fasciculations and cramps all over my body, stomachache, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation and when I eat the food returns to my throat. It's really frustrating for me so I also get some anxiety. It comes and goes in aprox. 6 days long waves and it got a little bit better, but it's very slow and I'm not sure if it's getting better now.

I've been to an infection department in my hospital and they tested me for a bunch of things, but didn't find anything. I've also been to rheumatology where the doctor examined me and took blood tests for autoimmune disease, but all of them were negative as well. Then my GP sent me to x-ray to scan my lungs and heart, but again everything looked fine. I've also went to a psychiatrist and she put me on trazodone extended release for my mild anxiety and depression. I thought that those symptoms might be connected to the anxiety but no, even though the anxiety's better now my symptoms are still there and I hate the way I feel on the antidepressants, it makes me feel boring, like I'm not really myself, so I want to stop it in month or so. It also makes me not being stressed out about things that I think I should be stressed about and it makes not afraid of death.

I can't live like this for much longer, it's a torture. I don't want to be on multiple psych meds just to be ok with living like this. The problem isn't chemical imbalance in my brain, the problem is that I feel like shit physically. I don't even think about what disease I might have, I don't care what it is, I just want to live normal life again. The only alternative I see is unfortunately death. I'm giving this 6 more months maybe and if it doesn't get better I'll start looking for ways to end this. I'm just so hopeless right now :( Thank you for reading this and sorry for my English",02Sep2018,1

I don't know if I'm being dramatic but that little bit just seemed like a really big shift of how I saw things, and how I saw myself. 

From that point, I told myself I would work on how I developed social relationships so I could do more for myself. Instead of it being good for me though, I feel less and less proud of who I've become. Everytime I think about what people see in me, I feel disgusted. It's as if the whole idea of meeting new people becomes so tiresome, trying to be less of a mess for them to like my presence, but in the end, just losing them when I let my guard down. 

The strange thing is, I know what being depressed is like. I used to be. Though I know I'm not feeling the way I felt when I was depressed, I can't help but think this all feels so much worse because I know I'm doing it all to myself.

38,"8 Months ago I climbed a tree and tied a rope around my neck. 2 months ago I OD’d. Today I’m somewhat in between. 

Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, after a decade of battling with my mental health and wondering why I was a little different to everyone else and not understanding things as most adults do, I was sat down by my GP and told that it is a very real and serious diagnosis affecting only 2% of the population. After the most horrific and emotionally crippling 12 months of my life I was finally told that I’m not mad, my emotional development had stopped as a child.

I simply feel emotions and have mood swings on the highest possible intensity. I simply love too much, I see the good in people too much, I feel anger and sadness on a spectrum that even psychology does not even fully understand.

I developed anxiety and manic depression over the years on top of this illness and the obvious route was to fix those problems, however after much time with my psychologist and many hospital trips it has emerged that the root of the issue was much deeper than ANYONE could have ever imagined. I finally understand myself so much more than I did last year. 

I am referred to specialists to help me cope day to day with what I am coming to terms with what I will have to live with forever.

I am still intensely suicidal, I still cut myself and bite when I’m frustrated, I still have extreme mood swings changing within minutes to hours, sometimes even days.


I can’t thank some people enough for putting me back together, sitting with me and trying to understand what I’m going through on a real level, those who truly love me, those who have stuck by me the whole roller coaster and never made any wrong mis-judgment of me, you know who you are and you are the reason I held on, the reason there’s now a tomorrow.

But non of them know what to do when someone is in full panic mode or breakdown mode. Instead they look at you all stupid and dumb like (because they are). Mental awareness is great but for the people who just don't bother learning about it, and look at people as if they are on top because they have ""had it too"" and are doing great now. But really if they actually knew anything they would know that it's different for everyone that goes through it. They say they know the importance of mental health but the moment it gets hard to cope they dump you from your job. And so the cycle continues.

**BUT** there's two friends who make me feel worse at times about it.

They don't 'talk' to me about it, it's more of an interrogation. Saying things like 'we all know whats going on and you do too so why aren't you telling me about how you feel, i thought we were good mates, why are you keeping your distance, you never talk to me about it'. And if I  don't tell them or try and avoid it, I get the cold shoulder. ""Oh ok,  whatever, don't tell me so.."".

72,"I find it incredibly hard to describe how I feel. I thought for a long time it was because I’m a man and men are portrayed as emotionally suppressed, especially in my home country (the UK) but I realised recently that it’s not that.

I find the best way to describe how I feel is ‘numb’. I don’t feel in the usual sense, i just feel as if I’m going through the motions with everything. I can go for hours at a time doing very little simply because I don’t feel as if I’m really living, just existing. When I socialise with my friends and family, I don’t feel particularly happy, sad, angry, or anything. I just feel as if I’m feeling a quota I’m obliged to feel, like I have to spend x amount of time socialising. 

In general, my family aren’t very good at expressing emotions but I feel like what I go through is something more. The only times I do feel, I feel sad. This has been the case since I was about 12 (I’m now 19) and it only struck me quite recently that there may be something wrong with me. 

My friends think I’m quite a happy person but I’ve always put up a front so that they don’t worry. I don’t want them to feel bad just because I do. I’m not sure who I can talk to because whenever I try to tell someone I feel low or something they’ve just told me to “man up”, “pull yourself together”, and phrases to that effect. I’m slightly worried because in the media and pop culture people who don’t feel are seen as psychopaths and I don’t want people to think that of me. 

Does anyone know what this is and what I can do? Thank you",02Sep2018,2
73,"I was having a conversation on a different sub, with someone extolling the virtues of toughening up, bottling one’s emotions, and “not crying like a little bitch.” 

I suggested that everyone is entitled to feel and express their emotions (in a healthy, well-regulated way), and he responded by asking “what about the right not to feel one’s emotions?” My response to his question ended up being a lot more in depth (and personal) than I expected, and I thought it might fit well here.

My Comment:

Barring those with atypical neurology, I don’t think it’s really possible to “not feel” one’s emotions. In my experience, attempting to avoid difficult emotions tends to result in one of, or a combination of, a couple different outcomes: 

A) The unwanted emotion is processed as a different emotion that feels safer/more secure (eg. leaving late for work and feeling worried/guilty about it, becomes anger at the other commuters around you for “making you late).

B) The unwanted emotion is stuffed down and ignored. At least in my experience, this tactic tends to result in the repressed feelings bubbling up in unexpected (and sometimes, seemingly unconnected) ways at some later point in time. 

Both of these strategies, at least for me, provide a short term sense of safety/comfort, but impair my ability to truly experience my life, and grow through painful experiences.

I’m not trying to preach. Just offering a different perspective that you may find helpful. 

I used to feel that in order to navigate the world with a sense of safety, I needed to project an image of invulnerability, even to myself. 

I spent a lot of time angry and irritable, because I’d convinced myself that vulnerability was weak, and that carrying around a toxic load of aggression and cynicism was better than being, being-perceived-as, or feeling weak. 

I stubbornly held onto that belief, that gut feeling, that I needed a shell of toughness to navigate the world, even as it led me to behave in ways that, at core, I really didn’t like. Though I didn’t realize it, I was effectively utilizing anger and emotional repression to mood-alter, just as an alcoholic would utilize alcohol.

My fear of re-examining the defensive strategies that had allowed me to navigate an abusive childhood, resulted in me damaging important friendships, and nearly cost me my relationship with my fiancée. Perhaps just as bad, it stripped me of compassion and love for myself.

A couple of years ago, after a rage-fueled, totally unnecessary, shouting match with my fiancée and a couple of our close friends, I finally realized that my approach wasn’t working. I got back into therapy, and began the difficult work of training myself to rely on healthier coping skills. It hasn’t been an easy journey, by any means, but my life is 1000% happier now, then it has ever been before.

Obviously, everyone is different, and your mileage may vary, but I thought I’d share my experience.

74,"Recently I've realized I don't have much knowledge about mental health psychology in general, and that a lot of my ideas are... I would say quasi-superstitious at times, and I should probably do better. Getting with a healthcare provider is a great idea that isn't possible at the moment, so what are some resources you use to supplement your understanding of your conditions or mental health psychology in general? For example I was just considering keeping an eye on Psychology Today and that's what made me curious what else might be out there to this end. Looking into good books as well. And I mean good books, ha. I know there's a lot of misleading pop psychology type stuff out there, would prefer to stay away from those.",02Sep2018,1
75,"Hi, I really don't actually know what I'm looking for, I'm hoping that someone will give me some advice that will help maybe?

When I message friends, new people, anyone on any kind of social media or messaging service and the message gets seen but ignored my head starts to go to a really dark depressed place and I even start to feel sick. I can't even fathom the idea of knowingly ignoring someone like that, maybe because I know how it makes me feel. I just don't know how to deal with it at all and its ruining my life.

&amp;#x200B;

It can even just happen after hours of normal conversation and then suddenly for no apparent reason people start ignoring. I don't understand how someone can actively ignore you specifically in a way that lets you know that they are reading your messages and then ignoring them.

When I look in the mirror today, I see a pretty, young woman. I do believe that I look good, but I am not happy with it. The way I look does not match who I really am. I wish my appearance would reflect the pain and frustration I feel, these things have shaped me greately.

78,"recently I've been very sad which got me thinking about my life a lot. I figured out that I get sad very very easily and I sometimes hate life even though I know i am very blessed with an amazing life. I have great family and friends, I am considered very handsome to many ladies, I am very popular, I am at the top of my class in University, my family is not poor at all... but I am not usually happy. I feel extremely bad because I know a lot of people who have it worse than I do and I am here complaining and hating life, I feel like I should be more thankful for where I am at but I don't  


I decided to do a quick google search on symptoms of depression and it left me still unsure if I have depression. I do have some symptoms that relate to depression but I don't have all of them and some of my symptoms aren't very severe.  
Here is what I have: Trouble Concentrating, Feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, irritability, loss of interests that once was pleasurable, feeling ""empty"" and occasional suicidal thoughts (however, even though i think of suicide sometimes, I never had the urge to actually attempt it so I am unsure if i am actually suicidal or if that is just me wanting attention). Although, I have only spoken to one person about my suicidal thoughts.  


I always thought that these feelings were normal but now I am opening up to the idea that I might have some sort of mental illness. I am not very educated in depression, but in my opinion, I don't think my symptoms are severe enough to be diagnosed with depression. However, I feel like I do have some sort of less severe mental illness. Anybody think they can help diagnose me?",02Sep2018,1

I hate it and myself. I don’t want judgment. I see all these people posting about those people who are faking being depressed and I hate it because it is me. I guess sometimes I do want to be depressed. And I know what you guys are thinking. “Yeah she says that, but she doesn’t want REAL depression” and maybe that’s true, maybe not. I just think so often how much I want to want to die. I feel like sometimes I deserve the punishment. I also feel like growing up, depression was romanticized so that’s probably part of it.

81,"Mainly here to vent... if you criticize please be gentle... 

2 years ago I (29F) decided to pursue my dream of becoming a psychologist. I went from being a shitty community college student (&lt;2.0gpa) to now having a cumulative 4.0 gpa in all my upper division courses. I’m currently trying to transfer to a state university from my online private university for 1) a better education and a better shot at getting into grad school and 2) financially is more efficient. My goal is to pursue my PsyD. I have about 1 more year left of undergrad. Possibly some post-bacc work to boost my gpa and PsyD school which is ~6-7 years. So it’s a long time, I understand that. 

I am funding my own college expenses (student loans). I work part time for a major health care organization, but found out I’m getting laid off 10/31. Currently dealing with a major depressive episode, go to therapy every week, take herbal supplements to combat the depressive mood, exercise 3-5x per week... basically not letting this depression keep me in bed all day like I want. Ohh, I also live at home and am very grateful to be living rent free (although there’s resentment over the fact that I’m not paying rent). 

Today my mom told me that she and my dad think I should just give up on school because it’s taking too long, pursuing my PsyD will take too long, and they’re tired of funding me. I don’t pay rent (yes I know, I AM grateful for that), but everything else of mine I cover. She told me that I need to just find a full time job (at my current company) and do that instead. I asked her why I should give up on my dream so I can work full time at a job I don’t really want to do. She said they didn’t have the opportunity to go to school like I have and they had to struggle (they had me when they were 17 years old) and didn’t have any help so, I’m just going to have to “figure it out”. 

I’m heartbroken, devastated and angry. I don’t really have a question... but I guess I just feel like (and don’t understand) why anyone would tell their child to give up on their dream. I’m also having trouble digesting the fact that since my parents had to struggle raising me, they feel I should have to go through the same thing. 

I guess if anyone has any advice.... feel free to share. Otherwise, there isn’t much I can do except suck it the fuck up... chin up, keep moving forward and not give up on my dream despite what anyone says. ",02Sep2018,8

87,"I think I may have posted a few times on here. 

Firstly, I dont understand the difference between schizophrenia and schizoaffective because different sources say different things and different people have different opinions.

My psychiatrist is leaning towards schizoaffective bipolar type, and I agree with him because when I use Saphris, it works perfectly. Saphris works perfectly for me because it treats schizophrenia and it treats acute mania. I'm on 20 mg, and I feel like I've walked out of the scary fishbowl that was my mind.

 I disagreed about bipolar at first because I do not get euphoric mania. From my understanding, there are different manias and not all bipolar mania is happy euphoria. If I understand correctly, when I am restless, hyper, unable to sleep, with racing thoughts, and increased hallucinations and delusions, that is my mania. My mania is anxiety, restlessness, and intense racing thoughts that go hand in hand with my hallucinations and delusions. ""Mania""(as I have described) is always followed by severe, severe sadness, hopelessness, pessimism, and all the ingredients for an aching heart like severe loneliness and self loathing. My hallucinations and delusions during this time were more stagnant whereas in mania they changed drastically and were more concerning, but they related to feeling how I did(Ie: a voice may tell me that no one loves me). Then I am manic again. I already made this observation before I had the vocabulary. I would think, as I was manic, ""God this is only going to be followed by melancholy"" or ""great, I know when I get out of this sadness I'll just enter nightmares again.""

I also want to note that, when i'm depressed, I am not bed ridden and numb. I am EXTREMELY SAD. Like, I cannot describe how sad I get. I'm glad I do not get numb, but the sadness is SO extreme that I feel it all over my body, lay in bed staring at the wall, zone out at work, cry a lot. I always felt invalidated because my depressive periods arent typical: Poor hygiene, sleeping in, over eating or eating less. Rather, i'm just super fucking sad for 2 weeks so badly I could cripple in on myself.

So here are my questions:
What is the difference between schizoaffective and schizophrenia?
Is the what I described mania?
Does this sound like bipolar to you?
