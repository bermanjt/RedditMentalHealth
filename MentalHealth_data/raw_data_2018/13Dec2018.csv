0,"Nothing I'm typing is well thought out.. probably a lot of you understand I go in loops and can never really find the beginning or the most important thing to say, so I figured I'd just write whatever I was thinking at the moment as the title. Whatever.

I tried to see someone like... 3? 4? years ago, went to a website that was like ""find local therapists!"" and I clicked the link to email one, wrote a long, thought-out email, and never heard back. I just fumed about that for months and hoped that either the therapist who ignored my email would feel some kind of crushing guilt about ignoring it, or that whatever spammy advertisers put up a fake webpage to get my email address would face some kind of punishment from the universe.

Then I got in a relationship that made me happy for a long time-- I mean as happy as you can be when you're still depressed. I Like... it helped a little to have expectations set when I moved in with her, where some minimum standard of not living in your own filth is expected. I constantly disappointed myself and her, but still a big improvement.

But it's really coming back again. I've never been diagnosed with depression (fwiw I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid, then again when I was in vet school by a separate guy with no knowledge of my prior diagnosis, which I tried to hide from him like an idiot.) 

About 3 or 4 weeks ago I started looking into types of therapy-- the APA has a little summary of all of them. I read some stuff on finding a therapist from a few places. 

I am really skeptical of therapy. I feel like it's all bullshit, and that MAYBE if I select the exact right school of therapy, it will help, but if I choose the wrong one I'll get strung along. But I also don't think there's any realistic assessment I can do at any point after I select someone. I mean... good therapy might take years to work, and as much as I might want to be objective, really I'm going to end up judging my therapist on things like their personality and whatever random ups and downs I encounter after meeting them.

I wish there were a service where some jack-of-all-trades therapist would see you for a few visits then say ""okay this is right for you"" but also, I want them to be honest if some of the forms are anti-science nonsense.

There isn't an actual question in here. I'm from the US, California, close enough that in theory I could drive to the Bay but would rather go somewhere between Stockton and Fresno. I guess if you want to help me out, you could tell me your opinions on modalities, or if you were in a similar boat, just tell me where to go in that region. Or whatever. I dunno. Seeking any kind of discussion really. ",13Dec2018,1
1,"Hi, so this morning I woke up and I was feeling a little sad for what I think was no reason (since nothing had happened for me to feel that way). After an hour or so, I started feeling better and went on with my day as normal. I went to school, did what I had to do, laughed and smiled- Even had a class where we all legitimately got curled up in a corner and fell asleep for a full hour (We're a small class, all very united- Like family. And yes, high school, just to point out.). Anyway, after school... I got home, and suddenly I felt angry. I felt sad. I felt lonely. I felt unwilling. Out of nowhere! I am still currently feeling this way- And I still don't know why. Could this be a problem? Bipolar disorder? Depression? Anything related or unrelated? Thank you, for any help.",13Dec2018,1

3,"I can easily assume your immediate answer, which is no, but you have to think from my point of view. Let me explain. (I know you're going to read a few sentences and think ""fuck you,"" but I show signs of narcissistic personality disorder. I have not been diagnosed, and I'm not self-diagnosing, but my brain is evidently wired different compared to yours. I cannot think of any way to put this, so I'll be blunt) 

I'm not sad like you may think; I'm angry, and upset. I want attention that I can't have. I want the whole world to watch me. I want to be admired, and praised. The thing is, I can't have all the attention that I want. I would volunteer in ""The Hunger Games"" because everyone would be watching me. I'd risk my life to get attention. God,, I'd enjoy that so much. Now, to the main point. I don't think life is worth it. If I cannot get the attention that I want, then why am I alive? What is my purpose? If I kill myself, then I'd get my fifteen minutes of fame. Eventually everyone would forget about me, though, so that's pointless too. It'd be the best way to exit the world, in my opinion.

Usually I'd be distracted by a friend. They'd allow me to talk about myself, and I'd forget about constantly wanting attention. I don't have a friend to talk to anymore, and now I'm thinking about it. I don't think anyone wants to talk to me either, and that really makes everything worse. 

This isn't for shits and giggles. I'm genuinely upset about this, just so you know that I'm not a troll. I can already see the comments :'/ ",13Dec2018,1

7,"I (F23) have had depression since I was 15/16 and have always managed to get by without any help. I’ve had good days and dark days and at times lent heavily on friends but I’ve got through it. I recently went to the doctors because working 2 jobs I thought I was burning myself out. Instead the doctor recognised my depression and started me immediately on citalopram. Ever since I’ve been on them I’ve left like a useless excuse of a human for dealing with depression for so long to now need pills to help me. 

I’m genuinely worried about the side effects of the pills as one of my jobs is a chef and I haven’t been to that job in a week. I don’t sleep properly anymore. I’m on edge all the time. My eating is more sporadic than ever and I genuinely don’t feel like me anymore....I don’t know what to do

8,"This hasn’t happened to me in awhile, thankfully, but I just discovered reddit and I’m curious. 

What do you lovely people do to cope with dissociative thoughts? 

I used to have very bad dissociative episodes in which I would have constant panic attacks throughout my day. Sometimes I would have one intrusive thought in my mind, then try to shove it back away from what I was thinking about. Then, I’d realize the fact that I was having intrusive thoughts and feel crazy. I always know when i’m going to have a panic attack because I’d get a chill down my spine and then the noise would be drowned out of the room. After that, I’d shiver (or shake?) while trying to ground myself. I used to find solace in distracting myself by talking to others but then I had this idea that everyone around me MIGHT not be real and I would never know if they were. I suddenly had no coping mechanism. 

Sorry that this is just a jumble of thoughts. I know it probably does not make sense. I am just eager to talk to others in this subreddit since I have never had anyone to really talk to about these feelings. ",13Dec2018,1
9,"Hi guys! This is the start of my mental health blog, and soon to be mental health youtube channel as soon as I finish the proceeds on my housing situation. 

I have been slapped with a few labels: generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, unspecified psychotic disorder, etc., have been medically and therapeutically treated but only found a way out of mental illness through the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

I want to help others with an interest in this area of psychology gain access to resources, information, and knowledge that will help them on their journey to recovery. I've written this first post on anger and its relationship to social learning, as well as how we can move ourselves from a place to compulsively reacting to anger to acting in a way that serves our higher values, while in the process detangling the psychological conditioning towards anger. 

I will also occasionally comment on social issues and how they impact mental health, although specifically I'm concerned with how everyday ""normal"" behaviors contribute to the overall web of compulsive behavior that feeds mental illness, as well as how these behaviors manifest in cultures and social environments. 

I hope you all enjoy, and good luck on improving your mental health!

I am final year media production student and I decided to make a couple experimental films based on different mental illnesses.

I know it might me triggering for you to talk about such things but I appreciate any help from you.

Also maybe you have friends or family members who suffers or suffered from any type of mental illness and you would like to share anything what is relevant.

My main idea of your stories/experiences is to develop it in a short poem type of written text and do a voiceover on top of the video, so if you have anything you wrote down yourself which can help the audience to experience mental illnesses then please share it. Here or pm.

11,"This is the first time since I terminated my therapy sessions, 1. June, where I genuinely wish I could go back. I just want to tell her everything that has happened since our last session; I just wish to be able to cry in front of her and ask her for advice on how to move forward. I feel like I am getting perilously close to the end of my tether. No, I am not suicidal. I’m just back to feeling like I can’t possibly live my whole life. I’m back to feeling that the age of thirty is probably as far as I can manage (about to turn 23). I just don’t want to live alone... I’m tired of being the guy with no friends. And, most of all, I am tired of being the one who’s never had a real girlfriend. I’ll manage for now, but this is not a life I wish to live. And I am done trying to change things. It doesn’t work for me. (See my last post).

P.S.

This post is sincere. I’m still not going back to my psychologist. I will never in my life go back in therapy. However, as I am writing this, I am thinking that, if this doesn’t get better, maybe I should set up an appointment with my doctor. I could try talking with her. I’ll refuse all referrals, but it could still help having someone to talk to. As of now, I am feeling a little bummed out. It’s not that bad. That’s why I said thirty, and not 23! I’ll try dealing with this on my own first. Hopefully it won’t get any worse. If not, maybe I can get an appointment with my doctor. As for the way I am feeling, the worst part is the feeling that it’s not even worth trying at this point. You can see my last post for more information.

I’ve been flirting of the idea of talking to a counselor at my school for years now, but I’ve always attributed my feelings to me either being dramatic or hormonal, but over the past several weeks, something’s felt especially off.

I’ve done my fair share of research about the symptoms I feel, but I really don’t want to self-diagnose, and I also really don’t want to miss out on getting the help I need (if I really need it).

For context, I’ve felt very lonely and out of place for several years now. It’s very hard for me to talk to people, even people I’ve known for years now. I have an almost constant feeling of inadequacy and sadness, especially when I’m alone. My self-esteem is almost non-existent, to the point where I don’t even try to pursue anything romantic because I firmly believe that anybody else is probably better for them. These are just some of things I experience on a daily basis.

I(18F) am struggling a lot right now. I’m a freshman in college, and in the past I have been very driven and hardworking and I’ve always gotten great grades and I’ve always had great friends. While I’ve gone through my fair share of hard times, I don’t think I’ve ever been depressed until now. Since I started college this past fall I’ve struggled with a lot of social anxiety. Because of this I haven’t made a single friend (or even a nice acquaintance) since I’ve been in school. I’m a full time student and I also work 30 hours a week. My family lives about an hour away and with school and work I just haven’t been able to go see them as much as I would like. I spend most of my days at work, school, or pent up in my dorm room alone. At the beginning of the semester I was so on top of everything, I went to my classes early and I did my homework five days ahead of time and I was so happy with where I was until my first round of exams. I did terribly on them. I assumed that I just wasn’t prepared for how difficult tests in college would be so I studied much harder for much longer to prepare for my second round, and I still wound up with C’s and several D’s. I just felt really defeated. After this is when i think my mental health really started to decline. At first I think I was just unhappy with my situation (not having any friends, being so anxious all the time, busting my ass for shit grades etc.) and then that progressed to me being unhappy a lot of the time and just feeling hopeless. And now I find it really hard to even get out of bed in the morning. I’m so fucking exhausted ALL the time, and I have a really hard time being motivated to do anything. This has made me miss a lot of class and now I have a D and several C’s and I want to go to medical school, and that’s always been a realistic goal for me until now (kiss that dream goodbye I guess) I just feel like a complete screw up. Like I’ve ruined everything and I can’t even be mad about it because it’s all my fault. I just feel like I’m a failure and I’m not good enough to do anything right. I also don’t have anyone to really talk to except my boyfriend. He’s wonderful and supportive and I know that he truly just wants to help but so far nothing has made me feel better. It’s just impossible for him to know how to handle me feeling like this I think. I’m really close to my parents and my aunts/uncles but I feel like I really can’t talk to anyone in my family about this. My parents only care about my grades and anytime I’ve ever tried to tell them I’m struggling in the past they’ve told me that I just need to try harder or “I’m not properly applying myself”. My dad will just call me lazy and tell me I’m not working hard enough but that’s not what this is. I’m not procrastinating or making up excuses I’m just really struggling. On top of all the school/social stuff I work a LOT and I’m still broke all the time which doesn’t help. I don’t know, am I being ridiculous? Am I just being over dramatic? I feel like my life is in shreds and I can’t do anything about it because I’m the one holding the scissors. I’m sure I left some things out of this post that are contributing to my mental state so feel free to ask questions. Any advice on what to do here/how to feel better about all of this would be extremely helpful.

I’m currently a minor and my parents both work in the medical field. They had a distant connection to the psychiatrist and heard she did a good job. So we went to her and came back with something called the Vanderbilt Assessment. It tests for ODD, OCD, ADD/ADHD, anxiety, depression, etc. Both of my parents and four of my teachers were required to fill it out. 

[As a side note] one year ago I was at the worst I have ever been at. Very depressed and anxious. I told my parents and I since got into therapy for many months. Then I moved into the new school and life is going well. Arguably, I’m stressed but not at all depressed or anxious anymore. I have no reason to be. I’m not in an abusive situation, there’s no bullying, pre-existing mental health disorders, etc. 

So, anyway, my teachers fill out the forms and nothing of concern comes up. I came home after a few weeks at school and saw what my mom had marked. It was completely inaccurate for my current situation. She based my scores outside of the specific six month parameter that was asked for. She marked me from the last time she “knew me” and skewed the scores to extremely depressed, reclusive, anxious. I called her out on it, but it was a losing battle. She ended up redoing the form, but I don’t know exactly what she put. We had a good argument about it. My mom claimed we never talk like we used to and that I was very depressed from bad grades and my bed wasn’t made. Some points that had very poor connections. Very inaccurate connections. I talk to her everyday, I live on the top bunk and to anyone who has lived up there no one makes the bed haha. My social life has been beautiful and honestly it’s been the best time of my life. She just seemed to not understand that. My teachers and counselors from the school talked to her and said that I was taking every step needed and then some in order to pick up my grades and essentially, I’m doing well overall. 

As for my dad, he answered truthfully and specifically stated that he was not around me much between school and work. 

About three weeks later, my parents give me a call and I step away from what I was doing to answer. They told me I was diagnosed with ADD, generalized anxiety and depression. While I agree with the ADD, the other two are quite blatantly wrong. Regardless, I said nothing in argument. I was just stunned. My doctor started me on a stimulant to focus more in class and it has helped immensely. My grades are better, even the one that is slightly beyond repair. My pre-existing anxiety medication for the testing problems was upped as well. The medication hasn’t done much for me, but the anxiety has eased as I learned how to cope with it. I worked out more, practiced deep breathing, and just cleared my head before a test. 

I just can’t stop focusing on the misdiagnosis. Sure, it doesn’t affect me right now but it bothers me. I’m a minor, what can I say to a doctor when my parents are also in medicine? Regardless of the problems I will deal with with my parents, I would lose the trust of my doctor. My mother blatantly lied on the test and completely skewed my results. The teachers wrote almost neutrally and evened each other out. My dad was honest. It was a 50-50 split when the results came out but the doctor trusted what my mom had to say. 

If I tell my parents that it’s a misdiagnosis they may not believe me or yell at me or just find a way to make it seem like it’s my fault. I don’t know what to do. My mom does all of the talking when I go to the doctor. I think I’ve done two things that required me to talk: the basic questions they ask and how I’m doing. Obviously my parents are in the room, so there’s no way to say “yeah this is wrong” and even if I did, I’m screwed. 

While this isn’t a right away issue, it’s an over time issue. I want to go into the military, medical field, or jobs that require any security clearance. I’m a huge space nerd and this could’ve just killed that chance for me. 

What are my options here? Thank you ahead of time. ",13Dec2018,1
33,"I was about 8 years old and my father and I used to go play soccer with a group of his friends from work every week. One time, the weekend came around and we were supposed to go but my father wanted to stay home. I pressured him to go and he went to make me happy. About thirty minutes in, he fell on the ground and he broke his leg right above his knee and had an ambulance take him to the hospital. Eight years later, I still feel like it’s my fault. I’m not an emotional person at all but this always fucks me up. The fact that he was always excited to go but the one week he didn’t want to go and I made him go was the week that he got injured makes me feel like I could’ve prevented it. My dad was playing sports up until that injury and now he still can’t jog or lift weights or play any sports anymore and has frequent knee pain. I am not a  religious person so I don’t believe god made this happen or that this was gods plan. All I know is if I wasn’t whining like a bitch, my dad would be lifting weights with me everyday instead of having to sit and watch and lift 20 pound weights.",13Dec2018,1
34,"For the past two years, I have been haunted by a memory that doesn't fit into any straight categories. It wasn't rape. It wasn't assault. It wasn't even harassment. So I stay quiet about it because I doubt I even deserve support when there are actual victims out there. But it's ruining my life and my wellbeing and although it feels too humiliating to tell anyone in real life, I am just hoping for a safe space here to get it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I was seduced by my ex-boyfriend into sleeping with him. He was charming, loving, said I was the most special girl in the world and that he loved me. When we were in a relationship, he was the person I gave all my first times to. Where I'm from, having sex is a huge, huge deal. It's taboo before marriage and so it took a lot of trust and love for me to take this step with him, knowing I could never tell my parents or they'd see me as ""immoral"" and ""impure"" and all the bad stereotypes associated with girls who take this step.   


Anyway, in this post-break up meeting, I agreed to have sex thinking that it was a safe and loving space. Suddenly, in the days afterwards, his demeanour changed completely. He had gotten what he wanted (just sex) and he told me there was nothing special between us and that he didn't love me. He listed reasons why I was not worth it. My world crumbled overnight. I could not fathom how the loving, caring person had suddenly changed into a cold and indifferent one.   


His words - and the entire incident - broke something inside me. Like my dignity and worth as a person, as a girl,  vanished overnight. Over the past two years, I have done everything a healthy, happy, positive person is supposed to do: made lots of new friends, taken up new hobbies, have a great social life, and have achieved a lot professionally. But odd changes have taken place. I cry a lot, almost every single day, often without knowing why. I have a deep-seated sense of shame and worthlessness. I keep having a recurring sense of being in danger, that the world feels unsafe - I find it impossible to truly relax. I cannot hear or talk about anything vaguely connected to sex without feeling deep guilt and shame. I feel a huge distance from my family because I can't confide in them about what happened due to cultural taboos; I feel a huge distance from my friends because I fear that this is too humiliating to share. I fear that just like he did, they too will start to see me as inferior or lesser if I tell them. When I hear cultural messages about how only immoral women choose to have sex while unmarried, and I think of how he saw me - as something unworthy -  I have severe suicidal thoughts and frequently make suicidal plans. No matter how glossy or nice my life looks on the outside, on the inside I feel I have fallen into a dark hole I cannot escape. I have had sleep problems for two years now; every time I try to sleep, my heart starts pounding very fast and I feel the fear, the shame, all the bad feelings overcome me. The worst part is that I wonder if I am even worthy of support or help because what happened may seem so insignificant to others. If anyone reading this has any thoughts, I would be grateful just to be able to truthfully share this with another person. I appreciate your time. ",13Dec2018,1
35,"does anyone else know that feeling when you all of a sudden just get bad? like you're fine for a few days and then you just hit rock bottom and you quite literally stop functioning? like you were sweatpants and hoodies everyday, your hygiene has completely gone to shit, you aren't eating, ""what is daylight???"", etc. you stop going to class and then assignments start piling up and you start missing important deadlines and exams. and then when your professors start wondering why you've been AWOL, you have no choice but to be say ""i've been dealing with a lot of personal/mental issues and shit hit the fan"" and then they wish you the best but let it be known that they can't do anything to help you if you don't help yourself by letting someone know you need help. and now its too late for any accommodations and you feel shitty because it feels like its all your fault and like you're consciously making the decision to be a walking shit show.

36,"To start out I don’t really come from a bad background. My parents were always there and loved me growing up, same with the rest of my family. Never had a difficult time with any of that. Except for a divorce when I was ten. But now everyone gets along. 

I’m even in a good place physically. I go to a good school in a good program. Had an amazing internship last summer. I get decently high grades, was #8 in my class ranked by GPA for the internship. By no means is my life shitty. 

I am gay however. Most people at school and other friends know. I’ve been accepted with mostly open arms. There are a few people that still make jokes and threaten to out me to by family. Should probably mention that I’m not out to my family or and close family friends. It’s not that they wouldn’t accept me either. It’s just that I don’t want it to be a huge deal. 

That makes me feel bad because I know there are thousands of people out there who are either scared for their lives to come out or their family won’t accept them for who they are and that’s by no means what I am going through. 

I grew up mostly a loner. Few friends here and there but no super close friends who I was always over at their house having sleepovers or hanging out after school. I mostly kept to myself. Same thing in college. I have a couple people but I am in no means a social butterfly. Never go to parties or out with the guys. 

Besides all of this I still manage to feel down in the dumps at least daily. And it will go from having a great time laughing to being sad within 15-30 minutes. Sometimes it’s feeling bad for myself. Or just that I regret missing out on everything or whatever. I get this out feeling in my stomach and I feel like I’m under an insane amount of stress but nothing should be stressful. 

To complicate matters, I am in an industry where you need a license and a health form filled out by a doctor and one of the boxes talks about depression, bipolar and other things. I’m scared that if I go seek help that it will negatively impact my future career path.

I’m kinda stuck and don’t know what to do or whether or not I’m just being a whiny person or if I should go talk to someone. Sorry for the long post. 

TLDR: I have no reason to be sad whatsoever but I am. Don’t know why. ",13Dec2018,1

I'm really... scared?

I know I like her more than anyone else, but it just feels like shit, I have always been really closed about feelings and all that, not that I dont talk about them, I just cant really place them in sentences, like I just dont understand what the fuck is going on, and it's not just this, I almost always feel like I dont belong where I go, no matter how welcomed I actually am, which makes it really hard to connect with people, I dont really think I really connected with anyone in a big way besides my ex, and even then we had ""fights"" where it mostly went about me just talking shit.

39,"Hey, im a freak boy I wanna talk about myself Everyday I try to not punch my head They were too loud all the times, and I think sometimes they need to shut up, and get beaten up by myself I don’t like how my brains work He always think too kill himself sooner or later Sometimes it was going out of control, like drinking too much alcohol, or smoking too much until I spit some blood from my mouth I hit my own face, again and again until everything going bad for me to continue Blood starting coming up from my own mouth, it seems like I was having a bar fight or something and after that, I laughed till I can’t even remember. “what am I doing too myself” I think. But, I like the taste of my own blood.

 I am a monster, I’ll eat anything, rocks, paper, or even your computer It feels im getting crazier day by day I hope it will over sooner Im just a pain in the ass to everyone, hope that I just disappear from this life Sometimes it’s get better when you got to see your friends, i can be happy, I laugh or being dizzy about something real like work or etc But having a desease like this was like fighting over an unbeatable enemies, it was just like a part of yourself that hating your ownself but at times you try loving yourself instead, what are those?

 I don’t know I know that you know what im talking about, if you ever through that/at the same place as I am. It was so hard to ask for help, you scream or crying on top of your bed, begging for your mind too stop this kind of thing, or even begging for your own life to your insecurity, and asking for your own forgiveness to everyone that loves you. It was so pretty damn hard to loving yourself being. Sometimes maybe you have a friend to laugh it off, but mostly of the time you feel like everyting is crumbling down, even your own girlfriend don’t even have any idea about it, unless you were the one who told her. I hope everything’s going well for you And if you can overcome this sickness, tell me how to do it, maybe I can listen to you and not become an asshole who doesn’t listen to anyone, because I think I will always on this stage, waiting for my own hopelessness to gone, without doing anything at all. Until then, I will keep my fist up for my own head, in case something bad passing through my mind. Hope that you will understand me, have a good live, and please remember, hurting yourself physichally or mentally was not appreciated by other people, it will hurt people that love you. If you stuck just like me, who can’t even bother to cutting/punch himself, I hope you find the way into it, I know it sounds pretty hard, but I really do hope so. Give yourself a chance, a space to rest.

 Something “bad” always popped out inside my mind, so I think, I will buried my head on the deep sea-floor, so I can walk blindly into this path of abyss-life without feeling any emotion. life is really beating myself up everyday and everytime, I hope everyone who has this will get out from there as soon as possible, don’t mind too leave me as I be right now, I can’t change I think, I guess.

I quit smoking cigarettes last year, and since then I have been having bouts of what I can only describe as psychosis, general paranoia, fear of simple things, and I keep getting images of people getting hurt by me in my head but I have been isolating myself for the last year trying to assure I dont hurt anyone.

I dont know what to do i told my therapist and ig shes going to check for autism, brain damage or chemical imbalances. 

But I am wondering what should I do, I am living between my families and friends houses (basically couch hopping) and I have really bad depression like even with my antidepressants. But everyone is having issues with me unable to work and the fact that I dont leave the house (other than for groceries and therapy). I haven't left the house in over 8 months other than necessitys, if I could do online therapy I would

44,"For some reason it occurred to me that I have almost no relationships in my life and my current relationships are atrophying. I am a university student so I figured that I should have lots of people around me, or even just a good amount. I decided to make a chart of all the people I interact with on a weekly basis, the nature of our interactions, my thoughts on the interactions, and the persons relationship to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1: Roommate/Friend: Forced in-person interactions, usually unenjoyable. Discord to play games with others, he mostly annoys me now but is my oldest friend: Last contacted Dec 12.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Mom: Family: Google Duo, reminds me of home, makes me happy, tells me about happenings in the family and sends me videos and pictures of my dog: Last contacted Dec 10.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2: Friend: Discord, I play games with him and others. Enjoyable. Last contacted Dec 12.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3: Friend: Discord, Play games with him. Sometimes enjoyable. Last contacted Dec 12.

&amp;#x200B;

\#4: Friend: Discord, Also play games with him. Sometimes makes me angry but otherwise enjoyable. Last contacted Dec 12.

&amp;#x200B;

\#5: Friend: Discord, Never met in person but plays games with me and the others. I have a completely positive opinion of him. Last contacted Dec 11.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, most of my interactions are with a group of friends on Discord where we play games together most days. For one-on-one voice conversations, I only feel comfortable talking with Mom and 2. I'm not overly close with any of these people except for Mom. I do have a Dad, Grandparents, and siblings, and while I view them positively, we have almost no interactions (limited to a brief checkup every few weeks). I spend all of my free time browsing the internet, playing video games, and watching Twitch and YouTube. I have had girlfriends in the past but I don't really know how I got into those relationships so I can't follow any sort of formula other than ""talk to girls and see what happens"". I have several acquaintances from university but contact outside of class is nonexistent, and now that the semester is over I wouldn't be surprised if I never saw most of them again.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing started when I was writing an anonymous post to my university ""confessions page"" (embarrassing I know). Here it is in case its relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

""Have you ever gotten out of a bad relationship and just decided to not even look in the general direction of the opposite sex for over a year? I get anxious at the thought of going anywhere and always feel like there is something separating me from the people around me. I can't explain it but it feels like there is someone watching me whenever I leave my room. I've limited in-person interactions with friends and family down to a bare minimum and I sometimes find myself feeling that my previous and unhealthy romantic relationship was preferable to my current loneliness, which is weird because I've always been reclusive. Having one person to contact daily and build a deep connection with was really nice. I bet that a complete and extended lack of physical contact, sexual or otherwise, isn't good for your health and hugging a pillow at night can only go so far as a substitute. The idea of having lots of people wanting to hangout and talk with you seems so weird to me. I keep in weekly contact with about 5 people in total and sometimes find that even so few relationships is too many. I, through no fault of anyone else, sometimes wish I could finish school and cut contact with everyone in my life. I don't hate my friends and family but maintaining relationships is difficult for me. Good luck with your exams everyone.""

I don't necessarily feel \_sad\_ about having so few relationships and really only having a deep relationship with my Mom, but I don't think its normal for a 19 year old to be essentially a social recluse and hermit. The post above does okay to detail my current mindset but please ask if something is unclear. I don't think I'm in danger of hurting myself or others so I'm not worried about that, but I am curious to see if anyone can relate or offer some wisdom. Apologies for the wall of text...

I was literally in the middle of helping my friend buy Christmas presents for them, so naturally it cut really deep, these people are like family to me. Lately I've been dealing with a loss of deep significance to me and it's made me see things a lot differently, I try to make every day matter and spend it with the people I love and care about. I make an effort to remain close with what little family I have left and the friends that have stuck by me for years, and it really hurts when I find out they have such nasty thoughts about me. I can't exactly cut this person completely out of my life either, as them and my close friend are related and I spend holidays with them a lot. Which brings me to my next point, the last time I saw this person was the last holiday and we got along just fine. I really don't understand what I did, and I'm always the type of person to beat myself up about these things so I doubt I'll feel better about it by Christmas.

I constantly have these intrusive thoughts that nobody likes me and they all secretly hate me and I'm realizing them to be true.

I'm starting to feel like no one gives a fuck or ever gave one about me, my emotions, or my mental and psychical wellbeing. I am no one's priority. Yet I dismiss these gut feelings until this shit happens.

I'd like to put an article together along the lines of ""12 People Share How Therapy Has Helped Them"" to hopefully inspire others to consider getting support (the article will link to and be featured on [this page](https://thewellnesssociety.org/therapy/)). 

Would anyone be willing to share their experience with therapy, how it's helped you and any tips you'd have for others considering therapy?

52,"I’m having a hard time due to an obsessive thought I had. I’ve had a thought before that didn’t really make me feel guilt but looking back at it now, it makes me feel extreme guilt and I wasn’t sure of how my reaction towards that thought was but my head is making me think it was something good even thought it shouldn’t have been. 

My compulsive instinct to relieve my anxiety would be “confession”, to my SO mostly and lately these compulsive actions took a toll on our relationship and I just wanna be able to hold it in til it goes away and stop bothering me. 

I just feel the need to tell them because it makes me feel guilt. But i know I shouldn’t cause it doesnt really affect whats happening now and I don’t like the thought now either. Also it might cause them to resent me or be sad.

Its extremely hard to live like this without income on top of debt I have.

57,"Hey everyone. I have a question for you guys. I’m sorry if this might not be the place but I’m having hard time with this and it is involving my weird brain. 

I have Bipolar and social anxiety. This little mixture brings me a nice helping of paranoia. Not full blown paranoia but enough to make me a full time really suspicious bastard. 

But when you get thoughts into your head, how do you tell what’s paranoia and what’s legit? In the past, whatever I got paranoid about I’d avoid at all costs. I know that’s not healthy but it worked. Till now at least. 

It’s to do with my wife. I won’t go into details (involves personal things) but little things have been said (about not trying to make me insecure) things being said would be done but not done, even after further discussion and time. These weren’t important things, but just repeating, many times, and annoying me. I’m starting to suspect there’s more to this than mere happenstance. 

So how do you guys tell if something is real or paranoia? To be perfectly honest, I’m hoping I’m being paranoid. My wife is usually one of the only people/things I don’t get paranoid about. I developed it after we were together. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",13Dec2018,1
58,"Hi all, I am a 25M - using throwaway because people know my reddit name. However, I am more just asking for advice. Basically, when I was younger, my parents spilt up and I'd spend half my time with my mother, and half with my father. My mother ended up becoming a drug addict and and prostitute, she moved through abusive partners where I was present on many occasions where I watched people (family members and others) get bashed and raped. I spent a lot of time living on the street, in situations where I was beat, etc etc. While this was on, I use to spend a lot of time on the internet watching a lot of shock videos, people getting killed (that type of stuff), trying to desensitise myself, always thinking about how great my situation was compare to these other people - and honestly, it worked. I then got into a relationship where my partner was really abusive towards me - she use to hit me in the head with bats and that until i was knocked out, I had to sleep outside, etc etc. (I'm sure you all know the type of girl). She had sex with my best friend just to hurt me, but we still dated for another 3 years .... (I'm an idiot - maybe abandonment issues from being a child) From then I started dating this amazing girl who just broke up with me - I also just had to quit my job, because the boss took me on a work holiday, got drunk, then tried to force me to have sex with him. I feel like I could go into a lot of details about things I have seen and been through - but I'm sure you get the situation from what I stated above.

I've seen psychologists (many) and it just does nothing. I also feel so detached from the whole situation that it does not feel it happened to me - it's like it's a dream. Although I am not depressed - not even in the slightest, I don't have any anxiety ... nothing that I would call mental illness. But, I feel like my brain is starting to be too full. Like, I feel like there is only so much fucked up shit you can see before there is no going back? And I am scared - I'm actually certain, that I've passed it. I think I am actually losing my mind. I don't think I can be normal. Or, I just feel like, unless something changes, I am going to go insane.

I just need to know. How to I stop this? What can I do to make me forget and move past what has happened. Or is it too late?",13Dec2018,1
59,"Im a high functioning depressive. Ive been depressed all of my life due to childhood trauma that has never been resolved. 

When i go to my doctor i had to ask and then insist that im put on a list for cbt. They then tell me they have nothing else to help me because i said i dont really want to go on meds (i dont think its okay the gps can have a 10 minuet conversation with you and then ram you on some meds that dont work and every time you come back to them for checkups they dont care and you get a different doctor every time).

 I then went through a charity for councilling where they made me tell them about all of the really shitty things that had happened in my life, dragging up all of my past trauma only to tell me that they couldnt help and that i should go back to my drs and talk to them and ask to see the same dr every time. I LIVE IN A LARGE CITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE MEDICAL FACILITY TO TAKE EVERYONE I WOULD BE LAUGHED OUT OF THE GPS IF I ASKED THAT I SEE THE SAME DR EVERY TIME. 

I feel like im going round in a loop and realising that the drs dont care. And dont have the capacity to help me. Is it any wonder that suicide rates are up and depression is rife.

I am trying to adress a problem that should have been dealt with as a child but like now as was the same then theyd rather i just swept it under the rug and pretend it didnt happen.

Furthermore the reason i appear so high functioning is because i ignore my condition so not only is it hard to get a drs appointment but its hard enough for me to admit i need help, pick up the phone in the morning, talk to someone about it, talk to a gp who dismisses my thoughts and just asks me the same routine questions every check in, to confirm and fight for the right  have to medical treatment, which is often needed all whole my brain is telling me that i am not good enough and that i should just give up and give in to my darker urges because then at least the drs would have to act.

Why do we need to be dying or a danger to ourselfs before we receive treatment. Why do we brush away trauma and hope it doesnt resurface and only when it has torn through our psyche laying waste to everything that we once were as a person thats we are then recognised as damaged and in need of patching up.",13Dec2018,1
60,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post, but I honestly have no idea who I'm supposed to ask for help. (In case it matters: I live in Germany.)

I've been in therapy for depression and SAD for about two years. During this time, I've made lots of progress and I'm generally very happy with my therapist. The past few months have been extremely stressful for academic and family-related reasons and I've managed to navigate them okay-ish, but I've been losing too much weight during all of this. Things are looking better now; the problem is, I have emetophobia, which makes it very hard to gain weight. Instead of putting the weight I lost back on, I'm just losing more of it. I'm terrified of eating before I have to go anywhere (unfortunately I work afternoons-evenings, so I usually only eat a pretzel at noon to tide me over until 7pm), can't eat outside my own home and don't want to try things I've never eaten before because I often have actual physical symptoms like nausea, stomach cramps and severe diarrhea. To be clear, I do not think I'm fat or ugly. I liked my body before I lost those 25kg and I'm tired of having to buy new clothes because none of mine fit me anymore. I'm underweight, I know I'm too thin, I just don't know what to do about it. My friends and family are seriously getting worried. At this point, eating until I'm full always makes me physically sick. I have a very limited range of ""safe"" foods. 

My therapist thought my symptoms pointed to a physical reason more than a psychological one (since I'm handling my other disorders pretty well), so I've had a gastroscopy done just to make sure. I had a minor gastritis, nothing more. Afterwards, my doctor's reaction was mostly ""Well there's nothing we can do about it then, just try not to lose any more weight."" Both the doctor and the therapist agree that I'm going to be fine once I have a stable job and can move out of my dad's house, but if I'm very lucky that's still at least three months away and I'm honestly scared that it's going to get a lot worse until then. 

I know something's wrong with me, but I'm hesitant to call it an eating disorder because I think I'm ""missing"" a lot of the usual symptoms. I need help but I don't know where to get it. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",13Dec2018,1
61,"I'm (18, M) kind of skeptical if I will ever be cured. My symptoms of depression and anxiety are managed, with the help of Lexapro (which I started 5 1/2 months ago) and Seroquel (which I started about 4 1/2  month ago), but most of my days are just, well days. 


There is nothing special about them most of the time I just feel like I exist, neither good nor bad, just the purest form of okay. 
I still have the illnesses, and they still weigh me down. 


I'm happy if I'm with my girlfriend, I enjoy my friend gatherings. But the only other time I feel significantly happy besides that is if I'm doing recreational drugs, now the only common drugs I do are Weed and Whippits and Nicotine, I stopped doing Hydrocodone when I started actual treatment (6 month ago), I don't have a problem that I became a narco addict for over 3 month until starting treatment for my mental illnesses, it was probably the only reason I didn't commit suicide back then. 


I just drift through my school time, not motivated to do anything or contribute in any way, after school I just play Computer games until I go to bed if I don't see my friends or SO my days are just that, I don't have the motivation to do any homework or study, my grades are mediocre. 


I recognize that I'm incredibly better for the past 4 month, with no intent of self harm what so ever for that time, my PHQ9 went from 24 to about 5, where its been for the past 4 month, and my GAD-7 went from 20 to about 6.

It is  just that there have been no other improvements, since then and it has been stagnant, I'm not unhappy where I'm at, I'm simply not happy. 

Anyone have any suggestions with this kind of thing? I don't know about this any further, at this point I guess I will go on living hoping it gets better then this one day, like the heavy depression got better one day. It might simply be a matter of time.

64,"Hi guys, so I'm 22, currently living at home after a recent break-up while I apply to Graduate schools. I'm in therapy for various reasons, but one of the biggest is that both my parents have Destructive Narcissistic Personality disorder. This is something I've only learned recently, but the whole thing has really consumed a lot of my mental energy, making me think and rethink my decisions, interactions, and word choices with other people. For example, I'll say no to driving a friend 4 hours to get their car because it has no benefit in it for me and I really don't want to, but then I'll worry that this is actually just egoism that was drilled into my subconscious by the people who raised me. This sort of worry seeps into a lot of what I do. My question is: how do I look to stay healthy and keep myself from falling into the rabbit hole of worry while living with my abusers? (And I can't leave, I don't have money or a job that could support me).  


My therapist recommends ""thought stopping"" and replacing the worrying thought with something more positive, but sometimes, especially when dealing with narratives such as ""I'm selfish"" or ""I'm a bad/ignorant/worthless person"" it's hard because I was taught these were true most of my life. I want to become a loving and caring person who looks out for others and supports their relationships unlike my parents, but it just feels so far away, like I'm stuck in this narrative.",13Dec2018,1
65,"Hey there! 

So I am diagnosed Bipolar 2, depression, and PTSD. I fight with these illnesses every day and I think I would benefit from more recognition that mental illnesses are real diseases and should be treated the same as other illnesses as far as insurance, occupational, and educational environments go. I am looking to start a project in 2019 that will help raise awareness for mental illness and try to achieve this recognition. I know there are a ton of advocacy groups out there but I want to focus particularly on violence prevention through mental health. I really don't think enough campaigns are focusing on this and I think it would be a good way to get the attention of people who think mental illness is all in our minds and maybe even touch some religious groups who are against medical treatment. I'm looking to work with government officials, doctors, government analysts, and particularly people who associate with gun rights groups whether they are for or against. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to get in touch with individuals who are interested in helping to get this campaign going in 2019 and share their ideas and resources as committee members. I am New England based but will be looking to spread this campaign nationally so I would be happy to talk with any interested parties living in the US. ",13Dec2018,1

But still it seems my emotional investment, more than most, can be discerned. I don't want to make others feel uncomfortable, and I want to maintain these emotional outlets.

67,"I made a Reddit account just so I could post this- I'm not sure if this is even the right place to put it but here I go- 

One of my friends suggested that I should go see a therapist, I'm trying to find one (which I know may be hard because of how bad our town is, I'm probably going to have to catch a ride into the city) but they also suggested I post on forums to get some help too if I couldn't find one, I'm doing this meanwhile-

I'm not really sure whats 'wrong' with me- Sometimes I feel like I'm different people, I kind of thought maybe I had something like Dissociative identity disorder, but after looking into it, you have to have amnesia for that to happen, and that's never really happened to me- well, not technically? most people have described it as blacking out but the only time I don't really remember stuff is after some time has passed- 

right before grade 5 I got taken out of school for homeschooling for three years (im not really sure why), and I don't remember anything that happened over those three years, and even before grade 5 I still can hardly remember stuff- some of the stuff I do remember, I feel like sometimes that wasn't me- I know it's been a long time and maybe iv just changed? from the sometimes, I do remember I would sometimes drown grasshoppers in bowls of water, and I was very protective of my stuff, threating to kill them and hurt them if the broke or even just touch sometimes, and i was very loud- Nowadays I'm too afraid to tell a person ""please don't touch that"" if they do something- I hate it when I hurt things, I accidentally closed a window on my dogs tail once and I cried for almost an hour even though he was completely fine i just felt so bad- im almost always scared and I don't know why, no one has ever hit me before but I feel like people would if I said something they didn't like. when I feel like im one of those other people, they don't actually have a problem with telling people to stop doing that when im uncomfortable, they also aren't afraid of the dark- when I walk into a room I always a bit worried because I see shadows move, but when they walk into a dark room it's almost like when I walk into a light room, it's fine-   
when I was also yougner- although I'm not sure if this was when I was in school or not- I had this friend who was a year younger then me who always wanted to do sexual stuff- I hate thinking about this because I was the older one and I felt like I should have stopped her but at the same time she was younger than me and could always put the blame on me instead- we would make dolls have sex as gross as it seems but then she wanted to do stuff with real people. I should have stopped. we never took our clothes off- and I remember one day I was at her house and I was watching a movie with her out of nowhere's just grabbed my boobs- I walked out of that house that day. 

I thought I may have OSDD-1b but I'm not really sure what would count as being traumatic? recently I accidentally stained the sink and my father yelled at me, not exactly what he said but it was along the lines of 'if you where born at the time I was I would have beat you' and it was like some kick in the face and it was like someone told me that not the first time he's said that- I can't remember the other times he's told me that but I know it's happen to me before- something I haven't really remembered before-

about my personality or alters(?) iv never really heard them talk but it's like I kind of know what they're thinking- iv only kind of known about them for a few months now- there was a time when I was out in the forest next to my house and I was just having fun, and there was a laugh, like a happy laugh from female- and I'm not sure if it was a bird or not but I kinda felt like it was from one of my alters, that's kind of like a mother figure- it was weird. when I feel like one of the other alters are there I don't feel like iv completely lost control of my body- it's like I'm still kind of there. there have been times where one of them is up front and I keep thinking 'say out loud that your (my own name)' and they have said no- there was also recently when I was in class (im back in school now) and I felt one of my alters get excited- and I touched the side of my neck and I could feel how fast my heart was pumping and I went to the bathroom trying to get calm- but it was like I was actually calm but my alter wasn't- so my heart was racing but I was calm- if that makes sense? im not sure- it doesn't really even make sense of what happened to me to be honest 

my head is starting to hurt- probably from writing this all down, im still not really sure what's going on- I may have OSDD-1b but I still feel like I may be missing symptoms of it- maybe it's something else- maybe I'm just trying to deny it? I'm not sure what's going on- maybe I'm doing something wrong? If anyone has some ideas of maybe something else I have that I could try and look into please tell me- I just wanna try and figure out whats going on-

68,"I've been posting to numerous, job related forums about working conditions and such. Mainly my ambitions to seek out a new career where I've got more time off to do other things apart from work. I've also posted about frustrations related to various, repair woes with numerous items/things I use everyday.  
The discussions could get quite heated at times and I'll admit there's some anger coming from my end. But out of nowhere, the replies to some of my threads have included either suggestions to get mental help, or some person telling me to keep the number of the National Suicide hotline available. I've since reported these posters as being abusive and not of any help at all. At the very least, usually blocking them as well.  


So while I'm not knocking the mental health providers and places of treatment, I honestly think it's an insult when treatment is suggested. If anything, someone might actually need help.

**TL;DR** my therapist tells me that for every ‚‚bad behaviour‚‚ there is a certain gain that we aim for on some deeper level. I guess it is something I am trying to prove to myself, but I can't believe that it's such a silly thing as ‚‚nobody will ever love me‚‚ which I adopted as a defense mechanism during my lifetime.

First of all English is not my first language so thanks for your patience. I tried to use Grammarly for assistance.

Last time I spoke to my therapist we started with an interesting premise. Whatever, laziness or procrastination, bad thing I do it is because I am ‚‚getting something‚‚ out of it. This concept is not new to me, cause I happen to live with a few psychology students throughout my lifetime. I don’t have any special example of this, but being that psychology is such a deep and profound exploration of the human behavior I was ready to accept this premise and work with it.

For those who are reading this, I can presume that you have actually asked yourself this before. After a recent breakup, I started self-analyzing just to get myself prepared for the next therapy session, and the question I asked myself is why do I let girls treat me badly during the course of our relationship. One of the conclusions I came through is that: I am getting something out of it. Some kind of confirmation at least.

I hate psychology because of these ways of looking at things. Cause if I am getting some kind of confirmation it would be somewhere along the lines of: *By letting people (girls) treat me like thrash, which imminently leads to a breakup, I am trying to prove to myself* (some deep and old notion, you know how psyche gets) *that nobody will ever love me*. This is why I don’t like the science of psychology (or whichever branch in particular) because why would anyone start with such an ugly and unreasonable thesis. What is there to prove? If you asked me now, my sober rational analytical me thinks like this: Some people will like you sometimes, and other won't ever, from the start, and some people will love you for a period of time it all depends on your qualities (something that my therapist also challenged) and aspirations of other people and that’s it. You can’t predict love, especially in such the timeframe of infinity.

Or is this just a game that I play with myself for the sake of it that I\`m afraid of commitment and that I start these relationships even, though, from the start I can see some signals that it\`s not going to work out, but I keep going at it just for the benefit of gaining some cheap thrills (not being alone, social status or sex)

\*as Woody Allen puts it in his joke in Annie Hall - just cause I need some eggs.

A bit about me. I grew up in eastern Europe during the nineties, and I can remember some teenage phase of self-deprecation and self-pity, but I mean come on I was young and I don’t fall for that anymore. \`\`That\`\` being the message being transmitted through pop media at the time (there is no such thing as love and devotion etc). Especially now when I am more experienced and I have ways to explain the world around me, rather than just reacting to it. Or am I just a cynical bastard, who suffered a few letdowns, and is now coping with ways of trying not to get hurt by holding back and preparing myself for disappointment.

Do this is my question. Have you experienced something similar and would you like to contribute some insight and how deep does this self-analyzing hole goes?  


PS I don't want to sound arrogant but I would like to treat this entire ‚‚what are you getting out of this‚‚ as a thought experiment, for the sake of Reddit as the medium, I really wouldn't like to get a bunch of ‚‚this notion is so stupid and unnecessary‚‚ replies. If you have and an additional way of looking at things please submit it, but for the time being, don't critique the way of self-analysis that I chose. ",13Dec2018,1

78,"i've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder for almost three years now and have been off and on medication. i made the executive decision in february of this year to quit my meds cold turkey because i felt that they weren't making much of a difference and at that point i was heavily relying on marijuana to manage my symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

it's been about 10 months since quitting medication and recently i've noticed a sharp decline in my mental health. granted, i have been under a lot of stress since september what with managing college courses, adjusting to living alone for the first time, and dealing with a few bouts of (physical) sickness. however, i have reason to be concerned with the new symptoms i'm experiencing due to their sudden onset and intensity.

my anxiety has increased tenfold. basically to the point that it has evolved into paranoia and delusional thinking. i've never been much of a hypochondriac but the past few months i have become obsessed with pinpointing minor bodily changes or physical ailments and researching them excessively. i've gone through phases where i convinced myself that i had MS, diabetes, blood clots, etc. like there's no middle ground, no reasonable explanation, i just jump to the most extreme conclusion without thinking rationally or even consulting a doctor. on top of this, i've become fixated on the notion that i am pregnant. my mind travels in circles around this idea, i lie awake at night stressing about the possibility that i am pregnant. i understand that this is a normal thing to worry about, but i am on birth control and have taken two negative pregnancy tests this month. i've been having a normal monthly period, yet it is the only thing i can think about. i spend hours online browsing through pregnancy forums and articles, googling symptoms, even going so far as to think that every time i see an ad on TV for baby items or every time someone brings up pregnancy in conversation that it is directly targeting me. that it's a ""sign"" from the universe that i MUST be pregnant. it's gotten so bad to the point that i had a full blown panic attack during sex with my boyfriend because i couldn't stop imagining myself carrying a child and giving birth.

my paranoia also extends to everyday interactions. i worry that my friends are conspiring against me, that they keep me around out of pity and don't actually care about our relationship. i think that people are staring at me in public or gossiping about me while i walk by. the stress from these delusions has caused me to slip into dissociative states on multiple occasions since around september. one of these episodes occurred while i was driving, causing me to almost crash my car and take a trip to the emergency room. 

basically the reason i'm sharing all of this is that i need some advice about whether or not it's worth it to go back on medication. i hate the whole process of trying to find a brand that works, a dosage that works, dealing with side effects, etc. i've looked in to trying to use CBD (i've greatly decreased my marijuana usage for personal reasons) so if any of you have experience with that, was it effective? and in the mean time, what are some coping mechanisms i can try to use to curtail the paranoia? any advice would be greatly appreciated",13Dec2018,1
79,"I often zone out and literally think out loud. There's always some scenario playing in my head, and I always manage to speak or laugh out loud as I am 'playing my part' in my head. I will literally start having a little conversation in real life with someone who isn't actually there.  

As a child, I would constantly create these different worlds in my head with made-up characters and it would constantly just play in my head like a movie, and it was a big problem in school. Nowadays, I just play these more realistic, made up scenarios and it still gets in the way of my productivity. I thought it was just normal, but people are always freaked out by how often and intensely I zone out. 

I was diagnosed with mild ADD a few years ago; could it be that? I'm not sure I fit the symptoms of maladaptive daydreaming, but I found out about it recently and I've become curious about that, as well. Am I maybe just totally normal and overthinking it?",13Dec2018,1

81,"Sorry if nobody cares about this, I just want to get this out. About 3 months ago I started randomly feeling like shit. Basically I started quitting most of my hobbies, sleeping all afternoon (but being tired anyway), generally feeling like shit and sometimes randomly thinking about just horrible stuff. I just can't stop thinking sometimes and I need to get it out but nobody ever listens. Well, maybe you guys will so here are some of the things I've realized/thought about lately.

Everyone I know and care about will leave eventually. Both my best friends from primary school are gone, one moved across the country the other won't talk to me anymore. I met some of the best 3 people that I have ever known in Spain earlier this year but the Whatsapp group has been silent for weeks. I'm terrified of loosing them. The only people who have ""stuck around"" are my parents and generally people who are a lot older than me and...well...all of them will die long before me. I'm just starting to wonder if having friends is even worth the pain of loosing them.

I also think I know why I sleep so much. Part of it is being constantly exhausted of course but I think it's also because I just don't want to be awake. It's the best distraction ever. When I don't have a distraction I freak out. I do whatever I can to not be alone with my thoughts. Sleeping is like a free trial of not existing which is exactly what I want to do. There is one thing in the near future that I'm looking forward to a lot but after that I don't know what to do...life is just not worth it. It's long stretches of boredom, stress and worrying with the ocasional happy or absolutely devestating event in between.

I hate the place where I live. I hate how painfully familiar everything is. I hate how I don't ever see the sun in the winter. I hate the ugly, grey sowiet housing blocks that are absolutely everywhere. I hate how people are such huge assholes for no reason. I hate how when you smile, nobody ever smiles back. And above all I hate how I have to stay here for another 3 years.

I can't be thrown in without training and pick up on stuff like most people. Bad managers seem to flock to me wherever I go as well. Because I can't handle the conflict and confrontation verbally. I'll be blamed for anything that could go wrong related to me or not and given all the worst tasks

83,"I (20’s F) have become acutely aware of an internalized sense of shame. Recently I destroyed one of the healthiest relationships I’ve been in. I finally accepted that this shame is the product of being humiliated by a caregiver I had in pre-school. I was “caught” engaging in what I now know was normal harmless sexual behavior. I remember being pulled out from the private bathroom and being left to sit alone in the lobby.

I hadn’t realize until now what effect that experience had on me. My low self-esteem, destructive behaviors and perfectionism have made emotional stability an uphill battle. I struggle to empathize, mature or have any real sense of joy or agency. I have an intense fear of abandonment and a loose sense of identity.

I do not mean to do this, I get so caught up with what’s going on in my head that I sometimes forget that I have people around me that are willing to listen.

I have tried cashier jobs at gas stations, and other stores and tried jobs as a parts picker at a car dealerships so far.  I can't handle stress, I break down and cry and can't even remember my own name fairly quickly. It's hard for me to even go outside at all job or otherwise.. I have little experience with people and I'm socially awkward and submissive.
   In the jobs I tried so far it did not go well for me. If there were nasty people they found me. If there was a bad manager they spotted me from miles away, and that went for co-workers as well..  Customers , that one bad apple out of 5 would pick me apart the second they realized I was vulnerable. Wind up getting blamed for mistakes I don't make, being assigned the worst work  I shouldn't be , and making costly mistakes because I'm dazed and can't think straighth. Such as losing money to people that tricked me or pushed me for reduced prices, etc .   
I want to work, I'm not bad under no stress and no one breathing down my neck but that's not a realistic situation.  Not saying all people arenas but the ones that are have a field day with me. I'm not self interested bad have no self esteem or confidence. I wish I could be like most people and be concerned about my own interests with a high sense of self worth (based in reality or not ) but it's not there.

Atm I've been doing what I can. I apply to jobs online, like appen , I work on amazon mechanical turk ( it's a microworker site). For about 6-8 hours a day and average like 30$ atm.  Not good enough but better then laying in bed and accepting defeat for myself. I workout at home very day after I finish up on the computer. Do chores for my family that I'm.staying with. And that's my routine atm. Better then in the past but not good enough .. I've tried meds and nothing has worked. A cocktail of trying to deal with the attention and thinking  issues , the bipolar mood swings, and the anxiety is worse then it's worth . Stimulants, anti depressants, anti seizure drugs.. But then the opposite for the anxiety.. It drove me more close to being crazy then helped me tbh. No that it matters atm because I lost my insurance when I turned 26 anyway.

92,"So, I've known Reddit for some time now, and I'm not sure if this is even the right place to post this, but I just want to share this with someone so here goes. 

I'm in my teen years. I've gone through a lot in my life, my father abandoned me when I was very little, and moved to another country, so I don't really see him at all, and to be honest, I kinda like it that way, I don't really consider him my father, he's done a lot to me and my mother, so I have my reasons. 

I've always had social problems. It's difficult for me to establish new friendships when I go into a place where u don't know anybody, and usually stick to the one person I know in the place if there is one. 

A couple of years from now, I started developing anxiety. (It's not diagnosed, but it is what it is) I worry too much about not only what people think, but the way I act too. I believe that I have to carefully choose my words in a conversation with my family in order to be accepted, and I know that is wrong, but I can't stop that.  I also worry about everything being in it's right place. 

I'll give you an example: I recently got my cellphone fixed, and when they gave it to me, I started noticing a lot of features were missing, as well as the battery dying a lot more quickly than usual. I went to check it where i fixed it, and in a nutshell, they said that those issues were because the display wasn't an original one, nd there was nothing that could be done. I can not explain how much stress and anxiety this caused me, and I know it might seem ridiculous or even obsessive, but that's how I feel. It only got worse when I noticed that my friend (Who had the same problem and got his cell fixed) dis have those features, despite having a generic display. 

I just worry too much when my stuff don't work properly, and I don't know if that's superficial. Maybe it is. 

Getting back to the social problems, I'm afraid that I'm going to be this way all my life: Worrying too much about people's opinions about me, and not knowing how to act in situations.  I am aware that I shouldn't be like this, and that I shouldn't be so anxious about things that don't really matter, it's just that I can't stop at this point, and my mental health is worrying me. I am really going, and wouldn't like to live like this all my life. By one side, having issues with society in General, and on the other side, problems with superficial stuff, that isn't perfect, and is bound to have errors. I just can't bear with that. 

I'm sorry if I didn't make myself that clear, it's hard as he'll for me to express all of this that I feel, and it is even harder for me to resume it in a post (Because there's a lot more to say, but I would just bore, or despair you.)

Thanks for all those who read this up to this point, as I said, I only wanted to share this with somebody, and thought this was the best place. If this is the wrong subreddit to post this, please tell me which one is more appropriate. And if you have something to say about any of this problems I'm dealing with, I'm open.

Over the past 2 years I have started to notice that I don't have the self control and will power that I used to or what a normal person should have. Its definitely not noticeable to anyone; I'm happy, I eat fairly well, personal hygiene is great, I have great hobbies (Ultimate Frisbee and more recently photography), and I have a very loving girlfriend. However school is a mess. I find it very difficult to apply myself and do my school work. I will often sleep in late and miss my classes even if I didn't stay up the night before. Even when I do attend lecture, I struggle to stay focused and take good notes. I've just finished writing 4 of my 6 exams and I have realized just how bad this has snowballed, academically. I will likely fail at least one course and I sure won't be receiving great marks in the others.

More recently I have tried to figure out if this is worth talking to somebody about or if I just need to get my act together. I have tried to limit distractions, put timers and block social media, and change my studying location but nothing has worked. I haven't really told anyone, my friends and parents think I'm doing fine in school.

One time, about 5 years ago, I was on an antipsychotic medication that was known for being very safe and having few side effects. I will not name it here, because I don’t believe that telling others about my bad experiences with medication is safe or appropriate. This medicine helps millions of people; I was just in a minority of people who had horrible, devastating, contraindicative effects from it. This effect is possible because each medicine reacts uniquely in each person’s brain. A medication is prescribed based on the typical reaction it produces, but the typical reaction doesn’t happen to everybody. For me, this medication was very harmful, and it took several months for my doctor and me to connect the dots between my ever-worsening depression, insomnia, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, and mixed-state bipolar episodes to that medicine.

I was on this medication for five months, growing progressively worse. Every time I got worse, my doctor increased my dosage. I stopped sleeping more than 4 hours a night and fell deeper and deeper into a dark hole that was filled with overwhelming sadness and psychosis. By the time I got to the point where I had felt sincere suicidal desires for about a week, I started making plans.

&amp;#x200B;

It is snowing out and I haven't felt that at peace with myself, my life, and just everything else in a long, long time. I honestly started to cry when I was up in the woods (by the railroad tracks, which I have now dubbed as my ""second home"" since I am up there so much) because the snow was coming down, the trees were catching the snowflakes on their bare branches, and the ground was getting a little bit white. It was all just so beautiful and calming, and it made my whole week better. I really had a bad week with a LOT of stress and uncertainty, which is still there, but for the moment, it is lessened somehow. Our daughter is coming in from college on the 20th and will be home until mid-January. My hubby FINALLY got his first Unemployment payments too. That was a relief. I just feel so blessed to have a home right now, and food in my stomach, and a family that loves me. I wish everyone could have that...but I know that isn't realistic. Still, that would be a wonderful world! The kids are so excited that next week is the last week of school until the new year! I kinda remember those days lol.  


My disorder is still quite active, but I am not having much trouble with it today. It is easy to control for some odd reason. I don't want to talk about that though. :)

I hope everyone is doing well and I hope this made someone smile. I haven't been around here as much as usual. I have been spending more time with the kids and more time outdoors, so I have been keeping myself occupied and out of trouble for the most part.   


Thanks for reading all. I don't expect many replies, but I hope everyone has a good day/night!",13Dec2018,1
104,"Hi,

my girlfriend,who I have known as a friend through high school is a part of a divorced family,which brings it's fair share of problems, has an abusive sister that mentally even  a bit physically makes her life difficult. Add it to the fact that she'd been bullied in elementary school,which made her self-esteem turn to ash and made her outlook on herself twisted.

I myself am a student that wants to go study psychotherapy and counselling in very near future once I finish high school and I've been working on her self-esteem and outlook by just being a supportive guy,mostly alleviating her mental burden by listening and being the shoulder to cry on and the hug that she needs.

I am not yet a professional and I know psychological practics are not to be used on the therapist's friends and close relatives. I also know none,but it still breaks me to see her so broken and me being able to do so little from my side.(and yes,I've tried to persuade her to go to a therapist,doesn't wanna nor she'd have the money for it)

Is there something more I can do other then the things I've mentioned or is this the ceiling what I can afford right now ? ",13Dec2018,1

First of all. Yes I am drunk. And it’s Part of my diagnosis. I had a car crush a few weeks ago while being drunk. I‘m facing criminal sanctions. It’s ruining my future. I‘m so sorry about it but what can I do. I have no goals in life. Nothing satisfies me. I thought maybe I could become a professor but now I won’t. I don’t wanna work as a psychologist in a company that keeps people out of jobs because of their gender, religion, age etc. i‘m a psychology undergrad. I just wanna be good to the world. It feels like an impossible task. I‘m sorry to my parents. Really. I just wanna die from the bottom of my heart. From the bottom of my heart I just hope to die tonight.

112,"A friend (though the relationship is waning) has been showing signs that his mental health is failing fast. The first symptoms that I personally noticed was him talking to himself in the presence of people, including in the middle of conversations, and though that is relatively mundane it has escalated to grand conspiracies against himself involving the police, sheriff, and big corporations like walmart. 

I would call a welfare check but I am worried since he owns a few guns and is already violently paranoid of the police. I don't want to be the one who got him shot up by the police. I don't want to be the one that put those officers in danger. I don't want to be the one that did nothing and let a dangerous individual stay unchecked to the point that he does something horrific. 

What is the best way to move forward that ensures the safety of everyone. I know this ends with calling a police welfare check, but are there more intermediate steps that I should take?

113,"I've been dealing with depression since I was about 13/14. 21 now. I moved away from all my family, closer to my mom, and she just passed in June and that obviously didn't help. I've been feeling so very negative and depressed with 2 spurts of feeling ok for a week (in the last 4/5 months). I'm as far as planning a suicide after the new year. I was in the psych ward for a few days in February for suicidal ideation/plans and I really don't want to go back there. Ive been taking meds for the first time in a few years starting since that stay in hospital and I feel like they help me go through the motions but I still feel hopeless and depressed. I tried one therapist that wasn't a great fit so I'm about to start seeing another one.

My suicidal ideation is quite intense and my hope is all but gone even though I have things in my life that would be considered hopeful. I was wondering if you all might have any tips to not give up for being at such a low point.

114,"Ok so I’m very stressed from studying, I care about my subject just too much, I rarely let myself give up on smth or overdue, and also I’m a huge procrastinator so I end up doing urgent things at night, not sleeping well, worrying like A LOT, hating myself, etc. 

I also have a great boyfriend who always supports me. But at some point, I realized sharing bad feelings doesn’t help much so I said I won’t be talking about the bad stuff anymore and he respected it. Things got better but not for long. I started seeking his support again - or just responding openly about “how I am doing” (hint: I’m doing bad) - and now I just want to cry in his arms bc I can’t take this stress anymore. But I feel guilty for demanding that much support, for always being sad or irritated. 

To add more to that, we started our relationship as two mentally healthy individuals (or at least satisfyingly healthy) and I shared past experience when a person’s mental issues were just too much for me to handle. I fear that he soon will begin seeing me as mentally unstable (which I am, obviously) and won’t be able to provide so much emotional support. I ask him all the time if he feels alright to support me, and he says he does, but I still feel like a burden.

TL;DR: I’m super stressed, boyfriend is super supportive, I feel guilty for being sad and needy all the time. 

What do I do?

115,"I get extremely nervous when talking to people. It's ruined a lot of my friendships and I even had to take a break from my girlfriend (of about 2 months) recently because I hated the feeling of discomfort I got when hanging out with her and her friends even though she was awesome. I was honest with her when I told her I had to take a break and she said I seemed normal when I talked to her, but I think she saw something in me and was waiting for me to open up more and that was why she was with me. I don't like hanging out with friends because of nervousness and I feel like they're disappointed when I hang out with them because I'm not really fun, but I'm scared of seeming nervous so I do it anyways. I've talked about how I felt on forums and people have always said social anxiety and I thought that too, but there's some things recently that have made me doubt that. For example, I could go up in front of my class and do a presentation and barely feel nervous at all, or I could walk up to someone and say something embarrassing on purpose and it doesn't affect me. The problem I have is actually just socializing normally, I don't feel like I can do it. I feel socially inept. I hate it, I try to hide it by being confident in other things. It depresses me, I've thought about suicide because I feel like I'll never be happy because I'm unable to laugh and socialize with people. My problem is I don't think I ever learned how to socialize. I used to be super talkative, to the point where I constantly got in trouble at school for annoying my teachers, and as a result no one wanted to associate with me because I had the reputation as being the ""bad"" kid. This was until 4th grade when I became extremely anxious and just stopped talking, in the course of 2 weeks I went from getting called up to the office 3-4 times a week for talking too much to not at all. I lost all my confidence in everything, which I've regained some but not all. Whenever I try to do sports I end up just standing there trying to look like I'm just totally disinterested because I'm afraid people will think I'm bad at sports, I'd rather have my teammates and everyone yell at me than them see me try and fail. A lot of the time after hanging out with friends I would go home and cry because I feel like I'm always the ""worst"" friend, like my friends don't dislike me but they barely like me. Whenever I go out with my friends I feel jealous because I feel like they can all make jokes and laugh but I just sit on the sideline because I just can't do it because I never learned how to socialize properly. Sometimes I do try to socialize, but when I feel myself starting to get awkward I just say something edgy because then I'm in control of the conversation, even though the other person doesn't like me at least they don't know I'm completely socially inept and not confident. I act in such a weird way and I'm not sure if it's consistent with social anxiety and/or something else. I constantly feel like people have their attention on me, like if I'm taking a test I feel like everyone is judging me, but at the same time like I said I can present and not feel that anxious. I feel like I have more than just social anxiety, what do you think? Sorry if there was repetition I repeat myself a lot and I usually don't catch it when I proofread.",13Dec2018,1
116,"My mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when I was very young. She is now 44, and I am 19 in college. I have not seen my mother in person since I was 8. She does not live in the same state as me. She lives in an apartment by herself. The whole complex houses people with mental illnesses. My grandmother, my mom’s mother, has tried to get a case worker to help my mom out, but that was unsuccessful. My mom has gone under involuntary treatment several times. Everything my mom expresses is either an obvious delusion or a threat to someone, which is why I am afraid to speak to her. The last time she had my phone number was when I was 12, and I blocked her number because she called me at 3 a.m. talking about how she would murder my father. That kind of stuff. I want to help my mother live a better life. She does not trust her family except for her children, and even then it was scary to speak with her because you never know when she will have a delusion (ex: sometimes when I would call her, she would have a delusion 10 minutes into the call thinking she was talking to a random person, and she would start to yell threats).

I don't think i developed this hate of school later in life, because when i come to think about it, i remember i was not comfortable at kindergarten, i actually have a couple of memory events in my mind, i can recall i was always annoyed and never wanted to go to kindergarten, i hated waking up early to go there, i detested everything in there, from the schedules, eating there and doing whatever stuff that we were supposed to.

I remember i told my parents that the teacher(in the kindergarten) told us we will have a week off next week so we won't have to go, turns out the teacher never told us this, so i'm not sure if i imagined it or lied about it so i won't have to go.

The hate to school increased by moving up with the school grade, would fake being sick etc..

i remember one time at primary school, i had an accident, a car hit me, i was so happy that i won't have to go to school.

when i was a kid i have always envied animals because they didn't have to go to school.

Now in college, the hate is as strong, i skip almost all the classes, it has been a month without any class now.

By going to school i think i'm forced to do something i extremely hate, i really detest school, it caused me depression and deep sadness, i can't think straight nor be happy when i have to go to school, holidays are heaven for me.

in the school year of 2016/2017 i was living alone in a small place, that year i was so exhausted of college, it started from skipping a class, to not going to college the whole year, that year was the happiest year of my life, happier than my childhood, i did things i liked, i slept well, read books and i was just extremely happy, i wish i could do that again.

119,"I have always been on the pessimistic side; always expected the worse to happen. Growing up was stressful and disappointing for me; single mom, low money, moving around a lot, etc. school life was awful because I got picked on a lot, and college sucked because I was lonely, struggling academically, and broke. Graduated and got a job I HATED, which made me even worse off. I was used to not being happy.

Now, I have been working a job I love for almost two weeks and I get paid really good money. ALSO, I get off work at 3 PM as opposed to 6PM, so I have a lot more time to do things I enjoy. I’m also starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and life appears to be going a lot better for me.

Problem is, over the past week, I kept resorting to my bad mood because I feel like something isn’t right if I’m content/happy. I keep having thoughts that the world is SUPPOSED to be hard, and if I’m not struggling, I’m doing something wrong. I just get scared of being happy in life because my mind keeps telling me that I’m wrong and that it’s really an illusions. My mind tells me “People all over the world are struggling and you’re only comfortable for now, but your life will revert back to being bad like everyone else.  I just have never actually been happy in my life before and didn’t know it was possible.
