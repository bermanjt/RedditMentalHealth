0,"I started working full time when I was 21 in IT. I soon learned that working in IT is a lifestyle and not just a job. 

I've become depressed over the past couple years and just feel lonely. Am 23 and never had a girlfriend. Lost contact with most of my friends and I'm just lonely these days. I struggle to understand how to have a social life when working 45 hours a week and someone who struggles in social situations I find it difficult to know what to say and connect with people. 

I'm just lonely and wanting to vent. 

I tried therapy to help social anxiety to help me meet a girl (hopefully). But it didn't help. I'll try again but sometimes I don't see the point. Maybe I'm not meant to be with someone.  How are you meant work through personal issues while working full time. Life is just hard.",19Dec2018,1
1,"I am 19, and for the past week or so, I have been thinking about suicide. May be I am a little bored and depressed, because I have no money, so I can't just go out and have fun. I literally stuck in the house.

I really don't understand why I keep thinking about it. Nothing has happened in my life that would cause me to think about suicide. I know that I'll never do it, because I think it is pointless. If you are going to die anyways, why speed up the process? 

I am starting school and a new job next month. So may be once I start getting out more and meeting people, my anxiety and intrusive thoughts will subside. 

I know people who have been through 100x more stuff than me. If they didn't kill themselves, why should I? Anyone else experiencing this?",19Dec2018,1

It’s almost been a year since I was in the darkest place I could imagine and attempted suicide. At this moment I am finally off my antidepressants (citalopram), and I honestly don’t remember the last time I had a negative or suicidal thoughts. In the end this wasn’t with the aid of therapists or counsellors, but by my own strength in which I never thought I had even a piece of, to make the right decisions for no one but myself. I want this message to help people, as I remember feeling there was no way out of depression or crippling anxiety, yet for the first time I feel in control of myself and mental health and... happy?! You CAN do this, and for anyone who is struggling please do not hesitate to message for a chat. I have all the time in the world for you people, as you helped me so much. ",19Dec2018,1

32yo single male here. For a few years now I've slipping into a funk where I'm super lazy. The problem is motivation. And I really don't know to fix it. I really need to lose weight but can't find the motivation to exercise. I need to work on my house, but can't find motivation to do it. It's hard just keeping the house clean, and I'm the only one who lives here.

9,"Hey guys. This is my first time posting on here and I might be in the wrong forum but I was curious for some different points of view. Lately I have found myself very moody, like feeling the urge to cry randomly, especially at night, not having the energy to do things after work, so I’ve been spending a lot of time in bed on my phone. I have also been going to sleep really early, like 9-10 and waking up at 8 the next morning. By 3 I feel tired again sometimes but I can usually shake that sleepiness away by 5. I find if I’m laying in bed in the afternoon I start to get sad and start thinking about suicide even though I know I would never remotely even actually attempt suicide and I’m not actually sad for anything in particular and it usually just goes away. It’s weird because I keep contemplating dying a lot even though the rational part of me immediately is like dude why are you thinking about it but it keeps crossing my mind. Again, I would NEVER actually attempt anything but I just think about it. I know I’m not actually depressed because I don’t feel the same things I have heard from the many other people close to my life who have actually experienced the depths of depression. Anyway, I can’t tell if it’s just me being dramatic or if I should actually be concerned. The last time I felt this way was my freshman year of college a couple years ago but I was actually sad for a multitude of reasons. Right now my life is going pretty well and it’s just random illogical negativity that gets me down.

I guess I just wanted to post here to see if there’s anyone else on the same boat as me. ",19Dec2018,1
10,"So, even though I do a lot of self improvement shit and try to mentally strengthen myself by doing shit that sucks (like David Goggins), I have this immense feeling of loneliness and social dread, if you get what I mean. This feeling started when the friend group that I built my childhood with decided that they were better off without me, and they have their reasons. One of them didn’t like that I used to smoke weed, one of them thought I was untrustworthy (which when he cut ties with me it hurt more because of that) and the other one I just feel like she was always fake towards me. So since then I don’t have any close friends or anyone really that I can open up to. And I just feel unapproachable. Even though there isn’t anything really wrong with my looks or speech, I just hate my voice and the way I talk, I’m embarrassed to talk to the girl I like. I also don’t trust anyone anymore, not even my parents. This I feel is my biggest problem. How can I learn to trust people again? I feel isolated from the world.",19Dec2018,1

12,"I feel like no one gets me. 

There are some people who can relate to a few aspects of my problems, but no one really fully understands what I’m going through. 

Communication has never been my forté. 

As a kid, I was heavily ignored in my family. No one responded to anything I said or even tried to converse with me. 
Every evening, our family does a family meeting of some sort. Being the youngest child by 7 years, everyday, I was told to go to my room. I respected that I won’t understand some things, but because it happened everyday, I felt worthless. I constantly felt ignored and still feel so till this day. 

I know that my older sister is far more socially competent and the favourite kid, but now I think that my family only likes me for the reason that I am blood related. 

I gained this habit of rambling and being slightly aggressive to get someone’s attention with my family, but to no avail. 

The only time I started to feel listened to was a year ago when my sister moved out. But that made me feel worse because it just further confirmed my feelings of worthlessness. Now, whenever my sister comes back to visit, I again, become ignored. 

I know it’s my fault. I’m socially incompetent for my age. I was never able to make friends in elementary school and only made one or two friends with every school I attended. It’s been a year since I’ve moved to a new school. I only have two people that I consider friends. And I feel like I’m holding them back from having far better social lives. Compared to other 16 year old girls, I feel like I lack some sort of emotional maturity. I don’t belong. And it ain’t cause of bullying or discrimination of any sort. I’m just dumb. 

I’m never on the same page as anyone and I try my best not to make the same mistakes that I do with my family, but I end up having the personality equivalent to a socially awkward piece of cardboard. 

First I got really bad social anxiety and depression joined in later. 

For the past 2 years. I’ve wanted to kill myself everyday. I at least want to feel indifference with my life, but all I feel is dread everyday. 

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. 

I just want to know if someone can relate. ",19Dec2018,1

17,"Hi, we're both 22F. I've been very good friends with her about 7 years and we've always opened up to each other about all our problems. Recently she has been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety and since then I've tried to talk her through how she was feeling about the diagnoses (blaming herself, doesn't believe it, etc), I've continued sending her silly and stupid things I do in an attempt to give her a laugh or a distraction, and in most ways nothing really has changed about the way we talk. (We're now long diatance, btw) 

I haven't really dealt with this kind of thing before and would appreciate some pointers,

- Is it wrong/insensitive of me to continue sharing my problems with her? Would I be burdening her? 
- Any advice on how to best support her through this, esp considering we live in separate countries now?
- What are some things people commonly do in situations like these that are just terrible/make the depressed person feel worse? I'm scared to accidentally make things worse by trying to help lol

18,"Im a 19/M and as of recent I have been hearing a few noises that arent there such as the door ringer at work and on rare occasions (once a day at most), screams. Keep in mind the noise are all very faint, almost like as if I heard them in a dream so I know they're not just happening somewhere close by. The trigger to be seems to be when working on boring tasks or one which I don't like doing.

Some side notes I believe are important.

I have previously suffered from what I believed was exploding head syndrome where I was waking up to screams which 9nce again sounded like they were in a dream.

My family has had lots of issues with mental illness with one grandmother having severe dementia, another having severe schizophrenia and me and my younger cousin both having depression.

20,"A few months ago my boyfriend (I live with him since two years ago) went to the doctor due to some blisters that appeared in his body, they derivate him to a dermatologist and he told him that those blisters were a symptom of having one type of HPV. I have the vaccine for four types of HPV (the ones that gives you cancer and two more) so I am not worried about myself, as a woman I know how terrible could be to have uterus cancer but how good the vaccine is. 

After that moment his mood fell down. He started to be apart of myself by limiting our contact at the beginning, until one day the dermatologist told him that those blisters can be contagious so eventually my boyfriend preferred to stop having sex until they disappeared. It's been six months since the last time we had sex.

Among that time we have been through a lot of difficult talks. We have been feeling that our connection is getting weak, that we fight for stupid things that before we didn't, that we don't understand each other, that maybe we should be apart for a while, when before the depression was triggered never happened. Because of this, we always have in mind that despite all that we love each other and we want to continue being together. By this time my boyfriend haven't been diagnosed yet. We talked a lot about doing therapy, but didn't happen until now.

A week ago my boyfriend started to being treated with a psychologist were he has been diagnosed with depression. It makes sense with all the stuff we have been through but, what can I do to help him feeling better? What can I do to don't get in a bad mood too? How do I deal with can't being near my boyfriend?

24,"I have my OCD under fair control, usually. I'm no longer going mad from daily things, except at work.

My job has very defined routines. If you're in this position, you do these actions in this order, stick to this area, at this pace. If you're in a different position, it has its own order of actions, own area, own pace. I do very, very well in this environment. When everyone is experienced in their positions, it's almost zen. I'm laughing, joking, having fun.

We have a bunch of newbies. It's really hard. They break routine, which is immediately noticeable. They wander out of their area aimlessly and get in the way. Where no one should be, they are.

It drives me absolutely nuts. It's so minor and small, and I'm all for ""we get paid come hell or high water"", but it shakes my very core to see things done **wrong**.

26,"A little over a year ago, I started taking antidepressants (Zoloft). I started at 25mg, and today I am currently on 100mg. It has helped my depression drastically, anxiety significantly, OCD somewhat, and impulse control somewhat. My mindset has never been this clear and able to handle this thing called life, and I certainly don’t feel ashamed of taking them. 

I know there are common side effects to this, and that’s a given. Two of my main ones are having very low libido (which doesn’t even matter to me lol), and nightmares. Other ones I used to struggle with were fatigue, acid reflux (probably from not eating when taking it), and not having much emotion- but those have subsided over time. 

The nightmares are something that I could always deal with, and never really bothered me. Lately although, I’ve been waking up SOAKED in sweat and in panic from very realistic dreams. I’ve had these before but they are getting more and more oddly specific. I will be physically exhausted, emotionally distraught (ex. screaming) in my dream so when I wake up it feels as if it actually just happened. 

I then start to question why I am dreaming such odd things. Usually if it’s in the middle of the night, I manage to fall back asleep and then later can’t recall what I had dreamt. Or even when I do wake up and know what I dreamt, I often choose to forget what it was (if possible) and go about my day as I normally would. 

Just wondering, is this normal? Is there a way to help it? Anyone have similar experiences? It’s nothing I can’t handle, it’s just a bit uncomfortable because nightmares are always something that haven’t really phased me. Especially with the panic waking up. This has only started occurring in very recent months.  ",19Dec2018,1

I’ll list some.

* Huntington’s disease

* ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), or Lou Gehrig’s disease

* Parkinson’s disease

* Spasmodic Dysphonia

* Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome

They’re not having any medical tests, or being monitored with machines, they’re struggling with life, immensely even.

I’ve been dealing with a painful ovarian cyst for three weeks,flu like symptoms that won’t go away, so those are adding stress. Then comes the fucking holiday stress. I have NO money left. I’m completely broke. And I still have my parents and one of my nieces to buy for. And on top of that, I feel guilty, because it’s Christmas and I should be happy and I’m not and I hate it!

36,"For what feels like the longest time, I've wondered if I'm depressed, or if some truly ugly part of me just wants attention. Recently, I am obsessing over it a lot, and was hoping someone could help me out. I'm 17F, so a part of me wonders if this is just a societal thing, that everyone needs something to be wrong with them now. But at the same time, I don't know how I can describe what I feel.

I'm not depressed in the traditional sense. I am not overwhelmingly sad all of the time, and I can smile or laugh genuinely. But on the other hand, I am so fucking tired all of the time. Doing the most simple tasks take forever for me to do, and I'm not sure if it's me being lazy or something else. I used to love going out and doing things with people, and now all I ever want to do is stay in bed. Nothing can ever keep me from boredom, and I mostly just feel indifferent with everything all of the time. 

I don't really understand the point of living. Maybe it's an existential crisis, but I don't understand. When I die, no one will care, it won't matter in the long run. My life is meaningless. And since I won't remember any of it when I'm dead, what's the point? I think about suicide briefly a lot. Just seconds here or there, which is why I don't think it's anything. Everyone thinks about suicide right? I think it's a normal thing but don't really have anyone to ask. I'll never go through with it, but everyday when I'm driving home from school down this one big hill, I think about driving straight off the road, and how much better it must be for everyone in the long run. 

I can never keep friends, they all end up leaving me after about 5-6 months because they get bored with me or decide they don't want to be my friend anymore. It rips me up every time I think about it, cause I'm not sure why I'm not good enough. I have tried to change who I am or how I act a platitude of times, and yet it never lasts longer than a few hours and I just feel even more worthless. 

I feel alone, but don't mind it. I can't focus for very long before I get sidetracked into thinking about my future and how fucked it is. I'm constantly trying to find ways to escape myself, but when those ways can no longer help me, I'm lost all over again.

37,"I'm actually not really sure how to properly sum this up.



This is partially a vent that I'm getting off my chest but I am interested in hearing possible solutions.



I don't know why, but for some reason the person I am online is not who I am in my real life. It's not deliberate either.



I don't come online and decide ahead if time to act in a reprehensible manner. I am by no means a troll or anything like that.



I do admit that I have some real life issues. I am in a bad place in my living situation at the moment, combined with chronic stress, and I have Bipolar type 2, along with anxiety.



In real life, I'm pretty good at hiding my issues. At my job for example I am the funny person. I'm always telling a joke, chatting with my co workers, overall my public personality is friendly, and laid-back but at the same time very hard-working. I am one of those people who just doesn't feel right going home unless all of my work is done.



When I get online though it's like this switch gets flipped.



Instead of being able to take jokes to the point of making them about myself I become hypersensitive.



Where is the real me is completely fine with people having other opinions my online self is like ""Oh, you believe differently than me? would you please tell me why you are evil and hate all things that are good?""


My real self doesn't hold grudges unless someone has repeatedly stepped on me. I give people a lot of chances in real life, but online it's like if I'm crossed just once I hold a grudge like it's a contest.



Again I have no idea where this comes from. Whenever I do act like this online I feel horrible about it afterwards. 



I really do wish I knew the source of why I act like such a jerk online, or at the very least what I can. I'm not always like that, and usually I do maintain my more jolly personality up until the person I'm talking to does something to upset me. 


But still... I want to be as kind to my friends on the internet as I would be to my friends in real life. They deserve to see that side of me and they shouldn't have to deal with my weird, jerk, persona.

Are we in the clear? Of speaking Truth.  Yes.

Mental illness lol who is out there that can judge another's mentality? Ha! Biggest scam caught! Did you know enforced drugging in all around the world is making pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars? 
Hahaha don't be naive. Really.
Oh I forgot to say.
Per year.
Yap done the calculation myself.
Abilify the name. 500 dollars a shot per patient per month which comes to billions of dollars a year enforced legally by help from police to handcuff patients and enforce the injection.
Governments buy these chemical weapons from pharmaceutical companies based on reports made by psychiatrists of the effects of them and number of required stock for enforced injections.
You know what we patients say in hospital?
""Tell them what they want to hear.""
The results of the effects of anti-psychatic medicines that are reported to the government? Lies from patients are what that results are.
To get freedom back against illegal enforcement of mental health department which caused most of the attacks against mental health workers by patients.
Discusting creatures disguised as human,
Behind the face of we help people in need.
From patient's point of view?
See that garbage that needs to be burned?
After what they did?
Even burning them alive doesn't sound fair enough to say justice served.
That? Is the reality you never thought of.

Oh you think I can't give you example? LoL
Mental health department inside the hospital which the place is built for purpose of helping people with mental illness. Right?
Is a place where you are thrown in, by the yours truly, protect and serve the phrase that officer got yelled at for hour I think? Phew asked for water and took 2 hours til I got some juice. With handcuff on obviously, the entire time from home to hospital mental health department.
Ya someone knocked on the door so I answered and it was them. Came in and Handcuffed me. In my home yes. For a crime which I was certified by a psychiatrist. Well I did say I will bring the dead people back. Meh, e=mc^2:T=F/1 time travel. 
You want scientific explanation too? Anyways.
So 3 weeks of enforced hospitalization began~
Did I mention that I was able to get high for 1 month before I said that to him?
The anti-psychatic drugs that you heard of?
Most of them are completely focused for immunization of effects of illegal drugs.
Hence Mental health and substance use.
Case in point? Me.

I asked my psychiatrist in regards of me not getting high from weed. That was about 2 years in with abilify. 

He said he was not aware of such side effect. Guess what, its been year since,

Think about it.

That mother fucking piece of fucking cunt lied to my face with drug effect.

They learn that in school to become psychiatrist.

Intercepting signals of the illegal drugs that are what they suspect as the source of hallucinations or delusions. Get it?
Part of their so called education.
Not aware of such effect?
If I can? I literally want to rip his fucking heart out with my bear hands.
He should be happy that he lives in 21 century.
No consequence? Gladly. And painfully.

The anti-psychatic drug that I am enforced.

Heart infection.

See? They all deserve death sentence. ",19Dec2018,1
40,"Hello, I think I have an unusual degree of urge to disagree with people, especially when it concerns about or is implied about how one should behave. I would feel that the opinions could influence my memory and thus me if I don't voice my disagreement. I didn't have such kind of feeling when I was younger. However, during my middle school, I encountered several bullies, and I picked up a habit of arguing back. I am not sure if that was the start of this kind of feeling/logic.

These days, say someone says something innocuous like 'Oh, this is where things get interesting.' or 'This story just gets funnier!' or 'It's normal to be anxious at such events.', I would have a strong urge to voice disagreement although I probably wouldn't really say something like 'it's not funnier.' which sounds weird. There would be some weird logic in my mind like, 'interesting or funny is subjective, doing anything should be OK. If I don't say that interesting/funny/normal is just some subjective or personal feeling, I may be influenced to do what they are describing more, which I don't want.' 

When the college teacher says, 'You should be a little anxious about the exam, but don't worry too much about it.' I would just really want to say 'well, I shouldn't, anxiety doesn't help it. I would just do it instead of worrying or being anxious about it.' The urge is really strong but no one else seems to have such feeling at all.

Are there study on such feeling/desire to disagree? Do you have personal experience you would like to share about how you face different opinions on how you should behave? Thank you very much.

42,"I've posted on the sub a lot, but I find it is so helpful to talk to real people about this and hopefulyl someone else going through the same thing will find this useful. 

Quick background : Have anxiety and OCD, took Wellbutrin 150 XL for almost two years, great results, doctor switched it to SR once a day accidentally (which is malpractice- there's more explanation in my post history), made me have convulsions and extreme panic attacks, went on corrected dose for four weeks and was still having (decreasing) panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, OCD

I finally saw a psychiatrist for the first time a couple of days ago. He increased my Wellbutrin dosage to 300 mlg, which at first I was skeptical, though I do feel better these last two days. However, after twenty minutes of me meeting him, he declared he thinks I'm bipolar. 

Why?

\- My mother is bipolar. (Although in her older age the symptoms are pretty much non-existing, even without medication.)

\- When I was on the SR once a day for five days - which is against regulations - I'd occasionally get so anxious I felt like I had to get up and move to distract myself. 

He told me that if I have a manic episode on this higher dose, it means I'm bipolar.

Why on Earth he'd tell someone who has problems with hypochondria and specifically at this time is having an awful problem with OCD and repetitive thoughts this, I have no idea. Also... I was on the 150 mlg for almost two years without having a manic episode. Will increasing it really throw me into one suddenly? Also, isn't that just kind of a general side affect of Wellbutrin?

I guess my real question is this - I can Google all day what mania symptoms are, but does anyone have personal experience with it? What are some true tell tale signs?

Now everytime I feel better or ""normal"" or productive, I freak out and think I might be having a manic episode and spiral back into obsessive anxiety.",19Dec2018,1

I’m generally a really private person so I don’t want any images of myself or my interests on it. My ocd on the other hand makes me feel like I need to share just as much as I used to to balance out my dedication page from middle school.

I know I need to talk to a doctor, but there are no words for this experience. It's like trying to describe the spiritual side of an acid trip. It doesn't work if you're not there.

I cry just thinking about how kind and generous the people around me are and how much I love them. I'm curious if anyone has ever heard of a phenomenon like this, a long term and continually sadness surrounding the idea that you can't express the feelings which the people around you cause, how do you even begin to describe such a deep sense of appreciation and love.",19Dec2018,1
46,"I've spent a lot of my life scared of crying because of a couple incidents when I was younger (I'd say about four or fivish) and I have yet to talk about them. Talking has helped me a lot even when it makes me nervous or embarrassed and I really want to start improving on this so I decided to talk about it here.

My mom used to get really angry when I'd cry, I've always been really sensitive so not only did I used to cry a lot but anger/yelling has made me really scared for as far back as I remember.
So I began to start getting really nervous when I'd feel the need to cry (which is often) to me now actually getting sick whenever I begin to feel sad around people. My usual method is to hideout either in my room or the bathroom and get over however I'm feeling as quietly as possible and then come back and just pretend to have been grabbing something or something along those lines.
This was okay and it worked really well until my most recent girlfriend (ex now) who after being together for a while brought me to tears. I got really scared but I thought that it could be the moment that I start getting over my fear and that maybe she'd like if I 'let her in' but she didn't like it. She wasn't mean but she told me to stop or to not to not cry around her as I'd evidently make her uncomfortable.
It was okay, I understood that she probably had her reasons but it was embarrassing and hurtful nonetheless as to some extent I fantasized in my head that she'd tell me it was okay (I know it's silly but I really want someone to hold me when I cry and I sort of assumed that she would). 
When she finally broke up with me (over the phone) my voice cracked when I was talking to her because I was devastated that she was leaving me. And as soon as my voice cracked my heart just sunk so deep and I just hung up. 
Eventually she talked me into dating her again with a huge apology and I was really desperate for comfort and happiness after being so hurt for so long after our breakup. She even specifically said sorry for being cold when I cried in front of her and that she appreciated honesty and sensitivity.
So obviously I was overjoyed but of course I was just being stupid (I have grown enough since then to recognize my stupidity in a lot of this.) And so she broke up with me over the phone again about a week later.
Since then I've been struggling with crying at all and I feel like an emotional snowball that keeps getting bigger and worse inside me. When things would get bad or I'd get stressed or angry I'd always go to my room and force myself to cry it out but I can't anymore and I don't know what to do.
I've been completely over her for over a year now and I still can't cry. I just get too nervous to be able to. 
I've been feeling so overwhelmed and nervous and I really just want to be happy. I still find myself fantasizing about the same situation but lately I've been wondering if I'll ever find someone who's willing to hold me when I cry. 
I know how silly a lot of this is but it's been weighing heavy on me for a while and it's easier to talk about it without my identity attached to it in any way shape or form. ",19Dec2018,1

I want an actual scientific explanation, not just 'OooOOOOooH your third eye is opening!' Because even though I'm a spiritual person in some senses I don't believe in that stuff.

49,"So, my situation is a bit specific, so I'll try my best to keep it short in the hopes of someone being able to relate and give me some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, every aspect of my life started to feel so irrelevant. It's going to sound really dumb, but I wanted to explore new Youtubers and I started to watch a specific group of the new generation popular Youtubers (Dolan Twins, Emma Chamberlain, James Charles, etc..). They are all young (17-19, basically my age) and their success and ""projected"" lifestyle just made me SO envious. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has never happened before. I've watched YouTube for 10+ years at this point and I've always been a fan of popular artists, actors, singers, etc, but I've never in my life been envious of someone's lifestyle, I was well aware that more popular people aren't always the happiest. However, this time, It just hit me like a truck. Ever since I binged their videos, I just have this burning this desire to feel ""accomplished"" just like them. This leads to every single thing that I use to feel pretty fun (school, gaming, even watching TV) now feels SO irrelevant since it won't help me satisfy this desire to feel accomplished. I need to clarify that I have always been a relatively passive person meaning that I'm not the one to take risks and to do crazy activities, so feeling this way now is so weird, it's like everything's changed. But the worst part is I have no idea how to satisfy this desire of adventure and success. I feel like even a job in the field I'm currently studying won't satisfy this feeling. Right now, I just feel like flying away from my hometown, go on a crazy adventure and meet new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on winter break, and it's hard. I have all this ""free"" time, but I spend it depressing over the fact that I'm just a random person doing meaningless things. Also, I know that social media is toxic if you start comparing yourself to all these people who project a perfect and happy lifestyle, I'm well aware of all of that but my depressed feelings remain despite me knowing all of this. I really hope to hear advice from you guys or stories if you went through something similar.

55,"All my life I've been liked, loved even, by many.  Friends, family, teachers, fans/customers (I'm a content creator online), etc.  I have very few enemies, and have been multiple people's 'best' friend at different times in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I feel utterly and hopelessly alone.  It doesn't matter how many people *tell* me they like me, that I'm a good or even great guy - I barely believe them.

&amp;#x200B;

My living situation doesn't help this much, as I am self employed from my apartment, but even when I was at college or employed I still felt the same way.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been single for over 8 years now. I had two serious girlfriends in the past and am not a virgin, though it has been so long I feel virginal.  The very few women I've pursued in this time-frame were effectively unavailable (distance, interested in someone else, etc)  It seems like I've sabotaged myself out of shyness, fear of rejection, and laziness. 

&amp;#x200B;

My skin is extremely thin.  I ruminate over the smallest of insults or criticisms - most of which aren't even insults in the first place.  I can distinctly remember tiny comments from over a *decade* ago - unable to truly let go.

&amp;#x200B;

The close bonds I form always deteriorate, whether faultlessly (like someone moving locations) or from lack of upkeep.  Though in a couple of rare cases, there was a big falling out, for which I claim responsibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try to care deeply about people.  Perhaps too much.  I remember every detail I can about everyone.  I try to help them (when they want it).  Try to give nice personal gifts on birthdays/holidays.  Try to come up with fun things to do, and always pour all my attention into them when we visit.  And it works for the most part.  But when others don't match, (or don't seem to even try) what I put in, I quickly become resentful - which I bottle up until things fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like if I'm not praised every so often I just default to thinking I'm not good enough, regardless of what the truth is.  This is the case for virtually every aspect of my life - looks, intelligence, virtue, the content I create - if I don't receive a steady stream of external validation I crumble.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, I often feel like I have to be the best, or at least in some arbitrary top percentile, in every aspect of life.  Another expectation that's impossible to fulfill.  Compounding this, the physical faults I perceive in myself (5'8"", balding, fairly lean but not jacked, etc.) make me feel like it's completely pointless to even attempt dating until I'm as 'perfect' as I can be.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these obsessions and delusions are exactly that - psychological demons that have to be kept in check.  I know my expectations do not match reality.  And I know that happiness = reality - expectations; I'm the source of my misery.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm painfully aware of the cluster-b personality disorders I skirt close to (BPD, NPD, pure OCD).  But the professionals I've dealt with tell me I don't have true manic episodes, and none have called me a narcissist (is that something they would do though? a nagging doubt of mine)

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried therapy, and it helped a bit, but eventually the therapist's advice became too repetitive and I couldn't afford to keep going.  As for meds, after a bad episode with SSRIs in my early 20s (triggered actual mania beyond anything I experienced otherwise), and reading a good deal of scientific literature on them, I'd rather figure this out without them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've been meditating and it helps.  It feels like I *know* what the path is - developing a real daily routine, exercising + meditating daily, following a real sleeping schedule, working more consistently, finding social activities in my area I enjoy, etc.  Yet for so many years I continue this painful circle of staring at screens to fill the void, always doing the bare minimum of what I need to in a big burst to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish there was some panacea beyond the obvious things I stated.  Or some better way to view everything.  Some damn button to press in my brain to make it stop sabotaging itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else relate to this or have any advice?  ",19Dec2018,1
56,"TL;DR: I was diagnosed with anxiety. I have repetitive thoughts that cause me to get caught in thought loops with myself and they resemble arguments. I know the negative thoughts are just that negative voice, but I can’t help but interact.

5-6 Months ago, I was experiencing a bunch of symptoms that suggested depression. I didn’t know it at that time, but some of the symptoms really encouraged me to get help. I had a huge loss of appetite, and could only eat a full meal if I was high. I talked to the doctor and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. After being diagnosed, a lot of what I had been going through began to make sense. Anyway, I was put on antidepressants, fast forward to now my depression has been completely diminished. I’ve been pretty happy for months now, but I’ve still had anxiety.

What I’ve been dealing with lately has made me think something else must be wrong with me. I have the negative voice in my head, I know it’s the negative voice whenever those thoughts pop up. My therapist told me to try not to interact with the thoughts, but sometimes I can’t help it. Especially if it’s a topic that really bothers me. So, I’m constantly in a war with myself internally. Since I’m unable to ignore the thoughts, it’s like I’m literally arguing with myself trying to prove the thoughts wrong or try to reason why it shouldn’t bother me. It has been the worst to deal with, and I’m starting to wonder if this is actually anxiety. I’ve been trying to self-diagnose something else I guess because I’m really just trying to find any solution to help me(besides stronger medicines, I’m not trying to get on any benzodiazepines), and it’s made me wonder if maybe it’s more of obsession instead of anxiety? It’s usually the same thoughts that bother me, and I haven’t been able to let them go.

57,"Hi there! My whole life I’ve had issues communicating and expressing myself. Everyone I knew always had so many thoughts and I thought it was weird because I would only get a thought every 30 seconds or so. I have always had some sort of issues with conversation and storytelling. 

I went through a rough breakup earlier this year and pushed myself to the limit socially. After a couple months I was very happy and worked out consistently and was on a vegan diet. During this period in my life I had mental clarity. I experienced “thoughts” regularly and I could communicate effectively and get my messages across clearly. I had a thought every second or two. I had no barriers and I was a complete extrovert (pretty much opposite of who I thought I was). I had no issues keeping conversations with people, being empathetic, listening, or storytelling. 

After a few weeks, this “high” went away even when I was still active and on a plant based diet. Throughout much of my life my mind has felt empty and I have had trouble coming up with thoughts. I know that the natural high I felt was because of how low I fell following the breakup, however, if I took care of myself and maintained the same habits, how come this clarity went away? 

I feel numb to a certain extent, but is there any way to get this clarity back following different circumstances? My confidence levels are lower now so that might be contributing to it. I just want to be able to think! I’d love any feedback :)

59,"Hello. I just needed to write this out I think. Im 26 yeards old, a virgin, and still live with my parents with hardly no social contact outside them or a friend I talk to online. I know I have ocd. I had for it ever since I was 10. But over the years I have suspected to possibly have schizoid pd or depersonlization. I don't know if either of these are true. For years I have had very few and weak emotions. I wasn't always like this. I remember having emotions as a kid and gradually over time they disapeared. I dont know if it was being bullied, having harm ocd at the time, or being a very scared child as my dad raged at me a lot (no physical abuse). Overtime my emotions just grew less and less.

About 2 years ago, I had a mental breakdown over philosophical arguments I read over the internet. About there being no objective morality, life being meaningless, nothing matters, etc. It broke my world to pieces. Im atheist so I have no religion to fall back on. I tried constantly searching over the Internet for c0unterarguments against those thoughts and nothing worked. Somehow eventually I managed to break through and lived as normally as I can f9r the next 2 years. Still was mostly emotionless during this time period. 

But now the thoughts have returned. I can't help but think how everything in life is pointless. Emotions are pointless and meaningless. Love is pointless and meaningless. Human life is pointless and meaningless. Nothing in life matters at all. I feel like I have had my eyes open and have seen the truth in life and there is no going back. I just look at everything humans do and see it as if I was looking at animals. I'm scared because of this i will turn into some kind of psychopathic monster that has a blue and orange morality. I say I'm scared but I feel apathetic to this thought because I don't feel emotions anymore. I don't even understand emotions anymore or what they mean. But I still don't want to be like this. I want to stop thinking like this but don't know how.

I want to go back to how I was as a child, that had emotions and was human. But I cant. That part of me is dead. I just feel so empty now. I'm going to a therapist tomorrow but I don't think they can help me. I am too far gone. I don't want to be inhuman being. Why am I like this?

Everytime i tried to go out with my friends she would come get blackout drunk and say horrible things to me. She told everyone i kicked her out for no reason. She told everyone i was being so shitty. Hearing all these things about me all the time really got in my head, i went back on antidepressants, being told youre the reason someone is suicidal constantly really makes you question yourself. How awful do i need to be to make someone want to die? We'd argue about something trivial then shed say she was going to kill herself and she would follow through, they weren't empty threats i've stopped her killing herself twice. i was able to bounce back from it at first but over the course of months i cannot. After she tried to attack me i called the police they removed her from the flat for a while. I took her key off her and locked myself in the flat and blocked her online and over the phone. When she couldn't get back in she went to live with her parents. By this point it was now a month until we were moving out (took 2 months to kill the lease because she lied about looking for flats and i didnt want her on she streets). Still concerned about her i called a meeting of all my friends explained what had happened why i had done what i had done and asked them to keep an eye on her. I thought that would be the end of it but it only got worse. I've been hearing snippets of conversations about how awful i have been to her. Things that never happened are held over my character. My self worth has been at an all time low and now its just being beaten into the ground, when you keep hearing something you believe it. I met my old flatmate the other day and i explained why i did everything i did and she apologised. There's nothing else she can do so i forgave it. I will never be as close to her again by at the end of the day its her disorder if she could stop being like that i imagine she would. Issue comes in here. I'm moving away from my town but not for 6 months, this is why im moving tbh but ive been lingering for too long anyway. I dont know whether to keep spending time with these people. I dont know who it was who have been saying the worst things i dont know whether to find out. My old flatmate messages me everyday again i dont want to made out to be a bitch anymore im so tired of it so i have to reply to her. Do i stop replying knowing it will make peoples opinion of me worse but keeps me away? Do i try to forget what ive heard from my 'friends' and just hang out with them? Ive been very depressed from this situation and i have severe anxiety so i havent been leaving my flat really which means ive naturally become less involved in peoples lives. I dont believe i could make new friends in this state and i will constantly see them around, do i try to rebuild my friendships with these people or just walk away? i want to walk away but if i do i think i will become isolated and worse than ever and it isnt all of them. I dont think i can deal with being alone when i feel like this and with no family close by its kind of them or nothing. Have i been emotionally abused or am i being dramatic?",19Dec2018,1

Something in my head drives me to need to do 2 things on a routine that is so specific that I feel...I guess incomplete is the word, if I don't do them.

But I have to go through the motions of getting that drink... I can drink a quarter or half of it and trash it no problem. I've tried switching to another. I feel incomplete when that happens.   The bigger routine however is hookah. I don't smoke anything else. But I have to smoke it when I'm at the computer at home.  And the amount is a lot. Out and about I'm fine. At work I'm fine. But if I'm at the computer. Again. Incomplete or something ""off"".  I don't know what the issue is. I've tried vaping that didn't work (but I'm kind of glad that didn't. Replacing smoking with smoking isn't awesome). I'm have a pretty bad combination of issues. Those 2 things, I'm overweight but don't want to exercise in front of people. Don't live alone so can't be private about it. But ideally if I can replace those 2 shitty things I've described before with exercise or better decisions.

I'm 19, but I've struggled with what I think is anxiety for pretty much as long as I can remember. Even when I was a kid I would be in a constant state of worry about pretty much anything, but mostly school-related stuff. I've just always put pressure on myself to be as close to perfect as possible. My family knows this about me and are very supportive, always telling me they'll be proud of me as long as I try my best, but it never seems to relieve my seemingly constant stress. I had my first panic attack around 9th grade, and would have one every few months or so from then on. They're usually brought on by something minor, like an impending due date or job interview. Most of them start with really heavy breathing and before I know it I'm shaking like crazy and can feel my heart beating out of my chest. After a minute or so, it'll feel like I need to hit myself, usually a closed-fist punch or two to the face or side of the head, and then I just deflate and feel exhausted for a few hours. The next day I usually feel fine, and the attacks never really impeded on my social or academic success, so I kept them to myself. About a year ago, I started smoking weed beyond the joint or two with friends on the weekends, and for the last three months (my first semester of my second year of college) I've smoked once a day...and I felt great. I could tackle school assignments, get a great night's sleep, have fun with friends, all seemingly without worry. I wasn't high all day, I'd just smoke a bowl before bed every night and wake up feeling rested and ready for the day in the morning. A week ago I came home for winter break and didn't bring any weed because I never felt like I truly NEEDED it (also my mom knows I smoke but would probably be upset if I did it at home). I have a final paper that I was working on, when all of a sudden the thought popped into my head that if I fail this paper, I fail the class. Next thing I knew, the breathing started, except this time it felt so much more intense. I ran to my mom shaking and cried like a baby, which I haven't done since I was 10. I felt sick all the next day, and the next night it happened again, this time in front of both of my parents.  I've done a couple sessions with a therapist about 2 years ago but I didn't feel like it helped, so yesterday I went to a new one at the recommendation of my parents but I felt like it was more of the same. I KNOW my reactions are irrational, and even during panic attacks I can hear myself in the back of my head saying that this reaction isn't logical, but I physically cannot stop myself from freaking out. I also know that suddenly stopping regular use of marijuana can cause anxiety and nervousness, but would it be really be this intense? Should I see a psychiatrist?

I'm hoping for some advice, I can't find any information about this online, most of what I find is regarding night terrors in children. I get these night terrors ca. 2 times a month, I wake up screaming, sweating, with a racing heart. I sometimes remember why I'm so afraid, other times I don't.  The most common one I get is seeing someone in the room who is trying to kill me, or my boyfriend, stabbing me with a knife for instance. I'm 27 years old, I've been diagnosed with burnout and anxiety, but I don't have PTSD. Doctors and psychiatrist I've seen don't even know what night terror is, so I'm a bit lost. 

The last time this happened I hit and kicked my boyfriend because I thought he was the dark shadow trying to kill me. It really devastated me knowing I hurt him

It started getting worse and my boyfriend told me yesterday that I repeatedly wake up during the night, sometimes sitting up and looking around, looking panicked. He says I usually take in a big breath and then open my eyes or sit up. He calms me down, tells me there is nothing there, and I fall asleep again. I don't remember any of this. 

He also tells me I ""sleep start"" (twitching before falling asleep) very frequently

This explains why I'm so tired after 8 hours of sleep.. 

Has anyone experienced something similar and has some advice?

So after years of abusive parents (mentally, physically and emotionally), being bullied and being lonely I actually feel like there is a future. Earlier this year I decided enough is enough, so I packed my shit and left to live with my girlfriend with her family (with her families permission ofcourse). It was strange, growing up I never knew that a family can be kind and loving but after being here they taught me that. They showed me the true meaning of family. They understood my struggles in my past home and always tell me to stop apologizing (I do it alot out of habit because i feel like everything i do is a mistake). Then recently I came to the realization that there is something to live for. I've lived so many years of attempted overdose, hanging, self mutilation. I lived life just hoping something would end my pathetic existence. But yesterday me and my partner received out rent application approval are finally going to move out to our own place. I've never been more happy in my life. I finally have something. I'm off my medication and I've never felt so alive.

82,"Hello, 

I hope I'm posting this in the right place - but if not then please feel free to delete. 

My partner of 5 years is currently suffering from anxiety. When we first met we were both relatively care free and we spent a large portion of our free time together socializing with friends and generally enjoying ourselves in the usual ways. 

A little over 18 months ago we welcomed our son into the world. Since that point she has progressively become more and more controlled by anxiety and OCD like symptoms. It began with small things like checking that doors were locked etc. (To the point where we've had to replace door handles after they have been snapped due to excessive 'pushes' to ensure they are locked). 

More recently it is effecting her ability to drive. This one scares the hell out of me to be honest. She was previously a confident driver however now struggles to drive 2 minutes from our house without being consumed with emotion. Due to our working patterns she often has to take our son to nursery. I know that she would never put our boy in harms way and if she feels she can't drive on the day in question she will catch the bus - but there is obviously still a chance that a panic attack will catch her off guard. 

Mental health is never something I've dealt with. And I often catch myself struggling to be empathetic to what she is feeling - largely because I have not experienced it personally. (Selfish perhaps). 

She has been seeking help and has attended sessions to talk through the triggers etc. but I want to know what I can do to be as supportive as possible. 

Has anyone been through similar or can relate? ",19Dec2018,1
83,"It feels like, no matter what I achieve, I can never gain any happiness. I can’t gain a feel good factor unless it’s relationship related. Unless I had a girlfriend. But I had it installed to me when I was younger I looked like a freak. I was ugly. I’d be the butt of the joke. I was quiet. If relationships and image is all that preoccupied my thoughts, then the only option is to die, nothing else. Because, even if I got a relationship, I’d be too reliant on it, therefore it would make me indirectly feel worse. There is no winning factor unless I either got unconditional love or a new face and body, and neither of those things are possible.

In an attempt to break the cycle, I’ve tried to chat to new girls, but it ends one of two ways: I’ll overshare, they get uncomfortable and I’ll profusely apologise or try to fix it, or they’ll just ignore me from the very beginning, completely uninterested.

I’m uncomfortable no matter what I do. Therefore I can never be happy. 

Every little thing annoys me. Everyday I’ll go from “it’s better” to wanting to hurt myself. I’ll go from “I love you” to “I hate you” in the most severance forms. 

I hate myself. The way I look, speak, and act. I hate my mind. I hate the constant feeling of being uncomfortable. I hate having to open up. I hate the dismissal of a hormonal teenager. I absolutely despise myself. I despise the people who ignored me, but want their validation at the same time.

\- I then asked if we could talk about it later, as lifestyle choices aren't a huge deal and can be changed or adjusted. It seems silly to me to end a great relationship over things that could be easily resolveable.

\- She said we can talk later, but needs time/space right now

\- I'm not filled with confidence that we'll work things out, so in the meantime I'm dating again and meeting new people

I got nervous an hour before the appointment, and told her I had car trouble so I couldn’t make it, but I rescheduled and I am so glad I finally got the courage to go! After talking to a compassionate professional for only 37 minutes, my outlook has changed massively! I know there’s no easy fix, and it will be a tough journey, but I feel like I’ve already been through hell. This is the first time I have felt so empowered to overcome my depression and that in itself feels really good. We didn’t talk for long, but with the little insight I gave her into my life, she was able to give me a couple tools to practice coping with my spiraling self critical tendencies. It feels amazing to know I have someone that will not only listen to me, but who can offer me legitimate help and understanding.

100,"One of the major problems I see on college campuses is that students aren’t comfortable speaking up about their mental health challenges and often when they do, resources are scarce. On the flip side, students who have learned to manage their challenges don’t have any uncomplicated means of providing validation and encouragement to their peers (and peers are really who students want to hear from). So, I’ve created a website where students with lived mental health experiences can share their stories, so other kids who are feeling alone and suffering quietly, can anonymously gain a sense of support. All the videos are prescreened and there is no capacity for interaction, so the students who post videos and those who visit the site feel safe.  There is also a feature where anyone can enter another person’s email and GenuineU will send them a note of support and invitation to view the site. Because actually addressing a peer one believes might be in distress, is often uncomfortable, we thought this would be a valuable feature. 

I'm not sure what the best way would be to spread the word about the site. All the functionality will be ready to go on Thursday Dec 13th. But, I'm open to ideas about the best way to spread the word about the site and our Kickstarter. Any thoughts (I don't think reddit appreciates links)?",19Dec2018,1

I am kind of introvert and sensitive person, when I am attacked with words I bleed internally very badly.

Once I had an argue with someone or I just felt bad. And I started listening to this video. And... I felt good. I felt so good I decided to listen for more than just 30 minutes. I do it quite frequently, once in a month or more. When I listen to it I feel comfortable, like in big, thick bubble and nothing is hurting me. Moreover it regenerates me mentally.

Well it doesn't mean I am some kind of weirdo. I live simply, look like a normal guy, have normal relations with everyone around me. But it make me interested or even worries me.

Do I have PTSD ? I have read on wikipedia about PTSD and I don't think it's PTSD. Some people on youtube commented, they listened to it 'cause they have PTSD and this video helps them.

103,"Hi, I'm new here. I came here from googling and  I hope that this will be a good place for me to say these stuff.

I'm 18 turning 19 soon, and I'm from Sri Lanka. To introduce myself, I've always didn't believe in mental depression anxiety and stuff like that but until recently because now I think I have stress all the time.

I've noticed this because the sleeplessness, random suicidal thoughts, constant stress,  headaches etc.

So right now if I listening out stuff that bothers me they are,

1. My life with my family.
2. Education
3. Career
4. No positive thoughts about myself
5. Relationship
6. Social connections.
7. Social Media addiction
8. Lack of personal space and ""space""

Those are few things that really stresses me out.

1. My relationship with my family is really bad because I live with my dad,brother and sister. I know I'm not supposed to rant about it but they are really a pain in the head. Everyday you wake up to demotivation from dad and sister makes you sound like a total loser, they want me to ace my exams but they don't give me proper support. Constantly put the blame on me for everything and when I don't score well they bring the usual ""We're paying and you're wasting money"" I mean I'm doing my best at the moment. There's more to this but I dont know how to explain.
2. I was never the bright student in the class and I have lack of focus when it comes to education but I'm supposed to be acing my final exam because that's my only choice and I'm doing the hardest of all the exam also from maths stream.
3. .
4. Never was positive about myself, has insecurity about my body and how it feels, how unhealthy I am etc.
5. My girlfriend helped me with forgetting all those stuff that stresses me but now she's really busy and I should be giving her time and space to let her have her own family life. But rather than that, I've been annoying to her and I don't want to lose her because from my whole life she is the only person who really made me calm down and made me understand stuff, she is the person that I really want to be with at the moment. But she is busy and I don't want to be dependent (I'm indirectly depending on her that's why I text her with all ranting about how she is busy) and My head gets filled up with paranoia.
6. For some private reasons I lost all my friends which were close to me but then again I was never the person who is with bunch for a while. I'm extroverted enough to have more than 100 friends at once and kept me busy everytime but now It's not. I feel alone all the time and I don't feel secure.
7. Yes, Instagram, Youtube, PC let alone.
8. In sri lanka no one really respect that, so I don't have that. I really want to turn off the PC, mobile and have a digital detox and don't speak with anyone for awhile and be alone till I ready myself up because I'm not doing any good right now.

Thanks for reading my post this far, I expects some advices etc. Thanks again.",19Dec2018,1
104,"Hi,

I’m a computer science student, not in my first year. although this degree requires 100% seriousness and dedication, sometimes it’s really hard for me to keep being serious and I love life and I also procrastinate and its hard for me to keep a continuous track during the semester. For this reason, and also because this degree by itself is a really hard work and requires time for comprehensive understanding of the material, I found myself sometimes failing courses and having to repeat them. But when time comes and were approaching almost the end of the semester (like 3 weeks before), I always find myself sitting on my ass for hours trying to complete as much material as I can within short time.

My closest friends from school know that about me. They know that I can be a good student but I just lose patience. But I know and they know that I’m a very intelligent person, with high skills in many fields that aren’t necessarily school-related (I never need to prove what I’m worth bc they already know). 

But still, there are things they don’t really invite me to, like studying together sometimes and some projects they want to pursue (programming things and skills that I don’t have at the moment but neither do other friends of ours, who ARE actually invited to those things) and I get the feeling that they actually don’t want me for these projects bc they just don’t think Im too serious for the things that they do. Well, yeah. Thats true. I’m not always into having these projects. But I think that they could at least invite me, or, at least know that its super offensive when they don’t invite me but do invite other people who aren’t very serious in terms of school. I just don’t know what to do - on the one hand I know all about my situation, I barely wake up to go to classes, I failed courses and I even sometime just fly abroad for a few days in the middle of our hectic semester and then try to fix the flames that are waiting for me in school. But fuck. Makes me feel lonely and super out.

One would say “what do u expect?” But I have the feeling that I can be very serious when needed but they just don’t believe in me. They could be wrong and could be right in terms of that — just sucks.

For socializing - I’m perfect. They enjoy having me and my jokes and my good vibes. But for school related crap I feel usually out.
I’d love to hear you guys on this.

Thanks for reading.",19Dec2018,1
105,"I'm almost out of hope and strength. I've suffered mental health problems for as long as I can remember, and it's ruining EVERYTHING. I want to share my story, at least some of it, maybe there are others suffering through similar things and/or able to give some decent advice. Man I don't know, I just need to vent. 

I was adopted pretty young. My birth parents are incompetent and irresponsible morons. They kept having kids in an unstable relationship and had unhealthy habits and mental problems of their own. I was the last of theirs, I had 4 siblings already in the care system. My mother is a horrible woman, to be frank, extremely self centred. She apparently has issues but that doesn't excuse her being the awful person she is. The father was and still is an alcoholic. I don't know all the details, only what we were told and some what was rumoured, neglect and abuse ect. Growing up I had behaviour issues and severe separation anxiety with my adoptive parents as well as other anxieties. Luckily my parents are amazing and supported me through all the troubles I had. Anyway, When I tried having relationships as a teenager, I was never able to. As soon as anything became serious I'd suffer severe anxiety attacks and resort to ending the relationship. I pretty much gave up with it. Then, when I was doing my exams at school I broke completely, I became so stressed I couldn't even leave the house because of anxiety attacks, therefore I had to drop out of school and I became depressed and isolated. I had brief contact with my birth family beforehand, I thought it would help, but it only made things worse. I never got any answers and was left only with more questions. I focused mainly on recovery for the past few years. I had some friends I was romantic with, but I never got into anything serious with anyone until now and I'm afraid of my mental health ruining the first thing to make me feel genuine happiness since my breakdown. I've been having anxiety during today, I've spoken to my partner about it and we're trying to work through it. My anxiety makes the world ugly and overwhelming. The things that bring me joy turn disgusting and I become repulsed by them. I say that because it makes me feel so ill that I can't face whatever it is anymore. I have no idea what to do. If I can't get over this I fear I'll never be able to handle loving anyone ever.  It seems whenever I feel it's real and intense that I crumble.  ",19Dec2018,1

I’m prescribed Vyvanse 30mg for my ADHD I thought maybe they were making me anxious so I stopped taking them for a few days and I didn’t really feel much better or worse, just tired and sluggish. 
I have so many panic attacks even when I’m happy even when I’m around people I love most I will panic, even if I smoke I don’t even feel high anymore and it’s top shelf medical so I should be stoned. 
I tried to take a 1mg xanex and it helped a lil I guess but I still felt really panicky and sleepy? Like I don’t think they actually help me feel less of the panic attack and they just knock me out but I’ll wake up still panicking.
I cannot work that’s out of the picture, well customer service that is. I was working a serving job but I started to have blackouts at work from the stress. 
I desperately need money and I want to work so that I can go to school and get a music degree.

My best friend has a drug problem that’s on and off and I know that stresses me out cause I love him and he’s got a lot going for him right now in the works but if he doesn’t quit the drugs he can really fuck up all this greatness that’s coming so I know that’s adding a lil stress because that’s like my big bro. But I don’t think it should add stress and panic to this level I mean Jesus you’d think I have actual problems to deal with but I’m fine and I’m safe.

I've had romantic relations that were not serious, but I always wanted to have love. Now that I've found it, I'm afraid it'll be ruined. My anxiety makes me feel fear and disgust towards things, even things that have previously brought me joy. Something beautiful could become repulsive. I won't be able to face it or stand even thinking about it.

About 2_3 weeks ago I think I had kind of a breakdown( don't know how one looks and feels) and since then i don't get the thought out of my head that something might be wrong with me.

I often had times where I was completely down and cried for some hours, and then started to getting ""normal"" again.
But since this ""breakdown"" I don't get these negative thought out of my head. I don't enjoy the things I like normally anymore, I liked movies, videogames and YouTube, but they are all just meh.

Whenever I watch a movie I feel just bored, even when it's one I really liked, same with videogames, tried to play today and lost, quit and started to cry again...

116,"#The Myth of Mental Illness

By **Thomas S. Szasz (1960)**

My aim in this essay is to raise the question ""Is there such a thing as mental illness?"" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated.  Mental illness, of course, is not literally a ""thing"" -- or physical object -- and hence it can ""exist"" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as ""objective truths"" (or ""facts"").  During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events.  I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings.  As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause--let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill?
In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put.  I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.

#MENTAL ILLNESS AS A SIGN OF BRAIN DISEASE

The notion of mental illness derives it main sup- port from such phenomena as syphilis of the brain or delirious conditions-intoxications, for instance -- in which persons are known to manifest various peculiarities or disorders of thinking and behavior. Correctly speaking, however, these are diseases of the brain, not of the mind.  According to one school of thought, all so-called mental illness is of this type.   The assumption is made that some neurological defect, perhaps a very subtle one, will ultimately be found for all the disorders of thinking and behavior.  Many contemporary psychiatrists, physicians, and other scientists hold this view.  This position implies that people cannot have troubles -- expressed in what are now called ""mental illnesses"" -- because of differences in personal needs, opinions, social aspirations, values, and so on.  All problems in living are attributed to physicochemical processes which in due time will be discovered by medical research.
""Mental illnesses"" are thus regarded as basically no different than all other diseases (that is, of the body).  The only difference, in this view, between mental and bodily diseases is that the former, affecting the brain, manifest themselves by means of mental symptoms; whereas the latter, affecting other organ systems (for example, the skin, liver, etc.), manifest themselves by means of symptoms referable to those parts of the body.  This view rests on and expresses what are, in my opinion, two fundamental errors.
In the first place, what central nervous system symptoms would correspond to a skin eruption or a fracture?  It would not be some emotion or complex bit of behavior. Rather, it would be blindness or a paralysis of some part of the body. The crux of the matter is that a disease of the brain, analogous to a disease of the skin or bone, is a neurological defect, and not a problem in living. For example, a defect in a person's visual field may be satisfactorily explained by correlating it with certain definite lesions in the nervous system.  On the other hand, a person's belief -- whether this be a belief in Christianity, in Communism, or in the idea that his internal organs are ""rotting"" and that his body is, in fact, already ""dead"" -- cannot be explained by a defect or disease of the nervous system.  Explanations of this sort of occurrence -- assuming that one is interested in the belief itself and does not regard it simply as a ""symptom"" or expression of something else that is more interesting -- must be sought along different lines.
The second error in regarding complex psycho-social behavior, consisting of communications about ourselves and the world about us, as mere symptoms of neurological functioning is epistemological.  In other words, it is an error pertaining not to any mistakes in observation or reasoning, as such, but rather to the way in which we organize and express our knowledge. In the present case, the error lies in making a symmetrical dualism between mental and physical (or bodily) symptoms, a dualism which is merely a habit of speech and to which no known observations can be found to correspond. Let us see if this is so. In medical practice, when we speak of physical disturbances, we mean either signs (for example, a fever) or symptoms (for example, pain). We speak of mental symptoms, on the other hand, when we refer to a patient's communications about himself, others, and the world about him.  He might state that he is Napoleon or that he is being persecuted by the Communists. These would be considered mental symptoms only if the observer believed that the patient was not Napoleon or that he was not being persecuted[sic] by the Communists. This makes it apparent that the statement that ""X is a mental symptom"" involves rendering a judgment. The judgment entails, moreover, a covert comparison or matching of the patient's ideas, concepts, or beliefs with those of the observer and the society in which they live.  The notion of mental symptom is therefore inextricably tied to the social (including ethical) context in which it is made in much the same way as the notion of bodily symptom is tied to an anatomical and genetic context
To sum up what has been said thus far: I have tried to show that for those who regard mental symptoms as signs of brain disease, the concept of mental illness is unnecessary and misleading.  For what they mean is that people so labeled suffer from diseases of the brain; and, if that is what they mean, it would seem better for the sake of clarity to say that and not something else.


#CHOICE, RESPONSIBILITY, AND PSYCHIATRY

While I have argued that mental illnesses do not exist, I obviously did not imply that the social and psychological occurrences to which this label is currently being attached also do not exist.  Like the personal and social troubles which people had in the Middle Ages, they are real enough.  It is the labels we give them that concerns us and, having labelled them, what we do about them.  While I cannot go into the ramified implications of this problem here, it is worth noting that a demonologic conception of problems in living gave rise to therapy along theological lines. Today, a belief in mental illness implies -- nay, requires--therapy along medical or psychotherapeutic lines.
What is implied in the line of thought set forth here is something quite different.  I do not intend to offer a new conception of ""psychiatric illness"" nor a new form of ""therapy.""  My aim is more modest and yet also more ambitious. It is to suggest that the phenomena now called mental illnesses be looked at afresh and more simple, that they be removed from the category of illness, and that they be regarded as the expressions of man's struggle with the problem of how he should live. The last mentioned problem is obviously a vast one, its enormity reflecting not only man's inability to cope with his environment, but even more his increasing self-reflectiveness.
By problems in living, then, I refer to that truly explosive chain reaction which began with man's fall from divine grace by partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.  Man's awareness of himself and of the world about him seems to be a steadily expanding one, bringing in its wake an ever large; burden This burden, then, is to be expected and must not be misinterpreted. Our only rational means for lightening it is more understanding, and appropriate action based on such understanding. The main alternative lies in acting as though the burden were not what in fact we perceive it to be and taking refuge in an outmoded theological view of man. In the latter view, man does not fashion his life and much of his world about him, but merely lives out his fate in a world created by superior beings. This may logically lead to pleading nonresponsibility in the face of seemingly unfathomable problems and difficulties.  Yet, if man fails to take increasing responsibility for his actions, individually as well as collectively, it seems unlikely that some higher power or being would assume this task and carry this burden for him. Moreover, this seems hardly the proper time in human history for obscuring the issue of man's responsibility for his actions by hiding it behind the skirt of an all-explaining conception of mental illness.

117," I’m currently in my hometown for a few days (christmas with family) and I gotta be honest, I think I never felt more trapped in my life. I mean, whenever I come here I feel trapped, but now this feeling has grown so much inside of me that I just can’t stand being here anymore. I feel like any second that I spend here is a waste of time and the worst part is that I barely have friends here anymore.

I lived my whole life here up until last year, but I never really liked it. I always considered myself as an outcast because of the clear differences between me and the people who live here, even back to my childhood and especially my teen days. When I was around 15/16 years old I started having panick attacks and anxiety became a part of my routine. Because of that I distanced myself from my childhood friends and that was one of the main reasons why I switched schools to a different town when I began high school. Spending so much time out of town in such a sensible age really didn’t help me at all at adjusting here. It only made me feel more apart and I used to wish everyday that I could get the hell outta here. I mean, not even my high school friends were from here, so what did I have to do here? Nothing, really.

And last year it finally happened. I graduated from high school, spent the summer here and when the time came I finally got what I always I wanted: I moved to a different city because of college. The first weeks were not that easy and for the first time I found myself missing my hometown. It was a weird feeling, but it was soon gone when I began to adjust to my new life. For the first time I really felt like I could fit in. My house there is really close to my college, all my friends live close to me and I barely feel alone there. I'm a totally different person now, I'm confident, most of the people there like me and I'm much more mature. But whenever I come back here, I spend most of my time feeling anxious and desperately wanting to go back, like I was my high school self all over again.

What should I do? I mean, it is kinda obvious that I can’t just get of here and never come back because most of my family lives here, but at the same time I feel like my mental health is affected by this town and its vibe. It seems like I’m exagerating, but I swear to you guys that I’m not.

120,"I'm not entirely sure where to start this, but I've spent an hour considering making this post so I may as well try to just blurt out what's on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male in my early twenties from the UK, and quite simply, I don't feel like I fit in. I've never felt like I fit in, and it's just a strange place to be. It's almost as if every day I'm in limbo, like some sort of outsider put in a foreign place, trying to blend in with the locals.

&amp;#x200B;

My family considers me a know-it-all, which I find sad considering that they're blissfully ignorant about things. I don't really speak to them more than I need to, even though I probably should, but I've accepted that I'm the outsider at home.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends only ever really existed inside of school, and now in work. I don't consider them to be friends like most people would. I find it difficult to get involved in the banter and never really feel like I fit in. I often don't have much to contribute to a conversation. People don't seem to dislike me, I've never had much problem in talking to people, or making friends, but oddly I find myself uninterested with people. I long for the interaction, but I don't think that I ever actually truly want it.

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of school and work I've attempted to make friends, never really had much luck at keeping them either though. Same sort of story as inside of work. Everyone's hobbies seem to include drugs, drink and hookups, which is fine, but they're not exactly my thing. Alternatively some people are passionate about movies, I rarely see any I want to watch in the cinema. Some people love music, I rarely listen to it, and I've never been to a concert nor do I think I want to. I've never been able to remember the lyrics even if I do like a song. If I go to a club, I feel completely out of place, no matter how drunk I am. I can't let myself ""loose"" and enjoy dancing or getting down with people I don't know and can't hear.

&amp;#x200B;

From the ages of around 12-22 I've just stayed inside my house playing video games as some sort of escapism, I imagine similar to how people abuse other substances and activities such as gambling. I never actually do progress as I throw my life away in front of a screen, but I do feel the sense of progression in the moment, and i think that is what I yearn for. All of my free time goes to this, even when I don't feel like it, because I feel lost without it. I simply don't know what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point I didn't leave the house for around three years after leaving college. I didn't feel like I had the motivation to really do anything. Eventually I did get a low paid job in a supermarket, but that did nothing for me either. Money doesn't interest me, so the paycheck didn't get me. The work itself was low skilled, it was mindless and mind numbing, that gave me no satisfaction either. I wanted to have some sort of impact, some sort of progression, where one day eventually I will have a positive impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago I eventually did start to train for another skill set. I plodded along for two years, still didn't go out, but at least I was contempt with my work. It turns out that now after finishing my training and getting into the workplace, it's not actually about the work anymore. It's all politics and I can't seem to handle that either. Everything is just completely cut-throat, nobody is interested in doing the job properly to a high level even though I'm working in an industry where that is vital, and all anyone wants to do is fill their own pockets at the expense of everyone else. I already want out.

&amp;#x200B;

These things that are out of my control shouldn't bug me, but they do, immensely. It's like all of these things add up and I never actually fit into society like everyone else does, and no matter what I do, I'm always just going to be a pessimist who doesn't actually know how to fit in.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at all sorts of threads to find out what's wrong, but I don't ever really feel like any of them fit me. Bits and bobs here and there, but who could really put a finger on it? And even if there was something, would I be able to change anything about it?

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked into Autism, and honestly I've thought maybe I do tick a few boxes. Doesn't everyone tick a few boxes though, and there is no actual ""solution"" even if I did have it is there?

&amp;#x200B;

Equally, I've looked into depression, and honestly, looking at most peoples posts, thankfully I've never actually wanted to commit suicide or self harm, so I think that may not be the issue either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for an opinion really as to what may be wrong, or if anyone else has felt this way, I'm wondering how you have gone about tackling it. Sorry if it's a ramble. I just feel like I needed to get it off my chest finally.",19Dec2018,1
121,"All my life I’ve been an abnormally irritable person. Someone interacting with me when I’m just not in the mood is enough to make me super angry for hours. I recently learned about IED, and I relate to a lot of the info about it. The only thing that doesn’t line up is that unlike most people with IED, I’ve never come close to using violence during an episode of anger. I just seem to have a nearly constant feeling of anger in my head for no known reason. I’ve tried to dig deep into my thoughts to see if there’s anything going on in my life causing all this rage, but I’ve never been able to pinpoint anything. 

I just feel unwarranted amount of anger at pretty much anything. These episodes of anger are almost always triggered by being irritated by someone close to me. For some reason these episodes are pretty much never triggered by someone I am not close to. And while I never react with violence, I still react in really regrettable ways. I snap at people for no reason. If I manage to stop myself from snapping at people, I respond to them in this super angry tone. I’m sure I’m not a nice person to be around. For some reason, certain people trigger this anger more than others. My dad triggers the most anger, and he’s never done anything to deserve it. It’s to the point where if he says anything to me, I’ll be clenching my fists in anger. I have no clue how to stop being so angry. I’ve tried so hard to calm tf down. I end up getting angrier, and then feeling like absolute shit. When I get these episodes of anger, it causes me physical pain in my neck and the back of my head. I feel so much pressure on those areas, and it’s terrible. These specific episodes of anger feel much different than when I normally experience anger. I feel it in a whole different section of my head. No matter what, I can’t seem to calm down and end up getting more riled up when I try.

The good news is I’ve gotten a lot better at managing this anger. Although I’m still not good at it by any means. And I haven’t made any progress in actually reducing my anger, I’ve just improved my management of it. I have no idea where it’s coming from or how to stop it. I know I have to see a professional to get a proper diagnosis, and I plan to. But I was just wondering if any of you have similar problems, or any tips on managing and reducing anger.",19Dec2018,1

127,"I hope I don't regret posting my situation online, but here it goes. So I am a 23 year old guy, still living with my family. I recently started working full time doing a Business Administration apprenticeship earning 3.70 an hour (my wages won't increase until December next year). My mum has always been my main tormentor in the family. She often has bursts of rage, she doesn't even try to hide them or control them, she just lets it all out and I am often the one on the receiving end. (Sometimes its my younger siblings she takes her anger out on them when I am hiding in my room after a long day at work, I can hear her screaming at them). She often puts me down saying things like ""I am a useless piece of shit"", even going so far as to telling me they would be better off if I was dead. She has never shown me any sort of support when it comes to my career choices, (or any form of support in general for that matter), instead making fun of the fact that I have been sacked from previous positions in the past, saying things like ""this job will be no different than the last because you are not good enough for it because you are retarded"". It is difficult for me to stay motivated sometimes, I just feel so emotionally exhausted all the time. I can see her attacks coming but cannot escape them. She has also hit me on a few occasions, mostly on the shoulders with her fists, and when I asked her to stop because that hurt she laughs it off and continues it anyway. I am now on a year long waiting list for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with the NHS, but I can't wait that long. I can't keep going to my friends because it feels like I am just bringing them down with me so I just isolate myself for a while whenever I start to feel really low and have frequent mood swings. It doesn't take much for me to start feeling low, but video games and focusing on work as well as reading/writing helps but these are only short term methods. I'm scared of going back to this house after work, but I am sad to say that I am used to receiving this constant belittling/negative treatment on an almost daily basis. ",19Dec2018,1

129,"This might not be the right thread for this, but I feel like I might as well try. I have been dating a very sweet girl for going on 4 months now. Everything about her is awesome and I am definitely in love with her. As we became more comfortable with each other, she began to open up to me about sexual abuse that she endured growing up from an older brother and cousin. Though this isnt the immediate issue, she struggles with this very much. She is an extremely empathetic person and struggles between feeling hate for the people that put her through this as well as feeling responsible for her assailants well being and feels obligated to love them since they're family. (I should also mention her family is culturally mexican and view family bonds as unbreakable and to be honored at all costs). Her mother and father both know about the abuse, but instead of trying to protect her they pressure her to forgive them and to not make it a problem. To add to everything, she has a younger brother that lives with her who also has some sexual deviancy. She deals with occurrences ranging from him sneaking in to the bathroom and taking pictures of her in the shower to masturbating onto her lingerie and then putting it back into her drawers for her to see. And this is a daily or weekly thing. Obviously for anyone this is disgusting and confusing, but i am really worried about her dealing with this and putting up with it. I am constantly having to find her when she gets too depressed and stops responding to my texts or talking her down when shes suicidal. She isnt willing to go to therapy or counseling and everytime I try to suggest finding a new place to live (I've offered her my place and also found affordable places for her) but she just insists she cant because of her parents.

130,"I thought this day would end well. After several sad, depressing and exhausting weeks I was having a normal day today. I wasn't overly happy or anything, but I wasn't really sad either.
I went to class today, saw my crush and all was well. Then I got home and decided to search my crush on instagram and you know when you have to look for people who obviously don't write down their name? Anyways, I did managed to find her eventually (it's a girl so that possibly makes me gay?) And  I read a post which was from a while back, but there it was. The word that freaking punched me in the gut – boyfriend. Inwardly, I was just like 🙃 ""Yeah, obviously, why not right?"" 

In my 19 years of being alive, I never really had a crush. Sure, I found guys attractive, but when I saw *her* it was like an electric shock hitting me out of nowhere. She might be a complete stranger, but yeah I guess she is my first real crush...(Seriously, she's got the most beautiful eyes)

You might not understand, but even though I knew that I never had a chance (and obviously I didn't know if she was gay or not, or even bi) the fact that she has a boyfriend hits me really hard in a way? 

From her posts I know that we live in completely different worlds. And it makes me hate myself again, makes me remember that I'm a social cripple and an awkward creep because I've probably been making her uncomfortable with my staring. (Don't worry, I wasn't really staring that hard, but some people say that they know when someone is looking at them occasionally).

134,"This is a HUGE deal for me. I'm 26 and during my entire life, my parents have yelled and screamed that mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, wasn't a real thing. They often dismiss anything that they don't want to accept, anything that might be a real issue. I wasn't allowed to go to a therapist, even when the school counselor brought me in almost weekly (mostly in middle school) to talk about well, anything. They were just trying to get something out of me but I often thought I was in trouble and didn't really understand why I kept getting taken out of class. 

So I've been struggling with my demons my entire life, looking for ways to cope, most of the time it was through drugs/alcohol, but I've cut down on that a lot. A close friend of mine has repeatedly told me over and over that I need to go talk to a therapist, and he's tried to convince me that I'm not crazy because I need help. Over and over and over again I told him that I didn't need to, I was fine, I just need to vent sometimes. I guess though, after my last episode a couple days ago, I was going on and on about how I just wasted my whole life, how I keep wasting time, how I don't have a direction, how I'm afraid to leave, how I'm afraid to act on things, how I'm indecisive, etcetcetc and he just flat out told me again that I really really need to seek someone out and it's not because he didn't want to help, he just doesn't know how to get to the root of my problem.

After some extensive research, I found a really nice counseling office right by my house. The counselor has a therapy dog too! My first appointment is on January 2, right after I get out of work.

Sometimes I wonder if being on them growing up, having adverse reactions as a teenager (black box medications are no joke), and being on them for at least 15 years has done irreparable damage to my ability to lead life without medication.

It seems the most effective method is Exposure &amp; Response Prevention, &amp; that other methods don't really do a lot to treat the disorder. This treatment exposes the person suffering from OCD to the thing that causes their anxiety/fear so they become numb to it or learn the fear isn't real &amp; thus helps them control the compulsions. The problem with this method for my situation is that I only have compulsions but no anxiety or fear behind them. A little background, my OCD used to include what I refer to as ""tics"" which were behaviors I felt I HAD to do &amp; I did them constantly. But I never had a reason for why I felt the need to do them nor did any of my tics serve any useful purpose or provide comfort for myself. Over the years I was able to mostly eliminate this behavior however the other part of my OCD is still present which is unwanted thoughts that keep repeating themselves. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but there are certain parts of everyday life that trigger certain negative thoughts (most of which I don't believe &amp; immediately feel horrible for thinking). Maybe it is because I am particularly tired this week, &amp; when I'm tired I don't have a lot of thoughts or feelings, but for the past 3 days the things I don't want to think about have been playing on repeat.
