1,"Im at a loss with my life right now. Im still getting over a breakup two years on. I have almost no friends, i see people maybe twice a year when my friends come back to my hometown to meet up. Apart from that we dont talk.

Im working for minimum wage trying to become a nurse eventually, but i haven't started that whole process yet.  I have to take the long route as i wastes my university funding trying to do a course whilst suicidal, thus ending up missing all my lectures and not going outside for months. 

Im heavy. Not the heaviest ive been but im still 17 stone and classes as obese on the bmi scale. I have very little confidence in myself. There are things i wish i had the guts to do but cant bring myself to do it. Such as missing an interview for a graphic design job becuse i didnt believe in myself.

Theres just a tonne of little things im working through. And although i know each and every one now. I still feel like im missing something. Like even though i know what im working towards and i know what i need to do. I feel empty. Like theres something else. A vague feeling of something that just doesnt sit well with me. And i hate it. Its so uncomfortable that its painful sometimes. 

Its like ive accepted my faults. Ive realised how i feel and im honest with myself about it. But it doesnt mean anyhing. Theres not really a point to this. I just wanted to tell someone.",13May2018,1,

3,"I've been working at my current job for right at a year, and I've been looking for a new job for about 6 months. I like what I do, but my two managers are absolutely toxic. I have PTSD and anxiety, and being there has absolutely tanked me emotionally and mentally. I was in therapy for a year just before starting the job, and my therapist and I agreed I had progressed enough that it was time for me to stop going. 

However, it's been a year and I am plagued with so much anxiety and self doubt after being exposed to the management at my job that I don't know how I will adjust back. Now, mind you, I work in a professional office setting in a high-stress job.

When I first got the job, I thought it was great. But, I always new something was off about the two managers. It started small. They would micromanage every conceivable aspect of my day under the guise of ""accountability."" I thought this was just because I was new and it would fade. It never faded.

Then, they used manipulation tactics like telling me how amazing I am and how much I was doing for the business. Then, if they get upset or if the business isn't doing well, they tell you about how terrible you are and how little you're doing and why you're holding everyone back. Then it progressed to humiliating me and other coworkers in the meetings in front of the rest of the staff.

They would also have one on one meetings with just you and the manager once a week. During this time you were supposed to share what stressed you and what successes you had. Really, it was to lure you into a false sense of security so the two managers could gossip about what was said. I caught them sharing information I thought was supposed to be private with more than once.

They surpressed all inklings of creativity or alternative methods to the current ones in place. This made me feel literally trapped. I couldn't utilize my ideas that I knew would help my office run smoother.

I finally found a new job, and I start in 3 weeks. I gave notice to my current employer, and it was received well. However, I am so worried that I will blow it with the new job. I have been so anxious that they will take back their decision to hire me or they'll do away with the position or something because I've been acting on my anxiety. 

I was supposed to receive 2 emails on the day they called me with the job offer. I only received one, and it didn't have my paperwork in it. I wanted to make sure all the paperwork was out of the way before I gave notice to my current job, so I waited until the next day and sent an email requesting it. I didn't get a personal response, but a canned email with the paperwork at the very end of the day. 

I also called them back after they gave me the offer because the first email they sent requested I bring high school diploma or transcripts which I thought was odd. Also, my high school diploma burned in a house fire 5 years ago and I now live 2 states away from my high school. So, I left a message stating that I could bring my college diploma instead and asked if that was fine so I could get started ordering the high school diploma if need be to have it in time. I also included the bit about it being burned in a house fire which was completely unnecessary. I was just so nervous on the phone.

Now, after I bugged them with the call and the email, I'm so afraid they'll resend their offer and I'll be jobless. I am so anxious about it and haven't been sleeping well. I thrive on constant reassurance, and not hearing from them until I start in three weeks will be absolute agony...

I had worked so hard in therapy to resolve these issues, so that I wasn't acting on my anxiety like this (calling and emailing for things that are unnecessary). I'm so frustrated at myself for being back here, and I know I can't 100% blame  the old job. But, I know it has knocked me so far from where I was. I feel like I lost all that progress and now my life will suffer from it.

Have any of you left a toxic work environment and bounced back well?? Do you struggle with self doubt like this?

TLDR: I had really bad management that have caused me to regress into my anxiety and basically undo my progress in therapy. I bugged my new employer who I haven't started with yet because I was anxious to get paperwork done. Now I'm afraid they'll take back the job offer. Advice?",13May2018,2,
4,"So I met this girl and she told me up front that she was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. Of course I was understanding, having OCD and anxiety myself. She caught feelings really fast, like within 2 days she was worried she said that she would say the L word. She told me she is super clingy and so far she is with messages saying she hopes I'm alright if I take too long to message. 

Everything in her life according to her is negative. She says her aunt claims she is a hypochondriac. She says she has a lot of health problems, she claims her grandma and everyone is mean to her and won't feed her. Everyday she's got some kind of illness or someone is mad at her. Everyone she has dated has been abusive, with one causing her a miscarriage. She claims her ex husband was super religious and wouldn't have sex with her, that she had to force him to on their honeymoon and they never did again the whole 2 years of marriage. 

She told me one night she was scared because she was hallucinating, but that she knew it wasn't real, but that it still scared her. She says she had a lot of trauma in her childhood from her biological dad. It just all feels so weird. We've known each other for 2 weeks and she's already clung to me hard and wants a long future together.

7,"I have major health anxiety, and I feel like I’m forgetting simple things such as words, and I feel agitated and irritated at how I could forget stuff like this, and I feel like I could have remembered it before. I googled how I’m feeling, which is really bad for someone with health anxiety, and now stuff like Mild Cognitive Impairment can’t leave my mind, and now I’m super anxious. 

I’m looking for reassurance or something, idk I just feel really anxious.

Background info: I’m a male and 15, with no previous health issues that I know about, but I really worry about my health a lot, and that makes me think I have many things, and I go to the doctor or want to go to the doctor for little things.

I’ve recently felt like I’ve been forgetting things, it’s made me worried and I don’t know why I’m worrying, but still. I recently met with some old friends that I used to see usually every month or every few months, but the last time I saw one of the friends was maybe a year ago or some months ago, and I just couldn’t remember his name. I was busy during this event where he fitness cane so I never had a chance to talk to him, but after everyone left I remembered him and I just couldn’t remember his name. I remembered his little brothers name, but when I tried to remember his name, all I could think of was another friend’s name which was almost similar. For context, the person who’s name I was trying to remember was Rohan and my friend’s was Rohail, and it just really agitated me that I couldn’t remember, so I searched up named that start with Ro and when I saw it online I remembered it. 

I’ve also felt like I’ve been forgetting words, for example I was talking with my friend about a celebrity and he said homosexual instead of homophobic, and I tried to correct him but I just couldn’t think of the term homophobic, I was thinking that it was homophist for a second because we were recently talking about the word cancerist (probably not a real word btw, we saw something online of someone discriminating against people with cancer and made that up— unless that’s a real thing) 

I also meant to say encourage, but I couldn’t really think of the word and I said incentivize instead until I searched up synonyms for incentivize and remembered encouraged. 

Then, I was trying to search up is something was accurate, but I couldn’t think of the word accurate and I just put correct instead until the first page suggested used the word accurate.

I know these may sound silly, but I just feel like I’m forgetting things I should know like the word encouraged or accurate, and it doesn’t help that I’ve been googling what I’ve been feeling and I’ve seen stuff about Mild Cognitive Impairment and stuff like that :( 

I just really need reassurance, I feel like I’m forgetting easy things—things I should remember.

9,"I just finished doing a research assignment for my psychology degree and it required me to look into mobile phone use. The evidence was quite scary, it's basically likened to having an addiction.

People who feel negative emotions use their phone as a short term alleviation to their condition, and this in turn gets them in the habit of becoming almost completely introverted because it is familiar to them.

There is nothing inherently social about social media. And we are social creatures by nature, relying on human interaction to regulate brain chemistry and state of mind.

Imagine a scenario, the government prescribes a drug for all people to take from as young as five years old. This drugs makes you constantly stare at the palm of your hands and barely look up to see where you're going. Cars smashing into each other. People walking out into traffic, quiet restaurants full of people starting down, madness right??

Substitute this made up drug for a phone, all the symptoms are the same. People never look up and are in a constant state of distraction. I guarantee if I put any one of you on a crowded bus and gave you the choice to go on your phone or chat to the stranger next to you, I know what you'd pick.

Saving Mr. Banks never fails to make me cry so that’s a go-to for me. Nicholas Sparks always makes me cry as well, obviously.

13,"Today was the closest I've ever come to killing myself.  The details of why are irrelevant to the rant I'm posting now, so I'm going to forego all that; but basically I had to leave work and was so convinced I was going to just jump in front of traffic that I actually scared myself into calling my boyfriend (who was at work) to come and get me as I was scared to be alone.  He attempted to tell his manager that he had an emergency with my mental health and the guy nonchalantly said there was no one to cover and to take out the trash.  I live away from my family and had already called some friends to with no luck.  I was juggling between calling a hotline and/or 911, or just offing myself because I know I can't afford a hospital stay when fortunately one of my friends called back and rushed to pick me up.  My BF's boss sent him home 2 hours later for a bad attitude.

Now that I've calmed down a little bit from all the events and am left with a giant bump on my head from smacking myself in frustration I am absolutely livid that my BF's supervisors would treat a situation like that.  Not everyone has the luxury of having a giant network of people to get support from and one of the only people I have is him, especially since we live together.  I don't think I should have to put myself in the hospital or die for people to take it seriously but apparently it's not real since I didn't actually jump in front of that car.

Sorry, I mostly needed to rant but would also love opinions on what to do if I feel this way again, and also on whether you think my anger is justified.

15,"This is gonna be a long post. Sorry in advance

I'm a hair stylist apprentice. I study and work at the same time. Management changed my roster which caused me to have a meltdown with my anxiety and depression

This is my Roster:
Monday 9-3 I go to Uni for training.
Tuesday 9-5:30 in salon.
Wednesday 9-5:30 in salon.
Thursday 2:30-6:30 in salon
Saturday 9-3 in salon
Sunday 10-4:30. in salon

During my training I have to collect evidence to prove I can do certain tasks. e.g. bleach and tone etc.. My bosses won't let me train at all during my work hours. My manager will train me personally every fortnight on a Friday for 1 hour. All other training I am expected to do by myself. This is not in my contract. My manager is meant to be teaching me a lot more than what she does. Example: They booked chemical straightening for me to do when my manager has never given me any training on how to chemically straighten hair.

Technically I only have Thursday morning and Friday to be able to train. 10 hours a week and those are my only days off. In my own time I am meant to train as well. I also complete projects for my Uni assessments and study for my theory papers.

When I signed my contract I was told I would be an apprentice. Unfortunately they didn't sign me up until the day before my classes started. I had no information. i had no idea what equipment I was meant to bring with me. My manager doesn't understand the new papers for my assessments and I don't feel supported at all.

This schedule caused me to have a major panic attack. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression last year. I went to counseling and I started medication. My mental health was the best it had been in my entire life. It went downhill when I started my work. There has been some mild work place bullying too, by the manager.
The manager exhibits unprofessional behaviour. Example. Another almost qualified apprentice was doing a mens cut. The manager came over to me and was telling me how awful the cut was, that the girl didn't know what she was doing and that the client looked very unhappy. To me, she should of helped the girl. i feel very uncomfortable when my manager will talk about other staff to me.

I haven't been at work the past 2 weeks because of the state of my mental health. HR has been understanding and I have a meeting with them tomorrow. What should I say to them? People have brought up issues about the manager before but the manager finds out and is very passive aggressive towards you at work. It's horrible. They've lost a lot of good workers and almost someone ends up crying at work each week.
I'm unsure if I should try my best to stay or resign.
I want to explain to HR that my work load is too much with training. Unfortunately I know they won't offer to let me do my training during work hours. They will want to cut my work hours if anything. I'm unsure on what to do??

Advice please.? Any help is welcome. I feel very stuck with this arrangement.

16,"Hi!

 I am currently in school and I feel an enormous pressure to live up to my own expectations and the expectations others have in me which sometimes is really overwhelming.


My grades are good and every time I have to take a test or something else I try to learn so I get a good grade. But I always find myself sitting at my desk and just worrying about my future which prevents me from learning and also stresses me out a lot.


Also my father is very violent when he is aggressive and today during a argument with my sister I experienced a lot of aggression in my and I am scared that I might have a problem with aggressions. I have never physically beaten anyone or felt the urge to bet other but always when I am aggressive I have the need to punch something. I usually always punch against an outside wall and therefore have a few marks on my knuckles.

I never thought that would be the case, but I really don't want to ever see him again. I dream about leaving my hometown forever, and never speaking to anyone in it ever again. Is this normal?

22,"Trigger warning

For the past few years I've suffered from depression anxiety and PTSD. None of which I would have gotten if certain things hadn't have happened. I'm constantly fluctuating between terrified and walking on egg shells to walking across the street with my eyes closed. I never know when I'll be okay and when I won't be. Some days I can high five people and play frisbee and run and other days I have a nervous break down when someone puts their hand up. I can't talk about it because my friends just feel bad for me and I don't want pity. I want a solution. I want to be told it will get better and it will go away. I can't talk to older people because they'd try to fix it\- they've tried to\- and they'll just make it worse. This rollercoaster of being fine and then just not is wearing me out slowly but surely. I thought I could do this. I said three more years, and then I can get out. I can make my own life and surround myself with people who I love. I can heal. Now it's only a year and a half and I'm dying. I'm afraid I'll die. Not even from anyone else, just from not caring anymore. Sometimes I don't eat. Othertimes I eat too much and now I'm constantly eating because I know I won't later. Then I panic and sit down for thirty minutes doing sit\-ups until I cramp terrified that I'll gain weight and no one will love me. I'm scared that how I look is the only thing that's good about me and I'm losing it. I'm scared my friends hate me behind my back and I can feel people talking about me even though I know they wouldn't. I'm terrified that I'll be too wrapped up in wanting to be loved to realize I'm getting involved with someone who will do worse things to me than have already been done and I know I wouldn't survive that. Not so soon, at least. I'm scared I'll forget, but I'm even more scared to remember, because every time I forget and relax things get worse suddenly and when I remember I go numb or I want to scream and I can feel myself breaking down. My grades get worse and my life gets worse and I can't bring myself to even want to do anything about it anymore because all that scrambling to make things better only pushes back his anger by days.

Affirmation? Documentation? Some sort of sick gratification? The one thing I know is that I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I don't know how much longer I can just sit there and take it. What would happen if I fought back? Would I finally have the proof I need to get out instead of being forced to stay and endure even worse but just better concealed? How far would he go if I provoked him? Would he really kill me? Would I even care? Am I really willing to uproot and abandon any sort of relationship with me family? What if going would be worse? I only have a little more time. But what if I'm passing up something amazing? What if there's some family out there that wants me and would keep me? What if I could stay in a house and not have to wing it after I turn 18?

25,"This is going to be a long post, so kudos if you actually read through it. I'm a 31 y/o male, madly in love with a 28 y/o woman who I've been with for a year and a half. I've never experienced the kind of love and happiness that her being in my life has brought me, but for a long time I've been concerned that she doesn't seem to understand when she has done something wrong, and I've never seen her show any guilt or remorse. She thinks she is bipolar, and I've always thought that seemed likely \-\- she is definitely severely depressed and her mood swings regularly. She is deeply emotional and artistic, and cries all the time, so it never occurred to me she might be psychopathic. But I recently found myself in an internet\-hole about psychopaths and relationships with psychopaths, and she checks almost every box.

*Blame shifting and inability to take responsibility* \- check. No matter what she's done it is always someone else's fault, and often times when she has wronged me she manages to convince me that it was my fault by the time we're done arguing. She will orchestrate situations that end up upsetting her, and then she'll take it all out on me and blame me for it. I've thus far looked at this as a ""victim complex"", but lately I'm starting to wonder if it's something else.

*Lack of empathy and remorse* \- check. She has never displayed guilt and pretty much never apologized for anything. She is constantly mad at me for things I have no control over \(like relationships I had years ago or a girl hitting on me in a bar\), but she does things deliberately that hurt me and if I try to express my feelings it sends her into a rage. When I try to ask her to imagine if I'd done that to her, she begs me to stop and it seems like she simply can't handle that notion. Lately I've started to feel like I'm trying to explain empathy to her.

*They may have a genetic predisposition to psychopathy and a history of trauma* \- check. Her biological father was a violent psychopath. I've always thought my childhood was pretty rough, but hers was like nothing I ever could have imagined. She was abused in unspeakable ways and then was in a car accident that killed both her father and brother. This has always been part of the whole package that I love about her \-\- she endured more than anyone should ever have to go through in a lifetime and came out as one of the strongest, most remarkable people I've ever met. It's obvious that this is where her issues stem from, and I constantly excuse her behavior with this in mind.

*They reel you in with idealization, love\-bombing, and flattery* \- check. She love\-bombed me to a point I've never experienced at the beginning. Non\-stop texting, really aggressive pursuit of me and my affection, and started telling me she loved me very early on.

\*They involve you in their own versions of ""love triangles.""\*​ \- check. Her exes are all still madly in love with her and text her constantly and she never does anything to put me at ease about it.

*They hold grudges* \- check. The beginning of our relationship was rough. I was married and I didn't handle it very well, and was definitely pretty shitty to her on more than a few occasions. To this day any time we fight she goes back to that, and how traumatized she still is from all of it. Truly, I think I handled things poorly but nothing I did was all that terrible. I certainly never did anything to intentionally hurt her, and everything I did was with the intention to try to do the right thing in an impossible situation. I was just struggling with whether to leave my marriage for someone I hardly knew, dealing with the guilt of having an emotional affair with another woman at the same time as the guilt of leading this new person on because I couldn't keep myself away from her even though I was stuck on not being able to make the change. Nevertheless, I've groveled and apologized and repented a thousand times over, but also begged her to try to understand my position at the time, which she seems completely incapable of doing.

*They are jealous and hypocritical* \- check. My ex\-wife \(who is as uninterested in getting back together with me as I am with her\) texting me about an old bank account will send her into a rage just from seeing her name pop up on my phone. But if I gently voice discomfort about her going out for a drink with her ex\-boyfriend \(who showers her with flowers and gifts and does nothing but beg for her to come back to him\), she acts like she cannot possibly understand why I'd be upset and accuses me of creating drama for no reason. If a girl asks me for my number and I politely tell her I have a girlfriend, she might not talk to me for the rest of the day. But she'll invite a friend that we both know has a huge crush on her into her house for a drink at 1 in the morning and when I tell her it makes me uncomfortable she makes me feel crazy and tells me I'm trying to control her and not let her hang out with her friends.

*They are easily bored and can't handle loneliness* \- check. She complains about boredom more than anything else. She can't sit still for long, and can never handle being alone. She is a thrill seeker and loves doing things that get her adrenaline going.

*They are sexually promiscuous \-* check.

*They are exceedingly charismatic and charming \-* check. She's actually a somewhat quiet person and doesn't like to be the center of attention, but she is exceptionally charming and people \(especially men\) are drawn to her like no one I've ever known.

*They fall asleep instantly and easily* \- check. I've never seen anything like it. As soon as she decides she wants to go to bed she falls asleep the moment her head hits the pillow, even when she's upset or we're fighting, leaving me to spend the night awake with my thoughts spinning in my head. Once she's out there is nothing that could wake her before the morning.​*They will try to cut you off from your friends and loved ones* \- She has tried to cut me off from some of my friends, but this is something I've experienced with multiple other women in the past.

*They are impulsive and irresponsible* \- check. She makes decisions very impulsively, and then when they don't work out she doesn't seem to comprehend that it was her own doing.

*They are prone to violence* \- She definitely has very aggressive reactions, and has hit me on a few occasions. I am much larger than her so it doesn't concern me all that much, but she once split my lip open. She felt like it was completely justified​ \(it wasn't\), and she never apologized for it, just kept asking me why I couldn't understand what she was feeling when she did it.

​*I've also read that psychopaths don't feel the effects of MDMA* \- She has done it twice since we've been together, and both times she felt nothing but ""weird and a little bit irritated"" while everyone else was feeling deeply connected and emotional.

I know this all paints the picture of a pretty messed up relationship, and trust me I have my moments of wondering what the \*\*\*\* am I doing? ​But there's a lot of good too, and she has changed me for the better. At her best she is sweet, kind, and endlessly loving. She speaks very highly of me to others and compliments and encourages me, and has helped me curb a lot of my more destructive behaviors I've been prone to in the past. Since I started obsessing over this, everything I've read about being in a relationship with a psychopath has been discouraging me more and more, because it all fits so well. So I've started compiling a list of things that might contradict the theory. Maybe I'm just trying too hard to convince myself she's not because I can't accept it, but here they are:

*Crying at movies* \- As far as I understand a movie would never make a psychopath cry, because they wouldn't feel empathy for the characters. I've seen her cry at movies many times, and she's even called me while I was at working sobbing hysterically because of a movie she was watching. I also know that psychopaths aren't supposed to feel anything when they see violence in a movie, but even though we both like horror and thrillers and darker things in general, she will definitely cringe involuntarily if there is a particularly violent scene.

*Individuality* \- I've read that psychopaths try to mimic your likes and interests. She is the complete opposite. She values her individuality more than almost anything else, and never tries to pretend she likes something I like if she doesn't. We have very different tastes and are constantly having friendly battles about how much we hate some of each other's music, etc.

*Rule abiding* \- Psychopaths are supposed to have total disregard for rules, but she actually respects rules almost compulsively. She always brings her empty glasses back to the bar and chides me if I don't, she'll never stay on a patio later than the time it says it closes on a sign, and will give me crap for smoking too close to a door or things like that. It's not a fear of authority, more a deep respect for people and the businesses they run.

*Lying, stealing, cheating* \- She doesn't ever steal, and actually goes well out of her way to make sure somebody gets something back or gets paid for something or similar. ​I'm pretty sure she's lied to me about a few things, but she definitely doesn't compulsively lie or even embellish things the way I know I have a habit of doing. I've never known her to cheat someone out of something or throw anyone under the bus for her personal gain.

*Psychopaths are supposed to be parasitic* \- She is certainly not. She is very adamant about paying for her share of everything, and hates when people try to pay for things too often and will insist on paying when someone offers her something for free. She loves giving people gifts on Christmas and birthdays. She'll save up as much money as she can before Christmas and drop thousands on gifts for her loved ones, and it stresses her out immensely when she can't seem to find the right gift for someone.

*Animals* \- She loves animals, and seems to feel deep compassion for them. She spends much of her time on her phone watching cute animal videos and has had many pets. One time her cat managed to get to her lizard in its cage, and she was so freaked out and upset she couldn't even go near it. I had to come over and get rid of it for her. She could barely look at her cat for the next week because she was so upset. Another time we saw a dog running in and out of traffic and she was so stressed out she was squeezing my arm with all her might and screaming ""no no no!""

*Compassion for strangers* \- She will always give homeless people money if she has it, and will often go out of her way to help strangers. One time she helped this woman she didn't know with a situation she really didn't have to because she said she felt so bad for her. The woman later sent her flowers and a thank you card and it made her cry when she opened it. She also often cries when I do something particularly kind for her or give her a thoughtful gift.

*Panic attacks* \- I've seen her have outright hyperventilating panic attacks on several occasions. Usually it's when I can't take any more of her lack of understanding and out of frustration and an inability to comprehend why she doesn't feel bad I start drilling into her about how horrible she is making me feel. For this reason I had always thought she had some mental block up for allowing herself to feel guilt because she simply couldn't handle it, not that she didn't feel it at all.*Grandiose sense of self* \- She doesn't seem to have this. My perception has always been that she's actually quite insecure and struggles with her self\-worth.

*Nightmares \-* She has nightmares almost every night. She screams in her sleep and cries for help while clinging on to me. It certainly seems like she's experiencing fear.

*Children/grieving* \- This is a sensitive one. We have talked about the fact that we want to have kids together, even though we're not ready yet. We ended up getting pregnant accidentally a few months ago, and she decided she wanted to keep it. I've never seen her so happy as long as I've known her, but she miscarried about seven weeks in. She was devastated, and has been by all accounts genuinely grieving. Any time she sees a little kid or baby or a pregnant woman she breaks down completely. Is that a clear sign of empathy? Interestingly she has lashed out at me a few times because she thinks I don't care as much as she does. I feel things very deeply but I have a hard time displaying it.

I'm not looking for any advice on whether or not I should stay in this relationship \-\- I will make that decision on my own and we all know how unreasonable people are about staying in destructive relationships because of love. From what I've read, psychopaths in most relationships start out seeming perfect in every way and the mask starts to slip as time goes by. In my case, all of her darker qualities have been on the table since the beginning, and in many ways we've actually gotten better at communicating and avoiding conflict as the relationship has progressed. Even though she has a hard time understanding how her actions affect my feelings, she clearly seems to care about my life and well\-being, and is fiercely protective of me when others have wronged me.

I mostly want to know if any of the qualities I outlined in the second half of this here novel might preclude her from being a psychopath, and if there might be another cause for her apparent lack of cognitive empathy or guilt. Any insight is appreciated.",13May2018,3,

27,"Hey guys.

So overall I'd call myself pretty mentally healthy. I do have anxiety, but nothing that keeps me from basic functioning.
But there is one thing that I've had ever since I was a child (since about 9 years old): fantasies of hurting people.

The fantasy always follows the same formula; I'm provoked (the culprit is always an able bodied male of similar age), then I beat the shit out of him. BUT with one crucial detail that really gives me the pleasure: other people that I know are watching. I imagine what my peers are thinking, their opinions of me as I'm performing the act, their reactions, and their attempts to stop me. Also the provocation is almost always something that threatens the safety of someone I love or myself.

It sounds weird to say I get ""pleasure"" just from imagining something, but there's no other word to describe it. I feel a rush of adrenaline and euphoria during the fantasy.

I really go into detail. I think about each and every movement I make. I imagine all the different ways I could hurt the person, and what I could do to him that would cause the MOST pain. The more pain and bodily damage I cause, the better it feels. It feels like what that person did to my loved one or myself is fueling my rage and drive to completely obliterate this person. ALSO, I'd like to add that I never actually kill the person. He could be unconscious, horribly disfigured, bloody to the bone, but still alive and left with (relatively) healable wounds.

I've never had ANY manifestation of this in my real life. The fantasies never even involve me hurting anyone for something they actually did to me in real life, just for made up reasons. I'm actually pretty docile and easily intimidated in person (I think that's related to my anxiety). I've had violent reactions to things/people before, but they're rare; and even rarer do they involve me actually hurting anyone (most of the time it'll just be me throwing something or punching a wall). I really don't think I'm a bad person, but I'm trying to be honest with myself. Because I'd love to say that these are just thoughts in my head, and I'd never want this to actually happen, but that would be a lie. I literally fantasize about these things (happening in the exact ways I imagine them, obviously).

Anyways, hopefully someone reads this whole thing and has some thoughts. Am I in the same boat as anyone else?",13May2018,2,
28,"Warnings: depression, anxiety, rape, suicidal thoughts, self harm, feces.




A little bit of background: I've been struggling with anxiety since I was about 5 and depression since my early teens. 

I was raped when I was 18 leading to PTSD, suicidal ideation, and a desire to self harm. I was really lucky in that I had a therapist at the time and a great group of friends.

I've gone through a series of jobs in a very short amount of time(less than a year) due to anxiety leading to poor work performance.

Being without a schedule of a job or school is really hard on me and I've been struggling for a number of months with things slowly seeming to get better situationally-but worse mentally/emotionally. I've noticed that when I'm in conflict with the people I'm very close to I end up going into a depressive, almost disassociated state. My emotions are dampened and I shut down and stop caring for myself. I start fantasizing about self harm or even suicide. 

The most recent episode (today in fact) I argued with my mother and she accused me of using my anxiety to manipulate the people around me. This is one of my personal fears is that I'll use my anxiety unconsciously as a weapon and force people into doing things I want or need. I ended up feeling terrible and when she tried to make amends/talk through the problem I ended up taking it badly and shutting down. I've been feeling bad all day and my anxiety is being internalized. While walking the dog, I was carrying her poop bag to throw away when we had reached a trash can and I got the sudden urge to self harm/punish myself by forcing myself to paint myself with her poop and even eat it. I've noticed I have bizarre self punishment urges like that in the past (burn myself with hot water, eat sweets till I have to throw up, go lay down in the rain/snow/sun till I'm in extreme discomfort somehow, etc.) and I don't know what to do. I force myself to ignore them but I don't know why I have them and when I'm back in a more positive mind frame I get really freaked out.

I have a contrast between very poor self esteem and self image and feeling very positive about myself but my constant inner unconscious litteny is ""I'm useless, I'm just a drain on my family and friends, I'm not worth anything, they waste so much on me, there's no point in trying, I should just give up...""

I don't know what's going on with me and feeling like I should punish myself. Any words of advice or thoughts on the matter would be appreciated.",13May2018,1,
29,"I'm moving to Los Angeles in a few weeks. My counsellor back at school recommended that I find someone to help me with treatment but I kinda blew her off. I graduated from college last week (a year early), and spent the last month or so miserable and crying, regularly filming vlogs of myself to ""remember what this feels like."" (which I deleted in shame a few days ago)

I really hate myself quite a bit (that feels really weird to just say, and when I do say it, it doesn't register) and I have struggled with depression since childhood. 

Part of that means that I don't want to get the help and would just rather ignore it and fantasy about suicide, but it also means I'm miserable for long stretches of time which is not fun and also no way to live. Not miserable in the sense of I don't leave the house, but more like I feel immense pressure and weight at all times, weight I am consciously aware of, and aware of how I am the only one putting it on myself. 

And also, in my own mind, I've minimized this feeling to where I don't know if I have a condition. I honestly think at times that there is zero wrong with me, and I just need to grow up, suck it up, and be better as a person. Right? I'm only ""depressed"" because I'm not good enough to do the things I want creatively, or don't have a passion for ""work"" that isn't art or writing, or how I'm not desirable with women--and the only person stopping me is me so just stfu and be better. Everybody who has ever lived has faced this exact issue, I think.  

I say ""You won't be depressed when you get the things you want, so the only solution is work tirelessly until you get them and continuing working to keep them."" Or kill yourself, I always add, but it's either one or other, not settling for some miserable half-life so to speak. 

But then again, supposedly I actually have done a lot in my 21+ years on this planet, and yet I feel like I've done nothing. I still feel the same as I did when I was a fat loser in school, and even then I was supposedly not a fat loser (I was kinda, but who wasn't right) but actually a high-achiever with a lot of potential. I don't know. 
There was one kid growing up that people used to make fun of and call ""a school shooter"" (he wasn't, he was just a weird techy kid without a lot of friends) but he was the person with whom I identified the most with. Likewise with a girl who was fat and ""weird with no friends"", and another who was just kinda like a townie with no motivation. When I would tell people that, they'd always be surprised because in reality I wasn't anything like them. I guess that's just how I viewed myself.   

I always related more personally to the losers I had as friends and family, but also with the fear of ""don't be like them, they're losers."" Like I love (or loved) most of them, but they're losers. I think people do this with me too, like they love me for me but admit I am a loser. It's a weird dissonance, thinking of people ""oh you're good enough based on you being a human being"" and also ""you just aren't good enough relatively and it is what it is. Don't try to deny it."" 

I think I would rather be dead than be an adult loser and while I don't consider suicide as a real legitimate option now, I would then. But I'll admit I shift the goal posts. At this point in my life, it's like this: I want to be a writer and artist and filmmaker, but I'm not good enough to do to those things and I have to eat, so eventually I'll have to become a lawyer (this is what my family is pushing me toward now) or a teacher or some other dumbass thing to pay the bills. And when the time comes, I don't even want to find something that maybe I'll also like or be good at or pays well, because honestly I'd rather just shoot myself. 

Like I can envision the various paths of my life and most of them make me want to kill myself, and before anyone says anything, I am not going to continue to live for the sake of being alive. If I want to take my life for any reason, I have the right to do so, and the only reason I haven't is because to be dead is a very serious decision and one I don't treat lightly. Believe me, I think about this *a lot*, and a lot more than most, probably even than those who've done it. But I haven't done it, and it's because I would rather be alive and happy than dead. 

So that's what I mean when I say I shift the goal posts. Like, I should be like ""oh, a lawyer, with a nice car and a stable job and a girlfriend/wife what a nice life"" but it's more like ""what a fuckin loser."" Not to mention that I also am super terrified of a relationship and sex. I'm a virgin and kissless which is a big deal to me, and as a young child (like 3rd grade) I was made fun as ""forever alone"" which has stuck with me since, because I have been. 

And I think I now know what it means when people say ""you need to love yourself before someone else can love you"" because the idea of someone wanting me for me fills me with anger and sadness. Even just thinking about it makes me profoundly upset, but I'm not sure if this because I actually feel empty (and so a hypothetical person in this scenario just reminds me of how empty I feel) or if the idea of opening up really scares me. I think it might be both, but if it's the former then an actual real-life relationship wouldn't generate these feelings I suppose. 

I don't put myself out there but I don't want to because it's too much hurt and too much pressure. But then the pressure continues to build, since everyday is another where I remain a kissless, sexless, loser. I don't have great friendships either because I'm super jealous of my friends or just straight up hate them and want to keep to myself. I'm an extrovert but I'm a loner in many respects because I don't feel accepted. The friends who reach out to me, I ignore. I'll admit it's total mental gymnastics, and also a little of ""at this point in my life, my 'friends' aren't my friends but people I'm leaving behind."" 

And like I've said, I'm totally normal outside my mind. I really am, but this is a world I've concocted in my head and the only solution appears to be to work through it to get everything you want, or die. 

Lastly, I'll add this. I was a highly gifted child and have a supremely advanced intelligence even now, but I'm not a savant at anything, or passionate about math or science or law or anything in any way. Like I said, my passion is with art but I don't know if I'm talented enough. I'm not ""artsy"" in my personality type so I've always isolated from that community. Then again, I've felt isolated from *every* community. 

My savant skill is comedy and I've been the funniest person since I can remember and run circles around other performers, have been recognized by people as having this gift and performed comedy. In many ways, I feel very similar to Robin Williams and other notable comedians and artists whom have been depressed and eventually committed suicide. I feel as if at some point, whether or not I achieve success in these fields, I probably will kill myself, but I can't predict the future so it's a ridiculous thing to just suggest like that. It just glorifies my life smh. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and even if you don't have advice or anything really to say, I'd appreciate a comment or something just letting me know ""hey man I relate"" since I know I can't be alone. I really would like to get the help and move past this debilitating issue that I have struggled with my whole life, but I'm not sure I can afford therapy. Although I definitely would consider it if someone in the LA area can recommend someone. If not, are there other ways to retrain my mind into thinking differently? ",13May2018,2,

He readily admits that he has considered suicide and that the only thing preventing him following through is his younger sister and the fact one of his close friends did commit suicide and he doesn’t want to put any of us through that.

I have spoken with him tonight and told him i am there to help and support him any way I can, either as someone to talk to or to support him seeking professional help financially.

32,"I don't usually feel safe posting these sorts of things but I may now be at a point where it's no longer safe keeping this bottled up, let me give you a bit of a background.

I work 45-60 hours a week, depending on how busy work is. My grandfather (the man who raised me) has a terminal illness called MSA (Multiple system atrophy) and I've seen him go from the strongest man alive to a man who can't eat a spoonful of food, I could give it the ""he's still the strongest person I know"" speech, but he's tried to kill himself three times now because he doesn't want to go through this anymore and I completely get that. My birthgiver (""mother"") once gave him 150+ paracetamol so he could do it, there's a reason nobody in the family talk to her. 

Im at a point where all I want to do is come home and sleep and not talk to anybody, and I mean if I'm in such a state I'll scream at somebody who asks me how my day was. I can't be bothered to cook any more so I end up picking up a sandwich from the local shop for lunch and more often than not fast food for dinner... Not healthy I know.
I don't ever want to leave the house, sometimes I don't even want to go to work but I know I have to, I find it really easy talking to people online like Snapchat, instagram, Facebook etc but when it comes to making plans in real life it's like I'm too anxious to go and see anyone, I often think about jumping out of my bedroom window, knowing I won't do it, but still locking the windows and flushing the key away just incase. 

I don't know what is wrong with me and it's taken alot of strength to write this and I'm currently crying because this is the most open I've been in my entire life...

For the background, I am 17 years old girl and for the past two years of my life has been pretty crazy. Two years ago my long\-term \(9yrs\) best friends \(4\) dumped me and left alone. I have learned after that it was one of the girls that did everything to get me out and told everyone my secrets I had shared with her. She got what she wanted. The rest of them tried to come back and make it up, but after a long time of trying I realized the damage had been done and I could no longer trust them. I still do miss our memories A LOT and having close friends, sometimes I still cry about it and think about dying because never getting over my past. That was the part where my depression and anxiety really kicked in and ever since been very lonely. But I have learned that they are a part of me and will always be. 

 At that time when I lost my friends, I met my boyfriend whom I am still with, we have had A LOT of ups and downs but the last months I feel like we finally have come to an serious peace and are actually truly happy with the relationship and each other. I still do have a lot of stupid anxiety about our past that I hate, and I hate it because I can't do anything about it but accept it. I just don't know how to make a peace with past. Its a serious problem for me. 

 The problem is just what I have and I am going through in my head. I've also gone through 2 abortions in one year, which I feel both of the times really destroyed me and left me in a really, really dark place. Every time I have been on birth control it got my depression and anxiety way out of control and that is why I got off the pills, and I obviously got pregnant, stupid, yes, I know that. Most of the time I feel like a total failure with my life and the decisions I have made. I totally see myself as a weak person. To say, I am a very emotional and sensitive person, and thats why these experiences have been really tough. If anyone believes in horoscopes, mine is pisces. 

In my childhood my parents broke up when I was 3, and I believe with everything happened between my family when I was young, has affected a lot to me who I am today and why I have problems in relationships. There just happened a lot. 

I have told my mother that I need to talk to an psychotherapist before I no longer live, so im not sure when that will happen because I know that psychotherapist is a good one.

 I strongly want your peoples opinions and tips on how to survive a bad anxiety and how to find peace with yourself and THE PAST. I can open up more if you want to know about something. Thank you!",13May2018,3,

38,"i can’t do anything anymore and i don’t even know what good it is to be posting here because i probably know the answers to my questions but i just feel like i can’t get out of this rut i’m in 

i’m a 17 year old female i stopped going to school in year 9 but i managed to complete year 10 half because the school felt bad for me and half because i managed to stay sort of a float 

i don’t have my license, i’ve had three jobs, one i had to leave because i moved homes, one i had to leave because they closed down and the other i left because i became way too stressed and anxious every day.

since i left my job i haven’t done anything, i left TAFE (australian education system i think it’s similar to community college in america) during my cert 4 in game design because i never went and i just fell too far behind.
i’ve completed a business cert 2 and a multimedia and web design cert 3. 
neither of which really help me at all and all of which i passed by doing the bare minimum and being constantly anxious because i never went and was so close to falling too far behind.

i have no drive for anything at all. my rooms a fucking pig sty so i don’t really spend my time in there unless i’m sleeping.
i just scroll reddit or play video games all day every day until the weekend comes around and i go and see my friends, rinse and repeat. 

to be fair to myself my life has been fucked, my dad is extremely depressed and would blame me for it. i’ve seen things no kid should have had to see.
my mother has a had a rough life too but partied through all my childhood leaving me in a constantly anxious environment, many traumatic things happened.
my step dad, whom i looked up to and considered a father figure and someone i went to for all my problems recently became my worst nightmare as he admitted to having sexual feelings for me, i didn’t tell anyone as it would break my family apart and it’s never been this secure before.
i know you’ll say i should tell someone, but he hasn’t acted on it apart from offering me money for favours and being generally creepy.
but i can’t, i can’t because he’s had a kid with my mother and because they’re married and our lives has never ever been so normal and functional.
everything we’ve worked for would go down the drain, i just can’t, it’s not an option.

i’m constantly anxious and depressed, sometimes borderline psychotic.
i need to go back and see a psychologist but i can’t for the life of me get my shit together to do it, i need to find a new job but i can’t fucking do it.
i feel like i’m broken, i feel like i can’t be fixed. i have no support in my life and i’m left to fend for myself yet i can’t, i don’t feel like i have it in me nor am i strong enough.
i’ll have one of these mental break downs maybe once a week but the rest of the time i’m just nothing, no emotions what so over just lying there wishing i didn’t exist.
but killing myself isn’t an option because of my sister, because i want to be better but i just don’t know how.

i guess what i’m asking is how the fuck so i “just” do it like everyone tells me?

i think about it so much, i’ve been fucking thinking about doing stuff for the last 3 years but i never do it. 

i just have no energy, motivation or life left in me. 
sometimes i have a good few days where i manage to get a few things done but i crash really fast and it all feels like too much and i go back to my hiding place. i feel like i’m doomed.

i don’t know what to do anymore 

has anyone felt like this and if you have, how did you get out of it

Went to work today, felt really good, then a coworker accidentally misgendered me. I jokingly corrected him, and he got super defensive. After a couple minutes, he left and I guess I was upset. Another coworker, whos my mate, tried to comfort me because I was holding back tears. She left, I went to the bathroom and came back. First guy caught me as I came back to passive-aggressively apologise, causing me to start crying again. I think I had a panic attack right there because I was struggling to talk or breathe. Other coworker again tried to comfort me, then told me to just go home and calm down. So I did.

42,"My co-identity is ruining my life. I have violent and disturbing thoughts 24/7 and I can't control it. Whenever I talk to someone the thoughts of them being hurt or killed are non-stop and they clash with my normal thoughts, it causes me to blank out and not clearly talk well because I'm so distracted by the thoughts. I cry often over it and I don't know what to do. I always thought about telling someone my problem face to face but I'm afraid I might hurt them or something can someone here help me? My co-identity is best described as a vicious soldier who wants to see a battlefield and it's stressed that it can't, so the urge of facing an enemy has resulted in it seeing everyone as one. Triggers are: Getting patched on social media, stress over stuff like exams and reputation among friends, seeing people cry(even in films and such), seeing someone bullied or harassed, going out with family, going out shopping, isolation, others getting hurt or manipulated, and bad people like rapists, murderers etc. My co-identity is always there, but it changes intensity depending on how the day went. I'm 17 and I don't understand why my co-identity sees itself as a soldier, I've never had experience with weapons or had contact with any military things so it confuses me.

I just started at uni (Sweden) but i had a hard time getting friends, i heard for ex that some in my course thought i was a nutcase and a real ass.

Finally a casual fling with a girl from another country ended when she told me that she met someone else (perfectly reasonable) but i took her rejection way worse than i expected.

All of these problems are run of the mill adolescent problems so i shrugged it of and thought visiting someone for help was unnecessary. I am seeing a psychologist now though for the past two weeks but i feel as though my problems aren't serious enough to warrant it?

I'll suddenly be full of energy, I'll say and do stupid things, like laying on tables or shouting abuse at my friends because I think it's hilarious at the time. I mean, there's always a bit of good-natured ribbing and insults in our humour, but when I'm feeling like this I'll take it to the next level, and it will sound extremely funny. These mood swings last for an hour tops and almost always end with me curled up on the ground laughing my arse off so hard that I start to drool. The worst times to have them are at night time, because then I do really stupid things like giving myself really heavy nosebleeds because it feels like a good idea at the time. I don't really feel like I'm in full control of my actions when I'm having one of these mood swings, I'm way more impulsive, and I feel like I've lost the ability to think about my actions before I do them.

Afterwards I'm often super tired for a few minutes and then I'm fine again, or if it happens on a day that my depression is particularly bad, I can feel myself coming back down and I just crash really hard.

48,"Hi, everyone. I'm 25 and I've been dissociating my whole life. There have only been a handful of times I've been ""present"" in my life so far, and I remember these instances clearly because of how rare they are.

I've been going to therapy for years but it was mostly to deal with my OCD, which often took priority over my other mental issues (I have ADHD and Bipolar II as well). I've been on meds and now I'm not. I'm doing really well. (As a side note, I have not been through any severe traumas but I grew up in a chaotic household which is probably how my dissociation started.)

However, I'm still dissociating constantly. This isn't new, but I find it interfering with my life more now that I'm an adult. I didn't care about connecting with people for most of my life so my dissociation was fine for me. But now I'm trying to be more social and also to be present when I'm around my partner.

When I dissociate a lot I use it to be creative. I'm a writer and a storyboard/comic artist so I spend a lot of my ""daydream"" time to think about stories. I dissociate during important times and purposely try to feel like I'm someone else, like a character I want to develop. Even when I tell myself to ""be present"", it hardly ever works. It is something that I just slip into. It's obvious that my brain is more comfortable doing this and it's become a habit. Sometimes I prefer to dissociate so I can think about anything else, even when I'm not particularly stressed or anything. I get a lot of good ideas for art when I'm dissociating, and art is incredibly important to me. When I'm dissociating, I'm aware of where I am and who I am but don't pay attention to what's going on around me or what I'm doing.

It's not always daydreaming. Even when I'm not daydreaming, I'm still ""not all there"". Even when it's not like I'm ""actively"" dissociating, I always feel like there's glass between me and whatever is physically in front of me. I feel like I'm not in a physical plane. It frustrates me a lot. I've been hardcore dissociating this past year, to the point where sometimes everything around me feels fuzzy and even though I'm walking I'm not exactly sure how I'm walking. I dissociate most when I'm walking. When I walked a lot in college, I felt like I ""floated"" to class rather than walked. This is definitely a problem when I don't pay attention and bump into people or don't pay attention when I'm walking towards a road.

This might also be a focus problem, since I have ADHD and I either can't concentrate on anything or I hyperfocus on it. I think it is more than that, though.

I did not dissociate when I was on certain meds HOWEVER these meds also made it so I couldn't think at all. My brain was static so there was nowhere for me to ""slip away"" to, if you know what I mean? During this time I craved social interaction but lost a lot of my personality and creativity (I almost failed college because it was art classes and I couldn't do art while on these meds).

TL;DR I need to strike a balance with this but I don't even know how to cut down on my dissociation. I don't know how to be creative without dissociating but I know dissociating is bad for me. I feel like there's glass between me and the physical plane.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.",13May2018,1,

50,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but if not perhaps I can get recommendations of the proper sub for this post?

So I have always been pretty squeamish, not good with blood or biological things, which is incongruous with the rest of my identity/personality \(intellectual, curious, in touch with my body, etc\). I wrote it off as just kind of annoying, until an experience I had about 2.5 years ago. I went to a gynecologist for the first time \(I was 21 at the time\) because I'd seemingly gotten my period twice in a month. I warned the \(female\) doctors as I always do that I pass out very easily. As they began an examination I got woozy, dizzy, tunnel vision that eventually goes black, overheated, sweating, pale, sudden plummet in blood sugar, etc all the usual symptoms. As I'm in the middle of trying not to lose consciousness one doctor says to the other ""She's vagaling"" and then asks me if I have a history of sexual assault. Being almost unconscious and extremely uncomfortable I couldn't process that question or why she was asking. Also, no doctor had ever given a name to this horrible thing \(blacking out/fainting\) that happened to me.

So the fact that these two things could be related left me with a lot of questions. I put it out of my mind until recently when I began seeing my boyfriend and wanted to get on birth control. I made an appointment, warned the doc, etc, but still I ended up ""vagaling"" and just about passing out, just from discussing BC options. No exam, nothing crazy. When I came to, I tried to ask the doc why she thought this was happening to me as it clearly is interfering with my life in a fairly big way. She suggested it was a psychological defense from sexual trauma, and suggested I see a therapist to work through it.

While I do have a history of sexual assault, I consider it pretty processed and it doesn't regularly haunt me or anything \(consciously at least\).

I had 2 sessions with a therapist which were oddly terrible, so much so that I considered asking for my money back, but I'm assuming that was just bad luck, so I'll try again when I muster the courage.

So, I have a couple questions for you all:

Has anyone experienced anything similar to any part of this?

Does anyone have any more information on the vagal response, and it being connected to trauma, and causing such an intense reaction?

My biggest fear is that I have some repressed memory that's causing this. If I've been fine up till now, minus the passing out at the doctor and whenever anyone discusses pregnancy/BC/reproductive biology, is it worth opening that can of worms? However, can I get this under control without exploring that possibility?

I really want kids some day, but I'm scared I couldn't handle being pregnant/giving birth at all. I know this is a lot and maybe there's no good answer but I'm just looking for some advice! Thanks for reading.",13May2018,8,

The heart of the issue, though, is that she obviously refuses to admit that anything she's said could be inaccurate and refuses any sort of psychiatric help. She believes the rest of the family are the ones that are wrong and spends her entire day online reading about new ailments that we could have succumbed to. She regularly comes to my dad or I with tests she thinks can determine whether or not their house is dangerous or whether we're sick, but when the results come back negative, she always finds an excuse to explain why the tests weren't valid. It's sort of an endless money pit, and I've stopped doing them because it's a waste of both my time and money. Every test she finds is ""the test that we've been looking for all this time"" that is the be all/end all, and every time we do it and the results come back, she claims it was the wrong test or that the results were sullied by some outside force.

57,"For the past 5 months or so I have been having this attitude and feeling come over me. I recently married a wonderful woman, but I've been becoming grumpy for no reason. I just want to be left alone for a long time without her around. She hasn't done anything wrong. 
I also have found myself kind of cringing at wholesome things. My church showed a great video for Mother's Day detailing what it's like to be a mom. (My own mother is an angel of a woman, I love her very much). But even so, the video just made me cringe. I see happy families and the idea of having a family fills me with dread, again despite liking children. 
People I consider friends, I haven't really wanted to interact with them. They come and say hi at church and I kind of just say hi and try to say as little as possible to disincentivize further communication. Except for my best friend, and my own parents, I really don't want to interact with anyone. 
I have also found myself having difficulty laughing at things that aren't, at the very least, edgy or borderline offensive. I don't have anger problems, and I don't have I'll will towards others.

60,"So I was with a guy for 3 months almost a year ago and we had a toxic relationship. I was always insecure and jealous over his ex because him, his family and friends would always want to talk about her. I didn't trust him either because he wasn't always honest and I think he still wanted her. I think he wanted me to look like her too because I had short hair and he always said he wanted my hair to be longer. He frequently made that kind of comment. 

We constantly argued about her because she would try to contact him and he wouldn't tell me. He would hide it until I found out. He also never told me in the beginning that he wanted to stay in touch with her family. I couldn't tell him not to but I made my feelings clear that it bothered me.. I felt he had too much of a connection to her. He also told me that he doesn't fall in love easily anymore because he's gotten hurt so many times, including by her. 

7 months later he's dating someone who kind of looks like her. He writes things about his girlfriend on his Facebook that he wrote about his ex. He never wrote these things about me. He never said I was his dream girl or that he wanted a life with me. He's only been with her for 3 months. He also doesn't have his ex's family on Facebook anymore.

62,"Hi there. I would like to ask you for your opinion, and would be so thankful for your help. I recently broke up with my boyfriend with whom I was in a short relationship. I am still in shock because it was unpredictable, came all of a sudden, like he was possessed with some kind of a demon. I'll make it short, first I was accused of cheating, which I did not commit, ever. There wasn't a single reason that could lead to him thinking it, yet he suddenly thought that I wasn't faithful. There was a loooong discussion in which I practically begged him to tell me what are his reasons to think that way, and his only responses through 3 days of torture were ""you better tell me yourself"", ""don't play stupid"", ""don't play games, what are you lying to me?"" ""you know what you did"" and whatever my respond was, he never gave up on the idea that I had something hidden from him. But never told me the reasons why he thought it, even when I begged him to tell me, and not once I offered to take all responsibility of hurting him in any way, if he just told me how I hurt him. There was this situation in which he flipped, but once I totally explained it minute by minute where I was and what I was doing (for which I mostly had proofs), he even  ACCEPTED that I ""maaaay not have cheated on him, but what am I hiding then?""

I gave up after 5 full days of torture, in which after the first day I thought instantly that it is over, started recovering, crying in shock, the third day he texted ""Have you stopped playing dumb?"" in a way to discuss the ""issue"" and finally admit my ""guilt"". 
And when I told him that I wont take his shit anymore, he told me again that he will text me in a few days when I stop playing dumb.

That went for some time, until I finally said goodbye for good today. 

The big thing is, I begged him to see each other to discuss it eye-to-eye, but he never wanted to. He told me that he WANTS to be in a relationship with me, but I that never wanted to have an honest talk with him (!!!!!) and that he will not want to discuss it in ""live"" until I admit what am I hiding from him.

Broken as fuck, I tried to end it few times for good, but he always texted me after my final goodbye. Hi doesn't want to break up with me, seems madly in love, but still blames me for even he doesn't know what. Also, talks in a very unfriendly manner, cynical and blames me like I am the one who is crazy, childish etc.

I want answers, but I will probably never get them from him. All my friends who saw our convos told me that he is ""crazy and psycho"", but I just wanted to know is it possible that it is some kind of mental illness or just an ugly jealousy, egoistic trait.

My mom, who was in a mental hospital for ptsd for 6 months told me that he is probably bipolar, because it was so sudden, and that bipolar comes in many ways.

Although, even if used for that reason I've deemed it inhumane to use these people for my personal growth. The insights I'm finding about myself are painting a troubling picture. 
A little example of what I mean by mean. I was 12 years old and dating a girl my age named Lily. I was cheating on her with her unattractive best friend Liz, of whom I didn't like or find attractive. I was cheating on Lily for the purpose of making her like me with more passion, I figured that if I plant the seeds of mistrust in her but didn't blatantly reveal I was cheating she'd work harder to keep me. Let me do worse things to her. So one night during sex with Lily I took off a locket with a golden heart on it, given to me by Liz and left it on her nightstand intentionally. She called me the next day and asked me where I got it, I said my mother gave it too me. The very next night I told Lily I wanted to perform a sexual act with her she's denied ,me before, anal. She accepted this time. Why? She told me after I broke up with her ""I didn't want to lose you to someone who would more passionately please you"". That sentence alone brought me a great deal of satisfaction. I had created a new person, a person who was devoted to me (Or at least more so than the person they used to be).

Basically what I do, wether I want to or not, is trying to remove any unecessary aids when reaching my goals. Example: I could get stronger by eating more and gaining muscle. However, sin e someone of the same weight as me lifts heavier weights I force myself to try and become just as strong with the same amount of muscle. Basically I want to achieve all my goals without any unnecessary advantages or helps, with the minimum requirements fulfilled needed to reach them.

I don't think this is self-destructive behavior because I'm not trying to intentionally sabotage myself.",13May2018,1,

71,"Has anyone of you ever had to tell your parents about things that worry you related to your mental health? Especially as a teenager. I'm 17 in two days and I desperately need to talk to my parents about what I'm going through. I can't function properly and it would be much easier if I had some support in them, and didn't have to hide my panic attacks and meltdowns. 
I tried talking to my mum once but she just laughed at me and shouted that I need to pull myself together, because I'm making problems up for attention. I feel really anxious since that conversation. She's really strong and always focuses on what she has to do rather than what she feels. I can't in any way imagine her understanding what I mean and that I'm not joking. 
Thank you for your help, have a great day/night/morning/evening/life.",13May2018,4,
72,"So I’m a 17 year old. My mother was married to my biological father till I was 2 y/o till he got into a car accident and after all that he started using the pain killers as drugs. So she got a divorce. A year later she started with my step-dad (never got married) and they had a 14 year relationship  and till about 3 years ago. 

Everything started going downhill when my mother wanted another kid but my step-dad didnt. He says that he was “forced” into getting a 3rd kid. He wasnt happy anymore so he cheated on my mother (she found msgs on messenger). After that night she found the messages there was daily fighting and arguing for the past three years. I think my brain didn’t handle it tjat well because i started having constant mood swings (from being a happy man to going depressed in the matter of seconds). This hasn’t happened till a few months ago, but yesterday i heard my step-dad wishinf my mother to die(not in front of her) and I stopd up for her and he threatened me. 

I got tired of everything so I decided I’m going to visit my biological father in Australia for my birthday, and my mother didn’t take it that well. She said: “you are no better than your step-dad”.
I’m so mentally tired and heartbroken of everything guys.I never self-harmed or anything although it passed through my mind several times. 

What do you guys recommend? Thanks a lot

73,"So I finally met the psychiatrist and have been on aripiprazol 5mg for 3 weeks without improvement. I am also meeting with a psychologist to help with understanding my issues and creating a plan which I feel good about.


Now my dose will increase to 10 mg/day. I haven't had many side effects yet. How does/did aripiprazol affect you at which dosage?",13May2018,1,
74,"Hey, I just wrote out a long post about this topic but accidently deleted it. (Facepalm)
Anyways to put it in short, I was thinking of making a discord server for people who are down but feel they have no one to talk to.
Thanks, feedback appreciated. ",13May2018,1,

I have gone thru over a year of treatment for schizophrenia and when I got home I felt it would be a nice idea to create a community online of ethier recovering or recovered individuals. My goal is to help as many people as possible and to create a safe and educational spot were anyone with schizophrenia and or bipolar can hopfuly grow.

76,"On mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. 

I currently live in the UK with my family in a semi-detached house, the other side of the house is occupied by a lady in her late 50s or early 60s.

She is most likely Schizophrenic - she has been talking (although more often than not shouting/incoherent screaming) to herself for at least 3 years but has been getting worse and worse recently.

It is often very difficult to hear what she is saying due to the scream/shout but it is possible to catch words and phrases which I sometimes write down. Topics can vary greatly from Nazis to Stocks and Shares. She swears a lot and has talked about my family, including that we are spying on her :(. It's hard to miss the yelling. 

She has different ""voices"" that she uses sometimes, often in conversation or argument with other voices. 

She has been a recluse for around 8 years, however still manages to do food shopping and cares for herself - every time she returns from the shops there is always a fit (of shouting and screaming. (Seems like it was bottled up whilst she was in public but I don't know if this is a thing). 
We see her occasionally getting off the bus and heading home from the shops, but when we have spoken to her before she has actively ignored us or moved to the other side of the road. 

She also has no family left and therefore no nearest relative who can make decisions for her if she was to be sectioned. 

We have spoken to Mind - who were sadly not very helpful in this case. I spoke to citizens advice but they didn't have much to offer either. 
The Police have said that we should call them if she is harming us or herself. I don't feel that she is apart from the lack of sleep we sometimes get when she shouts at 3AM. 

I also feel that mental illness shouldn't get someone arrested and am especially worried about how the system would treat her. 

This is a very unique and hard situation for me and my family and we would appreciate advice from people with knowledge in this area, Thanks :)",13May2018,9,
77,"Months after a nervous breakdown (triggered by living with my mom), I am recovered but returning to myself and feel like I'm ready to absolute SNAP at her. I go to a therapist, whose helped me through this whole process.

How do I prevent from snapping or let out my anger in a healthy way?",13May2018,3,
78,"I’m 19 f first year medical student and I just need to vent maybe this isn’t the right subbredit I’m sorry. I just got back from the library and I couldn’t help it as son as I closed my bedroom door i just let it pour all out my exhaustion, frustration, fear. I feel like screaming fuck it and just going away. I’ve been through an entire pack of cereal bars as I did last night and the night before.... I feel bloated but it makes me feel marginally better when I eat. I look at myself in the mirror and hate how I’ve gained weight on my thighs how my jeans look like their going to pop around my bloated stomach. I think of the guy I’m seeing and what hell think cos he hasn’t seen me in a while. I think of how lonely I am and how I no longer feel anything towards what I’m studying I just want it to be over. 

I don’t want to seem ungrateful but I feel so crappy right now so done with fucking life I’m a stupid bitch I stopped praying but I still expect God to help me I’m a fucking hippocrite. I don’t know what to do feel a failure fat don’t feel confident for my exams feel sick. I wake up at random early in the morning and just lay there wanting to just sleep all day long but then I force myself to go in be alone smile at the people who only know my name but don’t know me.",13May2018,1,
79,"Right I’ll be honest. This may not be the best place to post this and it’s taking a lot to even type this but I just want an idea of what is going on.

I think I have some sort of mental illness. I am paranoid constantly and have some really weird things happening, idk why but when I’m talking to someone or thinking something I wouldn’t say out loud I believe that people can hear what I’m thinking and everything seems like they are seeing what is going on in my head (I.e that girl is hot, or I don’t like that guy) also I’m hyper aware of all cameras and what people say and wha they could mean by it. Also my mind keeps saying “there’s hidden cameras be careful” 
I feel flat and don’t trust people anymore, I feel worthless and unimportant sometimes but others I get a split second of over the top happiness about random crap then I’m back to how I was.
I don’t feel safe in my own head with my own thoughts anymore. 
What’s wrong with me.
(Sorry long ik)
Edit: I’ve posted this on other subs so if you’ve seen this before that’s why
