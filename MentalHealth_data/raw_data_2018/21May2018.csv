0,"I used to have intense anxiety about 2-3 years ago that I had since I was little. I used to be very motivated in school and would study for hours on end. I had a drive to know as much as I could and to get straight As. 
About a year ago I went through a depressive episodes where I lost motivation to do well in school, but I still did well in school and felt intelligent. 
After another depressive episode where I couldn’t do any school work, I am now on Prozac and feel much better. I am the most mentally healthy I have been in years. It’s wonderful. But I’ve felt an incredible decrease in the amount of motivation I have for school. I used to care so much about being the best and getting good grades, and now I couldn’t care less. I don’t care about how I do in school or the grades I get. I feel less intelligent than I used to be, but I don’t care. I skip homework assignments that I could easily complete just because I don’t feel like it. I don’t pay attention in class just because I don’t want to. All of this apathy and lack of motivation is concerning me and I was wondering if anyone else had felt the same way after “getting rid” of their mental illness. ",21May2018,2
1,"ADD. OCD. Depression. Shitload of smaller but still painful issues. It all just hurts. I don't know how to fix it and I don't know if they can be fixed. Adderal isn't helping a whole lot, or maybe it is I can't always tell because my mind is everywhere and nowhere at once. I disassociate and panic and second guess myself. I get depressed because everything hurts and maybe I'll never get better. I want it to be better. I'm just not sure if it can be better. I don't know how to be better. I just want to stop hurting. I want to not be in pain. I want to be at peace. I've forgotten how it feels to be at peace and not in pain. 

I can't think. And when I beat past the ADD for a second the OCD is there staring me down. OCD is like a background program running on your computer that won't shut down and just takes up RAM and memory. If I can beat back OCD for any small amount of time I get dissociative and depressed. Something is always hurting. 

I can't find a therapist right now, legal and financial craziness that's outta my hands. I don't know how to fix this.",21May2018,1
2,"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for upwards of five years now. I've been in therapy, psych wards, and PHP programs while cycling through a plethora of medication and fighting back suicidal thoughts. I very nearly killed myself three years ago, and then again a year and a half ago. I've been stable-ish for about nine months now, but a lot of the time it still feels like I'm going crazy. I have days when I wake up with my energy levels in the negatives, days when I can't stop jumping at every little thing that happens, and days when I can't focus on anything and float through life as if from behind a cloudy veil. Sure, I'm ""stable,"" I got through my first year of college with decent grades and everything, but I still didn't feel like I was *recovering*.

The thing that made me see my own progress toward recovery, actually had nothing to do with me at all. My best friend recently broke up with her boyfriend of 4yrs because the relationship was actively damaging her. Boyfriend had some serious mental health issues and he was way too dependent on her. She'd been stressing about him and trying to get help for him for almost the entire time they were together, but he never wanted to get help. He kept calling himself a hopeless case, talking fatalistically and guilt tripping her about supposedly not caring about him. It wasn't that bad all the time, of course, his depression came and went in waves as most mental illnesses do, so my friend couldn't bring herself to break up with him. Until this past weekend, that is.

I feel really bad for her, and I hope the ex will let himself get help one day and develop healthier relationships with his friends and family. But at the same time, looking at him and the way he acts, I feel sort of...proud of myself? I was able to see how far I've come compared to someone like him who hasn't even started on the road to recovery yet. Maybe it's hard for me to get out of bed some days, but I always manage it in the end. Maybe I'm excessively jumpy, but I'm learning how to rationalize away my fears and use coping mechanisms. Maybe I'm sick and messed up but at least I'm *trying* to get better. And it feels terrible that I'm feeling *good* about his mental health being bad, just because I look better in comparison. I hate that I only felt that I was doing something right when it involved looking down on someone else.

Does this make me a bad person, or take away from my recovery? I *am* trying to get better, and I don't want to beat myself down over actual progress concerning my self image. But I also don't want to have to step on those who have it worse than me, in order to build myself up.

**tl;dr I couldn't see the progress I was making with my own mental health until I compared myself to someone who had it worse than me. I feel terrible about using him as a measuring stick but I also feel a lot better about myself and my own recovery.**",21May2018,3
4,"After being on Effexor for five years for depression I went to go see a psychiatrist for anxiety. I was late one day and she could not see me and I became very upset. I did take a rock and self-harm myself outside the office and then the next appointment she suggested that I might be borderline because of the self-harm. I went to a 3-week outpatient group therapy thing. Never heard about avoidant personality at all. Kept thinking I was a borderline but some of it didn't quite fit. Then one day looking at Pinterest I saw this thing that said desperate for attention but afraid of everyone. And it said avoidant personality disorder. Just wanting some insight. Im offically diagnosed with depression, gad, add. But all that seems to fall under the personality disorder unbrella.",21May2018,1

-Depressed and not content with life

10,I danced in the dark corner alone with everyone. I met a girl swaying to the 120bpm. She held my hand and asked if I need water. We pushed through crowd and in the light we saw each other. I had not held a hand that willing held mine for sometime. When she held me as we danced she placed her arms around shoulders and waist and push her cheek against my back. My neck gave way and I looked with eyes closed up to the ceiling and was reminded of what it felt like to be wanted... If only for that time with her she let me know she wanted to be with me for that moment. I lost her later on the crowd. It didn't feel like loss. It made me feel sad that I couldn't find her and for a while I wish I could see her again. 24hrs on I just remember her and it's not anxiety. It's the feel of yearning. A pang of my heart feeling again. Knowing that it could love more and with another person. I hope to meet her in that time she wanted me. And now. Well the monster has returned telling me this and that and making me... Or goading me to return to the place we both can plot toil and trouble and ways of exacting self sabotage. So now we sit together playing songs that make us grit our teeth and grimace with a spitefulness we know will push one more line up and exhale with satisfaction. This I am familiar with... This habit comes easy. But giving all again to someone else is something like a dream or wish but acting it out is harder that scoring one more time.,21May2018,3

13,"I was diagnosed with mdd in 6th grade and then major depression with psychosis in 8th and ever since 8th grade i havent felt happiness. For the majority of the time the doctors were switching meds until they found out one that ""worked"". It didnt work i just was sick of all these doctors and i decided to internalise my emotions until march 24th 2018 when i almost successfully took my own life. I went to a non residential hospital and spent a month there because they put me on all these meds that were supposed to help but my physical and mental health kept declining so i decided to internalise and get out. I started vomiting three times a day every day and lost 50 lbs in a month. The doctors thought it was liver cancer because dypsepsia shouldnt be this bad. But it turns out it was my anxiety causing me to vomit after going back to the life i tried to leave. I was getting more and more depressed but i did tell my psychatrist and i am very thankful for that. He gave me a controlled substance and for the first time in almost a decade i think i feel happy. The only symptom is the voice. The voice came into existance a year ago when i fell in love with someone who didnt know i existed. I had other voices back then. Back then she was the only encouraging and rational voice. But recently after an event with the girl she became the only voice and whenever i start to feel happy she tells me that i am too bad to feel happy that i need to suffer for as long as possible to make up for the crime of existing. But even more recently in the last 2 days she stopped talking as much. And i think i feel happy but it feels wrong. I know i dont deserve to feel happy and dont know how to handle it. To sum up after being treated for depression and psychosis for near a decade and coming out of it and feeling feelings you havent felt in years and know you shouldnt feel them, how can you keep feeling them when you like them but know they are wrong and dont/wont last long?",21May2018,1
14,"I recently started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist to fully deal with my past. I had a pretty rough upbringing and I understand how that coupled with traumatic events along the way could affect a person. I've always been aware of my situation but the desire to overcome my environment persevered. Being aware to it didn't make the road any easier, in fact sometimes it made me feel worse, but I think nonetheless I handled it as best as I could– and my psychiatrist agrees. 

Now that I'm finally out of survivor mode I can see a lot of cracks in my character that I want to fix. I don't want to let my past me define me anymore, you know? I also want to stop making excuses for these ""cracks"" and really become the best possible version of myself. 

When my psychiatrist mentioned depression I admitted that I think suffer from it but I felt that it was situational. I only felt lows after these traumatic events. I'm sure there were and still are things that lingered, but for the most part I really tried to push forward. Sometimes that meant pushing it to the back, pretending it didn't exist, but I was a child/teenager dealing with some very mature issues so there wasn't any ideal way for me to cope. In my head I had to do enough to get by and I promised myself that when I was ""out"" I would seek help. That's what I'm doing now but it is not without its challenges. 

Despite positive feedback from my psychiatrist, she thinks that I have developed a clinical depression due to back to back traumas. She wants me to try out Prozac and see how I deal with it. I know that she's a professional and I value her opinion, but it has been a week since she prescribed it and I can't get myself to actually start it.

Something is telling me to not take the pills. I'm not sure if it's fear of getting better or the fear of getting worse, but I have this wave of anxiety that makes me feel like the pills will have an adverse effect on me. 

I'm really hoping that someone could give me some perspective. At what point do I question the mental health professionals that are trying to help me? Am I overthinking this? 

TLDR; My psychiatrist thinks I'm clinically depressed and prescribed Prozac. I'm scared to start it. Am I being paranoid?",21May2018,1
15,"I've always wondered for the longest time why I seem to have such a great life, great friends and great family, wonderful girlfriend and truly most everything I want but yet sometimes I still feel like I'm not functioning entirely how I should. It usually just boils down to some random issue that will pop up the actual very hour my last one vanished and I'll normally be able to fix it but in this case I treat it like it's a bigger problem than it really is, or if all my relationships are doing great than I naturally put some form of tension on the relationships or my own mental health. I've always told myself that ""That's just life and you can never be truly happy for more than a day"" but I today I think I came to the conclusion that it might  be my constant attempt at trying to find ways for people to see my life isn't perfect. Like when I try to fix the issues I have, they all end and I can have perfectly healthy relationships where nothing really bothers me. I can push through the day and they're all gone, but I feel panicked by the feeling of ""perfection"" (Or in the very least, contentedness) like I can’t be a great person who is healthy and happy, otherwise it puts me in this stage of fear. Do you think it’s just an attempt at self-destructive behaviors in order to gain pity?

16,"throwaway bc yea

So I’ve been having a weird ass year. 

it started off with being very stressed for no reason. It got really bad I couldn’t focus on my school/work stuff. It slowly changed into paranoia, which isn’t fun. I was/am paranoid about something super horrible happening to me or someone I know, and these thoughts are usually accompanied by extremely graphic thoughts. They’ve gotten to the point where it feels like a that’s so Raven flash into a horrible thought, very vivid, horrid thoughts. I just end up staring at something for like 30 seconds without moving or blinking. One day I looked into the mirror and my brain couldn’t recognize my face for like 10 seconds. It was a horrifying feeling, almost like I was looking at a stranger. During this fit I’d also looked at my hands and body parts and they didn’t really look like mine. Then it morphed into a weird body image thing. Really self conscious and constantly making sure I didn’t look fat. Now, very recently, I’ve experienced this thing where I find this guy very attractive, am afraid my friends will find him ugly, but at the same time, think that I’m completely out of his league and feel insanely insecure compared to him. I had a weird fit where I almost started to cry because I didn’t feel as attractive as he was and I felt like I didn’t deserve him to like me. 

I know this is a whole lot, but I was wondering if anyone could provide some clarity into what’s going on. And if these are any symptoms of anything I should talk to someone about. ",21May2018,1
17,"I started reading this book called Insecure in Love which talks about anxious attachment styles (mainly with respect to romantic relationships) and other attachment styles. I definitely am someone who has anxious/preoccupied attachment styles as well as trust issues. 

But where I am different is that unlike a lot of people who have those issues, I don't have lingering psychological problems with my parents nor do I feel like I'm unworthy of love. The book says that generally people who are anxiously attached were abandoned as kids or weren't given consistent love/attention from their parents. That's not me. My parents are amazing. They've never abandoned me or made me feel alone or made me feel like I need their attention. They gave equal love and attention to my sister and I, and they still do.

Unlike many anxiously attached people, I also don't feel I'm worthless or unlovable or not deserving of love. Even at my lowest points, I've never felt that. I feel very lonely (despite having amazing friends that I love dearly), but I don't feel that I'm alone because I'm unlovable. I've always known that I'm a person of worth who deserves to be happy, and while I'm not perfect, I'm a good person at the end of the day. 

I can't really do some of the exercises in the book or implement some of the coping strategies because I already know that I'm lovable. The problem is I can't find the right people (I don't believe I ever will), but that's not the same as thinking I'm unlovable. 

So I'm wondering if there is a forum for people like me or if there are any people here who relate to this?",21May2018,3

I don't know what to do with myself, I don't get physical and I don't really act out, but I want you. It's like something inside wants to come out and hurt others: people who have done me wrong. I know this sounds weird, but I want to get punched, then beat the shit out of that person. I have bad anxiety and I have never been in a fist fight, but I want to do it. I stopped caring about myself and pain and how people think of me. I want to hurt people who don't know what it's like, so they hurt others; is that such a wrong ambition?

20,"I don't know if this is the right Sub, so forgive me if I'm in the wrong place. I regularly microdose and use LSD and have had a lot of great experiences and breakthroughs, moreso than I have had on any psych med, antidepressant, etc. I've had a small handful of bad experiences on it, as well, mostly from reasons stemming from self-doubt, revelations and eye-opening realizations of myself that I didn't really want to accept at the time, but overall it has been great and much more helpful than any antidepressant, mood stabilizer, antipsychotic or any other med I've been on since hopping on the medication merry-go-round. 
I start group and individual therapy and see a new psychiatrist soon and am wondering if I should mention that I have tried psychedelics and have had these mostly positive experiences with them. I feel like more bad would come of it than good and would shine a bad light on myself or something.

21,"I have had this problem since I was very young where for the most part I can easily distinguish my emotions, but I get these other awful feelings and I don't even know what they are, don't know what the names for them are, I can only say they are next level awful. 

Words I can think of that are vague but are all I can think of for them is weird, very uncomfortable, and makes me want to leave my body. 

These two feelings, not sure if they are physical or an emotion, that's how weird it is.

1. I get this extremely bad feeling that comes from my lower stomach, and it feels like embarrassment combined with revulsion. It feels like being trapped in a crowded elevator and someone farted. I have no idea why, it always comes out of the blue and I usually get it when I have to participate in family events or something. I don't hate my family, so it's not that. Maybe a self esteem problem.

The other feeling is extremely restless and like I need to yawn or stretch only throughout my whole body and nothing makes it go away. Like I had too much coffee. It feels almost like a real physical sensation just under the skin and in my muscles, an awful and very subtle burning discomfort. I go for walks but it doesn't do much. I do not do any hard drugs, have never touched them. I do have very bad anxiety, depression and the doc also thinks I have psychosis.

26,"Hi everyone, I'm 27 male living in UK. It is now been a little over a month without a job. The reason I quit my last job was because of my manager and how she affected my mental health ( I was not happy working with her, I felt mentally abused though I never spoke about it). After 2 years of tedious mental stress at work I have given up and quit. Now after one month without a job ( didn't apply for any) I have been feeling better since I got rid of most toxic people in my life. However, my brain still turbulent and it is still bothering me as my manager rang me few times if I wanted to cover her holiday and I said no. However I know I need money but I would rather die than work with her.
Anyway back to what is happening now, I live with my partner who is working full time and he always told me to find something else if I'm not happy. Easier said than done. I don't want to find another job because I'm still mentally healing from past work and I don't want to see anybody, specially if I have interviews they can see i'm not ok. I'm not a fake person and i'm a terrible liar. I can't force a smile on my face if I'm not ok and people can tell that.
Another reason I don't want to find a job is because I'm afraid of people, I get anxiety out of nowhere and afraid to get a job with toxic workers.
I used to love being a student, graduating from arts and achieving top grades though education meant nothing in this reality. However I'm glad I studied what I enjoyed, have no regrets but what is good never lasts. People need to find a job to pay their bills. At least that is what Government and Politics are doing, this country is all run by bureaucracy, well I guess that is everywhere.
Nevertheless, I know if I continue more time unemployed it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend. He will start thinking that I want him to be paying the rent and bills on his own and I'm nowhere that type of person and don't expect none of that. I have saved for at least 3 months without work.
After that, I just don't want to think about it. I don't want to move back to my parents house either, I would rather be homeless.
I'm losing my life direction, I was hoping after I had quit my job that I would recover and realise what ''job'' I would like to do but so far I see nothing ahead of me. 
I looked at job opportunities that don't require me to work with people and can't find anything where I live. If you know any part time jobs that have minimal or no people interaction, please let me know.

I think that is the end of my depressing story. Thanks for reading",21May2018,4

Just needed some advice. So I've been kinda sad and have had a negative mentality for about 4 years now. I'd like to give some background:

4 years ago I was super in love with this girl. But, she eventually chose to be with another man and posted the event on Facebook. I can remember sitting working wondering why she wasn't responding to my texts. She texted me and said check Facebook, and there it was, I saw a picture of her with one of my friends and they had gotten in a relationship. She left me for someone else, and I found out that way: anyways, since then I haven't spoken to her much at all really, but the problem I've been having is that I just don't feel happy anymore. Things don't bother me as much, I don't get as much joy out of things as I used to. I want this to change and I want to be a better human and feel things more and be happy again.

29,"I'm everything to my wife. I play caregiver, therapist, doctor (dr google), support system, financial system, driver, shopper...I do everything for her. But lately, it has become too much. We painted ourselves into a corner, per se with her mental and physical health. Her mental health is stable when her and her family are doing well. When her father had a heart attack, she had a break down. When I had cancer, she had a breakdown. Now she has stomach issues/recurrence of c diff, she's having a breakdown. She's been out of work on medical leave since March, her physical health has been worsening due to the c diff, the treatment, and acid reflux, mix in the anxiety and panic attacks and it's a real...cluster fuck. Besides the panic, there are times when she can be...manipulative? Where she has used my love to get what she wants when I'm tough on her (it has been when I tell her I won't take her to the ER because I don't believe she needs to when we have gone daily or more than once a week). Yesterday she went to the ER in the morning and we got back home and I needed to go get my oil changed. I told her to stay home and relax while I did it because they gave her norco and she was a little dizzy...she physically tried to keep me from going, something she has done numerous times before. I told her I was going to call the cops on her if she didn't let me go, and she stopped....I got to the dealer and checked in and everything and was waiting in the lobby, getting a little bit of me time when she called. I didn't want to answer. After the third time, I did and she said she was dizzy and I told her to lay down. After I hung up, she walked up to me in the lobby....she had taken an Uber to the dealership rather than stay at home. She said she fell twice getting to me (I don't know if it was guilt or what) but I got upset and walked out and told her why, who would think it would be the most logical and rational thing to chase after me if she was feeling dizzy. Call an ambulance even, but don't come chasing after me in an Uber....we waited out for the car and when we got home she was begging that I take her to the ER. I told her no but she could go, that no one was stopping her from going. She doesn't drive and I told her to take an Uber there. She said a stranger shouldn't be taking her, that her partner should. I told her I didn't want to go. Things needed to be done around the house, we have pets to take care of. I told her no but to go if she wanted because I didn't want to waste my weekend in the ER when I knew the outcome because it's been the same every time we've gone. It was mentally draining.  Nothing got through to her.  Nothing does unless it's something she wants to hear to get what she wants.  And she's admitted at one time she does and says these things because she knows I will eventually do what she wants....I feel so drained because she's right. I do these things in hopes that I get the wife that I remember falling in love with. But each day now I'm finding it hard to hold on, I feel more lost every day. Her world is confusing and easy to get lost in. To stay sane all I can do is focus on my needs because she doesn't know what she even needs and anything suggested, there's a problem on why she won't do it. No one seems to know how to help that doesn't involve waiting weeks for appointments for therapy, and when we have an appointment, something happens where we couldn't go, and the appointments we did go to didn't do anything to help and the next appointments are days away. I'm finding it really hard to hold on to this relationship when I'm starting to feel used rather than being a partner in this. She always says she's sorry for the way she acts but it really feels like she doesn't care if I'm at work or have responsibilities to take care of. Like walk the dogs in the morning when she was begging to go to the ER, I wanted to give them relief but she said no, that we needed to go. Panicking every second....I left them to end up peeing and shitting in the house....when I say no, she threatens to call an ambulance. When I say go ahead, the ambulance come and she guilts me into driving her when the paramedics ask if I'll take her because I told her I wouldn't ride with her....she puts me in these positions because she knows I will take her....I want to walk away. Just go. Let her figure it out on her own. But I just can't.  Her c diff has come back but I know she'll just use it to get what she wants...she was supposed to go back to work tomorrow but i dont see that happening. I don't know what to do with funds being tight and time being tight with working and having to take care of her...she can't be alone either. She comes with me to work....she either sits in the car or an empty room nearby. In her world this is all normal and reasonable, to me it is....unhealthy. Last week was my first week back in the office after working from home for over a month to help her with her c diff....and she went to the er on monday and on wednesday. I made her take Ubers to other places she wanted to go, like the dentist because she fears she has an infection. Just another worry to the list that she endlessly obsesses about. The whole time at home, she does nothing but sit and worry about things. I have to tell her to do things. In the beginning they were suggestions, now they're demands....i guess this is just a vent now. Any words of encouragement or advice is welcome. Thanks for reading, if you got this far.",21May2018,2
31,"I have my last 2 exams coming up, one tomorrow and one in like 12 days. I have ADHD which I am off meds for which makes it really hard to revise or retain information, I have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis which causes me to wake up way earlier than I need too feeling sick and I end up gagging retching and bringing up saliva, muck and bile for a couple of hours. Then I want to try eat or brush my teeth but that makes me vomit again.

33,"Hi Reddit,

I'm writing this post to ask for thoughts/opinions/advice with regards to my current situation as I currently am feeling completely lost. In an attempt to summarise before going into details, I essentially find myself stuck in a state of debilitating uncertainty with regards to whether my degree (and therefore) career choice is going to provide me with the sense of meaning and purpose that I undoubtedly need to merely function as a human being in day-to-day life. Other disciplines exist that have interested me greatly since early high school, however I have decided not to pursue them due to pressures my parents (particularly father) have exerted with regards to financial security, and the unquestionable importance of a well-paying job in being happy/fulfilled.

I am a 20 year old male, currently studying Computer Science (in my 2nd year at the moment), and as of the past few months I have begun feeling myself fall into this awful, passive, apathetic, ""going through the motions"" state of being. I feel paralysed and unable to focus on my studies as I seem to obsessively fixate on thoughts in my head regarding whether I'm truly living the life I want to live. I find myself constantly daydreaming about being awesome and living an awesome life (similar to Walter Mitty), and constantly 'procrastinate' by binging on self-help videos and resources related to self-actualisation.

The reasons for studying Computer Science that I told myself after finishing high school were:

I enjoy mathematics (corrected; I actually enjoy problem-solving, which mathematics happens to provide an abundance of).
Computer Science pays well.
I was interested in robots as a child and thought AI may fascinate me.
I displayed impressive mathematical ability in elementary school. On top of these reasons, there was also an absolutely colossal pressure from my father to pursue ""computers"", as he personally believes it to be where the future is headed and what the most ""in-demand"" discipline will be. On top of this, he (like many members in my family) suffers from mental illnesses that have put him in a state of depression and desperate reliance of me being able to succeed. He has told me that my going to university is literally the one thing that keeps him from committing suicide.
On top of my interest in computer science that I have expressed above, I have also always had a keen interest in Psychology and Music. These are in fact the alternative career paths that have been assertively parading in my thoughts and causing my distress.

Music: My father, being a musician, taught me to play piano and develop deep appreciation for music (and art in general) from a very early age. Music teachers in Elementary and High School all praised me for being a gifted musician in their eyes and would give me extra time and resources in acts of encouragement. At around the age of 16, without going into too many details, I suffered an acute bout of mental illness (primarily depression/anxiety) stemming from the psychological toll of traumatic childhood experiences beginning to resurface in my mind. I was placed into a mental institution for 2 years and then released, thinking that I was now a changed person. Without going into details, I have always felt a profound need inside of me to channel these experiences of my life into a beautiful work of art, in this case music. I feel so certain that having just one piece of art to my name that beautifully summarises and creatively expresses these times is a mandatory step in getting my head right again. The issue is that I have adopted a perfectionist mindset with regards to pursuing this goal, to the point where I feel that only by acquiring a complete formal musical education will I have the confidence to not constantly throw ideas in the bin and actually grow as an artist. The idea of pursuing music as a career is also wonderful however my father has pointed out the many logistical problems associated with that which has made me decide not to pursue it. Hence I feel stuck in a rut, having to be so occupied with these Computer Science studies that I've now lost vision of, that I no longer have the time to develop these artistic skills (I also work a full time job).

Psychology: I have always had a keen fascination for the human mind and how it works; how and why people think the way they do. Maybe it stems from the long history of mental illness in my family and the fact that I also suffer from mental illness. That possibility is in fact one of the things that deterred me from pursuing it in tertiary education, as my motivation for learning the discipline would be stemming from selfish roots (wanting to know what's wrong with ME). However, all my life people have commented on my keen listening ability, compassion, gentleness, and most importantly, ability to understand people and where they're coming from. I have a keen fascination in analysing and understanding people; I do it all the time accidentally with the people I interact with in day-to-day life, for better or for worse. One of my friends has even jokingly said that I am his 'personal psychologist'. Another reason that Psychology appeals to me is the idea that I am directly helping people. When I think about it I start feeling butterflies in my chest, as though the act of helping others could be my source of purpose and meaning in life; a step towards true self-actualisation. Personality tests that I have done (which may be rash of me to use as a piece of evidence) in the past have also pointed me in a professional direction of this type; I'm an INFP according to 16 personalities, and its description does resonate with me greatly.

I suffer from ADHD, and wonder if, in a vacuum (without ever having begun study in computer science), if I would've in fact been equally interested in all 3 disciplines. I wonder if, because I've been studying computer science for a year and have done 0 study in these other disciplines, that there is a bias; of course computer science would seem stale in comparison to things I haven't begun yet, which are new/fresh and exciting. Maybe if I did switch degrees to Psychology, I'd get bored of that in a year. I don't know for sure, and this doubt stops me from taking any action. This is stacked on top of the general anxiety related to switching degrees; looking like an idiot, humiliating yourself, ignited further complications with my parents.

Should I continue with my degree in your opinion? Should I change? If either, what advice/thoughts can you share that may help realign my mind to the right head-space that would allow me to be productive with my time again instead of wallowing in existential depression?

Thank you so much for reading.",21May2018,4
34,"I posted this to another subreddit. I really want this to be seenbecause I am desperate.

Having one of those biannual mental breakdowns I always have. Though this time I'm not homeless or trying to kill myself at the moment.
I'm 21 year old guy and I moved to Arizona in February. And before that I was 18 and moved from Virginia to Washington. I was looking for something better. Well now I'm not homeless, and I make more money than I ever have, better living situation, but feel the worst. I've been depressed ever since I was a kid. I've always had something wrong with me. When I was a kid I always heard different things, he's autistic, or he's got adhd, or he's got abandonment issues. I was on stimulants for adhd(Adderall and Vyvanse) from ages 7-17, until I decided to quit, because it was making me feel emotionless, despite helping with my ""motivation"". I think that has a part to play in why I'm fucked up.

Despite whatever is wrong with me, I need help, and I don't know how to get help at this point, being trapped and all. My health is shit, I have quite high blood pressure and pulse, constantly, and I can totally feel it. I get chest pains. I'm pretty sure I have sleep apnea from working with weird powders, and from smoking and being overweight. I am a shell of who I was just 3 years ago when I was 18. I feel like I've lost a lot of intelligence too. I am so emotionally fucked up, I don't even know what to say, and I lack the ability to even communicate it. I don't ever have time to take care of myself because I always end up having to work to survive.
I can't join the army, I can't go to college. I just need help, and I don't have time for help. I'm literally at a job where I can't be late or miss a day or I get fired. I've quit a d got fired from so many jobs. I just can't do it. I am still so fucked up from everything that's happened in the past I can't move forward. 

If anyone has any advice, If I should move somewhere else where I can get help, or where I can go. I need help I am so lost. I'm going to kill myself if shit keeps going this way, I'm EXHAUSTED.

Also adding this tidbit, why I cant move back in with my family

My family kicked me out when I turned 18. I was having a lot of issues after quitting the Adderall, and I wanted to drop out of highschool. This was a tipping point for them, because they had already helped me so much my whole life. Man they've paid for me to be on so many medications and stuff, and I turned out more fucked up than I started. About 6 months after being kicked out, I took 3 whole bottles of antidepressants, and then drove from Virginia to PA. I have memory loss from that but after all that was done with I was living in a homeless shelter. I had pleaded to move back in with my parents. They said we can never live together, and they don't want to talk to me. They then sent me money, and I used that to move to Washington. I haven't spoken to them at all until earlier this year, as they didn't want to. I'm trying to repair what little of a relationship I can salvage with them. I can never ask for that help again. They've helped me more than enough. I am on my own.",21May2018,3
35,"I'm about to turn 40, and I've suffered from anxiety and depression for a long time. I've been on SSRIs for the last few years, which take the edge off but leave me feeling a bit blank.

Back when I was at secondary school \(aged 15\-16\), there was a girl in the year below me who was smart, funny and pretty. We chatted at a parties a couple of times, and got on well. It was unusual for me \(at the time, and still\) to feel relaxed in someone else's company, and able to talk freely without the anxiety kicking in. She wasn't a close friend, but I felt like she 'got' me.

I went back to school after a summer holiday, and found out that she'd died. I can't remember what happened \- whether it was an illness or an accident \- and I'm not sure I ever knew. A few days later, I was talking to one of her friends about her, and she mentioned that she had a crush on me. Again, this was unusual \- I hadn't had a girlfriend by that point. This hit me pretty hard at the time, but after a while I guess time healed and I didn't think about her so much, eventually at all.

Fast forward about 25 years... after I'd had a couple of girlfriends, got married, had two kids, and life had gone on as life tends to do. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she pops into my head. I see her face. Her smile. I think about the chilled conversations we'd had. I remember what her friend had told me.

Life goes on, but I find I'm thinking more about her. Soon a day doesn't pass without my mind falling back to those few decades old memories. I start watching a show about high school on Netflix, and the main character reminds me of her.

I scour my old photo albums for a picture of her \- but there aren't any. I search the web for any record of her. I look on the Births Marriages and Deaths register, but I don't know all the details and can't find her. I almost wonder if she actually existed at all or if it was all some kind of false memory. I consider asking an old school friend about what happened, but I feel like they'd think I was weird for even thinking about her after all these years.

It doesn't help that all my memories of her are so positive and happy. Realistically I know she would've had bad days, got sad sometimes, like any human being on the planet. But in my head she's like a beacon of pure, innocent, unending happiness. It makes no sense. Is she my Manic Pixie Dream Ghost?

I talk to my wife about the situation and she tries to reassure me, but I can't help feeling like she's not the right person to talk to about it. I'm not sure why I'm posting this here, really. I guess I just need somewhere else to let it out.

I miss her so deeply.",21May2018,3
36,"one of my cats got hit by a car tonight and died, when I heard that this had happened the main thing I felt was disbelief like it wasn’t true? feels like nothing has changed and that he is still alive. The same thing happened when I lost my lost my dog ( she was old and had cancer, her body was shutting down so we put her to sleep) I was fine until a week had passed and then I finally cried and again a similar thing happened with a different cat for months I kept expecting her to be at our side gate where she used to wait for me and I also didn’t cry until about a week had passed. 

The biggest example of this is that my parents divorced when I was 8 and i went 10 years thinking that it didn’t really have an impact on me until last year I spent a few months where I would bawl my eyes out for an hour or so thinking about my broken family wishing I could just have one day back in time when everyone was together.

38,"A wee thing I wrote based on the constant pursuit of perfection we all feel under and learning how to value imperfection more.

----------

The Perfect Circle.

Life is circular and unlike many would have you believe, 
it is far from being a perfect circle.

From birth till death, it waves, curves, bends and splits at all angles. 
In the end leaving the story and artwork of your life. 
Beautiful, unique and interestingly you. 

Those who aim for perfection do so with almost certain failure. 
For at the centre of every perfect circle is a hole left from the compass. 
A small dot in life, that we can pretend is not there but it always will be. 

If pushed too far and with too much force a larger hole is created. 
One that is much harder to fill. 
This continued pressure for perfection leads to rips and tears, 
making us feel like giving up, giving in. 

We need to stop seeking perfection, and enjoy the imperfection of life. 
It’s the waves, curves, splits and bends that make us unique and interesting.

So put down the compass and start drawing life freehand. It may not look perfect, but then it shouldn't. It should be you and interesting.",21May2018,2

43,"I was depressed for about eight months, then it ended: I gradually started to be able to be happy again. It’s weird because now it seems impossible to think I had reached such lows, just like previously it was impossible to think to get to feel good again.
Then, I was out of that depressive period, but I started to feel bad again, but in a very different way: now I am not with zero energy like before and I am not self-loathing myself heavily (almost not at all), I can also think more clearly. It’s probably this that made the difference.
I wouldn’t call it another depressive episode; it wasn’t.  –It’s weird, I can’t really understand what it was–, but that “feeling bad” was way more practical, way more concrete. I think about it like a moment of clarity I had; I was without any hope, any positivity again and all I could see was the raw reality. “I am not myself, I can’t be myself. It’s been years now. I feel like I’m trapped in my body, I can’t express myself, I can’t speak up. I’m alone, so alone. This could just end”.. Then the suicidal thoughts started again, they were more concrete too. I realized that it wasn’t a fantasy anymore. I was closer to it, and it wouldn’t have taken much to take that step and cut my wrists.
I was scared of myself. I’ve also always been frightened of opening up, then to see a psychologist too. But the fear of what I could have done, of my own hands, was stronger, ‘cause we were talking about death.
Then I asked my mother, and I’m seeing a psychologist this afternoon.
But now I got the hopes back. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel because I thought that going to see a psychologist would have fixed everything. That’s why now I’m pretty good; I could be validated for the first time in my life.
This makes me think: do I really have the “right” to go there? I feel like I’m making the psychologist waste time, because now I’m good and I feel like, since now I am energetic and vital and positive again, I won’t go back to depression again.
What do you think?
Also, do you have any suggestion on what should I not avoid to say to the psychologist?
I also wanted to tell them that I wanted to stop selfharming, but it’s been almost a week I haven’t done it, then I probably won’t.",21May2018,1
44,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a struggle for me to write so please bear with me. This might be a bit graphic in detail as well.

On December 4th my grandmother passed away unexpectedly. No prior illness or signs that anything was drastically wrong. We were very close, because my mum was a single working parent we spent a lot of time together and I would pop to see her every day for a chat and a laugh, she lived directly across the street from me. 

Basically I'd gone over early afternoon as usual and found her passed away in the bath, she'd been there since the previous evening. I scrambled to call 999 and I don't know if I wasn't clear enough but the operator kept telling me to try mouth to mouth resuscitation which in my state of shock I did - even though I knew it was futile because she was stone cold. After I said that it's not working because she was already dead the operator told me to try and move her body into a different position which I tried to do but physically couldn't move her because of how her body was wedged into the bath. Because of how long she had been there at this point there a lot of skin and gunk was coming off her and onto my hands. Thankfully for me at this point the paramedic arrived and was absolutely amazing. 

For the first 2 months after the funeral there was so many arrangements for the family to make, house to clear out etc I didn't get much time for what happened to really sink in. But it's hitting me a lot more now. I have to constantly be doing something to keep me busy otherwise I get very unsettled. I'm also becoming prone to angry outbursts at people and I'm also getting random panic and anxiety attacks around people. I'm constantly worrying that something bad is going to happen which was made worse when my dog (my best boy) passed away when I went away for a weekend to try and relax. 

People are telling me that I should speak to someone because what happened and what I did was not a normal thing to happen but I think it happens all the time and I'm just being over emotional (and I think that I'm just making excuses). I feel ashamed about it because it would have absolutely broken my grans heart if she knew I was the one who found her. 

I'm posting this now because I had another anger outburst and panic attack over the weekend and I've been having dreams about it again. 

I'm scared about going to anyone for help, I don't want my family knowing about it because I'm afraid it'll make them worry about me.

Listening to anything new feels like a chore and some of the old songs I usually love just make me feel worse.

61,"Hi all!  
  
So here’s the situation. I’m 35 and have been living with untreated Depression, Anxiety, and ADD. I was a terrible high school student, and have worked a series of factory jobs I hated and office jobs I was terrible at since. I’ve been fired from my last two office jobs, couldn’t keep up, couldn’t focus, couldn’t begin to get/stay organized, and just couldn’t understand my job no matter how much help I got.  
  
When I got fired earlier this year I decided something HAD to change. I went to get help, and I’m working with a psychiatrist to manage my mental health. Currently on 25mg generic Adderall XR x2 day and 20mg generic Prozac. I think it’s helping! At least the ADD medication (only a week or so in on the Prozac). I also joined a Vocational Rehab program to help people for whom mental health has been a detriment to their careers (or lack thereof). I took a test to measure my interests and aptitudes and did pretty well! Based on my scores they really want me to go to college. Yikes.  
  
I tried this about 10 years ago. I tried like 3 different times to go to community college and it was the same as my office jobs. I couldn’t keep up, couldn’t get organized, felt like everyone else was SO much smarter than me. ADD was in full effect, along with crippling social anxiety. Sometimes I would almost have a panic attack trying to go into the classroom and would just go sit in my car. It was rough, but as the psych and Voc Rehab pointed out, I was untreated. They think I can do it now, even if I’m not sure. I’ve spent the last decade convinced I’m just too dumb for college so the idea completely terrifies me.  
  
Has anyone been in a similar situation? Anyone spend years thinking they couldn’t never go to college, but then go? If anyone could share their experience or advice I would be so grateful.  
  
tl;dr - Finally getting my ADD and Depression treated at 35 and considering trying to go to college. Has anyone done this? Any advice for going to college with ADD/Depression? Especially going as an ADULT. Thanks!",21May2018,2
62,"I have no idea what the background to it all was, nor care really. 

Boss began just laying into her like she was a fucking punching bag. I intervened by yelling at him, he stopped and acted as if nothing really had happened while she sunk to the ground and began wailing, he ignored it and just continued working. After that i was in shock and i just kinda started working again before stopping, leaving the store and calling the cops before returning and making sure he didn't go near the office. I wanted to console her badly, she was so distraught, but i was the only staff member there at the time and i didn't know if it would escalate things or not. 

Cops arrive and so does an ambulance \(she called one it seems\), i tell them everything that happened and don't hold back. At this point ive already decided i'm quitting, which sucks as i'm getting married next year and awhile we have enough money for the wedding unless i can find work we likely wont be having a honeymoon on the same scale we wanted, but i don't regret it remotely as im not going to make him think that his actions are remotely justified by continuing to work there. 

The whole time i just wanted to cave his fucking skull in. I'm so angry, i'm still angry and i haven't been this angry before in my life and yet i feel calm, scarily calm. Logically it feels like i shouldn't have this much anger while also feeling calm at the same time? And i just can't lose it, the anger wont go away and it worries me. 

I don't know what i really want from here, advice maybe on how to deal with how this has effected me? To vent hoping it'll lessen things? This all feels so surreal. ",21May2018,18
63,"I’m a 22y old female , and I’ve always somewhat struggled to communicate to people , however with age and experience I’ve gotten better. I now rarely have times where I’m afraid to talk to people or won’t go up to someone and strike a conversation. 

What I do struggle with is doing anything alone. Not staying home alone or driving ect... but being alone in public I suppose. I get very nervous doing the most basic tasks like going grocery shopping, going to gym, ordering food , waiting in line for anything by myself, going shopping ... literally anything in public. 

It’s very confusing to me, because to some effect I figured I might have some sort of mild social anxiety, but I don’t struggle speaking to people, it’s not the fact that I have to speak to someone which gets me nervous.. it’s that in some sort of weird way I’m worried everyone will laugh at me or stare at me or I’ll fuck something up..  and it’s gotten to a point where I utterly avoid doing anything by myself - like I genuinely almost never go anywhere alone even if that means I don’t get to buy essential things... or go to gym and I feel like it runs my life

The first time I tried to kill myself I was in the 7th grade and I tried to hang myself, luckily my mom called and I for some reason answered the phone. From that moment on I didn't know how to deal with my issues and couldn't talk about them at all. I am 31 now and have been dealing with my demons alone, just put on a smile and wear our masks. There were many more times I have tried since that first time but I won't bore you with those. Last year I was at a all time low and didn't know what to do.. The idea of running my car off the road or the thought of getting a handful of pills and taking them all was just overwhelming and I couldn't move past it. So I did what is hard to do... I called my dad and told him for the first time in my life what was going on. I didn't know what to do but I knew if I didn't try I would of killed myself that night. He told me to go to the hospital now, and for some reason I did. Now a year later I am still here.. It's still a struggle most days.. But with the help of my family and friends and the wonderful people who work in the mental heath field I am still here fighting. If anyone reads this and feel the same or perhaps worst..

68,"I've dealt with depression since I was about 11, I'm now 20. Several things contributed to it, including feeling like my parents disregarded/invalidated me and a secret internet relationship around age 13 that may have been emotionally and/or sexually abusive. They found out about that and ended it, I got in trouble, and we never talked about it again. I still don't know how much they know. If my parents knew at any point that I was depressed, they never talked to me about it. My sister had a similar experience (eating disorders they didn't see) and when they thought my brother was depressed in high school, they really freaked out and went into super-helicopter-protective-emotional mode. My mom especially.

I think my parents mean well and they're good people, but I have always considered my friends closer family than blood relations. Two of them I trust are strongly suggesting therapy, but if I go, especially while I'm home for the summer, I'll end up having to tell my parents why. I feel like if I say ""I'd rather not talk about that yet"" it'll just freak them out, but I also don't know how to tell them I've been depressed for nearly ten years and they've done nothing.

69,"I’m in USA. I’ll try to be brief, but this may go on longer than I’d like. My 19 year old son has a history (since about 14) of major depression/anxiety/ADHD/bipolar/borderline personality disorder. I put all of them up there because his diagnosis largely depended on the mental health professional or the year or the facility of diagnosis. I even had one psych put him on the Autism spectrum. When he took the test to confirm, he did not score severely enough to get any government intervention. It’s in the back of my mind, but I can’t really prove he is on the spectrum, but there are clues to that. He has severely black and white thinking. He can only see family members as on a pedestal and flawless or evil and out to get him. The number of people who get to be on the pedestal is usually no more than 1, and he consistently tries to manipulate the pedestal dweller into seeing everyone else as an enemy. Inevitably that fails and he starts cultivating another person to be his new favorite before either verbally or physically attacking the current pedestal dweller. Needless to say he can’t retain employment. 

Lately (few months) he’s developed a problem with methamphetamine and has bee arrested, is currently in jail. 

The question is, given all these symptoms, is it normal for him to completely fail to see a connection between his actions and future consequences? Right now he can’t get out of jail unless he gets a favor from a family member. Every time he talks to those family members, he blows up and further destroys the relationships. It seems crazy to me.

When I was about 7\-10, whenever my male cousin came to visit we would kind of do the exact same thing, I never really thought anything about it.

80,"Hey guys.

I have a very obvious problem that has basically just slapped me in the face in the past few years. 

When I was a kid, I use to hate staying over at people's houses. The bed could be extremely comfortable and I would still want to run home. I hated being in a strange environment. It probably stemmed from being at a friends place and hearing their parents fighting. Or, from being molested as a kid by a teenager that my sister was babysitting. I am not sure where It came from, but either way, it is something that had now transported into my adult life.

My earliest memory of the anxiety attacks; I worked three days at a farm where the owners were rather brash. They yelled at me for being slow. I drove the tractor with tears. I quit after two days when on the third, I had a massive anxiety attack over going back. TBH, it was a shitty job.

The most recent instances: I have been trying to go backpacking solo at Grayson Highlands for the past three years. Every time I drive the 5hrs to the town, I panic and drive back home. Mind you, I love hiking. I backpack with freinds, day hike, and know that I can hike the trail I intend to do with little effort. 

I don't know why I panic. It's a very silent ordeal, and also is not 100% tied to that trail. I have literally hiked another trail, the eight miles to my campsite, ate dinner, sat down, felt this doom sensation that has my body basically like ""RUN HOME! GO! GO! GO!"", packed up, and hiked the entire trail back to the car.

I have been backpacking with other people, and after a long day hiking...packed up...and drove home. Mind you, each time is a 4-6 hr drive too and from the trail-heads. It doesn't matter. I am just overcome with the need to be home, in bed, or away from what I am doing that day.

What is going on? And, how do I go about getting over it? 

I love to hike and backpack. I can backpack with groups, and get no ill-feelings. Other times, I just crash down on myself and high-tail it out of there. 

It has happened on lazy camping trips where I am comfortable, and with extremely large groups of people. (Group Car Camping Adventures)

It is so frustrating. With Grayson, I have to battle my panic for the days leading to the car ride, while in the car, and then while hiking. I have only ever gone 4 miles in before hitch-hiking back to my car to drive back home. I lie about what happens and always say its, ""flooded bridge, Rain, etc"" that causes me to step off the trail.

Does anyone have any advice? Right now, I am going to stick with groups to help me maybe work on the problem. Maybe when I have done the trail with a group, I will do it solo.",21May2018,1
81,"When I get anxiety, and this can also be triggered by other things, I experience what I call an ""existential dysphoria"".

Generally, if I feel anxious, if I see any blood or that type of thing, have a bruise or cut, or sometimes when I just have to deal with my body (like showering), it triggers such a disturbing and negative reaction in my mind. It shares similarities to both body dysphoria and existential anxiety, but my symptoms are not adequately described by the symptoms of those exact conditions.

I would say what I feel is more so a disgust of bodies in a deep existential way. I tend to disconnect my mind from my body, beause the only thing that helps me is how spiritually grounded I am. When I feel badly, I can only describe it as a sudden and disturbing realization that my body is ""meat"". Seeing blood or any type of injury makes me conscious of how fragile human beings are, and it makes me deeply uncomfortable, and I feel a desire to sort of crawl out of my skin.

The strange thing is other people don't bother me. If I touch my husband, he feels warm and tender, and I genuinely enjoy touching other people and being touched. That in no way makes me uncomfortable. It seems to be limited to my own body, the awareness of my body, and all the anxiety attached to that. I feel like I don't belong in a body at all. I find myself fairly good looking, there's no issues with the appearance. Just the fact that I am IN one drives me up the wall.

This isn't debilitating or anything, and I don't ever discuss it or let on when I'm feeling badly. I think I'm just more curious about it, why this happens, and if there are others experiencing this. I would love to know if this has a label or a name as well.

Discuss? ",21May2018,1
82,"Hi, everyone. I've gone back and forth on if I should share this. I don't know, I considered making a throwaway account, but whatever. Let's go

To start off, I've been professionally diagnosed as someone who has high anxiety. I'm not on any medication for it, but my epilepsy drugs are often used to help with that, so I guess that's a nice bonus? I also have Asperger's, and I dunno if my age is relevant, but I'm 20

I am online constantly. Like, almost every waking minute. Mostly on forums, Youtube, reading wiki articles, etc. And I've never found anything odd about it until recently when I've realized I sort of have little mini panic attacks when I'm not online. Like if my internet's down or even if I'm just away from it for more than a minute

I feel small and isolated, alone, though it isn't as bad if I'm visiting my dad's place or if I'm with my mom or something. One of the best things about the internet is that I can socialize. I'm a manager on a forum and very active there. I also frequently post here on Reddit, comment on Youtube a lot, talk to acquaintances on Discord, etc

But if I'm away from/unable to get on the internet, then all that's gone. I hate that crushing feeling, being alone and not able to communicate with anybody, even if it's for a second. It's gotten to the point where I take my laptop with me to the bathroom. When I go somewhere like to the store or something, I try to get done as soon as possible so I can get back online so I won't be alone

Problem is that, aside from my family, almost 100% of my social interaction is online, and I don't really go anywhere, nor do I have much reason/ability to. I just hate being and feeling alone, but being online helps to assuage that

85,"What we do know is that psychiatric drugs work, at least for a short time. But how do they work? 

We've all been told by our doctors that psychiatric drugs are medications. We know that those drugs produce altered state of consciousness which is usually dismissed as side effects. But here is an argument that this state of consciousness is actually a primary effect, drugs are simply non-disease specific centrally acting psychoactive substances, and paradigm needs to be shifted from ""like insulin for diabetes"" to ""like alcohol for social anxiety"". To add to that, historically this was the paradigm of drug usage actually, and saying that those drugs are disease specific is a relatively recent change which is not compelling scientifically. 

What's said above can change how we guide our usage of drugs to minimize harm and maximize effectiveness of drug treatment. Here is the video which I highly recommend to watch to everyone taking psychiatric drugs to understand another approach towards drug usage, and making an argument that they are psychoactive substances which produce altered state of consciousness, and that using them as medication, with some imaginary ""target dosages"", and thinking that they treat the root cause is extremely misguided and leads to grievous harm:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV1S5zw096U&amp;app=desktop

---

Here is how a psychiatrist understanding the above would guide prescription of psychiatric drugs.

First thing, she would tell people who need help with their mental conditions that because of the nature of the problem, namely it being highly subjective, top/down doctor/patient approach like in the rest of medicine will not work. She can only be a guide and provide a helping hand, but she can't command what to do. Communication is obviously paramount and should be among equals, and that she understand that all drugs can cause all sorts of even rare and strange side effects, and so she won't dismiss any complaints.  

Next, she'd tell that psychiatric medications are psychoactive drugs, no different from other legal or illegal substances with psychoactive effects. They don't cure anything and their primary effect is producing altered state of consciousness, which might be helpful. For example, SSRI numb emotions and may produce a small high, which would be extremely useful for some people who have issues with feeling extreme negative emotions. Also SSRI can help with bodily symptoms like digestion issues, because being stressed for prolonged periods of time can cause digestive system among other things to shut down.

(In the video above it's explained that for many years drug advertising was doing exactly that: telling which subjective effects a particular drug produces, instead of bullshitting about fixing chemical imbalances of all sorts).

She'd tell that those psychoactive drugs can be very effective for limited period of time. To illustrate the point, she'd explain that in independently funded STAR*D trial 70% of those enrolled achieved remission on drugs. But in the long drug drugs will almost inevitably stop working, and this was shown in that same trial, after one year's time only 108 out of 4000 people remained in remission of depression, others either relapsed or dropped out of the study. 

She'd add that in that trial figure of 108 patients was buried and only surfaced after several years, which illustrates how bias can affect even independently funded psychiatric research, and thus users of those drugs should be wary of any claims that those drugs are safe and efficient in long-term, even if there were are no immediate side effects. He'd tell that right now many people are realizing that they can't stop taking those drugs, so drug exposure should be limited at all possible.

She'd say that using those psychoactive drugs can lead to worsening of depression in all people, suicidal thoughts or violent behavior in all people regardless of age, paradoxical reactions like aggression or anxiety or violence, and if people experience any such discomfort those drugs should be discontinued immediately.

Finally, she'd stress importance of limiting drug exposure and concluding that those drugs do (not can, like it's often stated) cause tolerance and withdrawal, probability of which is going up with time, and that some people report that emotional numbness or other effects persist for years after withdrawal. Said that, those drugs can be very effective in what they do in short term. To use them it's important to remember that there is no target dose and because of that only subjective effects felt by the user should guide the usage. She'd suggest trying using those drugs on need-to basis if that's appropriate (no serious ""clinical depression""), because even SSRIs are effective immediately for some mental conditions, and that usual 2 weeks waiting period only makes sense because if someone is extremely distressed/depressed their body will need time to recover when they'll stop feeling really bad, and not because those drugs do something special.

One of them went to try and stab me but was distracted by a passing car which allowed me to run away and dind a stranger in a local fuel statiin who called the police. They never found the people but my skateboard was handed in 2 days later as it waa apparently found on the side of the road (maybe they took it, or i dropped ot at the time, i cant remember)

Due to this and a few other events, i dropped out of university. I was mugged about 1 minute away from my accomodation and was too scared to go outside for months.

Since then ive gotten a lot better. In terms of being afraid of other people in public and being able to go outside i thought i was fine. But i just watched a tv program where a very similar thing happened to a character on the show. I freaked out hard. Had a big panic attack and threw up. I really thought i was over this. I haven't even thought about it in several months until now.",21May2018,6
94,"Hey everyone.

I have been suffering all my life from mental illness
I am now 19 and still not at my greatest.

I have created a Tumblr page for those who need support. Where I will check the messages and daily to support those in need.

I know there are many resources out there to reach out for help.

I just don't want people to suffer the way I did throughout my life.

All the best,

Anonymous.

95,"     I don't really understand myself completely and I can't really pick up my full personality yet without watering it down to completely nothing  but I will say that my anxiety is starting to fade and my depression isn't destroying everything about me as much as it was. 

     Today ignites the day of change and it falls perfectly under mental health awareness month. Next year, I'll be speaking about my experience with the my local school on stage and I'm not sure I'm ready but I hope I will be by next year!

     I'm sorry to anyone who is going through anything right now, I fully understand the struggles as for I have been struggling for thr past 2 and a half years and I have nothing but respect for anyone that is open about their mental health. Keep striding for the best!

98,"I am near 2 years sober from a heroin addiction. Before that addiction I was into all kinds of drugs. My whole life basically minus these last almost 2 years was just drugs and self destructive behaviour as well as a few horrific abusive relationships. 
Im on methadone and a heavy dose of Sertraline. I have also been prescribed Prazosin for my nightmares and have been taking it about a year now. 
The reason I needed it was because my sleep was so affected by trauma that I couldnt get any rest. My dreams were incessant floods of pieces of the past and the present.. always being chased or chasing, not fast enough, cant catch what Im after.. or just clusterfucks of triggering bits and people who harmed me. I often would wake myself up with my own screaming, and hurt myself in my sleep by hitting and kicking. 
Does anybody have these problems? 
The prazosin is supposed to disable my adrenal system or something so that I can have rest. 
The terrifying issue is that any time i forget to take them, the dreams are active that same night. Its like it never stopped. I wake in panic attack and cry. 
I fear that this medication is hampering my subconscious' ability to work through the trauma thats so active in the dreams. I wonder if they could ever end..
Can somebody help me? 
Have you experienced similar? Have you recovered from the traumas or been able to stop the dreams? Have you found a medication that helps? Any doctors, therapists or psychiatrists helped you with this?
Im at my wits end.",21May2018,1
