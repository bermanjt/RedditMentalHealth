1,"Adult M.I don’t live with them anymore but I feel like the dirtiness, lack of accountability, and unhealthy living conditions are terrible, not to mention the rank smell.
 I’m actually meeting my therapist the first time,  so what would they say? What would happen?

All my life I’ve had an anxiety disorder, undiagnosed and untreated. When I returned to that home, I was instantly reminded of the bad memories. I got this *weird* feeling... I really can’t describe.

I noticed my room looked smaller or something? I had asked existential questions like:

&gt; Am I going crazy?

Maybe I was dissociating?",06Oct2018,1
2,"A few month ago I had a tinder date, we drank a few beers, then went back to my place and we had sex.

It was my first time having penetrative sex. It was the first time I kissed someone.

And I did it all for wrong reasons. I wasn't attracted to him. I didn't like the smell of his breath.

At first I was doing it because I wanted to have done it. I was tired of not being able to relate to everyone around me. Of being ashamed. (I know there is nothing to be ashamed of for never having had sex). And I wanted to be the kind of person who does it with a stranger. The kind of person who is liberated. So yeah, at first I got into this because I wanted to, no matter how bad the reasons were. And the alcohol may have helped with the terrible decision making.

But then. I did it, or more accurately let him do it because I didn't think I was worth being respected. We didn't have any condom. And I told him there was no way I would do PinV sex without it. And he seemed to respect that, we started doing other stuff. And he tried to penetrate me. And I told him no. And he tried again. And I didn't say anything. Maybe because it happened so fast and when he was in me I felt like it was too late to say anything. Maybe because at that moment I thought that I wasn't worth being respected, that his desires where more important than my consent, so yeah, really low self worth. I don't know what this means. To me it sounds like self harm, or like I punished myself in some way. I don't know what to do with that information. I'm not traumatized by the event. I'm just annoyed. And a little bit angry.

What does this say about me ? How do I forgive myself for allowing him to do that when I didn't want to ? How do I forgive myself for not respecting myself ? How do I process this event ? What do I do with it ?

- I have been depressed my entire life. I dont think negatively about anything, I dont have low self esteem, but I have always kind of felt very depressed in a way that is hard to explain. Even if I am feeling happy, which I am a lot, there is always this feeling underneath that never goes away.

- I think I have depersonalization and derealization. I can remember feeling mildly like this around when I was six. But last year, there was a daily problem where this would happen on a very extreme level for about an hour. I would also be completely unable to talk during these times. Thankfully, this rarely happens anymore to that degree.

- I have had Maladaptive Daydeaming my entire life. Now I have a constant urge to daydream, and daydreaming just make me feel very depressed for some reason.

- Recently, there were many times when I was alone and would suddenly get angry at nothing. Sometimes I would just start hitting myself for no apparent reason.

- I have had tinnitus since I was five.

- I have had constant vertigo my entire life. I dont really feel dizzy, or disoriented because of it, but it actually looks and feels like the room is always swinging back and forth.

- Feeling like everything is very small, but only during random moments, and it lasts for a few minutes.

- Visual snow.

- I constantly see random flashing lines that are spinning around in my vison. I can remember this since I was one.

- Very good memory (to the degree of Hyperthymesia.)

- Afterimages

- Synesthesia

- There were times in the past when I had tremors and tics.

- I have never hallucinated, or lost connection with reality.

- I have never had migranes or seizures. (Other than cluster headaches that I used to get often.)

- I have never had any problems socially, but quite often I would never end up talking to anyone, even though I wanted to.",06Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied for years in elementary school / high school and I think it still affects me. I missed out on so many things in life because of that. Never went to prom, never kissed a girl, never invited to anything. I don't have many friends. I drink way too much, which is really not good since I'm a type 1 diabetic. I have weird fetishes like diapers. I go to bed each night diapered and piss myself each morning as I eat breakfast. If I don't go to bed diapered, I have all of these self hating thoughts. The diaper takes the focus off of those things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really fucked up in the head. I went to therapy in the past and never fully opened up to them, so they put me on meds since they didn't know what else to do.. which didn't work. I mean why would it work? I don't have a chemical imbalance. I have real issues I needed to tell them about, and I sabotaged myself again by not telling them about it.

I'm drunk right now which is why I'm writing this. I need to find someone who can help me. I asked my primary Dr. for a referral to a therapist, but I knew him from my job.. so that wasn't an option... and that was who he referred everyone to. Figures. I went on my insurance's website to look for a therapist, and I have no idea if they are good or not. I tried looking for reviews on people that are close, and the information is lacking.

6,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I don't even know where to start. 29M married to 34F,  been with her since I was 19, married 4 years soon. 

I ran into an old flame at the store, not a girlfriend, just a girl I had a crush on, who crushed on me when we were younger. I talked to her for 20 minutes or so, and carried on. Well that really fucked me up. You see, she's my Great White Buffalo... the one that got away. 

I couldn't get her off my mind, so I stalk her on FB, message her and get her number so I can talk to her. Listen, I know, I'm a fool, but I already know that and I don't care about your judgment on the next part: she invited me over to her house to chill. 

Well I'm game, we talk about being on best behaviors and stuff, and all is well. I'm so excited to see her again because we've always gotten along well, and to be honest, I'd throw my life away for the chance, because again, I'm a fucking idiot like that. This all happened today. She tells me to hit her up at 4.

It's 630, and I never heard back from her. I remember why I stopped hitting her up back in the day, but is that making me feel any better? Absolutely not. 

Now, before you cry foul about me being married, it's been strained lately. I've been unhappy for a little while. It sounds primitive but I've been with my wife basically my entire adult life. I never had a chance to be single in my 20s and I'm starting to resent our relationship for it. So naturally when I run into this other girl, I got a bit excited. Now that I've been rejected, I just feel worthless, and I probably am anyway. Couple this with my unmentioned work problems I've been having lately and I honestly feel like just fucking ending it.

7,"I feel so isolated, so discarded by others. I know that my thoughts have substance, but when they diverge from that of the popular norm, it seems that they are ganged up on, and shunned. It seems somewhat akin to children excluding an other for some superficial reason which amounts to difference from what's comfortably accepted, without any flicker of conception about what effect it might have on the rejected individual.

8,"(This is sort of a shorter version of something I posted yesterday that was extremely long and didn’t really get much response. So I did my best to shorten it down, but it does leave out a lot of important details pertaining to my situation, which I don’t expect to be valued so much as to read all the shit I ramble on about.)

Obviously, this is a common symptom of depression. But I feel the same way even on the occasion that I swing back to feeling normal. It’s not that there’s nothing I enjoy or appreciate, I love my family and I do my best trying to stick to working out if my mind permits. I’m not a gamer but I do enjoy video games sometimes. My point is that it’s not like I can never experience positive emotions, but rather that nothing fulfills me and makes me feel like I’m content with who I am. I have less than zero interest in working for someone else for the rest of my life. 

Years before my mental health issues began manifesting (around 6 months ago), I always had a hatred for the idea of complacency and ending up living an average life. I’m from a middle class, mostly white suburb, and we’re all exposed to the idea that the dream is to take the train to your office and do whatever the fuck all day to get your boss a big pay day, come back and repeat every day. I’m sure there are plenty of people who would love to have that and I’m not at all saying it’s a bad thing, it’s just not who I am. I want to be extraordinary, but there’s 2 major issues I see with that: I feel like my depressive states prevent that from being a possibility, and I don’t really have interest in anything.

Also, no shit, everyone would like to be extraordinary. But I literally mean I don’t think I could handle living an regular life I’m a natural competitor and that’s not who I am. The only times I truly feel like I was put here on earth for a specific reason are when I’m convinced I was put here to be destroyed internally by my own brain and die, or when I know I I’m here to not play the same bullshit system and really make something of myself. (Again, I’m not trying to talk down on people whose idea of fulfillment is different from mine. Just my own personal feelings)

I guess the one solution really is right in front of my face to do everything to tackle my mental problems, it just seems impossible at times. Just helps to write it out for some reason. If anyone has any insight or feels/has felt similar I’d appreciate it.",06Oct2018,1

11,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21 and I was never a happy child. I'd say that I really became depressed when I was 14, but it wasn't until I was 16 that my depression became my identity and started actively holding me back from participating in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making this post because for the first time in my life I feel like it is possible to make a change, that there is the possibility in life to be happy. I had these realisations after a lot of self reflection, many visits to therapists. I realised the reason that I was miserable as I child, and I realised that I had repressed and lied to myself about my childhood and my past. I realised that my father (to whom I stopped speaking/seeing when I was around 15) was severely depressed and had serious emotional issues due to his abusive childhood. Because of this, he did not treat me as a father ought to. He   
 was always drunk. He criticised me constantly and thought that he could buy my love, and then acted bewildered when I would act terrified and miserable around him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I grew to resent him, but more significantly, I developed an ""avoidant attachment style"". I came to associate requests for closeness and affection with pain, fear, and self loathing. It was easier to never have to risk getting hurt by never even attempting to give life and relationships a serious go - I shut off from the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

A big turning point in my life was when I met the first and only girl whom I have loved when I was 16. I opened up to her, and I derived all of my self worth from her, feeling for the first time in my life that happiness was an option in life. That relationship ended later that year, and I was in so much pain. I cried every day and every night for almost two years straight. I distinctly remember making a conscious decision to never open up to anybody again, to never love anybody else, and that the only possible life that I could have would be a miserable one. I've stuck by those decisions for years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, however, I understand that I was wrong. I've been trying to mask the pain and fear of people that I have felt with apathy and anger. I have been wrong. I deserve to be happy. The way in which my father treated me was not my fault. I am not a fundamentally shit human. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know what to do. I've tried my best to open up to friends, but it scares me so so so much. I disassociate as soon as I try - as in, my mind goes completely blank, I hear a voice in my head telling me that I should just kill myself, I look away, and no words leave my mouth. I've written some letters to a friend of mine, and that was really good, but when he wanted to talk about what I wrote I couldn't say anything. I have intense social anxiety that has only gotten worse over the years, and it's making me feel so so alone and isolated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. As in, what can I actually do? I've been to therapy and all of that, and through that I found the answers to my sadness. But what now? How does one transfer knowing about one's past into actual solutions? What can I actually do about the pain I feel? Will opening up to people make it go away? I'm so lost, but I want to be happy. I want to be able to have relationships, I want to feel comfortable around people and not have to doubt their intentions, but I genuinely don't know how. Any advice that you might have will be appreciated. Thank you for reading my story",06Oct2018,1

I'm very conflicted on how I feel, and it's wearing me down. Lastly, this is going to be a long post. I have never told this story firsthand in detail before, and it is taking a lot for me to be able to put my experience into words. Here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

A year ago, my boyfriend and I lived in our first apartment together. We loved it -- it was definitely outdated and had its ups and downs, but it was our home. We stayed for two years before breaking our lease. Right next door, a lady lived with her aunt (who was disabled -- double amputee in a power chair, had a stoma, and was on oxygen tanks 24/7), and the lady's two daughters. The lady was awful to her kids and to her aunt. She was awful to us too, but that's irrelevant. 

My boyfriend and I worked second shift, so we got home around 10pm most nights. We sat in the kitchen eating dinner when we heard a thud in the next apartment, and I smelled something burning, like plastic. Not even a minute later, there's banging on the front door, screaming outside, and my pets start freaking out. Knowing something wasn't right, I leashed the dog and grabbed my phone and ran outside, my boyfriend following while holding the cat. We meet my neighbors outside the building, and all the tenants begin running out of the building. 

I looked back into my apartment, and there was smoke absolutely pouring out of the air vents. At this point, I can't form any words. I just keep saying, ""Oh my god."" My neighbor is on the ground, screaming and crying because her fiance is still in the building. The neighbor's dog is running loose and the aunt next door doesn't have her oxygen tank and is choking for air. I'm the first one to call 911. An upstairs tenant is still sleeping, and the firefighters later have to break down the door to get him out.

Boyfriend realizes we don't have the car keys to keep the cat safe, and runs into the apartment. It takes him a minute, but he makes it back out and we keep the cat and dog in the car safely. We wait for five hours until the firefighters deem it safe to go back in, we had nowhere else to go, and stayed the night in the apartment. We got back into our apartment at 5AM. But we were fine.

We got *extremely* lucky -- nothing of ours was damaged, except the air filter which was literally melted into what divides our apartment and theirs. Our neighbors (where the fire started) lost everything. 

Here's where I have issues: I am 22 now, and this happened almost exactly a year ago. I can still smell the smoke and soot. I can't look at birthday candles the same way. I double check everything like power cords and electronics that get warm before I even consider leaving the house. For six months after the incident, I had a panic attack every time I heard a fire truck. I still remember every single minute. I almost wish I was able to repress these memories.

So why do I feel like I can't have PTSD due to this? We were fine. We didn't lose anything. Our neighbors did, and they're functioning fine. I almost feel guilty or unworthy of feeling traumatized by this. Am I wrong to think this? How do you cope with these feelings? Will I ever feel normal or safe again? ",06Oct2018,1

I don't have any idea how to express the feelings I get when I start fires (I have no problem expressing it here) which is a build up of anxiety, pressure, excitement--then the fire-setting behavior--then absolute release much like a sexual orgasm thing, even though it is NOT a sexual thing for me. It is a mentally orgasmic thing. I feel so much pleasure and happiness and relief that I sometimes moan or cry. A ""high"" feeling follows for a little while, but then, the anxiety creeps back in, the sadness of what I'd done, the longing to see the flames again...and it starts all over.   I can write it here, but I won't be able to say it. I am so bad when it comes to talking to strangers face to face. :(  Thanks in advance guys! ",06Oct2018,1

This most difficult process when discoving this is the way it affects your everyday life. 
I wake up in the morning blaming my problems on my ugliness, saying if I was attractive I wouldn't be experiencing this, I would probably have a lot of friends, a lot of people would be interested in me and reach out to me. (I know it’s a horrible reacurring thought to plant in yourself) I would be who I feel like I really was and wouldn’t let others judge me. Probably be in a dedicated relationship by now, not used and thrown away. 
This has embedded a deep dark fear in me that I missed out on every opportunity that has come my way because I can’t stand looking in the mirror or looking at photos of myself.(which has some truth to it) 
 I still try to lie to myself saying one day i’ll be attractive, just have to get my shit together, then an episode hits and there I am hating myself for something I can not control.

31,"Hi, I'm located in North Carolina in the United States. I'm not sure how specific I should be with my location so let me know if I should disclose anymore information. Also, I just made this throwaway account since people know my actual account and I would be embarrassed if they read this.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so during my high school years I was very depressed and suicidal. During my freshman year of college I spoke to people and learned what I was experiencing was not really normal. So, I went to the University's counseling center. They said they couldn't really help me since I was extremely paranoid and it would be better if I spoke to someone consistently in the community. At this point I told my parents about my mental health since I would need to use their insurance to afford speaking to a psychologist or psychiatrist. They were so surprised since I had never talked about my problems and they made me come home during the next break and they took me to our local medical provider. I told the local medical provider about my problems and they seemed pretty surprised too. They then said I should go to the ER so I could get medicated immediately. My mom drove me to the ER and I talked to a psychologist on call in the ER (I don't know if that's normal) and a social worker. They both agreed I needed to be institutionalized so I was non-voluntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for my suicidal thoughts, but mainly they said it was because they thought if they only recommended I go and my mom try to take me I would inevitably back out and not get the help I need. I'm not so sure their reasoning was sound, but maybe they were just saying this to me because they didn't want to tell me the real reason they were sending me. In any case, I went and stayed for a week. While there I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety. They prescribed me celexa and something else for anxiety but I don't remember. All in all, I consider it an eye opening experience, and I learned a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the rest of my freshman year, I spoke to a psychologist in the area and I felt like I made significant progress. Eventually I just stopped rescheduling appointments and stopped taking my medication. If I felt depressed or suicidal I took measures to deal those feelings and thoughts. I felt so much more in control of myself than I had ever before. That's not to say I didn't struggle some days or don't struggle now, but I'm a junior now and still deal with depressed and suicidal thoughts effectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been experiencing some very terrifying perceptions of reality. I'm not entirely sure when they began, but I know I definitely started to experience them halfway through my sophomore year. Although I think I experienced some incorrect interpretations of reality near the end of high school, but I just didn't identify them until later. Yet, I guess I could be thinking they were that when they were something else. Anyways, when I sit in class everyday, I start to think everyone around me is a paid actor and I'm the only student in class. I start to think everyone already knows the information and the teacher is solely teaching me. I start to think everyone in the class is communicating telepathically about me. Or, people in front of me are fidgeting in particular ways in an attempt to hypnotize me. I think people behind me make sounds to encourage certain behaviors of mine and discourage others. Last week I was taking an exam and my professor likes to joke around make certain answer choices obviously wrong but related to a joke he said in lecture while covering the material related to the question. It's pretty funny, but I read some of them and thought he was fucking with me. I won't get specific for fear of someone reading it and knowing exactly what course I'm taking, but I actually came to the conclusion during the test that an ex girlfriend of mine had paid my professor to include certain joke answers because she knew I would know it was referring to something I thought she did to me. And it's so frustrating my mind makes these automatic connections without any effort on my part. 

&amp;#x200B;

When dealing with unwanted depressive and suicidal thoughts, the methods I use are extremely effective. But with this, the same methods don't even fucking dent these thoughts. It's such a frustrating and seemingly hopeless endeavor. So, I figured I'd research these types of thoughts and what to do about them. I eventually discovered the personality disorder called schizotypal personality disorder. Previously, I had never heard of it and didn't really believe I had any personality disorder. I just thought I was a depressed kid. But after reading about some different personality disorders, I see symptoms of it within myself. I won't detail all of the weird shit going on in my head, although if I should elaborate I will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I included the info above about my pysch ward visit to hopefully provide evidence of a diagnosis which may be accurate but didn't really identify the underlying problem. I don't know if I said that scientifically correct, or if I'm just thinking I'm some special fuck when in reality I only have normal problems. I don't fucking know. I just want to know where I should look to talk to psychologist or psychiatrist (I don't know which one would be better) about another diagnosis. Even more importantly, I know I need to speak to a trained professional again. I was looking for psychologists in my area, but most of them are specialized in marriage, depression, or general counselors. So I'm not too sure what to look for. I'm hesitant to talk to the same person I talked to during my freshman year since I just stopped scheduling appointments and I feel like a dick for doing that. But maybe it would be beneficial to talk to them again. These are their credentials:

Counselor / Addiction (Substance Use Disorder) 634 North Carolina

Behavioral Health &amp; Social Service Providers / Marriage &amp; Family Therapist 032 North Carolina

Psychologist / Clinical 1751 North Carolina 

I mean, I guess you could just google the above to find where I live but I hope people respect my privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched schizotypal personality disorder a little and there doesn't seem to be any set treatment. So maybe I will be stuck with thoughts like this for the rest of my life. I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world. People have adapted to much worse things, and it's not like I've had an insanely hard life, so if this is going to be my sentence I'll deal with it. Currently, even with these constant thoughts during class and while interacting with others, I feel like I do fairly well. I mean my grades have been consistently great throughout college so clearly I don't just think I'm doing well, there is a well defined system indicating I am doing well. And my interactions seem okay, I mean even though I am constantly trying to evaluate whether the person I am talking to is trying to hypnotize me or is a spy gathering information on me, I do feel like I do okay. Although, I may be overestimating my abilities I suppose. I mean it's even scary to look for help since I don't really trust what anyone might say to me.

 

Anyways, sorry for the long and meandering story. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I think I have the ability to tell reality from my paranoid and delusional thoughts. I mean even though I'm scared to ask strangers for advice, I know rationally, reddit upvotes the most commonly agreed upon opinion and although it may be the blind leading the blind, there must be other accounts upvoting the top comments thus the advice I receive must be agreed upon my the number of upvotes it has. I mean unless people just upvote bad advice to fuck people over, but that would mean there would need to be more malicious people on reddit than people with good intentions. Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is: I know I have crazy thoughts, but I don't think I'm fucking crazy and I don't want to become crazy if I can stop it. ",06Oct2018,1

My problem is that as soon I start anything where I have to concentrate, like for example studying, I start yawing non stop. It's really annoying and disturbing.

36,"Hey reddit. Thought I’d word vomit on here to help process feelings and potentially get advice/reassurance. Posting from a throwaway. 

TLDR: Life got the better of me, skipped classes because I was either on too much of a high or too much of a low to go. Got dropped because of it. 

I have no idea what I want to do with my life, and don’t think I ever will. I have such a tremendous amount of anxiety surrounding the future: What if I pick something I don’t like? What if sea-levels rise and kill us all? What if none of this actually matters? My therapist has always told me that it’s okay to think these things, and that everyone does. But does it really effect people to the extent of such crippling anxiety that they can’t even choose a major? I don’t know. 

The first time this happened, I was 16. Everyone was getting excited for college and starting to think about their applications. I had decent grades at the time, averaging about a B in each class. Was doing extracurriculars like Theater and Cheerleading. I had everything going for me. But then everyone started asking the big question. What do you plan on doing after graduation? I had no fucking clue. I knew no matter what I would say, something would be wrong with it. Wanna be a teacher? Don’t get paid well. Wanna continue cheer or theater? Hard to get a job. Wanna be a therapist? Too much expensive school. I was being bombarded from all sides - but mainly my mom. She wanted me to be a nurse. Because she was a nurse. I didn’t want to be a nurse. 

So, did what any *sane* person would do and started cutting class and anything else related to school. Whether I was on a high or low - stay home in bed because I was sad or go to the mall and steal everything I could because I was on top of the world. I just didn’t want to be at school. That’s where all the anxiety was.  And of course my grades slipped, almost got kicked out of cheer and theater. Parents were understandably upset and took me to the family doctor who diagnosed me. I was NOT taken to therapy or put on meds though because my mom doesn’t believe in ‘mental health.’ My doctor and parents worked with the school to get me in better standing. Luckily, it was high school so it was easy enough. Did summer and online classes to make up my grades and did community service to get back in cheer and theater. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. Graduated like any average high schooler and got into a state school. Everything seemed fine again. 

Freshman and sophomore year of college were fun. I was going to school for nursing - even though I didn’t want to. I went to school for nursing because I had no other ideas, but more importantly did not want to upset my parents ever again. (No one should have to see the wrath of a white-suburban middle-aged Christian mom who’s daughter ‘isn’t doing the best’). It was no big deal though, nothing serious happens with your major until your junior year anyway, I had time to figure it out. Guess what? I didn’t figure it out. I spent my time either partying or sleeping all day. Good ol’ untreated bipolar. And with my parents at an arms-length away, I didn’t really care it was happening. I was discovering my self in ways I never thought possible in middle-of-nowhere’s-ville where I grew up. I discovered my own sexuality! I discovered I liked psychedelics! I discovered I like women better than men! I discovered I like psychology! Etc. 

I decided to start seeing a therapist to help me figure things out until I could tell my parents what was going on behind their back. She convinced me it was time I switch my major to psychology (what I actually wanted to do) and to come out of the closet to my family (what I didn’t want to do at all). I hesitantly agreed, but she’s my therapist and ultimately wants wants best for me. This time last year, I flew home to see my family. They excitedly asked when I was graduating, have I gotten a boyfriend yet, any new internships... I decided to play along until dinner. 

The questions came up again, as they do. I chose to start things out easy - I’m switching majors to psychology mom and dad! They quiet their eating and mumble something along the lines of, “Oh great...” They go off on how my new ‘libtard’ state has changed me and that I don’t know what I’m doing. Psychology is not a viable major, you’ll never be taken seriously, you’re going crazy again, etc. with most of the aggression coming from my moms side of the table. I sort of black out at this moment not really knowing what to say or do. I have a lot on my mind, and for some fucking dumb reason decide - NOW. I blurt out, “I’m gay.” Conversation is over. 

My mom silently picks up her and my dad’s dishes and goes to the kitchen. My dad walks upstairs and go to bed. I sat at the table until my mom followed my dad upstairs. I went to bed. 

My mom wakes me up in the middle of the night, surprisingly calm. In my groggy state she tells me that she and my father are going to forget what I said at dinner if I don’t ever bring it up again. She goes on to blame my new therapist for filling my head with ‘nonsense’ and says she’s going to call her in the morning. Okay. 

So, I’m fucked. I fly home defeated. Knowing fully well how fucked I am, I try to continue the solid C-grades I’ve somehow managed to maintain up to this point. I saw my therapist, she continued to tell me everything was going to be okay. I knew that wasn’t true. 

Cue 3 months later. Self-medicating with alcohol, practically blacking out every single weekend. Not giving a single shit about my future. I end up dating a boy for a bit to prove to myself I wasn’t gay and actually had sex with him a few times. I broke up with him soon after for obvious reasons. 

A little while later, I found myself throwing up in the mornings even when I wasn’t drinking the night before. Took a pregnancy test - came up positive. Went to planned parenthood, test came up positive again. I’m fucking pregnant. 
I’m 5 weeks pregnant to be exact. My life is in shambles. I text my ex, he says he’ll help me. He’s so sweet. I feel so bad for roping him into my life that’s falling apart. We decide to split the bill on a medical abortion. Thank god he was there for me. I don’t think I could’ve done it alone. It is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life. 

After that, I fell into the same whole I did when I was 16, but much worse this time. I wasn’t going to class. I wasn’t emailing my professors. Stopped going to work. Only barely talked to my therapist. I would either be too depressed to even shower or going to bars and spending what little money I had. I did this for an entire year. 

For some reason, a small part of me thought I could get out of this the same way I did back in high school. But of course I couldn’t. This is college, I’m a 21-year-old adult know. I didn’t even bother to sign up for classes this term. Its hard to do anything when almost 100% of your energy is dedicated to not causing harm to yourself. 

I just got the email today, I’ve been dropped from University State of X. I feel numb, stupid, angry, sad, everything and nothing all at the same time. I don’t know how I’m supposed to tell my parents. The same parents who couldn’t even cope with me switching majors. What the fuck do you do in a fucked up situation like this? I can’t blame anyone but myself, but of course I blame my parents. Maybe if they had been supportive this wouldn’t have happened? Maybe if they put on meds the first time around I would be normal? Maybe if I could be myself I would feel happy? So many maybes. 

I think I might voluntarily check myself into the local psychiatric hospital. My therapist said she could write me a referral. 

If you made it this far, thank you for listening.

40,"My sister has been institutionalized in the past for being suicidal, has never gotten a job to support herself and still lives with our parents, who are in the 60s but cannot retire because they are supporting her. When she was going through her super-religious phase, she has repeatedly told me that I am going to Hell for not going to church with her.

She has threatened to file a police report on my boyfriend for something she thinks it is morally wrong by her new-found religious standards, but is not illegal. That was the last straw. I stopped speaking to her at that point. That was three years ago.

My boyfriend and I broke up last month due to circumstances, and she thinks that means there's no longer a reason for me to ignore her anymore. She's been calling constantly (which I ignored), texting, and generally acting like nothing is wrong. Nothing else has changed. She has yet to apologize to my ex - she still owes him an apology, regardless of my relationship with him. She is still freeloading, and while my dad can no longer work due to his health and age, my mom is still working part time to support her.

People who have dealt with family with mental health issues, or those who have mental health issues as well, can you please give me some advice as to how to proceed?

a) If I keep ignoring her, she may hurt herself for attention

b) If I respond to her negatively, she may hurt herself anyway

c) If I respond to her positively (which I genuinely cannot do at this moment), that may enable her to continue with this behaviour

43,"**WARNING:** Long post, lots of details. Please read till the very end for notes and more context.

* My mother (diabetic since 5) has a (probably) undiagnosed and untreated disorder that showed itself in early childhood. Whatever this is, it was subtle and non-disruptive enough to the point where she completed college and her parents were always in denial over it and blamed it on diabetes. Symptoms include whispering to one's self, striding and running around randomly, walking with head bowed down, making strange hand and facial gestures as if conversing with someone and being able to somewhat control all this in front of most people. Literally how many disorders from childhood are there where the person is able to function semi-normally without treatment and complete college??? And as we all know, many disorders are hereditary, autism especially.

&amp;#x200B;

* For most of my childhood and early adolesence I had a daydreaming problem that was disruptive. I used to love watching Disney movies as a toddler obviously. So it started with those. I would pretty much be watching these movies in my head all throughout lessons and I wouldn't pay attention. When I was 7 my parents took me to a child psychologist to solve the issue. I don't remember much about the sessions, all they did to me was make me play educational games where I'd constantly be thinking 'what the heck is the point of all this??'. But now that I look back maybe they were testing me for developmental problems. I roughly remember a short exchange between my mother and the psychologist. Psychologist: ""So you think she has her own little world?"" Mum: ""definitely"". Even as an adult now I still don't know what the heck they meant. I don't remember any diagnosis being made, and I don't even remember any possible techniques being implemented to stop my day dreaming besides 'stop doing it'.  The day dreaming didn't get any better, it only changed in content, from movies it went to sort of fanfiction and original things I'd make up in my head. Sometimes I swear I wanted to stop it but I couldn't. Finally when I was 15 I forced myself to reduce it considerably because my accademic future was looking hopeless. But I still do it today, any time I don't have to fully concentrate I do it.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm anti-social and I don't think I view human relationships in a normal way. Once I turned 11 I had extreme trouble making friends and socializing so I isolated myself and spent all my alone time in the school bathrooms except if my best friend was around. I'm still kind of like that. I generally have an anxiety around people and many many people are too extroverted for me and not my type, plus I dislike loud people possibly because of my abuse which I'll mention in the end. But other than that, it's like if someone doesn't seem to fit my mold of ideal I won't even consider trying to strike a conversation. I don't even know how to have casual relationships. Every time I tried to make friends I ended up at least hinting that things weren't really all right at home or at least talking about deep stuff like philosophy and morality, which definitely scared off an otherwise previously enthusiastic acquaintance. The only way I can describe it is that it's like I'm always looking for a soulmate, or a lover, not a friend, and once I get that soulmate I pretty much won't need anyone else. And with the few casual friends I make, I always have a desire to go further but I know I can't. And I'll get just a bit upset over how I'm not special to that person and that there will never be anything close to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have a very functional view towards relationships, towards everything really, and I can't shut it off. I studied sociology and continue to study it, and in every class teachers say that afterwards you'll view life in a totally different way, viewing it in a sociological/psychological/logical way and that you'll go crazy! That's me, without any prompting, since I was 11. For example, whenever I'm giving a gift to one of my very few friends, one side of me wants to do it because it's nice and because it's going to feel very good knowing that they'll feel good. But the other half thinks, more like nags, how I'm doing it to make myself feel happy through their happiness, how it will strengthen our bond as friends which is very good for me in the long run because they'll kind of owe me a favor and will be less likely to leave me. See?  And this perspective is on all the time.  When I'm out socialising with the few friends I have and otherwise having a fun time, I have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9blm96/my_family_says_that_my_way_of_thinking_is_not/) list in my head. It's a list of what topics to bring up to entertain and what to ask them. And I make sure not to to talk too much about myself in case I seem egocentric. My family told me I'm not normal for having this list and that these things should come naturally. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Something happened very recently that made me realise how I have no sense of love for family. I mean of course that was already shattered by abusive and neglectful parents. But until recently I used to think I loved both sets of grandparents and my uncle for being nice to me and helping me to the best of their abilities. Notice I said to the best of their abilities, because with how conservative and traditional they are in their frame of mind, their values are in total opposite to mine. And recently I've realised how I have no trouble with completely and coldly abandoning them. I'll get into more detail. I never truly got along with one set of grandparents. Since I was born we had totally opposite views on life and interests. I still visit them, but only because my fun uncle visits with me and because my dad insists. But I've come to the conclusion that I would have no trouble abandoning them. This is because it dawned on me how they don't care/believe me about the abuse I've been through. They'd rather stay in their little fantasy world where blood relatives are the most important thing and will never desert you, where everyone is good at heart despite whatever they've done, and where the Beatles have satanic messages in their songs. In addition to that, I've kind of abandoned my other set of grandparents that I used to get along with even if they were slightly more liberal and educated in their mindset. But I reached more or less the same conclusion: they don't bother to understand me and don't think the abuse was a big deal. In addition to that, my grandmother hinted many times that she thinks I think I'm some special creature who wants to be the centre of attention. In the meantime my grandfather is deeper in his positive fantasy world and denial than my other grandma. They don't try to understand me, rarely offer good advice, have almost no concept of mental health and mental illness and many times tell me everything is my fault. As long as I've been alive I've never been apart from them for more than 2 weeks. It's been 2 months now, and I'm not missing them because they've hurt me so much. They expressed through my parents and messages that they miss me and feel hurt, and I do feel a bit guilty, but I reason that they'll move on. Because it never did good for either of us when I'd rant to them and plead for help when they didn't have the mental capacity to understand and couldn't offer any help.

&amp;#x200B;

* I honestly cannot give a clear answer of if I have the need to have relationships or not. In most cases I won't try to make friends and I'll occupy my time with something more important like writing the many novels I have planned. And I seriously do consider it more important and much more worth it than attempting to make friends which will probably fail in some way or at least not be up to my liking. Something that I can say, and that I've kind of mentioned, is that if I found a significant other, I won't need anyone else and the furthest I'd strive for with people is casual acquaintanceship.

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't know if these could count as some sort of sensory issues. I have a sensitivity to my body and the way clothes feel on me that seems to grow worse every year. It really makes me feel like I'm going crazy. I hate the way my stomach bunches and scrunches up so I try to stand most of the time. I hate loose or low-waisted trousers to the point that if I'm wearing one when alone I'll either stay topless or in underwear to even function. And even when I dress myself in the most comfortable things as possible I'm constantly re-adjusting and fidgeting and few things can distract me from how clothes feel on me. I also have this feeling that I'm bloated for most of the time, but logically I know I'm not bloated. I don't have the healthiest of diets but I'm not piggish and I know my limits, and even when I drink a lot of water I still feel bloated and it drives me crazy. I'm even hyperaware of digestion. Any time I eat a bit too much, besides feeling bloated I'll feel the little prickles of heat and contractions and I hate it. My sensitivity to my stomach is so bad that when I was 14-16 I was obsessed with pro-ana and tried dangerous techniques to lose weight. Not because I was fat or anyone told me I was fat, it was solely because of the feelings my stomach gave me. Other than that I hate loud noises, especially the screeches of chairs. I can't eat in noisy places like a restaurant or school cafeteria unless I'm with 2 or more people because the noise bothers me and makes me feel nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'll go to the same places and go along the same routes until I can't take it anymore. More context. I'll go the same pharmacy even though people have told me there are cheaper ones nearby, I'll go to the same hairdresser even if I'm dissatisifed every time, and I'll shop at the same grocery store even though it many times runs out of things I'm looking for. It takes me a lot of courage to change this kind of stuff. Till now my routine might be related to anxiety, but I can't find a good explanation for this next one.  I've known there are faster and easier routes to some places for years but never went through them until years later because of some irrational fear that something might go wrong, something might happen to me if I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

* My family and a few friends have told me that I'm always talking in a way that's too formal and too logical, like inserting a lot of complicated and scientific words and that I should just be a bit more casual.

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't realise until it's too late that someone was interested, or not interested in me. For example, there were a few students who seemed like they wanted to be friends, but weeks later I realised they did that to every student because they were members of the council and wanted to put up a good reputation, and that I was in no way special to them. On the other end of the spectrum, every time a guy showed he was interested in me I couldn't tell and instead was suspicious and wary of what they wanted. Two guys were really making prolonged eye-contact with me and all I did was ignore it, one guy struck a conversation with me which I just didn't elaborate on, and another guy approached me multiple times for a conversation where I also didn't elaborate. I mean it took my friends and grandparents to tell me that they were probably interested in me and that they certainly weren't weird. Yeah I got called prudish for that.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have a feeling I'm too blunt and rude. Over the last 2-3 years my family has randomly been telling me to be polite, say please and thank you, don't talk about X deep topic with X people, basically treating me like a 5 year old who has no concept of shame and boundaries. Also my friend briefly left me partially because of my rudeness. More details in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9a5d38/18female_i_think_my_personality_is_incompatible/) post.

&amp;#x200B;

* My best friend recently tearfully admitted to me that during primary and secondary school my parents, teachers and literally everyone in my grade thought I was autistic. During a group exercise (for which I was absent) somehow the whole class and the teacher got onto the topic about me. The whole class expressed how weird I was for being so anti-social and awkward to which my teachers explained to them that I probably have ASD or some other condition and to be kind yada yada yada. Yeah that literally shook me because I always thought how my classmate's attempts at kindness seemed very artificial and coached. ",06Oct2018,1

45,"So i’ve never had any long lastning romantic relationsships. The first time i slept with a girl was at an exhange of students. When i met her again though in her home country and she had gotten a bf i took the message unreasonably hard.

Last week i’ve met another great girl on an international exchange. I told myself i wouldn’t repeat my mistakes and went in with an attitude of ”simply having fun”

We started to talk though every day, she was flirty and physical, other people wondered if we were a couple. A few actually berated me for not kissing her; ”its evident that she wants you”

Last night we hooked up and i agreed upon leaving it at that. However at the final ”goodbye party” it was if i was a stranger to her. She was quiet, uninterested and at the final goodbye she simply said ”goodby” pretty much.

I hate the fact that i actually feel bad about her not showing any affection the last time we would see each other. It eats me up that i Can’t simply let a hook up be a hook up. These situations really showcase my awful self-esteem.",06Oct2018,1
46,"So, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression during my final year of university (January 2018). My anxiety symptoms were very physical and it was something I hadn't really had before. I was unable to attend anything at university, leave the house, do food shopping, drive - anything. I came out the other side though at graduated with a good degree after pretty much teaching myself the degree while I was stuck in my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Since leaving university, and essentially most of my triggers, my physical symptoms have lessened... until I was on a family holiday. My family have never really understood my anxiety, but they were never around me when it was all happening as I lived away from home. It was all just conversation for them. We were outside on a rooftop bar and I had this overwhelming ""feeling"" come over me, very much like what I would get in a lecture at university before I had to leave and have a panic attack. My mind started rushing and all the usual thoughts and feelings came back (I won't go into details about what they are etc, thats not the point).  I told my parents I didn't feel well and went back to my room ""fight or flight."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to panic in the room, shaking, hyperventilating etc and was texting my mum. My mum was replying along the lines of, whats wrong, are you having an ""episode"", stop being silly, why would you feel like this its relaxing here. ""Why has this come on"" was the question she was persistently asking, which in my mind, while I'm having a panic attack is not constructive conversation. I don't know why I'm having it, it's irrational and I don't really care why, all I know is I'm having it and I want to deal with it. She still persisted even after saying this. I told her she wasn't being helpful and was making it worse. She knocked on the hotel door. I opened it to let her in and immediatey went and sat on the bed without saying anything (when I panic I constantly think I'm going to pass out or faint so I prefer to sit). This is where it got... I don't even know. She started yelling saying I was such a spoilt, horrible girl for ""acting up"" like this on the holiday, how I'm just a horrible, nasty person etc etc... I was sobbing uncontrollably shaking and could barely breathe at this point, I was just telling her to stop over and over again and was saying I'm having a panic attack. I stood up and tried to get to the bathroom but she held me by my wrists while I was saying ""no, please stop, I need you to get away, don't touch me, you're hurting me, you're making it worse,  I need to get away"" she was yelling ""stop being stupid, no I won't stop holding, no, stop doing this"" etc etc, she came after me to the bathroom where it continued, I consistently said she needed to stop as she was making it worse yelling at me, I was trying so so hard to control my breathing as I was gasping for air, where she eventually yelled ""fine then"" and left the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

I facetimed one of my friends who knew about my anxiety and has had panic attacks herself (as I say I think I'm going to faint so I don't like being left alone) and she calmed me right down. I went back upstairs and didn't really speak to my mum. I was trying to explain as whole to my parents what the symptoms were, how they made me feel, that they didn't need to understand it or know why it happens, but this is just how it is. It was the topic of discussion for a couple of hours. I was on my own with my mum a few hours later and brought up the situation in the room where she said sorry briefly but passed it off as not understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this has stayed with me so much, I feel so much distance between my mum (this was 1-2 months ago now) and I don't really speak to her. My dad doesn't really know what happened in the room. I feel almost like I was attacked when I was in that state of mind... I don't know.. its really left me feeling alone. ",06Oct2018,1
47," 

Me and my younger brother (14) were both subjected to years of physical and emotional abuse by our mother, though these days it's mostly narcissistic and emotional abuse.

My brother has had anger issues since he was 6. He would yell at teachers and classmates and later he started doing it to my parents. Supposedly the anger towards others has stopped due to a learning assistant and several therapist appointments (where she doesn't know the root cause of his anger no doubt) but with my parents it's gotten worse. When my mum is seriously being like a banshee he becomes one too and even shoves her to the ground. But she being a narcissist magnifies her shock and pain by a million obviously. When I talk to my brother about this he tries to defend himself by saying something like she started it by throwing books at him, and he's even said it doesn't matter anyway because OBVIOUSLY he won't react that way with anyone else. He never thinks towards the long-term, it's like this with school as well, he has a mentality that he doesn't need to study now, just a mere few weeks before O-levels.

I don't know if my brother has empathy, I'm not close to him because of no other reason than petty childhood grudges and sibling rivalry. Supposedly he has friends since he moved schools and no one knows him to be aggressive. But I seriously don't know if he has empathy, not like he's had much opportunity to express it anyway",06Oct2018,1
48,"Like if I deem anything is remotely not needed like an extra 3rd eraser I will obsess over the fact and try to get rid of it even if it means throwing it away and losing money.

Let's take an example, I have a phone, a Galaxy S9, there's some harmless extra apps on the phone, there are 2 Email apps, 2 Calculator Apps, 2 Calendar apps etc. One from Google, the other from Samsung.

I deem the extra Samsung Apps as bloat and am obsessing over that fact, I wasted an entire day I was supposed to be studying with trying to remove the apps.

I'm here now because I know that removing the apps will not solve the problem, eventually I'll be like ""the heart rate sensor in the back is excess, I'm buying a new phone"".

I don't want to be like this, it's not like the apps cost me any space or something, they're just there and it's making me obsessed because of this need for ""purity"" I seem to have.

49,"Hi:) I've searched this and two other mental health related subreddits searching for sleep (fitness) tracker reviews and suggestions but most posts are very old or only have a couple of replies to them. I hope posting about this here is ok?

I'm looking at fitness trackers for use mostly as a wearable sleep tracking aid. (I've thought about bedside tech; I share a bed with my husband and two dogs, I have a feeling that would mess with my results somehow.)

 Sleep is my main priority, with steps/activity tracking a distant second. Any other features offered aren't really my focus and I view them as bonus features i'll have to learn to utilize later, after I learn to use the sleep tracking abilities the tech has to offer. (just how my brain prefers to process). 

I'm very interested to read your experiences/opinions/reviews/suggestions if you have any to share. It's a tool I'd really like to utilize in my attempts to establish a better sleep hygiene routine, but I'm wondering just how effective it really is.

After some time I worked up the courage to ask her if she felt the same way, and she didn´t. Although I kinda saw it coming it still hit me hard when she confirmed my fears.

Now I´m back to where I used to be and work out almost every day like I used to before the summer. I do understand that working out makes you more hungry, but I feel like I eat more than what I used to when working out regularly.

52,"My first ever relationship ended three months ago. We were together for over two years and he was my best friend and person I talked to most and spent the most time with. He  ended it really suddenly so we could focus on school and I took it pretty hard but we were able to stay semi friends mostly out of necessity as we are both part of the same friend group and have to see each other relatively frequently.

Anyways after it ended I immediately went through the whole won't get out of bed, loss of appetite, drinking too much cliché spiral that I've seen sad women do at the beginning of movies but I've kind of come out of that since I went back to school. 

I'll preface this by saying I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 14, so my life has always revolved very strictly around routine and structure. My brain runs on kind of a loop and I used to force myself to think about things that made me uncomfortable or disgusted or sad. Ever since the break up I feel like I just drift through everything internally, and that nothing is really making sense. I know heartbroken people always shove out that shit about ''nothing makes sense without them!'' but I honestly kind of get it now. I'm sure that's because I lost someone my life was pretty much built around and now I have all this extra time but everything seems so open-ended and I can feel my decision making being way more erratic and volatile that it ever was.

I keep thinking about him and all this shitty stuff that he's never even said will play over and over in my mind and I can't tell what is real anymore to the point I'm honestly longing for 13 year old me's mind where all I would think about was making sure I counted every step I took in groups of eight and blu tacking my pens to the table in class so they wouldn't move out their right order.

Well, you see, during my time in therapy, my therapist did (towards the beginning) suggest having a journal to record what my feelings are. I did, but I always forgot to write it in. I only had like two pages filled out with messy nonsensical writing in it. But what really turned me off towards it was my mom was angry about something (unrelated), so she went in and read through my journal. I was more than pissed and didn't write in it anymore since it was supposed to be personal and I didn't want any invasions of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

That was about four years ago, and I am still super secretive about putting things down on paper and even telling somebody about what I am feeling. The problem I have encountered, is that I usually forget or have a very difficult time articulating my experiences and thoughts when I have an appointment with her (I see my therapist every other week). I can tell her the basic stuff (psychosis, anxiety, etc.), but I am getting the feeling it isn't being taken seriously. I am not currently on any medicines at the moment. I want relief, and the reason why I am asking this is because I was wondering if recording things on a hard copy would express how much things have been bothering me. Of course, I will have the fear of somebody (at home or at school) reading it, but I want to see if this would help her see the gravity of my situation or how it is effecting me.

61,"Hi everyone. I'm male, 19, from England. 
I've always had problems with relationships starting with my first at the age of around 15. Everything starts off wonderful, but as I grow more attached, I start getting very depressed. I'll ask all sorts of questions, such as have you ever smoked, drugs, gotten drunk, fornication, etc. I'll get severely depressed if I get an answer I don't like (I must say I never ever get angry at anyone, I know the problems with me). Even when it comes to games, or app games (flappy bird when that was common, piano tiles, etc.) if I'm being beaten, I have to keep playing until I win or I'll get severely depressed, and feel worthless. This is how it was with my first relationship, until my feelings virtually went for her entirely. She ended up being literally crazy though so it didn't end up mattering too much, haha. 
Unfortunately though, my 2nd relationship when I was 18 was much better and worse at the same time. I started a long distance relationship with someone. We had everything in common, still do. She was a little older than me. I still asked the same questions, and every answer was what I wanted to hear, (we were both born Jehovah's witnesses which may be the reason why I have such strong feeling about those sorts of questions). However, she did watch a lot of movies, which is fine, but that included violent and horror movies, which again, I got severely depressed about. I would search for films and ask her if she's seen it, which she usually had. Again, I would get depressed. We played piano tiles, I got obsessed, I would constantly check all her scores and make sure she wasn't winning. If she was, I'd have to play until I did better, if I couldn't, I'd feel worthless. She was however, everything I ever wanted. She was perfect for me. We spoke for for what must have been thousands of hours, sent over 250,000 messages to each other over the course of a couple of years. After a year of being together though, my feelings began to fade, even though I knew she was perfect. It was almost as if I wanted the challenge of starting a relationship, I don't know. Around when my stress and depression from being so obsessed started, my physically health really went bad. I suffered from constant nausea, some days I couldn't eat anything, and that has continued until now. Even though we were amazing friends, we decided it might be best to call things off as I was always negative about everything. We didn't talk for around 9 months, until a few days ago when I messaged her again. She's still a beautiful person, amazing friend, and would do anything for me. However, she now has a bf, and is living with him, which I'm really struggling with. I believe I still have feelings for her, which is really difficult for me. My physical health is starting to get worse because I'm thinking about her living with him, having sex, and even though I know there isn't really anything wrong with that, my stupid mind is really not allowing me to believe that. My physical health is starting to get worse, my feelings for her are starting to get stronger again, but I know I'll be depressed and anxious and make the same mistakes as always whatever happens. I don't want to lose her again, as a friend or anything else, because we've both missed each other a lot, and it wouldn't be fair on her either, but I can't allow my physical health to get as bad as it was again. She's genuinely perfect, beautiful, and she would never do a bad thing to anyone, which is why I hate my mind so much for not only ruining it in the first place, but for getting me feeling this way now, both with my feelings for her, and the depression I'm getting into again. If I forget about her and start a relationship in the future, the same will happen, those questions, anxiety, depression, and obsession.

62,"Hi guys,
I started Zyprexa (2.5 mg)  about two weeks ago, and the side effects have been bad. (I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder) My ankles swelled up to the size of my calf, I had terrible stomach pains, my abdomen was bloated and rock hard, and worst of all I felt like a piece of me was missing. I didn’t feel myself, I felt completely numb, like a walking zombie. I went back to my doctor and she told me to stop for the week, and then take half of the dose and see how it goes. She also said, and I quote “you can either take half or none, your choice..” I’ve been off of it for a few days and my ankles have gone down a little, my stomach is feeling better, and I feel emotions again. But I think suddenly going off of it is messing with my body because I vomited 5 times in an hour today. Maybe it’s unrelated, I don’t know. But the question I’m asking is what do I do? Do I suck it up with the side effects and zombie state and take it? Or should I stop and feel too much? I’ve tried most of the other medications, and they either don’t work, or give me embarrassing side effects like lactation..

65,"I frequently feel hyper aware of textures and my body sensations. As an example, here's what I wrote one time while feeling this way:

'Fuck everything feels so gross and wrong like clothes feel bad but so does being naked and it's like I can feel a film of oil on my head but I showered yesterday and I can't bring myself to get in the shower now and I can feel all of my facial features and I just wanna do my makeup but my skin needs a break and I can feel the air and my fat and bones and the food at the bottom of my stomach and my glasses hurt my nose and I just wanna throw up and peel back my eyelids and turn my skin inside out fuck'

These nights (It's usually a night thing), come with very dark abstract-ish (I call them crow thoughts because of the movie The Crow. They look like that) and also suicidal thoughts. I am insecure about my weight, it was mentioned a few times in that paragraph. This all started in it's most basic form in 8th grade when I started having a really bad time. I have gone to a therapist and she isn't a great match for me. I'm still in school, and I do okay without stressing over it. But these nights are starting to get really bad and as I simplify/materialize these abstract thoughts I've become afraid of my own mind.

66,"A few months ago I broke up with my very toxic bf, and I was left to deal with a ton of guilt and loneliness. My mom was there for me in the first two weeks, and I kind of started leaning on her for emotional support whenever I needed it. I felt much better very quickly, but I am still thinking about it at times.
Lately I haven’t been happy at all. I’m soon to graduate from high school, but I’m literally surrounded by so many fake people right now that feeling lonely on a daily basis is inevitable. Two days ago I left school early because I felt so depressed I literally couldn’t function. It felt like I couldn’t even control it - like someone was controlling my brain for me. I felt suffocated. I wanted to cry all the time. I didn’t know why. I started feeling like I desperately needed my ex back (something that I have already established I don’t want to happen). I just felt so alone.
When I went home, my mom almost immediately started screaming at me that I am psychologically tormenting her with my “moods” and that I’m literally never happy. This is not true since I was, in fact, very happy like a month ago. Now she’s mad at me because she thinks I only talk about pointless things to her (I try sharing how I feel with her sometimes) and we don’t talk about my uni application process enough. I feel so bad, because not only is she so incredibly angry with me about something i don’t think is my fault, and also because she simply discards all of the stuff I’m going through currently. She literally said that I don’t need a therapist, because I’m just overdramatic. She has the habit of guilt-tripping me, and I know that. The problem is that I feel very dependent on her, and I subconsciously always feel like her opinion is the best opinion in the entire universe, just because she’s my mom.
Please, give your opinion on the situation, because I’m stuck jumping from thinking that she’s being a bad parent for not acknowledging the fact that I am very sad and then thinking that I’m probably just making this ‘depression’ thing up, and it doesn’t exist. I just need someone to tell me I’m not just being lazy and dramatic, I guess.",06Oct2018,1
67,"i've been through a lot of bad shit, including sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and plain 'ol depression because of it. recently i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

but even before the diagnosis, i couldn't remember my past, only bits and pieces. my friends would talk about how in 6th grade, they were friends with so and so, and in 9th grade, they had ms. smith as a teacher. for awhile i thought i just had repressed memories and my mind was just trying to protect me from the trauma i experienced, but as time went on, and as a freshman in college, i cant seem to figure out if that's really the case. i can clearly remember certain traumatic events that happened to me, but i cant even remember yesterday or the day before. when i do remember things, i get the times and dates mixed up, i forget names and places, i forget what we learned in our last class. it's gotten so bad that whenever someone says 'dont you remember?' or 'how did you forget?' or brings up my memory in any way, i get emotional. 

a better description would be that everything in the past, from yesterday to ten years ago, feels like im looking at gray smoke, a haze. an impenetrable cloud that is as heavy as a rock. all the events in my timeline are mixed up, things that happened when i was younger that i remember, i feel like happened two days ago, a week ago. but things that happened yesterday feel like a century ago. 

sorry for the long post but its made learning almost impossible, i have to study for tremendous amounts of time to get it in my head, and it has made me write things down in notebooks (only when i remember. ironically). something traumatic happened to me last summer and i had to tell my friends what my ex did to me, but for the life of me i couldnt. all i could remember and tellt hem was that he was abusive, it made me less credible and part of that is the reason why i lost them as friends once i moved on to college.",06Oct2018,1
68,"I wrote this poem as a reflection on my diagnoses of BPD and how it has ruled and navigated me through my life. My goal was to be able to express the extreme sides that exist, and to acknowledge that although those who associate with BPD may often feel manipulated or used, that it is rarely deliberate and to express the guilt i feel every day.   

And to my other BPD babes, don't worry, be strong, and learn to love you and all your rough edges.

 Transcript:  I have Borderline Personality Disorder A lot of times when I say this to people they reply  “Does that mean you have like a bunch of different personalities? Dude thats sick!” And i’ll reply with a laugh and a chuckle and wave the conversation on till it tumbles into a mess of small talk and avoidance Because they’re right. Kinda. BPD is sick. But it’s the sick that weighs down your bones and ties you to your bed with the lights off, and replaces you in your desk in all your classes because you’re sick.  Or too tired to fight against yourself today.  Because ingrained in every sense of your being is an unexplainable need to be wanted and inexplicable knowledge of your instability.  Having Borderline Personality Disorder is being able to see the future and being unable to stop it  Every BPD internet search is your crystal ball and all it contains are fires and hurricanes because the only forces seemingly powerful to fight off the omens are volcanoes and earthquakes.  I want to calm the storms but my inhales and exhales on counted breaths stir the winds My attempts at self sacrification turn to self preservation  I don’t need an angel or demon to sit on my shoulder they have encompassed my mind, and there is no middle man.   My existence is a never ending contradiction My retaliatory actions stem from a physiological fear and no matter how many  times i tell myself not to be afraid my feet keep running I keep running I am a constant juxtaposition, fighting against the need to be wanted and the fear of exploding to happy to productive to crying and flashbacks and hiding in my closet  because it has become my bomb shelter  and I couldn’t wish the shrapnel upon anyone but myself,  shards impaled in skin like ladder rings I’m sorry Climbing thorns up tall walls I’m sorry I hate me for this hurting please don’t leave me I’m sorry  Your bruised elbows and bleeding knees Promises and dreams  I never meant for you to get caught in my crossfire. But please help me to believe no one- not even me- deserves this volcanic instability.",06Oct2018,1
69,"I was always scared to admit my depression. I knew as soon as my family knew they’d treat me differently. I couldn’t hold it in yesterday. I broke down in school crying after having a strong feeling deep inside me that I couldn’t take my mind off. I was sent to a counselor afterward, and after a long conversation where I admit to my depression, but tell her I’m not planning on suicide, I came home to my father telling me to sit down for a talk. I could feel how scared he was for me, and it just made me cringe. Suddenly he wants to go places with me and spend as much money on me as possible. Suddenly my grandmother drives 2 hours from another country just to see me. Suddenly my aunt visits me from another long drive and gives me 50 dollars for no reason without directly talking with me about my depression. It feels so surreal, and I hate it. I even have to leave my door open now because they think im gonna KILL myself. My mind is far from suicide, and my brother has gotten angry at me because he was falsely told I was suicidal by my father, so he then says I’m overreacting and only trying to get attention, plus we’re tight on money and my father’s paying for therapy sessions. I feel worse than before I’ve admitted to having depression. Sorry for any run-on sentences or grammar/spelling mistakes,. I’m just feeling terrible as I’m typing this thread out, but I just want some way to convince my family that I won’t hurt myself, because I never will. Please help me.",06Oct2018,1

The past year I've also developed anhedonia, which is awful.  I have absolutely no motivation and, while I don't really feel depressed, I don't GAF about anything.

Anyway, I was terrified to try Adderall because I was afraid it was going to spike my anxiety (Wellbutrin did this with me, awful experience).  I'm happy to report that I'm 3 hrs into the Adderall and I feel calm, no anxiety spikes! Whether or not it helps with anhedonia, I can't tell anything yet.

I need to call this new one but I have a background voice in my head telling me it will be useless and it will go bad.. because it always has. I wish I didn't need it.
I have slightly suicidal behaviour and thoughts and pretty invalidating panic attacks at times but I am afraid of seeing another person and talking. I wish there was another way.
I do want someone whom I do not pay to help me but no one gives a shit about my issues.
I've had some bad stuff happen to me this year, to the point I thought I was gonna die and now life feels sad, without purpose and meaningless to me. It is difficult to find joy and be positive. 
I'll have to see a psychiatrist regardless bc I can't do it without meds but psychiatrists don't really care they just give you meds (not that I mind).

I don't know what's more shocking about this. That nothing feels good anymore, or that I feel no difference between when my family was here and when I'm left alone.

I’m hardly ever vulnerable or let my guard down but for him I did. Yesterday he was texting me all dry &amp; ignoring me so I double texted saying “why aren’t you talking to me I miss you” &amp; he didn’t respond for at least 3 hours. So I just said “nvm” cos I already felt so sad already &amp; he responded within minutes saying “cool” &amp; I was like “why are u being like this w me??”.

My husband has similar issues, same situation; no insurance. 
He has childhood sexual and physical abuse to deal with, like me. And recently it came to light that his abuser is still abusing and his wife is pressing charges. So he may have to testify.

I finally came to terms with the fact that I have problems about a year ago, and talked with my SO about it. She told me to get help, and I said I was fine and working on it alone. 

Fast forward to now. Big fight with SO about 6 weeks ago. I finally went to the dr and got on Zoloft. It’s helped my anxiety a ton, but wasn’t too sure about the depression.  But now, she broke up with me and I realized that all it took was some actual stress and I’m back to a mess again. Been together almost 5 years, we were engaged, and we have a 3 year old together. 

Through several talks with her, and reflecting myself I’ve realized just how bad I’ve gotten. On top of my depression and anxiety I’m pretty positive I have narcissistic personality disorder. I’ve unintentionally been gas lighting her, and I feel like absolute shit now that I’ve realized it and it’s too late. 

My only chance of getting my family back together is getting help. Even though I KNOW I have to, it’s just so hard still. Going to try to force myself to go to a non profit mental health help place here this week.

The homesickness from my other posts have worsened my anxiety and ocd to the maximum and now I cannot go anywhere. I’m bound to my dorm and going outside gives me INTENSE anxiety.

For a short rundown, I was COMPLETELY fine before coming to college but I got super homesick and suddenly worried about being gay (the biggest fear I had since I was young since my parents are super disapproving and I myself don’t want to be gay) so thinking about guys remotely sexually made me super depressed and anxious. I’d get so guilty and tell myself it’s  just cuz I’m stressed since I wasn’t like this before. I have unwanted thoughts 24/7 and wonder if I’d enjoy these things and it’s a vicious cycle. Also, to make matters worse, I can’t stand next to a guy especially with less clothes in fear I might act upon inappropriate impulses and avoid going outside at all costs. It’s so weird I have never had this problem before coming to college and I try to tell myself I’m being paranoid and stupid but I don’t know what to do now I’ve tried calling and texting help lines but it doesn’t help too much. I did an Emergency counseling service a week past but it also didn’t work. My only hope as of now is the scheduled counseling service in two days hopefully putting me into therapy. I truly believe it’s the anxiety that’s making me go crazy. I can only hope medicine will help me as nothing else is.

Also, my parents are my everything and being away from them has been ridiculously hard and thinking about inappropriate things make me so guilty to the point I’m sfraid to talk to them... I get weird impulses like if I think too much about it, I feel I’d enjoy it and involuntarily have my body gravitate toward an invisible guys inappropriately.

It's gotten so bad that all I can do is cry and beg for it to stop until I get so exhausted that I finally fall asleep.

I thought this would be described as intrusive thoughts, but when looking for information about it seems like that term seems to refer mostly to people who obsessively worry about themselves doing something bad or immoral.

87,"throwaway because my boyfriend knows about my actual reddit account.

my boyfriend and i (17F/M) have been dating for 9 months. we are in a long distance relationship but we plan to meet in december.

throughout the past month or so of our relationship, it’s been messy. we’ve had very high highs, or really low lows. it’s draining and i feel like we have been constantly arguing because of it. i struggle with mental problems myself, but after one of our arguments within the past week, my boyfriend came out to tell he thinks he has borderline personality disorder.

over the summer he told me he thinks he has depression. he said he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him but clearly something wrong with him. i’ve encouraged him to go and talk to a therapist multiple times, but he doesn’t know how he would ever tell his parents, which i completely understand because i also had a hard time bringing up the idea of therapy and medications and such to my parents. he also doesn’t like the idea of talking to someone that he doesn’t know. but, to be fair, he was never a person that liked to talk out their feelings. he would push them aside until the result of his problems blew up in his face, then he’d breakdown. he also tries to avoid me when he’s sad, because i try to talk with him about it and solve through his issues, but i end up getting sad too in the process, but that’s only because you never want to see the person you love in any sort of pain. at all. 

him telling me he thinks he has borderline personality disorder stuck with me. it’s a serious illness, and i have tried to get him to go to therapy, or try online therapy, anything. i am no doctor, i won’t self diagnose him, but i do think it’s a possibility that he might have it. it might make a lot of sense for some of the things he does. i really think he could have it, and i haven’t said anything to him about it since he told me. a day after he told me he said he was just “sad” and “doesn’t think he has it.” but, it’s really sticking with me. 

my boyfriend is impulsive. when we argue sometimes, he’ll say something so incredibly rude and usually it’s a direct attack to an issue i’ve discussed with him that had sparked a problem in our relationship, that we resolved, but when he brings it up like that, and is nasty about it... i don’t even know how to feel. he always ends up apologizing. he has also done other impulsive things.

i deal with being suicidal. i told him like recently i just had felt like killing myself and just ending it all. he fucking exploded on me when i said that. instead of comforting me, or anything, he went “do you care how i feel? i don’t think you do at all.” and a lot of other hurtful things, and i didnt get an ‘i love you’ until i told him to leave me alone and just not talk to me for a bit. i couldn’t understand. sometimes he’s just so absorbed into himself and acts as if no ones problems are as bad as his and he doesn’t care, and he’ll try to bring himself into the problems. i’ve seen him doing this with his friends who struggle with bad home lives / mental issues as well and he has nothing to say but like “oof.”
and for the first time i think it was done to me.

he tells me all the time of how he feels worthless, and how he’s not worthy of me, our relationship, life and that he’s a shitty boyfriend and he’ll never be able to make me happy. i am so far away from him, and i feel so helpless. i want to help him so so badly but the distance between us is straining me from being able to do so. i’ve thought about reaching out to SOMEONE that he knows in real life but he told me before that no one knows he wants to die besides me. it fucking breaks my heart. 

that’s another thing. he’s suicidal. about a month ago, he told me he wished i and his family didn’t care so if he died, he would have nothing to lose. he’s been struggling in school lately and i know it’s been hard on him, he doesn’t take easy classes. but lately i’ve been trying to address things in our relationship that have gone down lately. for example, the lack of effort &amp; attention from the relationship. he has told me before that he knows i’m always there and he knows that but he feels like he never is there. it’s long distance, and i know its harder but it wasn’t always like this. everytime i feel like i talk about it, i try to be as nice as possible. but it just turns into him letting out all of his insecurities, getting very very upset, crying, and telling me how he wishes he was dead and that he just wants to kill himself. if i pose the question of, “what about me?” he’ll say, “what about you?” and then he’ll go on to say that if he killed himself it would be a stress reliever for me. but then he’ll say something completely different like, “if i was going to kill myself i’d tell you” and “if it wasn’t for you, i wouldn’t be alive and that’s the reason i’m staying alive. i could never put you through that. it would change your life forever.”

whenever he talks about killing himself, or death, i get so scared and worried. i feel like i can never stop talking to him and i freak out and tell him not to do anything to himself or hurt himself. sometimes he’s really nice about it and other times he tells me to shut up and told me he’s promised me that he wouldn’t do such a thing.. then i just let him be. i’ve explained to him why i worry, and he still thinks i have no need to. like? it’s just instinct. i can’t not care about someone i love. i stick by his side through it all and i just want wants best for him, and i would do anything to take away or fix the pain he has.

i know i’m not supposed to be saving my boyfriend, but i do love him and i want the best for him. but i feel helpless and i don’t know what else more to do as a girlfriend. it is so fucking difficult. i am truly struggling.

tl;dr: ldr boyfriend is struggling with mental health issues and i am running out of things to do as a girlfriend and i am starting to feel helpless and like i can’t do anything for him. ",06Oct2018,1
