I wanna make this short so I’ll just say that for most my adult life (I’m 35) I’ve suffered anxiety and OCD tendencies. I’ve had panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, health anxiety, agoraphobia, you name it, I’ve had it. 

I’m in a really good point in my life now, career looking good (Phd researcher in psychology), good relationship, etc etc.

After worrying and panicking about a range of things, I started to come to terms with everything. Last Friday actually was awesome. I went to yoga, started to come to terms with my most recent worry (tinnitus) and thought things were turning around. However, during the relaxation I just suddenly panicked about the fact that I was thinking. The fact my mind was existing and that if I wanted to I could become obsessed with just that mere fact. That I was aware. I started panicking during the relaxation, hyper aware of the fact I’m trapped in my own skull and that I can be obsessed about the fact thoughts were occurring. I feel trapped and scared. Obsessively worrying about the fact that I can think. That I may be stuck in this forever. That I’m the only one and that I’ve accidentally broken through a wall that humans were never meant to do. Kind of like being super aware of the fact I’m thinking thoughts and that I’ll always be obsessively tied to re-thinking and thinking again. Stuck in the present moment forever, like a slow deep repetitive  tug from a chain at the bottom of a Loch. 

I can’t even explain it properly. I sound mad I know. But have any of you experienced this obsessive thought pattern? And if so, how do you deal with it? Best way I can describe it is the fact of being able to think is terrifying. I’m afraid to go to bed because I don’t want the silence and my own thoughts about thinking to make me go mad. 

Anyway , thanks for listening.

4,"I have depression, anxiety, OCD and panic attacks. I can pretty much keep my demons at bay while holding down a full-time and very demanding job. I can stay on top of my bills and keep my apartment clean. I can take good care of my cat. Basically, I have adulting down. However, I can't seem to do what most other adults do. I look at them and think ""Damn, how do you have the energy to XYZ? I can barely minimally function."" I'm talking about things like having energy, doing their hair nicely and make-up daily, running errands after work, cooking for a family after work.... it's just very very hard for me to do any of those kinds of things that most adults seem to do effortlessly.

6,I just saw a commercial featuring Olympic gold medalist swimmer Michael Phelps. He talked about how he was such a finely tuned athlete so I wasn't sure where he going and then he reveals he struggles with depression. I couldn't help but thinking that it was heartbreaking that pharmaceutical companies are using celebrities to peddle their drugs. To my utter amazement at the end of what I thought to be a commerical was more of a public service announcement for talk therapy. It's about time. I'm so thankful to him for using his celebrity for a good cause because I'm certain the are so many people who look at him and think his life must be perfect. It shows that any one of us can struggle and that it's okay to get help. ,20Jun2018,3,
7,"Hey guys, how are you?

I'm two months without ADs (which I took for OCD) and feel depressed as I wasn't before the meds. It's tough, but I'm hopeful that my brain will recover to its previous state.

Also, I am 6 months off weed: panic attacks and bad trips made me decide to keep off at least for a while. But I really miss MJ, not to cope or to use everyday, but to smoke once in a while with my friends, or to play some game in my home. Weed is the only thing that helped me with my shitty libido (I tried so many things) and it also made me feel so happy and alive.

Today I don't smoke because 1-) maybe its too soon because of the meds withdrawal or brain recovery; 2-) I developed a new kind of fear: fear of schizophrenia, triggered by smoking. My OCD is making me anxious and I guess that I would test myself mentally while high, checking for voices or stuff... this is my ocd challenging myself for having the ultimate comfort once I find that weed means no harm, if its the case. Problem is: seems that my grandfather had schizo in the past and went delusional to a psych ward. My parent say he was hearing voices in the past, but not nowadays... that is strange.

It's important to state that my weed bad trips took a spiritual side because of the context I was envolved by the time (an occultist friend, listening to Tool, and other things). Example: I became very scared about a really strange and meaningful coincidence that happened to me, kinda pointing me to NOT do something that I like... maybe what they call a synchronicity. The point is: I started giving credit to those kinds of things, making questions about religions and spirituality, wanting to know the truth and if that 'sign' could somehow harm me if I didn't follow it. I don't know if I can be considered delusional for this, to me its only natural to have this fears and metaphysical questions when messing with the occult and having some strange episodes in life.

So... the point is: to try start smoking again once in a while, without the frustration of feeling prohibited FOR LIFE for something I liked; or to abandon weed forever because I have more than enough reasons?

What do you think? Can you share your experiences on weed with me?

9,"“I balanced all, brought all to mind, 
the years to come seemed a waste of breath, 
a waste of breath the years behind, in balance with this life, this death.” 
– William Butler Yeats

This quote is so depressing. Yeats was looking at all of his life trying to weigh it in the balance.  He compared every year of the past to every year of the future. He saw no balance was achieved, and his life seemed such a waste.  

Perhaps pondering whether or not the years of a whole life are in balance is a preposterous effort.  But don’t we humans often wonder whether or not our whole life is in balance?

Balancing it all is impossible. Balancing it all is impossible.  I said it again just in case you missed it. Even if you are trying to balance only all the activities in a day, this cannot be done to a soul’s satisfaction - only to a soul’s empty want. 

This is what caused Yeats’ consternation. The sum of days, turned to the sum of years.  All that was done before and left to be done could not be balanced. This is because balance isn’t about external happenings or activities. Too many times we confuse balance with a balancing act, like juggling. Balance is not an act.

Balance is a state of being.

Balance is symmetry, poise, and equity.

Balance is the epicenter of opposing forces. 

Balance is not an act. 

Balance is an art. 

Living a life in balance is an art form to which I am just a novice.  - Excerpt from Well by Alias In Town

12,"For-fucking-finally I managed to get a spot in my city's subsidized psychiatric clinic. It's been an absolute shitshow trying to do so for the last 3 weeks.

 \- The first time I went, I sat for 2 hours and was seen for a \*\*screening\*\*. I got through the entire screening interview, but unfortunately since my job contract officially ended the day before, they wouldn't accept my financial paperwork. So they told me I would need to come back with it a different day.

 \- When I came back 2 days later, they put me in the queue to finish the screening process. However, after waiting in the fucking office for an hour and a half, they told me that the queue was too backed up and that I would need to come back in a week. I was there well within the time they told me we could come to do the screening; it wasn't like I showed up close to the end. I was more than pissed that they pretty much wasted my time with that bullcrap.

 \- When I came back the next week, I show up at 8 in the morning on a Monday. Oopsie. Numerous people at the office got sick and so no one could do the screening nor the financial paperwork. Come back in a few days and call beforehand to make sure everyone is there before I come (which is not something you typically think you'd have to do).

 \- I give them a few days and decide to call beforehand at 11 AM on Thursday. Apparently the lady doing financials was leaving early that day (really?), so I would have to wait until the following week.

The following week came, and I finally got through the screening process, the intake interview and the financial review!!! Say hooray! It only took from 8 AM to effing 12 PM...

\---------------------------------------------------------

But some of the policies they went over seemed a little... dehumanizing in a sense. For one, they told me that each visit would \*require\* a urinalysis before you can even see the psychiatrist. This applies to everyone. The clinic I'm trying to get into is a low-income clinic, and I'm guessing the low-income demographic is also incredibly high risk for drug abuse. They told me it's not to necessarily check to see if people are doing drugs, but rather to see if people are taking their medication. It still seems a little over-the-top in some respects and I'm not sure I'm completely comfortable with that.

And then, they told me they'd be taking my photo as well to make sure the person they're treating is the right person. Apparently a photo ID doesn't suffice for this.

And as well, the main reason I was trying to apply for the clinic was because while I have insurance through my parents, my ""specialist copay"" is absurd at $65 a visit. My caseworker this morning told me that I would still be required to fulfill the copay at the clinic. So the whole thing I was trying to avoid with this I'm still going to have to do. Now, granted they claim their practice runs on a ""Pay what you can"" philosophy, but those costs are still going to rack up.

\---------------------------------------------------

The clinic got me an appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow (which is very convenient I guess), but I am not even sure if I want to go through with seeking help from them if I'm going to be placed under all this scrutiny... I'm just concerned the whole process is going to be emotionally taxing to have to go through that every time I have to go there. Is it even genuinely worth all the extra steps?",20Jun2018,1,

14,"I've been with my boyfriend for about a 1.5 years and he's been depressed and suicidal most of the time - and I think most of his life.

He won't seek treatment and doesn't have health insurance or any money. I've tried to sign him up for health care, but he just won't fill out the forms, and doesn't want to talk about. So no therapy or medication, currently.

Background I guess: Within our first eight months, I found three suicide letters on separate occasions around my bedroom (he was homeless and living with me, leaving his stuff everywhere). One he had written after a fight we had, and it was addressed to me, saying it was my fault that he killed himself. He was also deep into a heroin and meth addiction and hearing voices telling him to die, telling him I was cheating on him, family members berating him. He would hear voices talking about his dad who had killed himself when my boyfriend was a kid.

After many unsuccessful attempts to get him to quit heroin, I moved across the country back to my hometown because I just couldn't take it anymore. He doesn't really have anyone other than me so he followed me out here and quit drugs, for the most part.

Since then, the paranoia and the louder voices went away and he got a job and an apartment, but he seems if anything more depressed now. He told me recently that he attempted suicide about a month ago. I had no idea. 

He also still gets extremely upset about me seeing friends without him, and about not spending enough time with him, being with my family too much.  I'm sick of giving up time with people I love in order to avoid his freak-outs. A lot of the time, I have fun with him, but he has this allover cynicism and kind of selfish way of asking more and more from me that makes me just want to break up. He tells me that if I do break up with him he'll ""probably"" kill himself. I love him and I do everything I can to help him but I'm also 24 (he's 33) and I never intended on being emotionally and financially responsible for him. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation on either of our ends, I would love to hear your perspective. 

By the way, I know I did not paint my boyfriend in a great light, so just a note that he does have definite redeeming qualities EX. charmer of animals, makes me amazing breakfast, etc.!

\*\*TLDR; I want my boyfriend to be stable with and without me, and for the suicide threats and dependency to stop.

So sorry for the length of this post!! Thanks for reading.",20Jun2018,2,
15,"Hello,


I have an interesting topic I need to vent about because I am a lonely bitch. So, I'm 18 years old, I got married to my husband in September of 2017, he has leukemia. I knew what I was getting myself into but it really puts a stress on my mental health that he's going to die somewhat young. I know it's more about him than me and I need to support him, but I am miserable thinking about him not being able to be with me to grow old. I know, how could I know for sure he'll die young? Of course I don't, he doesn't do everything to make sure it doesn't come back, like taking certain oral medication he needs. I love him so much, he's my whole world. I'm also severely mentally ill. I truly believe that if he dies young, I wont be able to handle it and I'll end up killing myself or relapsing self harming to a severe state. I'm terrified of myself and what I am and who I am, but I don't want help. I'd rather bathe in my darkness than the and rid of it because I've given up and I see no future for my mental health, but I'm okay because I feel like this is what I am, no matter how awful I am.

My general worrying about everything never ends to the point it's a burden. I've always had a bruxism of sorts, issues with perpetual bitch-face grimacing, excessive cussing when stressed, sour disposition, negative thought loops, etc.

What can cause this?  Depression?  Aspergers (disconnect with self)? ADD (hindrance to initiate things I need to)?

A regimen of St Johns Wort with 5-HTP seems to help with me wanting to crumple into a ball when I'm experiencing stress, handle hits to my ego without wanting to die, and generally weather the daily beating that is life notably better.

#1 personal growth, was present first as far as I can remember. From k-4th grade I wasn’t one of the smart kids. I didn’t try and I had zero motivation to excel. In 5th grade my two best friends were both top students, and I started to feel stupid for not wanting to learn. In an attempt to prove myself I made it my goal to get A’s/B’s and try out for the academic team; I accomplished both. I don’t think my parents knew I wasn’t trying at school until then. Well sixth grade and middle school came along and I had two conflicting ideologies guiding me. My proud parents had higher expectations of me going into middle school; All I wanted to do was prove I’m smart once, then go back to skating by just because I can. Then came the 4.5wk dance... 6-11th grade went like this: 

August-School starts

Fall 4.5wk midterm- Have a C, grounded until 9wk report card

December- 9wk Semester Report card has A’s/B’s so it doesn’t affect my Christmas

Spring 4.5week midterm-Have a C, grounded until 9wk report card

May- school ends and I have A’/B’s just in time for summer 

I did this same pattern, on the same schedule, for half of my childhood education. I showed the same pattern in sports as well. As a kid I didn’t understand my emotions so I thought my good days were just that. Now I see it was really a lack of motivation. It started young and spread its way through my life. I only felt the need to prove something to myself. I didn’t need to get A’s/B’s because I know I can, idc if my grades show it. In soccer I tried enough to prove I was one of the three best players, that was enough for me. I already knew I could be one of the best players on the field when I wanted to be so I turned it on when I felt like it. I just did enough to be respected.  At 21 I joined the military and followed a similar pattern with my career. Proving I can be the best at my job when I felt like it. The only time I truly tried was when I had to, deployment. This lack of motivation has hindered my personal growth my entire life. I’ve been walking two steps forward, one step back my entire life. I feel like I’m half the person I should be. 


#2, physical condition didn’t start until 9th grade. I got into weight lifting freshman year and did it all year until I graduated. I was 5’8, 100lbs wet coming into high school. I left 6’4 180. Still pretty thin but I’d gained 70lbs in four years. Throughout high school I would gain weight in the fall semester and lose 60-70% of it by the next fall. Back then I could blame soccer and swimming because they’re aerobic sports. After high school I followed the same pattern until I was 21. From 21-24 I was forced to exercise for the military. I didn’t take care of my body well though so my health suffered. I was 6’4 170lbs, my body was barely surviving the first year and a half. I drank heavily every weekend, hardly ate, drank sugar free monsters and coffee almost exclusively, dipped, smoked, and only drank water if necessary. I knew I was in bad shape when I noticed small cuts on my hands for over a month. I was malnourished, my body was having trouble healing itself. I got my shit together and I quit drinking the 6 weeks before deployment. I flipped a switch and I lifted and ate non-stop and came home 6’4 192. That was the heaviest I’d ever been. That was two years ago this month, and I haven’t worked out consistently in 14months. My alcohol/drug abuse trended like everything else until late 2016. Breaking the trend was easy physically while difficult emotionally. I gave up on exercise and my drinking was almost at its worst. This downward spiral continued past the 5month norm and  carried on 14months. 

#3 mental health, dictates everything. Growing up I didn’t understand depression and anxiety, I blindly carried on until 17 and had a wave of sadness backed up 2+ years hit me the summer before 12th grade. I went through the fall semester knowing I was depressed but still didn’t understand. By 20 I learned how to control my emotions and bury the feelings. I put myself in that mindset until I broke the trend in 2017. I sought out mental healthcare and set off a chain reaction throughout my life. I did counseling my last year in the service, and received the anti-depressant, Zoloft. That helped with the anxiety and depression, but there was an underlying issue. I mentioned to the psychiatrist on post about having trouble focusing and my wife’s complaints about me never sitting still and talking non-stop. Doc prescribed me Wellbutrin to help with focus, and that my anxiety isn’t stemming from ADD. I used this combination of medications for a year, and I never felt like I was fixing the problem but rather keeping it at bay. 

In the months leading up to coming home I frequently dissected my life to better understand what led me to be. I thought of every problem in my life and many related to self-loathing. I didn’t achieve things because I stood in my own way and I resented myself for it. Self-loathing wasn’t my problem either though. I thought about why I did the things that caused me to hate myself, and the thing that came to mind was, “I can, but I can’t.”  I was at odds with my own mind. I had the power to break through the haze but I didn’t know how to use it. I started reading up on ADD and tried to relate the symptoms to my life; several were spot on me. A month later I got diagnosed and prescribed medication, and I have never seen life more clearly. In conjunction with my Zoloft, Adderall is helping me help myself. I’m slowly breaking free from the grip of alcohol, and my mood is overall good. Life is always stressful but I mitigate a lot of stress by controlling the things I can. ",20Jun2018,2,
39,"I don't mean being physically homeless--but emotionally, as in having no one or nowhere you feel 100% comfortable or close with.

This is helping me in addition to my medications and don't stop listening to your doctors or therapist. This is not a replacement for therapy or medicine. I cannot stress that enough.

So now that we have that covered what is helps me so much is essential oils. I am so happy because they're actually helping me. Now I also have to say that you have to use them correctly so you have to do research. A lot of research. I would say reach out to someone who already knows about essential oils and ask them about it. Make sure they are a trusted source. Don't just put an essential oil on your skin because that could be very dangerous. You need a carrier oil. That's just one example. And don't ever ingest them Don't ever eat them.

With proper use essential oils can be very helpful. I'm not here to promote a company. So pick whatever company you want. Like I said just do your research. And use them properly.

so I just wanted to share this with you because I know a lot of people struggle so much and there's a lot of suffering and this has helped me so I want to pass it along so it can help you.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am not an expert. I am very new to essential oils so don't use me as an expert source. I can answer some very basic questions but beyond that I'm useless. 

Let me know what you think of this. If you had any experiences with essential oils already let me know how that went.

Mhm. Great idea, indeed. She ended up on the r/BPDlovedones (emphasis on ""loved ones"") page and came back near tears, feeling pity for me for having to go through all this and being labeled a sociopath. She told me that she loved me anyways (ha!) but she never knew that this was such a horrible thing and that I possibly should keep it a secret. What? Yes, BPD sucks, I'm not happy with it, I'm not going to run around telling people about it, but why should anyone be concerned about my disorder?

So I looked it up (big mistake) and went through some posts. Needless to say, I broke down crying in anger, cause what the hell? Going by the name of ***loved ones*** and advising everyone that they should stay away from us and break all contact, cause we're monsters? Constantly going on about how they'll find someone ""worthy"" of them, cause BDP people are ""not deserving of love"" in general???

Ehh. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I just really need to vent I guess. Sorry if this triggers you in any way, if you have bad experiences with BPD people, but we're not all the same! Don't put as all in the ""not worth it"" box.",20Jun2018,10,
50,"I started therapy a couple of weeks ago. My therapist asked me to do the following exercise: To write down something that was good, or a moment where I felt content or well, every day.

He said this exercise is supposed to help me pay more attention to the positive things in life. I am in therapy for my current anxiety and past depression.

However, I struggle with this a lot. I have started trying to really pay attention and look for the small positive moments/feelings in a day. Usually, there are none. Most of the time I find myself feeling neutral, tired, annoyed, anxious or stressed about something. I don't really look forward to anything in particular. I don't think my life is completely bad, but I don't really like it either.

Sometimes when I tell him this, we do the exercise during the session. I tell him what I did that day/week and he helps me ""look for something good"". Usually, something that objectively sounds like some kind of success (I exercised! I got a good grade!) ends up being the thing we settle on. But these things don't actually make me feel much of a positive feeling, so I don't really think that they count. I don't think this exercise is helping me at all, but I wish it did.

I’ve never been able to tell the secret

I will tell you
Because you won’t know who I am

But that doesn’t change that it was wrong
That he was wrong 

I should have told

How he slipped into my bed
While he thought I was asleep

I couldn’t tell

I would ruin their marriage 
They would blame each other

For never noticing 
For not paying attention 
For the loss of innocence of their only daughter at age 4

Fighting him off
But no ones there

I have to trick myself into sleep
With whatever makes me pass out
I have a problem 
I need help

I’ve tried to get help
Called all the numbers
Went to the doctors 
Spoke to counsellors

I’m trying to be better 
To get better

I also suffer from several issues, but i'll spare the details. I have no way of answering these questions. All i can do is get her to a therapist, but she doesn't trust them and can't formulate anything properly to them. 

I'm asking for any answers, advice anything. It tears me apart to see her like this and more so when I stand here like a brick unable to say anything.

58,"Maybe it's wise to mention that in our last meeting before her vacation she said she isn't a real shrink yet. Looking back at it, I am not sure whether or not she was joking because I am shit at recognizing sarcasm so idek what to think about anything she said anymore...  


I found a free centre for mental health so I applied to see a psychologist.     
  The three main things I talked about were:  


\- my abusive nmom  
\- my crippling insecurity  
\- my episodes of strong apathy  


1) The abusive mother 

  
   She couldn't accept that I don't love my mother even though I told her that she is abusive and that it would genuinely greatly benefit me and make me happy if she disappeared from my life one way or another. I admitted I am grateful for the objective things she did as a parent by taking care of me, but she is just so toxic and abusive as a person that we just don't work together at all. She told me I had some ""repressed feelings"" about her. I told her I acknowledge the fact that I may have some biological attachment to her because I have lived with her for 21 years, but so do many people who lived with abusers. She also told me that the best thing to do is to love and accept her for who she is. I told her that I can accept that she will never change, but I will never love her because she is **an abuser**.      
     
   I mentioned to her many times that she has both physically and mentally abused me throughout my life. No way is hell will I ever forgive how much she fucked me up nor forget that. I'm not freaking Jesus. I know I technically can, but I don't want to simply because I don't think abusers deserve any respect and I also don't think respect is just blindly given, it's earned. I think she was also a bit dumbfounded when I told her that I learned that family by blood doesn't mean anything to me and that I don't care who someone is, my mom, the president or the pope. If they treat me like shit, I will not respect that. I choose who my family is and my friends have been more supportive and loving toward me than my own family most of the time.  

  
   I think emotions got in her way maybe because she seemed like she couldn't fathom the fact that somebody can not love family. To a degree I can understand that she doesn't completely understand, but ffs she is supposed to be the shrink here.  

  
   I am happiest without my mother. When she comes back from her bussiness trips, I feel depressed again. I just thought that it was common sense, especially for a therapist, to know that sometimes you can't fix things and it's time to leave. Which is what I am primarily planning on doing once I gain financial independence.  

  
2) Insecurity  

  
   I am extremely insecure about myself about most things. I worry about small stuff alot and it is bothering me more and more. Like, I don't want to work a job that involves talking to people because I'm scared of it, I can't handle stress or pressure at all, I often feel extreme anxiety about stupid things my brain won't let me be cool about. So whenever a job is asking for someone ""communicative, improvising, quick-thinking, charismatic, social etc."" it just instantly scares me and I move on.  

  
   I have applied for a digital art course this summer and on the first period we had to introduce ourselves and talk about our motivation for this course and yadda yadda. I actually had alot to say, but when it was my turn, I completely froze. I managed to utter something very brief and vague and I could actually feel my throat tremble. I felt like I was going to have some sort of attack and that I should leave the room. None of this was visible on the outside, but inside I was panicking immensely for no reason at all. I managed to calm down somehow. Another example is actually happening right now. Our course is nearing to an end and we are required to write an evaluation on it. However, we need to write it in our dropbox group so everyone can see what each person wrote. I have some major complaints about the teacher, but I dread of making it public that I have those opinions to the point where I just won't do it unless we're gonna be presented with an anonymous option. I know he's a professional or whatnot but I just couldn't handle the confrontation, I don't want to do it. It can't be normal that I'm this scared and insecure about almost everything. Her solution every time I brought it up was basically ""It's all in your head and you have to get over it."" Nothing that really helped. She didn't go any deeper into it either despite what I've told her.  

  
3) Apathy

This one I discussed with a friend who is also 	seeing a shrink and it was handled almost the same way as my anxiety 	problem. I told her several times I get these extreme episodes of 	apathy where I can't put myself to work at all. Sometimes I don't 	even do very important things for college because of it and it even 	applies to things I actually like doing. I don't expect her to 	instantly diagnose me with something and put me on meds, but she 	kinda always concluded it with how I have to find a way to motivate 	myself through this and that and to think about the reward and the 	future. I know the reward. That's the problem. I kept bringing it up 	as a very strong blockage that keeps holding me back no matter what, 	but she barely brushed over it. My friend summarized it well:  


""I 	can't find a way to motivate myself.""  


""Find a way 	to motivate yourself!""   

  
""...""  


So anyway, she didn't help... alot. I'm thinking of asking for a different shrink.Maybe I expected too much from a free service? Or maybe it's partly my fault for not being able to express and describe my emotions well? ",20Jun2018,1,
59,"So it's come to my attention that when someone mentions I act as if I have a certain mental disorder or problem, I look it up and automatically assume I do because I can relate to a few of the symptoms. I know this is hypochondria, but I wanted to know if there was a different version of it? For example, if I read something about a disorder, not only do I think I have it, but others recognize that I start to act more like I do have it. I can't give a lot of examples, but I think misophonia is one. Once I read about it, I felt like I had misophonia, and I have started to notice that I become more irritated to certain sounds than I had been before I learned about it. I'm not really sure how to put this into words, I'm sorry.

I looked into it and it may fit me, but then again, those traits are what I believed to be normal for everyone. The ones I don't share with your common sociopath are;

They enjoy inflicting pain on others either physically or mentally. I don't.

They feel no shame. I do.

They don't have delusional, crazy or abstract thoughts. My thoughts are always wild.

They don't get nervous. I shake when I'm nervous. 

They love no one. I love my family.

62,"I usually don't like asking for advice, but I've been feeling pretty low lately and I need it. I would talk to people in real life, but I don't like talking negatively about my relationship to family and friends. I may forgive and forget in the future but they don't. 

Without further ado, my mental illness has been literally destroying my relationship. I have BPD, Anxiety, and an eating disorder. My boyfriend deals with the latter pretty well. I can always come to him while having a panic attack and he supports me eating healthily but enough. With his help, I eat four times a day now and I also haven't self harmed or purged in six months. The BPD has been more of a problem. I have mood-swings that make me either extremely loud and reckless or mean and gloomy. I always try to retreat to myself but he inevitably follows. He'd supposedly rather ""I hurt him than myself"". I personally think that's sweet but ultimately stupid and reserve to myself anyway. It's been working that way for a while. 

The problem is that throughout our three year relationship, I also compulsively lied. It was about little things. Sometimes I'd say I'd gone on a walk when I really stayed at home, or pretend my friend had blue eyes when they were really brown. I actually tried going to a therapist once and lied to him about how I felt to make everything seem better than it was. I felt bad saying that I really didn't feel any better so I lied to make him feel accomplished, I guess. Then I decided I needed a change.  I started to come clean about old lies I'd told while apologizing for each one. I also caught myself in the minutes after telling a present lie and apologized following it with the truth. I've been doing so since the beginning of June. 

On Monday he told me that he didn't see a future with me anymore and that the trust has been destroyed indefinitely. I'm sure that he hates me now. I just really care about him and I don't know what to do. We're long distance and now he keeps insinuating that I'm cheating on him. I promise I never did. What makes it worse is that I've been working on a gift for him. I put so much work into it so that I could give a final apology. I don't think he even wants to see me anymore. I don't know what to do. I haven't gotten out of bed since then. Is there anything I can do?",20Jun2018,2,

When I was 12 I was watching gay porn and I think is subconsciously put me under stress for some reason because I feared my adoptive parents catching watching gay porn and getting caught and my parents were kinda homophobic around this time and I just feared it would be so much drama but around this time I started urges to hit people who appeared to be nice to me and it’s like I was hearing a little voice saying to me to do it anyways It went away like the next week cause it freaked me out but yeah can anyway tell me what this was?

67,"Hi all. &lt;context&gt; I struggle with depression and anxiety after an emotional/sexually abusive marriage I left a year ago. I take a low dose of lexapro and klonopin that have helped a lot with mood swings and psychosomatic symptoms. &lt;/context&gt;

At a point during my marriage I was so overwhelmed I sort of wanted to escape everything. I didn't wanna die, I just wanted to escape. So I kept having thoughts about idk.. jumping in front of the train. Kinda like a curious flash in my mind as the train arrived to the station. But it's not like -how my counselor says- I had ""made a plan"". One day something ugly was happening and I locked myself in the bathroom and thought of drinking the whole mouthwash bottle. Figured I'd make it out of there in an ambulance.

Forward a year, today,  I'm in a much better place. However I've had a rough month, responsibilities piled up and anxiety/stressed piled up too. ""Thoughts"" are coming back. I'm two blocks away from the Michigan. ""jump off the bridge"" pops in my mind. Nevermind that drowning would be a horrible death if it came down to that.

Again I don't FEEL like I wanna die (also I always consider how that would DESTROYYYYY my family, I don't wanna cause them that suffering), I just need a break, but I can't just drop my job (I live abroad alone) and go to my homecountry to my parents or things like that. So I resort to a train of thought within the lines of ""maybe if I hurt myself enough so that I can spend a couple weeks at the hospital and can just lay down all day and look at the ceiling and relax"".   

Any advice? I meditate 10 minutes everyday w/guided Headspace for anxiety. I stopped working out, it's been a struggle going lately (I do martial arts and lately I just feel like I go and just get punched around and my body feels weak like an old lady's).

For the past two and a half weeks, I’ve woken up two or three times each night. I’m terribly fucking tired and at times I feel like I’m not even alive when getting through my day. I’ve been able to squeeze in some naps in between things throughout the day, but I just need my 7-8 hours again. I’ve tried stretching, going to bed early, doing light exercise before bed and even forcing myself to stay awake, but I keep waking up in the middle of the night with very achy legs and in a panic. I have no nutritional deficiencies and I’m pretty healthy and active. 

Will this eventually go away? I went through something similar like this for a week, but never this long. I fear I’m going to develop some sleep disorder or that I’ll never sleep again. I already deal with anxiety and depression, and this insomnia phase is just making things worse.

74,"23/M/USA

I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem, but I'm a rising-second year law student, and I began to realize sometime over the last year that I lost my ability to focus on academia. It may be that I've just gotten lazier, or that I've lost some of my drive that I used to have, but it's getting out of hand.

I was an exceptional student back in undergrad, with my worst semester being a 3.5 GPA when I first started, then with several 3.9 GPA semesters afterwards. I knew how to work hard, but I feel like that drive and initiative are gone, and I'm worried it's beginning to negatively impact my graduate education. I had a 2.4 GPA in my first semester, and I thought I worked harder the following semester, but I got a nearly identical GPA my second semester. I recognize the competition is steeper than undergrad, but I recognize that some of the issues with my performance are internal as opposed to mere competition.  


I need to figure out what's going on and how to cope with it. I've been clinically depressed before, while in undergrad, but I've done well with managing it, and I don't believe this is my depression flaring up. As I said, it may well be that I've just gotten lazier, but looking at it objectively, with the amount of time I've spent looking into why I can't focus like I used to and the number of times I've sat down with a book and stared at it for hours to not read twenty pages makes it unlikely I just need to buckle down. 

This also worries me that I should seek some sort of cognitive assistance. I had a counselor in undergrad, but I don't know if this is the type of thing I should seek counseling for, or if this is something I should discuss with a doctor. 

Hopefully someone here in this community can help me out with this, but if not, please let me know if there's a different subreddit I should direct my problem to!",20Jun2018,3,

I’m basically everyday with her and seeing how she can’t run or cross her legs or do anything without sweating and panting, and the extreme thigh chaffing and everything disgusts me, and I really hate myself for that!

I know she is trying to lose weight by using fitness pal but she is lying to the app like it would change something!
She also doesn’t know shit about nutrition and every time I try to help her she kinda brush it and continues with her tumblr sources (you know the ones that tell you that fruit isn’t actual calories or that drinks don’t count etc etc)

And she eats a lot, and maybe you notice it but when you’re with a big eater your perceptions of what is normal (mine is already fucked up) tend to change so you gain wait more easily and that happens to me.
Im not saying it’s her fault, it’s totally on me if I have no self control, but imagine how it is to be with someone who is always eating and asking if you want some etc etc.

Tbh I really needed to vent because it’s eating me (badum tsss) me inside and I feel very very bad.

76,"I’d like to start this post by both thanking everyone who regularly posts and comments on this subreddit for their dedication and heart warming empathy as well as apologising in advance for the wall of text.

I am someone who is definitely out of the worst of it. Six months ago I survived a half hearted attempt on my own life which was surrounded with self harm, substance abuse and a complete inability to function as I used to. This motivated me to get help and certain friends/family have been fantastic in helping that and I’m more than grateful to them for exactly that. Since then I’ve taken a voluntary year out from the very high profile/pressure university that I was at and my time off has been an incredible blessing. I used to describe the 1-2 hour periods of loss of control as ‘spirals’ and those spirals have now gone from being twice a day to once a month, with the help of rest and therapy. I am beyond grateful for this and have therapy, friends and this subreddit to thank.

Yet although the past few weeks were looking for the best yet, I feel myself wobbling again. I’ve started drinking daily (mainly out of boredom since I’m working in a city where I know no one), I haven’t exercised in a long time (which was something I always stressed I’d do with my year out), my concentration is lapsing and I feel a bit on edge. I realise that these problems are absolutely insignifanct relative to my past problems/the problems a lot of people on this subreddit face daily, yet I know that personally it’s a slippery slope, and much worse could be on the horizon.

I had a panic attack after my shift a few days ago, so today I called and quit without notice, pretending I had gotten another job somewhere else. My boss was, predictably, a real jerk about it and told me I should give notice (which I know I should have), and about how I was really screwing them over, and ended the conversation with ""Well, thanks for nothing and have a wonderful day"" before slamming the phone down. I am an empath apparently too, so this is killing me because I know I'm screwing them over (they are grossly understaffed), but at the same time I had to protect my mental health I feel like.

I need insight over them.

Firstly: I was worried that I have depression, but after a lot of research, going to several psychs and psychologists I finally understood that **I don't have depression.** 

So lets talk about my last hit(several hours ago.)

Here is how it began:
A knot in the stomach appeared and the future feeling came.(Like I know the steps in life and I don't want it or/and I don't want kids and I will s if I have one etc.)
So firstly I noticed that a knot in the stomach appeared, then the meaningless future feeling appeared.(Not like the depression feeling.)

Then my mood dropped and I had a feeling like the future feeling stems from my low mood.

Then I couldn't stop thinking about the feeling, I was always aware of it and everytime I managed to distract myself it came and I got like a strike in the stomach every time.

Then a thought like 'I don't want kids' appeared connected to this future feeling and like I will s because of it. Which made my knot in the stomach raise further.

Then it got intense like I everything in my head became darker, I couldnt stop thinking about this future feeling, like it was somehow attacking me, but it felt like me.

Then I decided to slee for 20 mins. 

Then I got better and went out with friends, I went out with friends but it was still in background.

Also, I don't think it is existential crisis because I don't need a meaning and have no interest in those feelings and thoughts.

Last year i was pretty depressed, so anxious and was struggling with a lot of suicidal thoughts.

I have better ways of dealing with those problems, but at the end of the day i’m still me and i hate myself so much. I mostly just feel empty now. I’m afraid this is the ‘best’ i’ll ever get to feel and once something bad will happen, i’ll just go down again so quickly.

I recently finished my ba in game design  while studying in uni I lived with a group of people who i thought were my friend but all i end up doing with them was smoking weed and never going to a.single lecture. Whenever i told my mates i wanted to quit smoking  they would just laugh and offer me joints. If i rejected, they would be like oh you are not a real friend....
I didnt even have my own room, i shared iy with one of my mate. Most times there would be so many people that i would just end up sleeping on the sofa. One of my mate would always wake me up by singing out loud while coming inside the room and disrypt my sleep and leave the door open. If i told him to close the door he would either just ignore me or tell mw to close it myself. 
For last 3 months of my uni, i lived with my other mate so i could atleast do my project but that place was the same....weed and all and ofcourse i could not resist smoking.
I am home now, probably failed my course. As soon as i come home my parenr have my whole life figured out for me and havent even bothered asking me what i want to do next. 
I been feeling down since sometime december and now i am reaching my limit. A friend of mine(whom i shared flat with) had borrowed my bag so when i had to return home i borrowed his and i returned it last week when i went back to pick up my stuff. Just now, i received a call saying that he cannot find the bag when i know 100%  that i left the bag in his room and now i feel tensed. My heart is pounding really fast and i am feeling really down....
Toxic friend along with disfunctional family....now a days, most of  the time i feel down, stressed about my future and about the fact that people I used to call my friends are just toxic people who cannot stand me and to my knowledge i have done nothing wrong to them. I Regret about my dexision to live with such group of peoplE. I might sound a bit naive but i feel like these people hate me because i was the only one in the house who would actually worry about my study(even though i didnt do much about it). To them, i might have looked my someone who procastinates a lot and were also kind of dragging me down with them. 


So why do i think i am depressed? 
I stay up all night watching jordan Peterson's  video to make myself feel better. 
I sleep during the day time. I wake up at 12 pm and fall a sleep again at 1-3 (mostly), go to my moms shop to help her at 3:30-4:30. Come back home at sleep till 9.
I feel hungry but dont bother eating.  I have lost  like 8 kg in pasr 3 months. I used to work out, infact for about 5 years.  I dont anymore.
I get irritated/angry really fast. I yelled at my mom last week really badly which i have never done before.
Im not suicidal but i feel stressed or sad almost 80% of the day. I could be fine for sometimez but if something bad happens, i get stressed or sad the whole day.
I still do play football though which i still love but once again i get really angry(although i have managed to hold it in) if i am not playing well.
I have noticed that i forget where i left my stuff or why i went to kitchen or lounge for.
