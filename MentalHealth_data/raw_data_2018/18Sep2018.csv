0,"Severe depression and existential crisis . Does it ever get better ? What actually works? Chain smoking my days away and can hardly comprehend a paragraph of schoolwork. 

I have the severe guilt of a lifeless existence. I disappointed my parents too badly and I need guidance. The fatigue prevents me from moving. When I do have spurs of energy, anxiety cripples me from going on even walks around the block. 

Wasted money on 5htp and am extremely nervous about a psychiatrist visit Wednesday . What combo of meds has help anybody particularly with fatigue and ZERO motivation? I have had too many zero days in a row.",18Sep2018,2
1,"I'm 21 years old from the UK.

Where to start... I am happily engaged and been with my man for nearly six years.

However, over time, I have literally lost all my close friends. This is due to us growing up, people moving away, starting their own families etc.

I feel so alone, to the point I cry. My partner, on the other hand, has many friends who always call and text to meet up with him or come over to have a chat. I'm just sat in the corner of the couch ""smiling"" and trying to join in but it's not the same. They are here to see him, not me. They message him, not me.

I feel so alone.",18Sep2018,9
2,"My girlfriend has struggled with social anxiety, and depression since she was a young kid. She has gotten help, and is on medication that she’s been taking for years. However, the past few months she’s progressively gotten worse. She easily aggravated, and is struggling every single day with dark thoughts. Last week she even had a mental break down. It is hard to see her go through this and I don’t always know what to do. She is going this week to talk to someone about everything going on and get help. I know it’s a process, and I wanna be there every step of the way. Is there anything you guys know that help you while struggling? Is there anything I should be doing to help support her? How do I help? Any advise would mean a lot to me, I just want to see her get better. She means the world to me, and it’s so hard watching her go through this. Thank you.",18Sep2018,3
3,"This is something thats been bugging me, I'm 20, I have a girlfriend (22) but I have virtually no friends.
I used to have a group of friends I hung out with but they didnt like my gf due to hectic addiction problems and me venting on the drama, this inevitably led to this group of people cutting all contact with me .
Lonely, I stayed in the otherwise incredibly toxic relationship (first relationship, started when I was 17 going on 18) and pushed her to sober up from xanax, which she did, but both me and her have smoked weed on the regular for the entirety of the relationship.
Im at a point where this woman is the only person I spend time with, despite her cheating on me multiple times throughout the first year of our 'relationship'. 
Despite that I routinely stay over at her place, I've become more distant with my family (I can still talk with them, I just don't know where we stand and don't feel comfortable most of the time), who I've already been distant with already, and I don't really socialize with anyone but her.
My current relationship with my girlfriend is alright, to my knowledge she hasn't cheated on me for the past year, and I haven't cheated period. We hang out, go places, talk, joke, laugh, I care alot about her and enjoy my time with her. But at this point she wants something longterm and I have a lot of underlying anger towards her from early on that gives me doubts on whether I could do that or not.  
I have a lot of anxiety and doubt when it comes to talking to people. I feel I come off in such a way that makes people feel uncomfortable as I myself am often uncomfortable during interaction. I've gotten so used to not talking to people aside from work related stuff and mandatory CUNY class/lab group assignments. I don't really enjoy the socialization either, but inevitably I'm lonely  and I should get better and more comfortable at social interaction. I've got alot on my mind and just feel like I'm stagnating, needed to type it atleast as I'm not doing a hell of a lot of talking. Most I talk in a week is my therapy group but even that doesn't feel like it's giving me what I need, prob gonna need to address that. I feel afraid to lose more than I already have but all my options seem to point in that direction.",18Sep2018,4
4,"I believe I am emotionally numb for a pretty large portion of my life; In huge situations, like when my great grandmother died, when my friend went into a deep depression and then tried to kill herself, or after my two major accidents (I was unharmed both times), I felt nothing, and to this day for the most part I feel empty, flat, and grey most of the time. My most commonly felt emotion is anger, irritation, or frustration. Sometimes I feel nervousness or anticipation, but not as much (I've mostly  overcome all my physical fears long ago,only feeling anticipation when, say, getting a shot.  I get a little nervous around people sometimes but thats it. The two previously mentioned incidents left no sense of fear, only a bit shock, which I overcame in minutes). Sometimes, vary rarely, I feel tiny flickers of what I think is happiness that vanishes as soon as I become aware of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in terms of Sadness- I have felt this the most rarely of all, especially in regards to events that should have left me really sad and upset, particularly recently.  In fact, I think a lot of negative thoughts about my self, but with no sadness or any emotion attached to them- thoughts like ""I bet they hate you"" ""You're worth less"" ""You should die"" and even ""You should starve your self"" or ""Maybe we should cut""  Sometimes when I'm caught by surprise by a hurtful comment I feel a small flash or hurt, but that fades away very quickly (before i realized i was numb, i would squash it out if it stayed longer than a few seconds). However, recently when I became aware, I felt faint pangs of inexplicable sadness that I was not really feeling? It felt more like the emotion was on one side of a glass wall, and i was faintly sensing it from the other side; similarly, with happiness, it feels like it is bubbling up from a small crack that was then abruptly sealed. Incidents of these emotions, with the exception of irritation, are rare and have space in between each; mostly, I only feel that grey, flat, blank feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what my next course of action should be, and I'm not entirely sure what will happen if my break down and remove the numbness, either. Thoughts? ",18Sep2018,2
6,"I hate to admit this, but ever since I  have acknowledged that I am suffering from Pyromania (which isn't the end of the world, mind you!), I have been having seriously dark thoughts. I had already written about how in 2015 I had tried to commit suicide twice, almost succeeded both times, and was hospitalized both times. I got out that last time and things were better for a while. Then this started coming to the surface, and things have got to hell in a handbasket.

&amp;#x200B;

 In fact, now that I think about it, I had seen signs way back in 2016 when I first started playing a certain game from Steam. It is my favorite game ever, and I wouldn't say that the game was the absolute trigger for my disorder coming out. I have been playing it almost 2 years solid now with no problems (Just a deep fascination of and deep attraction to the character who uses a flamethrower as a weapon) so that wasn't it.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to self-harm and I have the scars all up and down my arms to prove it. I thought I had stopped that behavior and gotten past it, but now that everything is coming up like this, I actually self-harmed again. It brought back all the memories and the pleasure I got from it was immense. I had to stop myself though because I don't want that to become an addiction again. Still...the pain was like an old friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually thought of suicide for the first time in 2-1/2 years. To make things worse, I was told that the place where my Psychiatrist doesn't have any Therapists that take my insurance. I have to go back to the crappy counselling center where one of the therapists had told me (I was in the dark days of my Anorexia Nervosa, mind you) that ""oh, you could stand to lose a few more pounds! You are not that thin yet!"" Who the hell SAYS THAT to someone who has a history of an Eating Disorder? It is all in my chart ffs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I will act on these suicidal feelings. I really don't want to die, but I hate myself more than I have hated myself in a long long time.I feel like I am lost and I feel like a piece of shit right now. I know I have 5 kids (one in college) that depend on me. I can't do anything without thinking about them, and as selfish as it is going to sound...I resent that at times. I am tired of people throwing it up in my face. I can't even heal myself because I have to think of them. I love them with all my heart, and typing that really made me feel awful (more awful than I already felt) and very guilty for being so selfish. :'(   


I am crying as I type this. I don't even have the strength to go burn something right now. The urges are quiet, as they usually do get around this time of the night (it is almost 10 pm here) because I am sick of thinking about it and I am sick of myself.   


Help. I don't want to hurt myself, but I feel dangerously close to self-harming again. :( I don't want to be thrown back into the hospital either! My hubby would leave me for sure. He works and I am the only one who can be home with the kids. We have no family or friends nearby. Help?",18Sep2018,2
7,I have major depressive disorder as well as Pmdd. I am obsessed with suicide. Like I'm not exactly afraid of committing suicide - I have constant urges to do so and that makes me feel better when I'm down. I think about it constantly. Should I be concerned about this?...,18Sep2018,2
8,"So 2 years ago I have left a dream job as a marketing executive for 5 years to join my friends in another company as sales executive.

This is a bad move as I was asked to leave after a year because of bias issues from my boss against me from another sales rep.

Now I joined a new job which is closest to my previous job which is in the toy industry as sales &amp; marketing. But my current boss is very unreasonable towards her retail staffs/interns and just forced me to do something I really have no skills for yesterday.

I admit I am very bad at doing sales related stuffs but I excel at marketing. But I was previous dealing with toys such as action figure or sorts but now I'm in a kick scooter line.

I know what I'm doing but it seems that I am bad at it, I have often thought of leaving my job and join another toy company by doing retail sales or a product merchandiser.

I have the habit of spending more than my budget on stuffs which I don't really need to de-stress, this isn't helpful at all since I am still trying to clear my student loan.

I am feeling so weird and down recently, I kept having the thoughts of shaving my hair to start a new. But this would'n't change a thing.

Should I take a massive pay cut to go for a more humble job?

I believe I lost my friends because I was let go from my previous company that my friend introduced me to. They have not contacted me ever since.

9,"I used to be depressed a long time back, but I found a fix pretty quickly so I'm no longer depressed.

The fix was basically just living with it and saying 'this is fine', my problems weren't as bad as other people. This was effective for literally everything that happened in my life, it was awesome.

Trouble is, I recently entered Uni and actually want to be social and make friends and drink and shit. I can't. It makes me feel empty and sad being alone, but it's how I've always been, so I've adapted to liking it in a way? I try to make myself more depressed, like I get off of it. I enjoy making myself suffer more and excluded more. I intentionally cut off contact with people I want to be friends with, I deliberately piss people off sometimes just so I can be more alone and depressed. I don't want to be like this, and I fucking hate it when I do this. I really don't want to do this, but I can't stop doing it cause part of my brain seeks some kind of pleasure in it. I don't want to live like this anymore, I just want to have proper friends and hang out and stuff. Please, I want to fucking tell someone but I can't cause the part of me that likes it prevents me from telling anyone cause that means I'll stop doing it. I fucking hate it, but I keep doing it.

10,"This might be iamverysmart material but I don't care. I consider myself on the whole to be fairly intelligent, and I do quite well in school. But that's not important at all, because being intelligent doesn't make me happy.

All my ""curiosity"" gets me is just advanced knowledge about how truly horrific the world is, how much suffering there is. I keep absorbing more information about all the murders and rapes and atrocities we keep committing, it makes me feel completely hopeless about the state of humanity. It almost makes me feel like happiness is a sin, that humanity doesn't deserve happiness anymore.

Like just today I was browsing Reddit and I came across the story of someone who was stuck in solitary confinement for a year and is permanently traumatized, I didn't need to know that. That knowledge gave me no new or useful information, all it did was hurt me even more and make me want to cry. But I keep wanting to know more about how we hurt each other, I know it will hurt me but I still do nothing but look for more pain.

Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be ignorant, stuck inside a little bubble, where none of the painful knowledge could get in. Sometimes I wish I were stupid. I don't care about doing well in school or making a lot of money or changing the world or doing anything else I might be able to do, all I want to do is be happy with whatever happens. But maybe being intelligent is indeed privilege, and ignorant people have it even worse than I do... I don't know.

Looking over this, this sort of is self-aggrandizing, if it gets a bunch of downvotes I'll probably delete it. I don't know how to say what I've just said without sounding arrogant, I just don't know what to say.",18Sep2018,4
11,Just wondering what implications or setbacks being diagnosed with a mental illness could cause? As far as jobs or anything really. I’ve been putting off talking to a doctor about what I’m sure are some issues Ive had since I was a child. Issues most of the people in my family seem to be on medication for. I definitely don’t want any medication so I’ve been avoiding medical help partly because of that. But also because I don’t want any diagnosis to hold me back. Basically I just want to know if it could limit any possibilities in my life. ,18Sep2018,2
12,"I have a history of major depression. One official, very severe episode I recovered from. One minor, acute recurrence where I was alarmingly suicidal, and haven't fully recovered from--the symptoms just became very mild but didn't go away. The symptoms of the second episode were already more mild, I think because I was on medication that time, and didn't have any of the build up or warning signs of the first episode. 

Now I am seeing a lot of warning signs another episode could be on it's way. I've stopped talking to my friends because I feel I'm burdening or bothering them. I want to get away from my family because I think I broke them. When having a totally innocent conversation with a friend, I thought ""I'm manipulating her."" Which was a theme in my first episode whenever I talked to someone (feeling guilty). 

The physical symptoms are there, usually in not sleeping through the night even with good sleep hygiene. And I cry multiple times a day. 

Another theme I see in common with my first episode is believing depression isn't real, or denying what I'm feeling could be depression when just earlier in the day my thoughts were erratic, distressing and obsessive (rumination), which is abnormal for healthy me. 

I don't understand or believe how depression is a real disease. I've read a lot about it and everything says it is, but also that it has to do a lot with personality. 

Which makes me think i am just a bad person with a weak personality who makes herself severely depressed because she is a bad person. So I deserve to be depressed and I'll never get better because I'm just broken inside, even after lots of therapy. 

This is making me so desperate. I have a family history of depression and life experiences in my youth that probably make me how I am. But I *should* be able to get through my ""depression"" and never have issues with it specifically again (I know life sucks sometimes, and that's normal), if I was a strong and good person. Because personalities can change, right? 

Lots of people get through life without developing depression or only have one depressive episode. 

So why not me? What could possibly make me different other than I'm bad and weak? I can only imagine depression is entirely my fault, even though others have told me much of it is out of my control (except I can make the symptoms better or worse based on my actions). 

Can we really compare depression to an illness like diabetes, in the way that treatment is necessary to manage it? Or am I just an awful person who can't handle life and will never amount to anything? 

Sorry this is jumbled. I don't feel I'm not making a lot of sense right now. My head is so foggy. 

(Note: I am on medication, in therapy with a few months break, exercise regularly, try to eat well, and practice coping mechanisms daily) ",18Sep2018,2
13,"I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression back when I was 13. I was given a script for meds, but my mum didn't allow me to fill it (she was afraid of the side effects) and didn't return to therapy until I was 15. I did that for roughly 12 months and then stopped going due to anxiety and fear of judgment from family . I'm now 18 and am feeling sick about going to the doctors to get a mental health plan. I want to go back to therapy because I recognise I need help, but I'm literally stricken by fear. I already skipped 3 doctors appointments about it and I'm onto my 4th doctors surgery because I was too scared to go back to the places I had skipped out on. I'm not sure what i'm asking for, but I just need guidance, or advice. I know this is an important first step to take again but i'm just so scared not only of the doctor, but what my parents will say.

14,"Hey, this isn't nearly as dramatic as a lot of the posts here but I sort of need help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's been almost year after we broke up. We were together almost a year. Towards the end there were a lot of fights, but I thought we ended on not that bad terms. We still wanted to be friends. Recently I talked to one of her close friends from high school about her and realized how ""crazy"" she was. When I was in the relationship, whenever we would fight obviously during the argument I would think she was wrong and being irrational or not being completely honest, but after the cool down I would always doubt myself. Nah she's not actually being crazy, we both said and did some dumb things. It's always scary to me to be completely confident in my opinions, because I'm so afraid of that chance, no matter how small, of being wrong. Maybe only I was being irrational and stupid. It was especially difficult because I didn't really like sharing my personal relationship troubles with friends and such for advice or venting.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the friend I talked to basically confirmed all my worst fears. She would lie by omission to me all the time, she would get angry at the hint of criticism, just often became an emotional wreck. During the relationship I tried to tolerate these things a little more than usual because I knew she had a rough history with a semi abusive family, including a bullying older sister, very vicious and intense sibling rivalry, authoritarian mom that got angry at the smallest things, dad that lived across seas. She also struggles from depression and anxiety off and on what sounds since the beginning of high school (maybe middle school too) until now. She has attempted suicide once before I knew her, and she says that the family, especially the mom and sister reacted very mildly. I believe she is no longer has those thoughts, but she has said in the past that her only reason for living is to pursue her art/career. She drowns herself with a heavy workload on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She has had a long list of boyfriend's starting from sophomore year, and rarely took more than a month long break between each one. I believe with her past two boyfriends she has only had about a week gap before meeting the next one. I have heard from said friend that many of her past boyfriends have had problems like mine as well and have called her ""crazy.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really afraid of fucking this up. I could just leave her alone but I still care for her and want her to be happy. If she gets really offended like she usually does when I bring up a problem I think it'll make everything worse. She gets even more angry if I bring up something I don't really like about a family member or teacher or other role model. I don't think she is very open to therapy or going to a doctor in general, because her mom was trained medically and rarely thought there was a need to take her to the hospital. I would also like to add that I am pretty angry at her currently due to the things I've learned she's lied about to me in the past, so I am also worried my anger will make me more aggressive and harsh. I just recently started to get on better terms with her again, so finding out about all this really really sucks. I feel like I've failed myself making so many mistakes and wrong choices.

16,"I re-opened my dating apps lately. Haven't been on them in a year. I swiped on a few people, got a few messages, and couldn't find the energy to care enough to respond back to any of them. I haven't been in a relationship for almost 2 years at this point. I've hardly even tried. I get crushes on people, but don't do anything about it. It's not that I couldn't get a date if I wanted to, it's that just the very idea of it is exhausting to me.

Every once in awhile, I get lonely. I think about how it would be nice to have a partner to go through life with. I just don't care enough to pursue it.

I do the same thing with my friends in some ways. I have friends, sure. But I rarely actually want to spend time with them. I'll see them once every few weeks. Other than that, I don't feel like I have the energy to focus on anyone. Recently I met a couple new people that wanted to be my friends. One texted me. I never texted back. The other asked me to hang out. I said sure. Then I ignored her when she messaged me to make plans. The idea of socializing with new people feels like an insurmountable burden.

I didn't used to be like this. I used to jump at the chance to meet people, to hang out with people, to leave my house and do things. I loved long late night conversations and really getting to know someone. People excited me. 

There's nothing huge going on in my life right now. I work, I come home to my dog, and I am generally pretty happy. Except I feel like I can't connect to anybody, because I feel like I can't even motivate myself to try.

18,"Ok this is going to be a throw away account. I feel like I need to tell someone about this and figured reddit would be the place. I don't think I feel the way most people should. For starters, I don't know if I love my family. If they were to die I would be upset, but I don't think I feel love towards them and if I don't see them for awhile I don't miss them at all. On the other hand, I am very protective over my pets and I believe that I love them, but I'm still not really too sure. The part about myself that scares me is my feelings of rage that I tend to have and my at times lack of sympathy. When I get annoyed at someone I feel a very strong urge to hurt them, even when it comes to my pets. I never would hurt them, but the urge is still there at times and I have to try and push it out of my mind thinking how crazy that would be. When in arguments with my mother I have imagined doing things like stabbing her or killing her so that I could get rid of her and she'd no longer be a problem for me. Everyone else seems to perceive me as a very nice person, but I do not feel like a nice person at all due to my thoughts and feelings. Over the past year I have been thinking about suicide a lot, but I am too much of a coward to actually end my life, and rather wish that I would die in a car accident or something. I think it may stem back to when I was younger and my father was abusive towards my mum before they split up and a saw him every few months and now every few years. I don't really feel anything towards what he did to our family, nor do I really have any feelings towards him at all. I also have some family members that are on drugs and have destroyed their lives, but I don't really feel any kind of sadness for the situation they are in. Being a teenager, I go to a lot of parties now and I am faced with a lot of unwanted advances. When I have mentioned these to friends they said that these things were assault, but I feel completely indifferent towards these events.

Okay i guess to start off i feel like we have something that nobody else could ever have which sounds ridiculous but we have gotten very very close. We are both seniors in HS and she has told me a few times that she has thought about killing herself and that she has been sure about doing it and just driving her car into something. She has a very busy and hard life and her parents are very difficult i guess you could say. She has also said she hasn’t done it because of me which I’m glad about. Im glad i can be there for her but i don’t want the day to come when things get bad enough that I’m not enough. I hate thinking about this and I’m pretty sure I should go to someone but i don’t want to break the trust she has placed in me by telling me this. She has said her parents think shes just being dramatic when she tells them. I am start to try and get her to tell someone herself because i think things would be much better that way but I’m just not sure what to do and i need help with helping her. I love her so much and will do pretty much anything to help but shes just in a very difficult place mentally and emotionally a lot and I’ve never been there so i don’t know how to help her.

20,"College is supposed to be the place where you make ever-lasting relationships and go through a ton of new experiences, but I think I'm fucking it all up. It's making me re-evaluate who I am as a person and what I can do to stop feeling down on myself. For starters:

I'm 20 F, grew up with a depressed, semi-alcoholic mother and no father. Multiple men in and out of my mom's life. I have a half-sister, who's father acted as my own up until I was ~12 y/o, when he married a woman who did not acknowledge me as his, and subsequently cut me out. I know a bit about my own father; he was a handsome but brutally mean man who hit my mother while she was pregnant with me. In 2015, a drunk driver hit and killed him. I've never cried about this, but I don't know, I think I might regret not having known who he was to at least clear up these issues that might be affecting my life?

In college, friendships have become more and more important to me. I've always cherished ""being comfortable"" around someone, so much so that when my first group of friends didn't work out, I fell into a depression for six months, at the end of which I thought I would commit suicide. Thankfully I didn't; I go to a really large school and very rarely see any of them anymore, and over the years, I've been able to overcome the majority of the social anxiety that I've dealt with since being bullied in middle school. I've met a lot of amazing people, but often I think about how close I was with my group of high school friends and don't think/know if I'll ever get there with anyone else. I want SO desperately to be close friends with the group of people that I hang out with but it seems like they're getting really close and I'm left out of the picture. It's really lonely and I know it's my fault, but I can't seem to break the wall I've put between me and them in order for us to become closer.

I've vacillated on and off about whether I'm being narcissistic, or if the sudden switch from being a ""sexless nobody"" with nerdy, weird friends all into anime &gt;&gt;&gt;to someone who people see as ""pretty"" and mysterious (largely due to how closed off I am emotionally and about my family history), is also affecting my interactions with people. I was never the pretty one in high school, and being the target of others' lust and affection has honestly been kind of scary. Even a small complement on my appearance or a glance makes me uncomfortable. Stupidly, I wonder if the people that I interact with like me for me and what I talk about and share with them, or if they only spark conversations because they want something more.

I try to hide behind memes and general weirdness to fend off the first impression that I give off which is, according to multiple people, very ""instagramy"" and ""stuck-up"". I just don't know what I'm doing! The other day my coworker told me, ""We can't all be pretty princesses like you, broberry,"" and I felt the distance between me and her in an instant. I can't ever say I'm down or feeling gross or ugly because it'll always be hyperbole to them. I'm trying to step down from the pedestal. 

So my last problem: I'm a virgin. I want to go through a ""hoe stage"" like everyone does in college, but I think I need one good relationship first. The last ""relationship"" I was in lasted for around two months, and it was great! He approached me as a friend first, slowly, and very rarely called me pretty, always complementing how much we had in common instead, which really put me at ease! I miss him as a person, but it being an interracial relationship was kind of difficult for me, who hates being in the spotlight. 

The start of the new school year has had me questioning my sexuality on the daily. The people who I get close to always seem to fall faster than I do and whenever they want to discuss ""what we are"", I pull back and suddenly get really afraid to call what we're doing a relationship. Mostly, I just lose interest in dating them at all. I can't see myself committing to anybody and I don't know why. I *want* to love and be in love with someone, but the thought of it is scary. I don't know if this is because I'm going after the wrong gender; I currently identify as bisexual (tending towards guys), but I'm thinking that I might be asexual? But I also don't know if that's just because I'm scared. I'm scared to get close to people, sexually or not. I'm really scared! And confused.

Can someone guide me in the right direction?",18Sep2018,2
21,"I've only experienced guilt two times in my life and both were very, very weak feelings. The reason that this is weird is because I grew up a scapegoat of a narcissist (and manipulative, transphobic, abusive, etc.) mother (usually resulting in super guilt-ridden children from what I've read). I also tend to break some laws and can steal from people without feeling an ounce of guilt. 

I know that I'm not a psychopath because I'm very empathetic for everything other than guilt and I care deeply for people close to me, but everything I find online points to psychopath. 

Does anyone know what could be the root of this (other than psychopath)? Thank you ",18Sep2018,3

23,"Sorry about posting this. Not sure this really belongs here because I've seen people that post that are in a worse condition than me and I don't think I should be complaining in comparison to them. 
Long story short I'm a university student and I'm 3 weeks in. I know the semester has just started but I already feel overwhelmed. To make it less of an eye sore I'm going to list it out. 

-I'm stressing out trying to stay on top of class and know everything in then
-Panicking about what I should be studying for future tests
-In general having a fear of my future
-Not being active enough in my student body
-I feel rushed that I have to try graduate on time. (I plan on doing an extra year but don't think it's good enough so I'm packing my semesters in with 6 courses)
- I'm worried my courses I have taken from my exchange program aren't going to transfer over which makes the courses that I'm taking now pointless
-To having a long distance relationship whom is coming to visit me in a week and I'm kind of stressing about that because I want her to have an amazing time here.
- Constantly comparing myself to my peers. 
- Not eating enough, I've noticed my intake has significantly gone down when school started
- Feel like I don't have enough time to do anything and when I do for leisure I feel like it's a waste of time

Note: I'm not smart and have never gotten good grades that I feel are expected of me. I try to study or always think I should be studying making me feel really unproductive. 

I don't know what to do. I want to have a balanced life and schedule where I can go to the gym and better myself, eat properly and get good grades. I'm honestly just scared, confused and tired. Sorry about this, just felt like I needed an outlet to try feel better.",18Sep2018,2
24,"So lots of bad things are happening in my life right now, on top of underlying mental health problems I already have. I feel so bad and sad all the time.

Sometimes I think about killing myself - like I don’t actually think about doing it, the thoughts or images of me killing myself just pop into my head. These images scare me, as I am afraid of dying, and I don’t want to die. I’m scared that these mean I’m becoming suicidal.

When I think about it rationally, I am 100% sure I do not want to die, and will most likely never attempt suicide. I am 18 and I still have my whole life ahead of me, and I know things can get better. It just seems like maybe it’s a fun thing to think about when I’m really upset and struggling.

Am I suicidal? I don’t really have much experience with this so I’m not sure... I would say no, because for all intents and purposes, I don’t want to kill myself - although I still get these thoughts.

Also, what can I do about them, and what can I do to make sure I never actually kill myself. Thanks :-)",18Sep2018,3

26,"People insult me to my face: I take it well. Shit goes south: No biggie. I eat a huge loss: Easy come easy go.

I'm happy well and comfortable in a pleasant atmosphere while engaging in hobbies I enjoy: God fucking damn this stupid shit fuck you fuck this fuck that fuck me. Fuck that guy, fuck what happened, fuck me and my stupid actions. Fuck this shit, I hate my life.

This is driving me nuts. I can't figure if I'm getting mood swings due to having and losing control of negative trains of thought, thus causing a negative mood despite a positive moment and environment... or if I have no fucking control of this and my mood is completely detached from external cues in the immediate present.

How many times should I cycle through a bad mood, then an upbeat mood in a day? I seem to cycle at least daily, and while external events can trigger a bad-mood period in the moment, quite often they're completely detached from anything and just happen because fuck me.

I don't think I've ever had actual *mania* before. Mostly I'm either upbeat, or all stormclouds... but when the stormclouds lift I am *upbeat*. It's more the sense that I have no control, and that they're detached from external cues as well.",18Sep2018,4
27,"I feel like no matter what I do, I’ll always be shitty. I feel like no matter how much I like and appreciate someone, I am virtually incapable of expressing it.

I always seem to be doing things the wrong way and it feels like I’m completely out of sync with everything. It feels like I’m on a completely different social wavelength. I either get too close to people or I am too aloof. I’m either under reacting or overreacting. I can never seem to find the right time to talk — it seems like I have awful timing no matter how hard I try to fix this. Nobody usually listens to me and it’s probably because I am so annoying and hard to be around that even my parents couldn’t stand me, no matter how many times they tried to fake it.

It feels like I have nothing to offer anybody. If I actually tried to reach out to people, I’d probably do it wrong and humiliate myself and this isn’t some sort of stupid paranoia or something — it’s the truth: I have no idea how to properly communicate with people and I’m usually an idiot when it comes to social cues. I don’t understand sarcasm. It usually flies right over my head and I remain oblivious until someone explains it to me.

I feel dead and empty inside and every time someone tries to help me, they just get dragged down by what I have to deal with and end up leaving. Sometimes I wish people would just give up on me so that I could suffer alone and not bring anybody else into it. 

The therapists can never understand what I tell them. They just keep acting like everything is fine and there’s nothing wrong with me but I know that’s not true. If there was nothing wrong with me, I wouldn’t feel like this. I wouldn’t be virtually incapable of maintaining friendships. ",18Sep2018,3
28,"Hi guys.

I really need some help. I moved into a house share and have since learnt why the guy before me probably moved out.

My neighbour’s house shares a wall with my room. Every fucking morning this guy knocks on the walls as if it’s some kind of code. Just all along the wall that’s shared with our house. It wakes me up and drives me insane. I asked my housemates who basically said one time they knocked back and the guy just lost it. It seemed like he was hallucinating and kept shouting “what do you want, wtf do you want from me”. Then he came to the door and started banging on it and threatening them and they had to call the police.

He also has this alarm that ring all fucking day long. I can barely hear this thankfully. It’s an analogue alarm for lack of a better phrase and he keeps it ringing for pretty much the whole day.

He also never leaves his house. In the past he has apparently poured chicken oil all over my friend’s washing that she had hung out to dry. 

Basically he’s not very stable and gets very aggressive if you contact him or tell him to stop. My housemates just let him do his stupid knocking and alarm clock routine. 

TLDR: neighbour who I think is mentally unwell keeps knocking on walls as some sort of code and is very aggressive if you knock back or talk to him. It is disturbing me massively ",18Sep2018,5
29,"Hi everyone, my name’s Kimmy, I’m a 22 year old aspiring makeup artist. 
I feel I have gained a lot of my skills actually due to a health condition. I have a condition that makes me commonly lose my voice, due to tensing throat muscles. I can sometimes have a very unfeminine and gravelly voice, which affects my self confidence. 
I’m a girly girl, and so I tend to wear a full face of glam makeup, and a nice outfit on days where my voice is bad. 
Bad voice day: 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KwyDDkR3UT8

My quality of voice is partially related to my anxiety levels, so I feel like glamming up makes me feel better and maybe sound a little better. 
My condition is getting worse though, so I feel I’m wearing more and more makeup. 
I always feel if I can’t sound good, I might as well look good though. 
My friends joke that if I have a full glam look on during the day, I probably can’t talk, lol. 

Am I relying too much on makeup?

What makes it even stronger is if the girl is losing her voice or has laryngitis. Especially deep &amp; gravelly. 
If a girl has a bad case of laryngitis, and has a gravelly voice, and is applying a full face of bold makeup, and the red lipstick is being applied has the voice is getting worse, that is such a turn on to me.

32,"   Hello people of Reddit so I have a story I would like to share in hopes that someone else will find the inspiration that I did. First off let me give you a little bit of a back story. I am a veteran of the US Navy and have a wife and three kids and have also been dealing with mental health issues for a long time now and I feel that me telling my story is very important and it is my hope that my story will help someone else. 

   It was about two and a half years ago and I was in a very low spot in my life. I felt as if I was disconnected from the world. I was not finding joy or happiness in anything my therapy was not working for me and I was on the verge of having to go to the Veterans Affairs Hospital for an inpatient stay because I was to a point where I did not want to be alive anymore. Well fast forward to July of 2016 the game was released on my birthday and my wife immediately downloaded it to give it a try. Much to her surprise she could barely play the game due to the constant server issues, but she was diligent and like most of the United States she was sucked into these digital monsters world. Now she kept trying to get me to download the game and play with her but I had no interest in trying to catch these pocket monsters. I had more important things to do like feel sorry for myself and try to figure out how to end my life and make sure not to hurt my wife or kids. 

   Well after about two weeks of her nagging me to just try it I said ok and I downloaded it. After about an hour of her showing me what to do and how to play something strange started to happen I wanted to get up and go outside to try and catch more of these digital 1's and 0's monsters. Now by this point I had already come up with a plan to end my life but, the strangest thing happened the more I played the less depressed I was feeling and I was actually having fun going on walks with my wife and our kids hearing her getting excited when she caught a new mon and seeing my kids having fun with us. Now I'm not much of a person to socialize with other people but the game kinda forced me to, so I started talking to other Pokemon players and making a few new friends. The game has helped me completely change my life it helped me get out of our house so I would not isolate, it helped me get closer to my wife and kids, it helped me have a better relationship with my wife and kids. We would go out on a daily basis to play and we would have so much fun that I would not want it to stop. I started improving little by little and I also did something I never thought I could I opened up to my wife about how I was feeling. 

   Now its been over two years since I started playing and my wife doesn't play anymore my oldest son stopped playing because he got involved in Minecraft but my 6 year old and 4 year old still play with me and we still have a blast they love going to the park with me and catching there favorite Pokemon and my 6 year old is convinced the only way to get a shinny Pokemon in the game is for her to hold daddy's hand. My 4 year old love to do the raids and really gets into it by creating his own sounds for the Pokemon's moves he also loves to sit down with me and watch the youtubers play Pokemon as well like Mystic7 and Trainer Tips. 

   Now I know this is long and if you have made it this far let me sum up what I think can be taken from this. First off if you are to a point where you don't want to live please ask someone for help it's not worth the pain you are going to cause everyone else. Second I found that when I started doing something that had a purpose for me it helped change my thinking and got me to a point where I wanted to get help and get better. I really hope that this can help someone. Lastly I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.",18Sep2018,7
33,"I've Googled, but haven't found any examples of my problem, I've read about regression after life changing events in children, but that doesn't apply to me since I'm an adult and haven't had a life changing moment lately, at least not any acute changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 22 year old male and I've been regressing mentally lately, not to the outside world, but in my mind I'm becoming more like a child and the other day I almost broke down crying at work. I've always looked forward to living on my own and getting out of school and objectively I know my life will be better and I don't fear the responsibilites I'm starting to face as an adult, yet, I'm now longing back to childhood pretty badly. I've started watching old TV-shows and movies I used to watch, I'm replaying childhood memories all the time and everything that even reminds me of childhood or parental love makes me tear up. The Tarzan soundtrack ""You'll be in my heart"" came up on my Spotify shuffle thingy (Disney soundtracks are awesome) and I started crying in the car and all I wanted to do was crawl into my mother's arms and stay there forever. The strange thing is that I have been dying to get out of my parents' house since I was 16, but kept failing in school for various reasons so I've never been close to getting out until now and on top of that, I don't particularly like my parents and did not have a good childhood, it was mediocre most of the time and miserable a lot of the time, I was a fat, poor kid with social anxiety so life was never great back then, but I still see that time through rose-tinted glasses, wanting to go back and escape the adult world before it swallows me whole.

I'm managing my generalised anxiety and depression and I'm living, I can go down the pub or play golf with my friends, I'm no longer trapped inside my head or my home. I'm starting to share things with people I trust about what's wrong and learning with my counsellor what is causing these feelings and deteriorated mental state, it goes right back to my childhood.

I felt helpless and alone, nearly suicidal but I'm winning now, there is still a long way to go the future is looking brighter everyday.

I do not see many success stories here, I don't think people like sharing as they do not want to risk going back to where they were. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing that helped me in my eyes was my counsellor, she was able to tell me after explaining my feelings etc what was wrong, and I worked on them and now I'm improving. A-lot of my problems stemmed from childhood which I feel is where a huge amount of us fall into this category, I had to rewire my brain, I had no idea how to do this at first, it started happening 1 moment at a time. Moments I felt trapped in my train journey from London back home everyday I just done my breathing exercises and performed what my counsellor told me to.

Update!

We have now had over 654 people take part! That's over £654 raised for mental health charities and over half way there for our research! A lot of our responses have come from Reddit so thank you!

In case this is the first time you're reading this post... We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment.

We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

The questionnaires will only take about 15 minutes to complete online. For your participation, we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink).

Now I'm gonna write down all the symptoms i have. I really appreciate any idea you have about where to go with this, or what is this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im a 20 year old male,2nd year medical student in Hungary, with extensive intrest in science and metaphysics and traditionality. In my oppinion i've learned quite a lot and that's why i could stay in university, but right now i dont know how i will go on. I'm almost sure, that i have some kind of an Asperger but dont know it for real, although it doesn't matter. I'm a vegan, i really take care of all the nutrients that are necessary, AND THESE SYMPTOMS BEGAN 1 YEAR BEFORE I EVEN HAD THE TOUGHT OF BEING A VEGAN, so im certain that its not a nutrient related problem.

&amp;#x200B;

ABOUT DOCTORS

About the doctors i've been to my first psychologist when i was 13 year old, because of family events i could not process up. Thats gone. My second psychologist was around 17 1 year after i had a really bad trip, with a designer psychedelic. In this trip i baseicly had massive hallucinations, I would say that i had a complete new story in my had every second(about myself, and others, which where AS LONG AS LIFETIME). Yeah i had a massive panic attack, because i was afraid that this mental state would stay. My (2nd) psycho diagnosed me with OCD. I've gone to SSRI-s and things got better. Then my relationship with pharma was really changeble.(Things got better then i stopped then it got worse and repeating.) 2 years ago i started to experience the symptoms i will write down later. I've gone to a neurologist, done MRI, he said that i should go to a psychiatrist again, because all my symptoms ARE NOT NEUROLOGICAL.I've been to that psychiatrist and he only taught me technics on how to deal with this, and he DIAGNOSED ME WITH PANIC/ANXIETY DISORDER. Lately i've been to an auditologist, and he sent me back to the neurologist which i will attend to in the next week.

 

SYMPTOMS THAT I EXPERIENCE SINCE THE BAD TRIP

&amp;#x200B;

\-First of all i've had OCD symptoms when i was a child and i had paranoid thoughts like everybody was trying to poison me,i understand and fully realized them right now. I got OCD from that trip and the obsessions were all related to my intelligence and mind health. I took care of my obsessive thinking, but out of that, i dont have any paranoid thought right now.

\-By obsessive thoughts i mean like having to remember a story, a logical consequence, having to call up names, told sentences (which i have a problem with now).

\-Hypnagogic sound hallucinations similar to what i heard in the bad trip. This includes hearing people talking, thinking random desorganized sentences like, ""I like go feeling."". THIS WORSENED OVER THE YEARS. Right now, i have these kind of random unlogical, not agressive, nor pressive random sentences, sentence parts (like hearing a bit of a word on a street, and then come up with a word that is just a wordpart. Like for Constantly: stantly) constantly going in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

SYMPTOMS THAT I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST 1,5 2 YEARS (Its progressing)

&amp;#x200B;

\-serious memory problems, like hearing a complex sentence(RIGHT NOW THIS APPLIES TO A NORMAL SIMPLE SENTENCE TOO!) and I don't remember the first part at all. This includces forgetting major words and interchange it with others that are not in the topic. Also sometimes forgetting names of my medium niveu friends, having a hard time to remember them

\-i had quite a bad hearing since i was a kid, but this worsened in the last to years rapidly. Now i can only hear somebody, if there is almost no sound other than one of the speaking person's, and only if he's articulating perfectly. Talks, Public speaks, randevaus, some seminars, TV shows, films (with background voices), require EXTREME amount of attention and even with that i dont hear out and understand every 7-8th sentence. I'we mentioned that i've been to an auditologist, done a hearing test and my ears are perfect....

\-having to read things (almost everything), 2-3 times just in order to understand it not talking about memorizing it.

\-misreading words at a high rate ( i didnt used to, at all.)

\-Decoding or understanding sentences with a time shift, like somebody is telling his 3rd sentence and i only got what he said in his first. Of course this almost always ends up in loss of conversation line

\-Enormous problem of understanding simple logical constructions, like:"" not that you would not do it"". I just cant decode it, it doesnt have a meaning in my head.

\-Having major thought blocks like speaking about a topic and from one second to the next i dont even know what the topic was. This greatly interrupts, and makes normal and intellectual speaks impossible.

\-Reading or listening to something and having a complete problem remembering, giving back, telling somebody what i read, conclusions, reasons etc. .

\-Feeling almost impossible to remember anything, having 4-5-6x more time dumped into learning the same amount.

\-I'm speaking less from day to day with people because i just dont know what to say, i have no thoughts nor personal things that would come up to my mind. (I love people, but i just can't communicate with them, because a, I dont understand them, b, there is nothing to communicate about.)

\-having a really hard time concentrating on one thing, on one people, solving mathematical and biological problems which were easy 2-3 years ago.

\-when speaking telling a story, sometimes I tell a different story, because i dont remember it the first time then i got it, and dont correct it because of the non logical reaction it would give.

\-making new words because i dont remember the correct form, like saying direfent instead of different, and often thinking about

\-requireing a lot more to sleep

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, that i kind of accepted, that my mental properties won't be as good as it were, but now i feel like i can't speak with nobody, because i really can't. I've been on quite a journey since 2016, I've met with Buddhism and traditional thoughts and practices, and i've been feeling a deep peace, but that are the times when i dont have to communicate, read, and learn something, because when i do i face with the symptoms mentioned in the upper sections. It's paradoxical, but still I love doing these things, I just constatly have to face my fail in these.

I’ve also been stressed out and constantly exhausted. My appetite has gone down as well. My memory is also failing me, and it’s usually pretty bad but now I can’t even remember large details of the day except for monumental moments or when I cry. I can barely remember yesterday at all I don’t remember any moment in it except for a small portion of my ASL class from the night. If it’s necessary I’m only 15 so I shouldn’t be suffering from memory loss like this. Should I see a doctor? Does anyone know what’s happening? Please help and thank you. ",18Sep2018,3

47,"Exactly as the title says. I have times when I have what I might describe as ""manic episodes,"" for now, because I don't know what else to call them. It feels like everything is in fast forward and I can't relax. When I'm in this state I'm restless and quick to get angry or irritated, and have almost no filter on what I say. Yet, I still feel profoundly sad and pathetic even in these episodes. It's often said that happiness is a defining trait of mania, but when I'm in this state I still feel depressed and mentally ill, just in a different way. I don't feel normal or reasonable and I quickly get frustrated, angry and sometimes even violent on occasions. Is it possible that I'm experiencing manic episodes?

I haven't really done this; I've tried it out a few times but no one knows how to help, if they tried. I don't have anyone to talk to. 

Every time I hang out with my friends, I feel like I have a mask on. I keep to myself, I smile so they don't ask questions. I do this because I know no one can help and it's better to not bring it up. But it's so hard. I'm stuck in the same low point in life and I don't know how to deal with it by myself.

49,"I had OCD themed problems in the past,from religious when I was younger,to a guilt themed one,until I was free from all of them.I went to psychiatrist,but they aren't of help from where I live,with the except of medication.

Now it seems something else bothers me.While my brother is chewing or just doing any sort of ''sticky sounds'' it seems I have some sort of 'groinal response' and that bothers me.I'm not afraid that I might be gay and I don't have unwanted thoughts that I'd do things to him.If I were to be gay,I'd rather be for Keanu Reeves(humour) It's the groinal response,if that's what it is,that drives me mad.What I want to ask is:Can I get to a point where the Groinal Response won't happen?Or will I have to solve everything else related to it?I tried ''exposing'' myself to these situations but it seems that even if I get to a point where I can psychologically be safe,that response still comes.I need help.

There is another problem,but it's not much of a concern.I feel like avoiding someone's photo on facebook.I learned that I need to accept the thoughts,and I don't have a problem with the trigger per se,but the fact that instead of ''thoughts'' to accept it's more of a headeache and image that comes.I'm accepting it,but still I'd like to know which strategy to use

I'm not looking for reassurance,but to know If the groinal response is something that can be solved,or something that I should avoid as much as I can,and if I'm using a good strategy on the second.I really am happy at this point in life,but I need help with this matter,as it seems that it's not something that I can do something about..

50,"So last year I guess I was extra depressed and anxious and I encountered this extreme lack of appetite. I didn't care about eating and couldn't manage much when I could. Of course a few weeks of this had me extremely unwell, but I got kinda better in the end. I've had plenty of experience with anxiety and depression but I'd never had this symptom before, but it's the only explanation I have for it.

I'm going through a shit breakup and substance issues and right now choosing my own food doesn't interest me one bit. In my past relationship, my partner would make food related choices for me, made sure I ate when I was ill/ hungover but it appears that I'm too fucked to manage that by myself. We used to eat the equivalent to 4 full meals a do, no issue and now I can barely manage 2. I sometimes look in the fridge but there's nothing I want to eat or prepare.

Does anyone have any tips? I don't want to end up unwell again and the one thing keeping me sane is lifting weights so I can't let this get in the way of it.

51,"I’m a 17 year old who’s currently in 12th grade. I feel like for the past couple of years I’ve been struggling with something but I don’t know what it is exactly. 

I’ve been to a psychologist a few times but I only go when things get really bad and I stop going once I feel ‘better’ even though the root of the problems haven’t been identified yet and I also have never really shared everything with them due to a feeling of shame(?) which I realize is stupid because that means the problems will never be solved but I kept doing it either way.

My problems have started worsening again recently and I feel like it’s time to finally figure out what is wrong with me, but before consulting a psychologist again I want to have a rough idea of whether I have something and what it might be. This is a list of things I’ve struggled with for quite some time:

1. Inability to concentrate, whether it while at school, watching a movie, hanging out with friends or other things I find it hard to keep focus on just one thing and I often find myself zoning out, daydreaming, constantly checking my phone etc. 

2. Laziness/lack of motivation, I create goals and set plans but I rarely follow through, I really do want to achieve my goals but for some reason I can’t bring myself to do it, when it’s time to do it I just procrastinate, I’ve tried to solve this via hiding all distractions, creating alarms etc. but nothing seems to work. There are also times when I just give up, because I feel like the goal isn’t achievable I don’t bother trying in the first place.

3. Irrational fears that I constantly think about, the fears constantly change, at my lowest point I was terribly afraid of my parents dying, I would worry about them until I was with them, I tried their food before they ate to made sure it wasn’t poisoned etc., I’m no longer that fearful but there are other things, like feeling that none of my friends actually like me and are all just faking it, or fearing being held back a grade even though I passed all subjects.

4. Antisocial behaviour, I don’t consider myself to be socially awkard or unable to make friends but I find myself never developinhg any real lasting relationships because a lot of times I don’t bother having a conversation, bailing out on plans and generally relying on the other person to approach me first. I also tend to keep my personal problems to myself. I do feel lonely at times, but it doesn’t feel ‘right’ to bother others even though I know that they’re there for me.

Other things I experience include horrible sleeping habits (too much or too little) and ocassional binge eating when things are bad.

I know that this is a ridiculously long post and I’m sorry for that but thank you so much if you spent the time to read through all this, it means a lot to me. If you have any idea of what this might be whether it be a mental illness or a simple case of teenage angst please let me know :)",18Sep2018,2
53,"Hi guys a family member of mine has been dealing with mental health issues for the past 3 years now and serious ones at that. This year has been the worst of all and they're not wanting to take their anti-psychotic and it's making them freak out and no matter what we do they still wont take it. We've gotten to the point a few months ago when it goes on for a prolong period of time we get the police involved and they send out 2 of their guys pretty much anytime. Last night was the 4th time we had to get them involved because my said family member got violent and physical. The last 3 times they would take them to the hospital get evaluated and then be sent of to one of the mental health hospitals/crisis centers around the state. The times she was sent there it was not as bad as what has been going on for the past month. 

The time's she's been sent away for a week was due to either manic episodes or she was threatening to self harm. Now the past month it's been worst then it ever has been. She's talking to the TV like there's a group of people around her and what ever she's watching she acts like they're talking directly to her. She'll bring up random names of old friends and get visibly angry to the point she'll start punching/kicking towards the TV. She'll say horrible things to us and make heavy threats towards us and the next 5 minutes she'll forget that she said anything, and that'll happen all the time with minuscule things as well. She laughs and things where some one that's mentally stable would not laugh at. When she gets upset/angry she'll go to her room and start banging on the walls for a good minute or two. We have an elderly neighbor and they haven't even bothered to call the police on her due to her being belligerent and obscene. 

Last night and the time before they came here I had to fill out an EOD (Emergency Order of Detention) Where i had to state what happened before the police arrived so they could take her into custody and put her into the hospital. She was in the hospital for maybe 4 hours and they called to pick her up when we knew she pretty much put up a facade so she didn't have to be put into a mental health facility. She came home and went right back to how she was acting before i had to call the police. I showed the police officers 4 audio recordings of what she says and how in depth she talks to her self and then proceeds to freakout and still they sent her back home. 

She doesn't sleep,She doesn't take her anti-psychotic, and doesn't take the recommended dose of the pills she was prescribed. What do we do from this point forward we're constantly walking on egg shells and honestly it's beginning to scare us. She's loosing her mind and we have no clue what to do from this point forward besides calling the police again if things turn bad.",18Sep2018,3

55,"At this point I'm pretty much interacting with the world as if it were real even though I strongly suspect it isn't. I don't have a theory about what it really is, but I definitely know that this isn't all there is to it, and I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who's even half real. You know those philosophical questions about not knowing for certain whether anything's real – you gotta exist since you wouldn't be able to think about these things if you didn't, but with everyone else you just have to take their word for it. That's how it feels to me. Everyone else is a figment or a reflection or a vision, but since I have no viable alternative to it, I'm treating everyone as if they were real. I'm just taking their word for it, since that's all anyone can ever give. If people were real, they'd want me to just fucking believe them when they told me, so that's what I'm doing.

To clarify, I do logically believe we're all real. My family exists, they love me and care about me, I have amazing friends and a supportive girlfriend, but on some level I feel like... I can't know for sure, and on some level my life does feel a lot like a simulation. I don't understand my past and I can't connect with several key parts of it, as if someone gave me a random backstory in an RPG that never actually happened but, you know, it *kinda* did anyway. My past does have an effect on the life I currently live, and I wouldn't be as unstable and flat out insane if I hadn't had a traumatic childhood, for example, but I still cannot connect with the kid in my childhood pictures. This is a thought I've had for a long time. I don't feel like I existed before I was about 15 or 16 or so, which gives credence to my delusions about life not having happened the way I always thought it did.

Thinking like this has actually helped me out in some ways, too. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, and I used to get bad bouts of existential anxiety whenever anything bad happened. Why would anything like this happen, what's the point of any of it, what's stopping it from happening to me or someone I care about, why should I keep trying to go on? Now that in some parts of my brain I feel like if this were a simulation or a story and I were the protagonist, it's pretty unlikely that anything truly horrible would happen to me. It may be hard to follow the logic here, but the way I see it, nothing genuinely awful is ever going to happen to me. Nothing that I couldn't survive will happen to me. I won't be murdered and dismembered while out for a walk, I won't be kidnapped and trapped in a cellar for twenty years after giving someone directions, I won't die after slipping in my kitchen. Every random and horrifying death and misfortune in the news is there to remind me that, you know, this *could* happen, but I know it won't. It's honestly just there to make me believe the world is real and terrifying things are happening to people and could be happening to me, but they won't. This helped me out a lot with the existential angst I was dealing with because I used to be scared to go outside or eat strange foods or meet new people because something like that could happen to me. Now I know it won't.

That's actually a little backwards since a fairly large number of truly terrible things HAVE happened to me in the past (traumatic childhood, was raised by abusive, narcissistic alcoholics, suffered from an eating disorder since early childhood, had to witness domestic violence from a young age, have a truly skewed view of relationships, have self harmed using drugs, alcohol, sex, and cutting, was raped, then when I was starting to get over it I was raped again only it was worse this time, then I was finally diagnosed with borderline as if none of this was enough), but it's like... I feel like most of the worst things that could happen have already happened to me, and I made it through all of it. People do generally feel bad for me because I guess all of this is a lot to go through, but it's like... I don't fucking know lol that's just my life I guess. I'm genuinely just chilling.

The thing is, my general outlook on life is actually good. Most days I feel happy and positive. I'm in a great relationship, I love my friends, my self esteem is on the rise, I have faith I will be able to leave my bad living situation and make a beautiful life for myself, and the thoughts I have of shit not being real are really not at the forefront. I do worry that this is a sign of something more serious, like, what if this is the early warning signs of fucking schizophrenia or something? I feel like sometimes I'm half expecting my paintings or the characters on tv to start talking to me or something because that's just the kinda shit that would probably happen to me. I've never been genuinely delusional but it's like... could that happen though? Am I going to start seeing fucking waking nightmares?

I'm not sure what I'm asking here. This got kinda long and embarrassing. I guess just – does this seem worrisome to other people? Should I see a doctor even though nothing is technically wrong? I'm chilling and I have a decent life, I guess. It's just that maybe nothing's real, and maybe that's got something to do with the plethora of trauma and mental illnesses I've dealt with in my life. How does this read to other people?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OH, I almost forgot about this lol. The thing that brought all this on? I was looking at my girlfriend and thinking about how I don't deserve someone like her. I'm incredibly average in every single way, yet her and all of my exes have been literal goddesses. Hot as hell, incredibly kind, good people, have had so much I shared with all of them, had a great relationship despite occasional troubles, and they all loved me the way I was even though I'm absolutely nothing. How could I be so incredibly goddamn lucky as to end up with so many absolute angels in a row if I WEREN'T some loser's literal self insert lol? I'm genuinely perplexed. The girl I'm with is the best person I've met in my life. She is more beautiful than anyone I've ever met or even seen in my life, she's so kind, she's so funny and intelligent and passionate, I've never met someone I felt so entirely comfortable around. She has been nothing but a ray of sunshine in my life ever since I met her. Genuinely, she's the best thing I've ever had.

TLDR: Not sure if I'm genuinely delusional or just a mentally ill fool trying to make sense of the world around me, also I love my girlfriend ",18Sep2018,9

I believe I have Delusional Disorder as I mainly struggle with delusions and they don’t interfere with my life and I just move on with them as fact. Do any of you have experience with this disorder because I know it’s pretty rare. ,18Sep2018,2

She asked me some general questions and wrote me a script for some anti anxiety/depression meds.  I’m just venting at this point but I just feel weird that she decided to give me meds without really talking to me or even having me talk to a mental health specialist first. Is this normal?

73,"My fiance and I have been together for almost three years. He is somewhat of a callous person who has problems with overindulging in things (he had a physically and emotionally abusive father and mother who was never the mother she should have been). He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had a conduct disorder as a child. A year and a half into our relationship he started to think he had Asperger's Syndrome after having a major surgery (not sure if the major surgery has anything to do with it but it's just the timeline in my mind). He then became obsessed with researching it to the point where he lost his job and started mimicking the traits of an Aspie. We even went and got puzzle piece tattoos after we got him a diagnosis from a psychologist. My son has high functioning Autism, so I could see a few similarities and my fiance eventually had me convinced that he had it too. A few months later we had a huge fight and split up for a few months. He became suicidal and swallowed over 70 clonazepam pills. He spent a week in a facility where he came back with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, Asperger's, insomnia and severe anxiety. He takes over 6 pills several times per day (its a ridiculous amount in my opinion). Well, here in the last month or so he has been researching Antisocial Personality Disorder, Sociopaths and Narcissists. He has changed his behavior to mimic those disorders and admitted that he manipulated his psychologist into diagnosing him with Asperger's syndrome!! He doesn't believe me when I tell him that he was never this bad. I do think that he exhibits some signs of Antisocial Personality Disorder, but he has taken it to the max lately. He has become more intolerant of people, less affectionate, etc. Everything that he reads online, he starts to mimic. He reads about Sociopaths, Narcissists and Antisocial Personality Disorder several times per day. I'm not quite sure what to do anymore. We have split up a few times because of all of this. He has said some pretty hurtful things to me and makes me feel like I am the crazy one.  He has an appointment with a new therapist in a few days and I have encouraged him to get re-evaluated. I am very afraid that he will manipulate her into diagnosing him with one of these disorders that he has been obsessing over. It has become extremely frustrating and has put a HUGE strain on our already troubled relationship. I am currently in therapy for my own troubles, thank goodness or I wouldn't be able to deal with this in a healthy way. I would like some insight on how I can help him, IF I can help him.

75,"I was walking (in the RAIN dang it---darn remnants of a hurricane) like I do everyday, lighter in my pocket, as usual. I was kind of playing with it in my pocket (holding it, feeling it) and I started to get a VERY strong urge to set this building that I was walking past on fire. Of course, I kept on walking, but then I went into this state where I remember walking and seeing things/people but I don't really REMEMBER it. I just remember the vision of flames eating up everything I looked at. The cars in a shopping center parking lot--the people. The only thing that was immune was the shopping center itself, probably because I walk there every day and I don't want it to be harmed. I had such a strong urge to burn that I literally went mad in my head. I don't know what happened but all I could think of was flames...fire...heat...smoke...pleasure. I wrote a prose that I don't remember writing  (hardly). It was SO strange. I finally snapped out of whatever that was on the way back home. An hour had zipped by in seconds to me. I almost had to light toilet paper on fire in the supermarket bathroom to quell some of the angst I was feeling, but I didn't because I didn't want the stupid sprinklers to go off. That would have gotten me caught for sure...and I don't want to be banned from there! That is where we shop for food.  


Anyone have any freaking idea what the good gravy this was? I mean I go into ""states"" when I want to burn so badly and I can't, but nothing like this. I haven't had it again all day now, but I have burned about 20 times which is much MUCH more than I usually do. RIP roll of toilet paper and half a roll of paper towels. Sheesh. What the hell is wrong with me? Wow.

objectively i am quite capable of getting things sorted out for myself but these days small easy tasks that comes my way can make me quite annoyed. I can still manage tasks etc and over the years I keep checking the DSM manual and I never get close enough to qualify for major depression/ dysthymia

I've never had CBT (up to 16 weeks intensive 50 minute per week) before so I'm not sure what's realistic goal-wise.   


I'm going to therapy primarily to deal with depression, also anxiety - from therapy in general I guess I'd like to be able to stop looped thinking (e.g. going over and over my last breakup in my head despite knowing it was for the best and not my fault), have some way to manage when I'm suicidal as I've no friends/family and hotlines aren't an option for me so I'd like tools to get myself out of that mindset...I'm not sure what else.

83,"* Compulsive lying, usually about small things but also large on occasion, to anyone and everyone in my life. I don't think about it until after the fact and my whole life I have pretty much said whatever I feel needs to be said to achieve the results I want, and it feels out of control. I am aware it's a problem and can't seem to kick it.
* When I am in an intimate relationship, I almost always end up demonizing the person I am with. Every partner I've had says I ""forget we are on the same team"" and ""turn against them"". I have a hefty amount of cheating paranoia and often create scenarios in my head of how I am being deceived that seem so real and logical at the time but later I realize these scenarios are ridiculous.
* I change my mind about everything and have a really hard time making decisions.
* I apologize a lot and do not take criticism well at all, it affects me on a ridiculous level.
* Periods of not eating at all, then periods of binge eating, has affected me my entire life.
* I pick at my lips and nails, can't stand or sit still.
* Inability to focus. It has gotten to the point where I'll miss my turn four times and sometimes forget how to do simple tasks. I don't know what is going on around me half the time because I'm so deeply engulfed in my thoughts.
* My inner dialogue is very racy and jumps from one topic to another constantly.
* I can't socialize with people at all lately. I quit drinking about a month ago, and when I was drinking I would include alcohol in everything I did with anyone. Now I'm extremely uncomfortable when I'm in social situations, even sometimes with family, friends and my partner. I get very caught up in my head and over-analyze everything I am saying and doing. This has made it to where I dread having to be around people. I'm quiet and have always been known to be - especially in the workplace and with romantic partner's families - to be very isolate and hard to get close to. 

These are all negative factors that have been severely impacting my life lately and everything feels so much more unmanageable since I've quit drinking. I'm currently waiting on employer health insurance to kick in after 90 days and I make too much for medicaid, the only sliding-scale clinics here in Denver are booking appointments out very far, the earliest so far I've found is December. Does anyone have any of these symptoms or know what the hell is wrong with me? I should add that I'm hesitant to take any medications but I'm starting to really think I need some. I feel like I can't properly interact with the world around me and I'm destroying relationships because I'm so caught up in my mental state. I never feel present.

After that night I had trouble sleeping almost every night and cried a lot of those nights as well...

Being all grown up now (22y) I experience the same kind of intense pain and sorrow. But now I do not necessarily feel it because of things in my personal life. I feel the pain that others are feeling. When I read stories in the newspaper or I see what other people are going through I just break down. I feel so much sorrow. My stomach feels like it’s being gutted, my eyes just water up and I just completely lose myself. 

There are nights where it is so uncontrolable that I just cry myself to sleep, but for what? These aren’t even my experiences. Why am I so caught up in those feelings? It makes me feel so drained and sad and alone.

I know that I feel disappointed in the world, I know that I can’t understand why people aren’t just nicer/kinder to one another.. but is that the only reason why I break down so often?

88,"So, let me start by saying that Im a (female) freshman in college and Ive been in recovery for bulimia for about 2 years, but overall Ive had an eating disorder for around 5 years now, as well as depression and possibly some other issues. I have intrusive thoughts a lot, and lately Ive been dealing with gender/sexuality issues. Im also currently in the intake process for the counseling center at my college. To get to the point, I just don't feel like a good person, or even a person. I hate my body and how I act, talk, ect. I just hate myself. Its like Ive dehumanized myself to a point where its difficult to see just where I fit in with the world around me and even where I fit in with myself. Theres a constant sense of anxiety lingering in the back of my mind, like I have to do something, but I don't know what. Im lonely and Im worried that I won't be able to make any real connections with people. I just feel isolated, and honestly, I don't know what to do. I feel gross, and fat, and although food-wise things have just been okay, Ive been dealing with binge eating. I don't know at this point where to go, and I don't even feel that desperate; its like Im used to this type of thing. Sure, Ive found some solace through working out daily and some song writing, but its not enough.

 To illustrate, theres this inner-dialogue constantly running through my head that goes something like this (excuse the rambling/language):  \*\*\*\*

When I look in the mirror, I don't see a person. I just don't see anything. I hate myself. Im an absolute shit person. I don't look like a person, I don't look like a human, I look so washed out and fucked up, I cant even see what I look like. Nothing makes any sense. I don't like being here. I feel like an absolute waste of a life. I don't look like I have real skin, I look pale and its like I don't look like Im alive. \*\*\*\*

Theres a lot of repetition, and yeah, its pathetic. I know that these thoughts aren't true, but they feel true to me a lot of the time.

He never does any hard work (I always do) and he fucking cleans because it's easier than dealing with customers. Fuck him, I hope he dies.

Anyways, i tend to have an obsessive mindset of having everything to be perfect. Things MUST be controlled or else I'm gonna feel like shit and worthless. I don't care about anyone besides those close to me, and really I'd feel like death would be appropriate to get rid of lazy, unreliable, and worthless people.

90,"It's an irony - I go to therapy to be better, but they end up seeing me as pretty much purely weak so I end up leaving for that.

I have experienced various weakness cherry-pickings by therapists. For example, I talked to a therapist about so many strengths I can provide for a romantic relationship. They then asked me ""What are the flaws you have for it?"". That stung me hard, it seemed to me they were cherry-picking for flaws, rather than amplifying and encouraging the positive traits, and helping me focus on being a more positive person.

It seems thearpy is reinforcing self-negativity more than self-positivity. I can hear that manipulative psycho(pathic)therapist I went to in the form of C-PTSD as I write this. Son of a gun asshole, that person is dead for what he's done to me (and potentially others). Now what you're gonna write? ""If you want him dead then you're a psychopath""? Have fun with that, you'll get reported for illegally diagnosing without a medical license.

The only concern I have is I seem to take my life into my own hands a bit too much. I hate when others try to dominate me over small matters, especially at home. They end up making me angrier, and therapists non-hesitantly antagonize me in general, so I end up leaving them all. I always sense they're bringing me down and want to bring me down more than bring me *upwards*. Moreover, the thearpist I went to who was a perfect fit, and despite my whole fighting for their sessions they would always say they are unavailable, invalidate me when I say they can be the only ones to validate me, and generally teased me for the sake of their pleasure. I mean, do therapists even **want** their clients to have a better life? Or do they just want to choose to mold them into an image or whatever of their own making?

Some people don't realize therapists are all about business, and some therapists choose to see treatments as ""relationships"" and ""commitments"", to manipulate the client into believing they're in for something deep. Well, from how I see it, more like deep **s\*\*\***.

Please help me out. Thank you very much. I really want to be able to sort things out with a more optimistic and reinforcing perspective, rather than the usual critical and judgemental one people choose to spread allot around and about, even if those people are professionals who are SUPPOSED to reinforce and help you out for goodness' sake!

91,"So I've always been and anxious kid and when I was 11 I had a horrible transition to middle school. Because of my horrible transition to middle school I predicted that my transition to college would be pretty bad and planned for a rough transtion. I was correct! I have been having a rough time. My best friend has been horribly mean to me so I ended our friendship and college is just so big and different and I feel the pressure of becoming an adult. I had my first ever panic attack 3 weeks ago. I can't really tell what caused it I just woke up and was hyperventilating, dry heaving, rocking back and forth, and it lasted 3 hours. It ended and ever since then I haven't been the same. 

I have felt more depressed and and anxious overall so I took action and started by taking care of myself. I take vitamins, exercise, make sure I go out with friends and spend time with my family.

The one thing I can't shake though are the intrusive thoughts. Any time I try to have a good time with my boyfriend or friends or family or try getting into old hobbies I get intrusive thoughts that go like ""Why are you doing this? Why do these things make you happy? These are just distractions from the fact that you're depressed and you'll be depressed forever and never get to do the things you have always wanted to do. You'll never be truly happy""

Its scary and distressing. I have never ever had these thoughts happen like this before. I have been doing my best to stop them and it seems to be getting worse. I've always been an optimistic and preppy and happy person. Ive been looking into research about therapy and medication but the world of mental illness is terrifying. It seems like everyone says antidepressants and therapy doesn't work. That's terrifying!

I should also mention I started hormonal birth control for the first time ever 4 months ago. I hope I get some good advice or idea as to what's going on with me. Thank you!!!
