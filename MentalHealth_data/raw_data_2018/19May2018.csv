0,"I'm a mess. I'm awkward to be around. I can never lead a conversation. I try to be funny but come off as weird.

I'm so tired of it. 

Honestly, I don't even know if my friends actually like me. No one ever asks me if I can hang out with them. It's almost like most people don't even know I exist. I'm always worried that I'm basically deadweight to the friend group I do have.  I feel like they only keep me around because they feel bad. 

At this point, I wonder if I should just be alone rather then have friends that feel like a lie.",19May2018,2

""Explain what is meant by multidisciplinary team work. Provide an example. Why is it important for a multidisciplinary team to work toward the achievement of common goals in the field of prevention?

2,"Nothing is rewarding or fulfilling, antidepressants just give me insomnia, Adderall stops the overthinking but leaves me feeling annoyed, and so serious, but with some depression, it's weird. 8 years of isolation and depression, and a family that only makes fun of me for going to therapy.

4,"I'm stuck in a hole and I don't see any way out. 

I've struggled with anxiety, depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts before. Mainly due to my mom being a narcissistic, psychotic, verbally abusive ass. I graduated from high school last May, and ever since then I feel like everything has been downhill. I have my senior year built up in my head as the absolute best year of my life. I had so many friends that I saw everyday, I did okay in all of my AP classes, was first chair flute in my wind ensemble, our music department even took a trip to the Bahamas and I (unable to afford the $1000 price tag) found out a week before departure that another student was unable to go and could not get a refund, so their family decided to donate the ticket to someone who couldn't go. I met the love of my life last March after I got out of an abusive relationship and we started officially dating in June (although we became intimate in April). I started running and going for jogs/walks (something I hadn't usually done) to get in shape and I really loved my body. I felt so confident that for the first time ever I actually went to Victoria's Secret and bought cute bras and underwear and loved wearing them. I even wore a bikini in the Bahamas and over the summer at my pool. I was working at my first job where my then friend now boyfriend also works as well as my best friend and all of my other work friends. I loved my managers, got great hours, and was overall happy. 

Then in August, I started college. I didn't get into the nursing program so I was taking the same classes and planned on applying to the nursing program for my sophomore year. I had to cut my hours so much that I was barely making enough money to fill up my gas tank and pay for food (my mom doesn't buy groceries). I found a great job working at a restaurant and had to quit my first job. I was so sad, but I made a lot of money at my new restaurant job. After 3 weeks an employee who's best friend was my boyfriend's ex framed me for stealing and got me fired. I reapplied to my first job and was told that I didn't come in on my last day, so they weren't going to rehire me, even though I worked my ass off there. I stopped going to my classes because at this point I was struggling to keep Cs and was not going to get into the nursing program. I gave up. I fell into this pit and I laid around for months not doing anything, feeling like a failure. I've gained 30 lbs and I hate the way I look. I only wear baggy t shirts, hoodies, jeans, and gym shoes every single day. I cut my hair over the summer because I had lost weight and it looked good, but now that I'm fat again I hate it. I used to have really long hair and now it's just past my shoulders and curly, so it looks even shorter. My glasses broke and my glasses were a huge part of my image because I felt that they hid a big part of my face. I don't have a lot of eyebrow hair so when I'm not wearing makeup I can't even look in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. I've gotten 3 different jobs and quit/stopped showing up at all of them because it's not the same as my first job. I miss all of my friends and I miss feeling comfortable in my work place. On top of it all, my mom is verbally abusive and screams at me 24/7 and accuses me of stealing her stuff even when I try to talk sense into her.. which means that I need to get an apartment and move out. My boyfriend has very emotionally and financially supportive parents so he isn't ready to move out just yet (understandably). So I have to come up with a way to get out of here and get an apartment (I'm turning 19 in June). Lately I've been really upset by the fact that I missed out on a childhood because of my mom and that my senior year was the best year of my life, and it's gone. I keep trying to get back there and I can't seem to move forward. I have no motivation and I can't seem to force myself to even go to work or try to get back in to school even though I will end up being a homeless shit bag if I don't. I don't know what to do anymore. ",19May2018,1
5,"To start off- several days ago I went to the doctor and got prescribed vyvanse due to poor grades in school, and the like.  

After a few days of taking my medicine, I’ve noticed that I am more anxious and jumpy than usual as well as extreme mood swings I have never experienced before. Looking down today, I realized I had peeled all my nails down to the point that it hurt to touch them, the first layer of skin underneath and around my nails is all gone, and a good bit of the skin is gone off my index fingers and thumb, some places the skin has been peeled halfway down my finger, and the skin on my lips is all gone as well. I usually chew or pick at my nails subconsciously, but never anything like this. 

About 3 years ago I was going through a lot of stuff and my mom took me to see a therapist who diagnosed me with chronic depression and moderate-severe anxiety issues. The depression is still very much alive within me, I have just learned how to deal with/ hide it better. My dad, grandfather, and aunt (plus more non-immediate family members) have all been diagnosed with chronic depression as well. However, my mom didn’t believe I needed medication despite reading text messages in my phone that showed what a low point I was in life that she cried over my well-being and believed I needed to see a non-religious therapist, as well as a religious one. They knew that I never liked the religious therapist (I live in Alabama and he was very conservative, I am not) and didn’t get along with him but they still made me continue seeing him once a week at least 8-9 weeks. All of this was because my parents found out that I am gay and they were initially very hateful about it. I don’t know what it struck, but that feeling of being rejected by my own family made things go so much further downhill for my mental health. So I was left to deal with my mental health issues by myself, as a developing, already mentally unstable teenager. 

My mom never believed that I needed medication for the depression or anxiety, but I got on vyvanse on my own since it has been years and I am now a legal adult and don’t need her authorization anymore. After I told her that I got on vyvanse, how my attention span had already been improving, and how I noticed an increase in productivity she just scoffed and told me that I didn’t actually have AD/HD and I got them prescribed simply because they are a stimulant. I finished my first semester of college with a 0.0 GPA because I didn’t have the self discipline to go to class, the motivation to take notes or even listen and often found myself staring at the smallest distractions for long periods of time and re-reading things over and over again because I obtained none of the information I had just read. 

I don’t know if this sounds crazy or not, but could the lack of recommended medication for my poor mental health earlier in life have anything to do with the sudden changes that I am going through on this new medication? I have always been a heavy sleeper, but now I find that I can sleep 12-14 hours sometimes and wake up feeling absolutely drained- emotionally, physically and mentally. This would happen sometimes before vyvanse but not nearly as severe.  some days I will wake up and the only thing that feels right is to lay in bed and cry. Occasionally I have a loss of interest for everything, yet some days my entire charisma feels like I am in a drug-induced high. Still some days I feel like I can compete in a triathlon on 4-6 hours of sleep. Some days I will be extremely irritable by anything that ever so slightly gets on my nerves- something so small as the sound of someone chewing will put me in a terrible mood for hours and other days I am the happiest person to exist.  There really is no telling how I will feel in the morning and I am tired of living like this day by day, I want to see if anyone here has any ideas? I’m so tired of hiding my actual feelings around the people that I care most about, but I fear that I may be over reacting. So I am afraid to actually talk to anyone about it. If anyone in this thread has any knowledge of what might be going on please lend a helping hand. Thank you. ",19May2018,3
7,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I’m interested in hearing other perspectives.

Often times when I am feeling depressed, I may listen to music that fits that mood and think about the lyrics and connect it with my life. I sometimes get lost in the music which can distract me from tasks I need to complete. (This can also happen with happier songs or other themes, not just depression.)

But what I really identify as a potential issue is when I have some of the more depression-fitting songs mixed in with the rest of my library and they come up while I’m in a better mood(whether it be from shuffle or a certain playlist). It automatically dampens my mood and, if I don’t switch songs quickly enough, I fall back into getting lost in the music.

Music has played a large role in my life, but I’m not sure if listening to music that fits my mood when depressed is actually helping me as a coping mechanism or if it is causing me to get “stuck” in a negative mindset that is holding me back.

Please let me know what role music plays in affecting your mental health and what steps you have taken if you’ve recognized similar tendencies in your life.",19May2018,2
8,"I've had psych symptoms since I was four. \(I recently posted about my whole history so look at my profile under r/offmychest for the deets if you're so inclined\- TLDR: C\-PTSD, BPD?\) When I first got serious treatment at 19 I was gung\-ho to work on myself; to ""fix"" myself.

I've been thinking a lot about choice and will lately. Why does it feel like I lost my ability to choose? Where has my will gone? And the big one \- what do I actually want? That's been scary to look at because a couple of years ago I would have said, ""I want to be healthy and emotionally balanced and well\-educated and creatively fulfilled.....etc"". But now..... I just want this to fucking stop. I feel sick everyday. My heart starts racing as soon as I open my eyes. I can't hold down a full\-time job because I just can't function.

15,"I was in a series of terrible times that lead to a traumatic event at the age of 17. I've just started officially going to therapy last year at 19 (I tried once at 17 but it didn't work out) and I'm 20 now. Throughout then, I've had one therapists and one physician suggest that I might have an anxiety disorder. My current therapist is suggesting something more serious is going on (PTSD) but I've never been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist to receive any medication.

Talk therapy has helped my anxiety a lot but I just learned about splitting and... That's exactly what I've been doing every time I'm in an event that triggers me.  My therapist has never mentioned that term to me before either. I've been having suspicions about developing another mental disorder but I haven't done  enough research about it to mention it and I haven't brought this up with my therapist yet. 

QUESTIONS:
How serious should I be taking these suggestions?
How seriously should I be taking my suspicion? 
Is medication worth it? 
In your opinion is it worth getting checked out or am I just going to pay someone to give me a label? 
What are the benefits of getting a diagnosis? (ex. say that now that I'm diagnosed with something officially will my therapist go more in depth in our therapy sessions or would it remain the same?) 

I've looked into medication before but I didn't think it was that serious and I thought I could handle it... Now I'm starting to think otherwise.

18,"So to preface this post with some context: I live in Ottawa, Canada and I met my girlfriend of 3 months now through some friends. She lives in Montreal, which is about 200km away. She moved there from Seattle WA for university, so west coast USA with a 3 hour time difference. I am jealous of this guy she talks to from back in Montreal \- for purpose of the post let's call him Mark. 

I met my girlfriend \- again for anonymity, Rosa, in mid December. We hit it off right away and pretty much went straight to texting every day. I was really crushing on her pretty quickly, but she already had a girlfriend in Seattle; however she was in an open relationship \(I didn't know this at the time\). So around mid\-January, she started confiding problems that she had in her relationship to me, and so, as someone with a crush on her, I avoided these conversations since I didn't want to give biased advice or anything like that, and just kept telling her you need to talk to your girlfriend. Eventually, she told me that she was in an open relationship \- I don't know how it came up, but I was probably unintentionally prying a bit... But I kept my feelings out of it to the extent that I could. One day, her and the friends that introduced to me all came to stay the night at my place in Ottawa. We got drunk, and I told her about my feelings for her because I didn't want her to keep talking to me about her relationship problems \- not because I didn't want to hear it, but because I was scared of getting in between them. The unexpected happened, and she said that she thought she had feelings for me too. At the end of January, I ended up asking her out, and then a week\(?\) later she finally talked with her girlfriend and the conversation unfortunately resulted with them breaking up because they couldn't handle the distance. We then went our first date mid\-February, which resulted in me having some feelings of guilt about the terms of their breakup \- even though it would've happened either way. 

Fast forward 2 months, it's the end of exams and she starts talking to this guy Mark that I mentioned. She'd known him for months through a club at school, but out of the blue she was going to cafes with him, hanging out several times a week all day, playing those games to ""see how well you know each other"" sort of thing, and the way they just suddenly went to talking every day like that just kind of freaked me out because it was how we started talking. So I started feeling jealous, which is a very new feeling to me. I went a 3 year relationship without ever feeling jealous, and now all of a sudden I do, and I don't know how to handle it. I figured it would pass, it was just a temporary thing. But I kept feeling it for several days, which felt weird to me. So I looked up how to deal with jealousy and most of what I was getting was asshole guys saying things like ""you need to control your women"" and other bullshit. So then I figured it was a confidence/self\-esteem issue, and figured it was because I can't be there the way Mark is, I live 200km away. It will be better when she goes back to Seattle. So she's back there now, and I keep feeling it. She talks on the phone with him a lot, and watches movies/shows with him on [Rabb.it](https://www.rabb.it/) and is content to just sit on call with him and play video games together, and watching shows and playing video games just strikes me as something that's typically really couply. I've expressed to her my jealousy, and told her that I just wanted to be open and honest with her and that I don't want her to change anything she's doing. This is a problem that I need to deal with, and she should not be thinking about this too much. The last thing I want is for her to stop talking to a friend \- or hide a friend from me, because of my stupid jealousy.

Anyways, if someone reads this, I just kind of want some advice on what I should do. I've been trying to work on my self\-esteem, but I don't feel I'm getting anywhere. Now I'm telling myself it'll be better when I move to Montreal \(I was planning on moving there before I met her\), but I want to get rid of this jealousy before then. It's not fair to her or myself to let this keep going on, and so I want to fix this.",19May2018,2

I don’t understand why I always feel this anger, I don’t want to go back to therapy after I just graduated, if I do I’ll probably have to fill out paperwork about my emotions and how I handled them every day.

I cried almost every day for a year after. Still today, the thought of her when im in a mood makes me cry and feel depressed. Every few days or about once a week, I have these episodes where I get super depressed, suicidal, and paranoid of everything around me.        

The common things I think about is how I will never amount to anything, or that every friend or even family member around me is just being paid to act like they enjoy my company or that I have something like autism affecting me. Even when I have these episodes, I know I am not being rational, but I just cant help but feel those things. I don't really know how to deal with this anymore. Every time I go through it, in my head I give myself two options, runaway or suicide.

32,"To start off with a bit of myself, I am a 30 year old Male, with no major health problems. roughly 8 months ago I had some strange numb feeling go across my face and part of my body that put me in the ER, they were unable to find anything wrong with me besides high white blood cell count. 

Out of concern for myself I spent 14 days last month completely cutting off caffeine intake as mine was very high. Since I then I brought myself down from a high rating 1k mg to roughly 120mg daily intake. Those are really the only things that have had any drastic changes in my life.

For my question, lately I have not felt like myself. I have had weird experiences with my thoughts much during the middle of the day at work and sometimes while at home at night, like I'm looking at my life/mind/thoughts as if they were a house, my house. But I'm outside of it and while the house is the same, all the furniture inside seems different, not mine(not an out of body experience). Like my perspective has shifted. Meaning I know my ideas, I know my personalities, ideas and concepts, but when I look at them, I don't feel like their mine at the time, almost like it's a different me judging my ideas based on a different criteria.

The last time it happened I actually thought I was someone else for a short time trapped in my mind/body judging every memory, idea, concept, belief that I had. I even had some false memories to compare myself with from this other personality, almost as if I was role-playing . Not harshly but tearing it apart as if to just analyze it. 

It was rather off putting feeling like I was invading myself, but not as myself. Usually to get it to stop I have to focus very heavily on something, but it only stops the judging. For the rest of the day or usually until I wake up the next I still feel like this other person though my eyes and mind. Each time it feels like a sort of different personality is there to analyze me, never angrily, or nitpicking, but sort of a ""oh so that's why he does this"" kind of thing.

It's really hard to explain, I've never had these sorts of feelings before but they have become stronger and more noticeable over the last several months. I know I have also had an increase in ease of agitation at small details or sudden changes in work flow as my co-workers have pointed it out in concern. I'm not sure if any of this makes sense or if anyone can help me out, but I would greatly appreciate any advice or what you may think it is.

I would like to speak with a professional, but I've always been terrible about seeing any in any field, a sort of fear of setting up new things, not really the outcome or who I'll be with. But of the process of setting it up itself always terrifies me.",19May2018,1

35,"I'm from the UK and I'm 17 years old. I suffer from awful mood swings and intense feelings of sadness/happiness/anger on a regular basis. I have PCOS which also adds to the whole mood swings thing. My mood can change instantly and I can change my mind on how I feel about someone very quickly. I also struggle to gauge how something will make me feel until it happens because of how unpredictable my emotions are. I have said this to a couple of adults and I feel like no one is taking me seriously because this appears to be normal in young teenagers, but even if it is normal, it doesn't stop me from feeling like crap. I am too afraid to get help because I'm scared people are just gonna shrug it off because it's normal. 

What my mental health makes me do is not normal but I don't know how to tell them this. I've been described as manipulative and I do have destructive behaviours when I am angry. I have self harmed before and I regularly use substances. I binge eat and sometimes throw it back up again but no one really knows about that either. I have suicidal thoughts and I have planned out exactly what I would do and when I would do it. I know that I never would though. I'm too anxious. I have previously been in a relationship that I think was abusive? I don't really know. He hit me once and grabbed me a couple of times but it wasn't anything major. He called me a whore and told me hopes I get raped by one of my slightly ""incel"" like friends. I stayed because I felt like I had found a best friend. I guess that is destructive as well? I don't know. 

I need advice on how to tell this to a medical professional so they take me seriously. I'm tired of these constant mood swings and constant change in opinion on my friends. Nothing is stable in my life and I know it's normal but I'm still struggling. Thank youuu",19May2018,3
36,"Something I always notice is how much hate there is,  in the 'mental health' community (online, I mean) to people talkig about the overmedication and its dangers. I see more often people mentioning how much of a gift a certain medication is, but never how sometimes (and usually due to bad professionals) it can be a living hell and ruin your life and health, both physical and mental. 

I am not against medication, I think it needs to only be used as last resort not only resort. My style of opinion is SOOO 'controversial' it upsets me. When I was being overmedicated, having terrible side effects... I just kept being told by doctors that it was for life, and had to accept it. That may need 'more meds' as I go. I only saw positive stories online, and never the most real ones. So I thought me struggling to talk, think or even move was going to be for life. It scared me. I am now medication free for couple years but the thought I may need medication again, even though I am okay with being in a low dosage for some time if I need to (its better than non-functioning) scares me and sends me into a terrible fear and paranoia. Seeing a new psychiatrist in less than two weeks sends me into anxiety attacks randomly, because the fear I will be forced medication again and lose my ability to speak well once more is just... terrible and overwhelming

My memory is gone from years I was on medication, I mean really gone. I only remember bits and pieces because had photos and tried to keep journals, or because people tell me stories, and for some time after I was off I had trouble remembering words or events. Took me over a year out of antipsychotics to regain my coordination and be able to hand write much less draw. Being overmedicated is REAL and is a danger, but why is it seen as wrong? As some kind of crime to mention reality? I completely understand why some people despise psychiatrists, I did for some time. Being threatened with higher dosages of medication is traumatizing, I am not kidding. And takes a lot of inner strength for me to try and see that I just had a bad one, that not all are like that. My mind is traumatized by something other people claim can't happen because to them it wasn't


Truth be told...
I just want people to be able to talk about it without being told 'well but medication saved MY life' or 'medication is NEEDED' or 'you're being rude by dismissing the importance of medication'. Which is opposite of what I mean. I just want to know I am not alone in the dark side of mental health care. The one side NO ONE likes to talk about, sadly",19May2018,2

39,"Hello,

I plan to go to a shrink after school is out this year.  I’m a 27 year old woman and I’ve probably needed to get my head looked at for quite some time. My husband and I plan to have kids within the next four years and foreseeing how stressful that will be we both want some tools to get a handle on our mental health.

The problem is that I know something isn’t right with me but I don’t know what the problem is. Hopefully, a shrink can help me figure out what is wrong but I figure it wouldn’t hurt to see if any of you have a similar experience(s).

 I moved to a foreign country and not having the necessary language skills  really showed me how poor my mental health was. My usual strategies didn’t work here. I’m considerable better now but this period of my life really showed me that my behaviour was outside the norm. Now a list:

1)Mood Swings- I can go from quite content to angry/sad/bored quite quickly. These emotions are extremely hard to control. I can be thinking to myself, “What are you upset about, it’s not a big deal, etc”. It’s really annoying because intellectually I’m maybe slightly disappointed but physically I can be crying or hot from anger. I do my best to rationalize what is actually happening and keep my mouth shut when this happens. Generally, these feeling blow over within 1-2 hours.

2) Fear/Anxiety/Paranoia- This one's a bit weird. When things have been a bit stressful (maybe long hours at work). I can get the feeling that I’m being watched or stalked. Noises will startle me; for example, I will feel like something is going to attack me when I turn on my food processor (it’s super loud). I will also see flashes of shadows or see faces looking at me. It’s one of those things that you know immediately after you see it that it’s just your mind playing tricks on you. Exercise helps a lot with this. This is usually a warning sign that I will have a big blow up.

3) Social Issues- I don’t enjoy socializing for the most part (I’m a real stick in the mud). I have one friend and am very close with my family. I feel very stressed when at social events and feel absolutely drained when I get home. I often think that people dislike me and often have difficulty keeping friends. I feel like I wear a mask around people and am on guard. I can socialize for a maximum of four hours with strangers before I begin to cry or get headaches.

41,"I have lived with my roommate for the last 3 months or so and we became fast friends. I’ve become acquainted with her boyfriend and her friends and we all get along really well. I love where I live and I like hanging out with her. 

We both have mental health issues that we are pretty candid about (we both see a psychologist for these). Yesterday, she was having a particularly bad day and we were in the kitchen talking and she was very upset. She was saying how she was tired of being tired, tired of cancelling plans because she wasn’t feeling well mentally, tired of how much attention she needs to feel well, tired of doubting why people even like her, tired of her body.  She said she wanted to just give up on life and throw things (although she didn’t). 

I’ve been there in the past and I’m in a somewhat better mental state. I want to be there for her, I want l listen to her and help her but I don’t know how. I don’t remember how I was helped before, and even if I did, I don’t know if that would work. I offered for her to knock on my door if she ever wanted to talk some more and offered her some hugs but I felt she wanted to be alone. 

I obviously don’t have the magic words that will make all her pain go away, but does anyone have any tips on what I can do to help her as much as a roommate can?",19May2018,3

On some days I'm OK and I can do stuff without a problem and then a lot of the time I feel really empty. There's this voice at the back of my head that tells me bad things and  I'm agreeing with it or just listening to it. I don't really see the point in anything anymore. Everything kind of seems useless to me. I find myself doing things and soon questioning why I'm doing it. A lot of the time I don't want to wake up anymore and I can't find a reason to get up.
Here's the messed up part- It's like I want there to be something wrong with me... maybe to just give myself an excuse for being such a burden/liability to what feels like everyone around me. I've been having suicidal thoughts and I just feel like I SHOULDN'T be here.
I just don't care about anything anymore.

I could have gotten this done months ago but I held myself back. I'm also trying to get off one of my medications but it's hard and I find myself crying multiple times a day. I'm trying to get off my meds before I'm 26 and off my parents health insurance.

I have a therapist I haven't seen a while because I couldn't afford it but now I can so hopefully that will help.


I feel like an absolute mess. But what's motivating me right now is the fact that I have to do this for my parents.

55,"Hey,

So this is kinda hard to explain, but I'll try my best.

I find my mood can kind of swing quite rapidly and somewhat unexpectedly for very little reason, sometimes It can be influenced by external factors, but often somthing just clicks and I think about the world in a different way. This morning I was playing MTG Arena and listening to music and loving, mid\-day I was obsessing over a negative comment that a co\-worker said to me and it made me feel like shit, now I don't care about that in the slightest, but feel like a waste of space because I'm spending saturday alone again. 

This is always happening, sometimes a few times a day, sometimes only once or twice a week. It just feels like I'm never the same person for long enough. It effects everything I do, at work sometimes I love doing my job and doing the work I do, but dislike the people there. Sometimes I feel like the people are pretty great and I should try talking to them, but then hate the work I'm doing. 

It can be for long\-term things too, like I'm supposed to be making a VR Shooter game with my housemate, but then out the blue all interest i have for it is just gone. 

I have no mental consistency and I think it's one of the reasons I've found myself so lonely at 22.

Does anyone get a feel for what I'm on about, or am I blabbering about rubbish?",19May2018,4

I have a house completely paid off. But I still feel empty. I ask myself every day what the fuck do I do with my life.

I envy anyone who can come home and watch tv and feel fulfilled. I value the brief moments I'm distracted despite knowing they'll come crashing down on me because I always set myself up for failure. Movies and games feel like such a waste of time.

I get into things such as art or sports or guitar and just grind to an incredible degree that I then feel I've quenched my thirst for that activity and then feel empty again, or I'll get cornered and then realize I didn't actually want what I'm seeking I just wanted *something*. My next goal is always more impossible or unrealistic than the last. Always. No achievement will set me free from what I've noticed.

57,"Recently, I've had the 'break'. Bottled up issues come spilling out and my life now is spent trying to pick up pieces of myself. Alongside this, the worsening of autoimmune issues mean I am very physically ill, but a lot of my doctors are saying since most of these issues are genetic and won't go away.

What's concerning me is my current mental 'duality'. My mind has become intensely focused on an entirely fictional female person, which isn't too strange considering my borderline personality disorder, but what has become issue is she has become a third 'thinking voice' inside my head (the other two being my casual self and my serious self). I think the voice is borrowed from somewhere else in my mind, but I can't think where. What's scary is that this thought can become as invasive as feeling like it's taking over my conscious. I do not, however, experience any kind of memory loss or distortion so it's unlikely to be DID.

My doctor said that I'm just being paranoid, but I keep finding myself thinking/wanting to think like a fictional person. Alongside this, I have become more and more phobic of male aspects of my body which happens regardless of my current mental state.

60,"Hi y'all:). A little background info about me: I'm a female, I'll be 19 in a little over a month, and I have depression, anxiety, and OCD. I take wellbutrin and Zoloft. I've been on Zoloft for about 8 years and I've been on wellbutrin for 4 years. 

Lately I have been extremely irritable. This isn't really normal for me. If I'm not hanging out with my boyfriend, then I'm in a bad mood. I'm so happy when I'm with him but he's busy a lot and has other obligations so of course he can't be with me 24/7. I try to hangout with other friends but I find myself wishing that I was with my boyfriend instead. I'm happiest when I'm with him but my mood goes way down if I don't see him for a day or more. My doctor recently upped my wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg once a day. I feel like since this increase in medicine, it's made my irritability worse.

 Before the increase, I would just be sad if I couldn't hangout with my boyfriend but I wasn't in a constant bad mood and could continue with my life. Now, I'm constantly pissed off if I'm not with him. I live with my dad, older brother, and older sister. I get annoyed if anyone but my boyfriend talks to me. I'm really close with my family. I don't think my boyfriend is the problem. He explains to me all the time that we can't hangout constantly and I understand that he's busy. It's not like he's influencing me to not like my family. We don't talk about my family. 

I literally get annoyed if my family asks me to do something or ask what's wrong. I was like this before but not to this extent. I'm lazy so I don't like doing chores and stuff but I used to just get mildly annoyed if I was asked to clean or whatever. Now it just instantly pisses me off.

I know it isn't healthy to be this irritated that I can't be with my boyfriend all the time. I fully understand that he has other obligations and has a life outside of our relationship. 

Has anyone had irrability while taking wellbutrin? Maybe this increase was too much too soon? I have an appointment with the psychiatrist this week so I will definitely bring up my mode changes. Just thought I'd ask here if anyone has experienced the same thing. Thanks!",19May2018,3

64,"A little history about me. Had a rough break up about 1.5 months back. Currently doing a mediocre job where I'm not appreciated really. Things don't go according to plan. But here's something that I came to realize.

I'm dependant on people. It's like I mooch off their lifestyle, not by money or anything. It's like I want to be included in their plans since I've hardly got anything going on my own. Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of stuff I should be doing but they kind of fade out.

I'm afraid that if they find out that I'm just a hack and they could be better off without me, they'll eventually forget about me. Like my two roommates can find a cheaper flat without me (they settled for a costly one when I wanted to move in), I was driving when I had an accident with one of my closest friends (and both of us got injured, me more, but his injury is still on me), my work colleagues enjoy more when they party with others than when I invite them over etc. Even when I am invited to some gatherings, I feel all I contribute is the occasional laughter or nodding or denial.

I've noticed I was never able to positively contribute to someone else's life. It's as if I'm sucking the luck out of them. I'm not openly negative though, I have a normal everyday outlook in front of others.


I've noticed at times I'm really energetic to go on long trips and at times I'm really sad. I can't really open up in front of others as people will judge me and it's not a norm here to go to the psychiatrist unless you're mentally handicapped-you'll be branded as such and made fun out of if people find out. Or if I confide in the wrong people they'll just brush it off as sadness or they'll try to distant themselves cuz no one likes a nutcase, right.

She’s so funny and outgoing and extroverted. I look up to her. But I feel like I only make friends through her. And when I make a joke, barely anyone laughs. My best friend notices it. She says that I’m hilarious when I’m alone with her. And that’s true. I guess it’s just because I’m most comfortable w her. I guess I put up this front at school. I guess maybe I act differently. I’ve been trying to act more like myself, but it’s so hard. To trust people I barely know. I act like I like people I hate.

Last year, I used to have the best circle of friends. I wouldn’t feel so excluded as I do now. It was better. I felt better. I felt better and more accepted around these people. But most of them aren’t around as much anymore. There’s this one guy (J) I was great friends w last year. I even had a crush on him for a month or two. I thought he liked me. But now I feel like he hates me. For example, I was sick from school the last two days, and on Friday, my best friend and my other friend were walking home together. J and his newer friends were walking home. They walk home almost every time I walk home w my friends. But they never talk to us. But on Friday. The one day I wasn’t there. They didn’t just talk to each other, they walked home all together. I don’t understand. 

I want to cry all the time. Anything can trigger it. I have a lump in my throat 24/7. And my parents fighting all the time don’t help. My mom screaming at me every day doesnt help. 

I’ve detached myself from conversation. I just don’t find my best friend funny anymore. That is, when she’s around other people. It’s just the same jokes over again. I’m bored. I’m tired. I don’t have the energy to laugh anymore. 

There are times when I’m happy. I like to be around others. Sometimes. 50/50. There are days when I don’t cry. Where I don’t detach from the conversation. There are days we’re I genuinely try to have a good time. And I do. 

But I’m so tired right now. I just want to know why this is happening to me. What is this?
