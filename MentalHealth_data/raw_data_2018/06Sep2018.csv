I (22m) have been struggling recently with a general feeling of doubt/anxiety about how my life is going, which i think is odd because I think there's some good things going for me. I have good grades in school, am doing a lot with my favorite hobby (music), and I have a lot of different friends that I enjoy spending time with.

However, I cant seem to just be happy with how things are. I feel like any day I'm going to wake up and everything Ive worked for will be gone or that everyone will see me as a fake. 

Also, my mind tends to fixate on anything that isn't ""perfect,"" so to speak, and magnify the problem until I spend a significant portion of my time worrying about it. Right now that problem apparently is the fact that I'm single, even though I know that is not at all a bad thing and there are benefits to being single at this point in my life. Also, I think that even when I have a gf, my mind would simply find another ""problem"" to worry about.

(Tl;dr) So to get to the point, does anyone have any tips for reducing this sort of anxiety and just being content with who I am? 

Thanks for reading, PMs welcome. Peace",06Sep2018,1,

2,"I have an ex, she and I are still friends. We're still close and I have strong feelings for her. Long story short, she's dealing with a lot right now. One of which is going to the gym to exercise. It is a really important factor in her everyday life. We used to go together, until we started having arguments and fights there sometimes over certain things. Now, she associates the gym with me and the fights she had with me. It prevents her from going, it prevents her from feeling confident in her abilities there, people who've seen us sometimes look or ask her questions and so she overall does not go anymore. I feel so much regret about it and I want to do whatever it takes to make amends with it. What can I do to help her stop associating the gym with these bad memories we shared?",06Sep2018,2,
3,"Throwaway account because I'm about to open up about things I've never admitted before. I've struggled with my mental health for years. I was sexually abused by immediate family in my early teens, but never got to process it because of my church's insistence on forgiving and moving on. Never admitted it until I was 17 to my high school teacher at my bible school, which blew up in my face because she told the principle, who told the vice principle, who notified the two main pastors which then called in my guardian who went hysterical. Offered her guidance and nothing to me and never notified police. After that I turned 18 and sought out therapy as I was becoming scarily depressed. Diagnosed with situational depression and PTSD (I feel like everyone gets diagnosed with ptsd these days...). Hospitalized due to a suicide attempt and got put on antidepressants.

They didn't help. Months of experiments with antidepressants did nothing, but worsen the depression so I got so discouraged I just stopped. But then things picked up for me a bit and I felt better. Made a social life and got my own apartment which dramatically increased my quality of life. Then for no reason, another major depressive episode began in June 2017 that left me suicidal for 3 months. Felt better afterwards like things were finally going to be okay. And by better, I mean I rarely slept for the entirety of September because I was constantly partying. Pulling all nighters, working 10 hour shifts, going out again, repeat. Binge drinking and lots of weed. Then I calmed down. By calm down, I mean October I became extremely depressed again and would engage in reckless sex with strangers. Started getting into harder drugs like fentanyl, which was my way of playing russian roulette with my life. Hospitalized after an OD overnight, then released the same day and took a four hour road trip. In December 2017 I started a slow descent into a full on psych break. I woke up one morning and felt normal:

Better than I'd ever felt.
I wasn't tired.
I was full of energy.

So I wrote and painted and worked crazy shifts. Would sleep for 6 hours then work then party. Extremely reckless sex, more fent, binge drinking, and excessive partying. But I wasn't depressed. I was better than I'd ever felt. One day I cut my wrists pretty deep. I felt great, but felt nothing. So I covered up the bleeding with a black sweater and went to a party. Drank there, but didn't get drunk. Tried snorting drugs, but accidentally flushed them. I couldn't stand how numb I felt and just didn't want to deal with work anymore, so I drove myself to the hospital. They admitted me immediately for inpatient care.

I tried explaining I wasn't depressed multiple times. I was the opposite of depressed, but none of the psych nurses believed me or just didn't care. One look at my history and they put me on prozac again. Every morning they'd ask if I felt melancholic and the other questions you'd typically ask someone with depression. After speaking with the main psych and he still not bothering to consider this was a manic episode, I just played along. I was smiling, chatty, restless, barely sleeping because of energy...

but they still insisted I was depressed.

I was discharged after a week and immediately took a cross country road trip after quitting my job. All of January and February is a blur. So much reckless behavior till I finally calmed down and experienced Euthymia for all of March and April. Then in May the recklessness started again. I was going out with this guy and I was smitten by him. We didn't want anything serious, it was all a casual f**k buddy situation. But then when I became more reckless I told him I was on birth control (which I wasn't) and we had unprotected sex despite me knowing I would likely be pregnant. That didn't phase me. I didn't care. I was playing Russian roulette again. Fast forward and sure enough... By then I had calmed down and was dealing with the fallout again. I had an abortion because I couldn't handle it and the guy was abusive (I know I'm going to get so much hate. That's okay, I beat myself up for it every day). Then I fell into a deep depression and cut just about everyone out. A month later I felt great again. Creative wheels were spinning so I signed up for these huge gallery projects which I knew I couldn't realistically complete. Here I am now trying to complete them. 

I don't know what's wrong with me.

Mental health professionals refuse to consider bipolar disorder, so am I just crazy? Is this really just depression. I'm a horrible human being. I've isolated myself so I wouldn't hurt anyone else. I hate this. I hate my brain",06Sep2018,7,

7,"I want to explore the possibility of optimizing my health physically and mentally without the use of medications. I realize this is a pretty controversial subject, and I’ve been on both sides of this thinking at different times in my life, always ruthlessly defending whatever side I was on.

Now I’m trying to approach this as open mindedly and also with as much healthy skepticism as possible... I want to cut through the bs and woo-woo stuff and get to the real science and results that must be out there. 

I feel like everyone has such strong opinions on both sides and very convincing data on both sides. It’s hard to figure out what to trust and what not to trust.

9,"Hey, folks, first time posting here, so bear with me.   


I currently live in Brazil and recently received a job offer that would require me to permanently move across the country (I assume most of you are not familiar with brazilian geography, but the distance is similar to moving from NY to LA). It will be my first actual job and the salary is pretty decent for a first job (I'm 25).  


I'm super excited for this opportunity, since I will be working in the field in which I want to invest my career (Research in Petroleum Engineering) and, as I mentioned before, it would be my first proper job and the money is not bad. I'm currently in the final year of my master's degree, which I still plan to finish, although with some delay.  


At the same time, since I got the job offer a couple days ago, I have been, of course, very excited, but also feeling this sort of fear mixed with anguish, to the point that I have to hide in the bathroom to cry (happened twice). This feeling I have is mostly triggered whenever I think of having to leave my grandmother and my girlfriend here. I have been living only with grandmother since I was 6 and my parents divorced. My grandfather passed away a long time ago, so I have been keeping her company for all these years. She's 78 and her health is not great, and this has been a big concern for me. As for my girlfriend, we have been together for ""only"" 3 years, but we are really tight and have been considering marriage. However, her financial situation and her job prevent her from moving with me for the near future.  


The feeling I previously described has occured to me every time I started a new chapter in my life: starting high school and college, when I went to the USA for a year as a exchange student (shoutout KU), etc. It feels like I'm in a dangerous place and cannot find anyone that could help me. I am diagnosed with anxiety and have been on medicine and therapy for almost a year and it has worked for the most part, but this situation has got me a bit shaken.  


Every one I tell about the job is very happy and supportive, and this has been my main tool to try to defuse these bad feelings. I'm also taking solace in the fact that I can always take a plane and visit home during holidays.  


I imagine some of you have been through similar experiences. How do you folks coped with it? What were the main takeways from these situations for you? Sorry if this is too long/silly, but the simple act of writing this post has me feeling a bit better about the whole thing, Thanks for keeping up this awesome place where we can help each other out.

10,"My ex and I are still good friends, I still have feelings and am hoping to get back together with her in the future. Lately she has been associating bad memories with something good for her. We used to exercise at the gym together on a daily basis and would sometimes get into arguments there. She has very bad anxiety in situations or places outside of her comfort zone, and at the time I was not working with her well and instead just made her upset whenever we would have a fight. We are never able to have a normal conversation about our problems and just work it out, at least not often. Now, she has decided to completely stop exercising there because the memories of us arguing make her uncomfortable there, and she cannot go elsewhere right now. I really don't want her to go through that, it was my fault in the first place and I want to take responsibility for it. How can I help her stop associating our past problems and bad memories with the gym that we go to?",06Sep2018,1,
11,"So a bit of context... I (24m) graduated 2 years ago, and through a crazy turn of event's I managed to land my dream job right out of school. It's great, i get to work on insanely dificult, and cutting edge, engineering. I'm in a workplace where my ideas are valued, and I'm surrounded by people who think like I do....

Now as great as that all is, I find myself not doing anything outside of work. I come home, watch tv, play games, and eat... That's it. Every time that I try to go out and hang out with friends, or go on double dates with my wife, I am just so board. I can never find anyone who I can talk with about the things that I find fascinating. When I do talk about the things that facinate me all I get are blank stares followed by ""yeah, that's really cool"". 

To be fair, that's what I was used to. I had never found anyone who could stomach a full conversation about the seemingly dull topics that I loved. That was normal for me, so I got used to nothing but small talk with everyone. Now ever since I started working with people who shared my enthusiasm about these ""dull"" topics I feel like a drug addict who got a taste of interesting conversation, and now nothing else will do.

15,"For the past two years I’ve been suffering from a TMJ disorder (might be related to my mental state) that’s caused constant pain in my jaw, upper and lower back. I can’t eat popcorn or anything chewy and no amount of therapy is helping. 

For about the past 3 years (I’m 17 now) I’ve been feeling generally unhappy and nervous about everything. I get average marks in school, but I hate myself for it and I keep telling myself I can do better and no matter how hard I study my marks seem to stay the same and I hate it. I’m terrified for my future, I want to get into a good university so that I can get a good career and I feel like I’m blowing it for myself by not excelling in school. 

I’m always tired. I don’t really have a social life and I don’t watch TV or anything aside from maybe the occasional youtube video so I generally finish homework and studying by 7pm and I can go to sleep by 8pm. I get almost 8 or 9 hours of sleep a night and I am still exhausted every single day. 

My concentration because of my tiredness was getting so bad that I was falling asleep in class. For the last 4 months I’ve been on methylphenidate because of this. Without the medicine I feel like I’m dead. I need to take this stuff even if I want to hang out with my friends, read a book or go to the movies because I am an utter disaster when I’m not taking the drugs. I just fall asleep or if I can’t fall asleep I get irritable and angry and tired. I don’t like that I rely so much on the drugs but I literally can’t live normally without them.

My family went through some horrible, horrible things about two years ago. I witnessed a close, immediate family member trying to end their own life and it was heartbreaking and I still feel it today. I’m scared that they will try to do something again, even though they’re acting normal and have been fine for the past months. I kind of blame myself for the incident, I should have gotten help sooner for them but I didn’t. 

The only time I feel happier is when I’m in conversation with my friends about stupid meaningless things, like memes or vines. This is odd because I’m a diagnosed Aspergers and for a long time I avoided social activity. Lately I’ve been reading less, I’ve stopped playing video games even though I loved them.  I love writing as well, but lately all I’ve been able to do is write depressing poetry and not much else. I figure I’m talking to my friends more because it’s something I haven’t lost interest in yet.

I’ve never had thoughts about taking my own life. But I have felt upset with my life lately. I feel like I can do better. I don’t think I’m doing enough. Recently I was placed in a youth conference and I got a trophy, I’ve been awarded for several writing competitions, but I feel undeserving of them. I feel guilty, as if other people are definitely trying harder and doing better.

I have no idea what is wrong with me. My mom tells me it’s because I don’t exercise (which is difficult to do what with the TMJ disorder and all that) and that its because I’m a teenager and that all teenagers go through stuff like this. Am I just a teenager? Will all this stuff blow over in the next few years? I really want it to. I really want to feel better.",06Sep2018,1,

18,"parent suicide

I loved my dad, it was the closest relationship I had to someone in my life. Im 20 years old and in my 3rd year at college. I decided that going into this year I was gonna stay in the city I go to college at cause I love it and enjoy it. Mid july I get a call from my little brother saying hes gone just screaming it. My dad had been fully hospitalized in the past for depression, but at the time of this occurence he was just in partial. My dad was missing for 6 days before they found his body, 6 days of just not knowing and only having a sliver of hope to hold on to, to find out hes dead. The letter he left was brief and did not address anyone or anything, it was sent scheduled email and based on everything of his I looked through he only had been planning a suicide for 2 days. Fast forward a month and a half and im through my 3rd week of school and after trying to be the man of the house and support my family emotionally ive hit the hole where i realize hes not there. I myself have struggled with anxiety for 6 years and depression for the last 4. I have never been at a point in my life where the anxiety is so overwhelming i just cant concentrate and the depression is so dark I cant feel joy and am just going through the motions. I have had thoughts of what would happen if I committed suicide, but never planned or self harmed. But theese thoughts are just stuck in my head and I dont want them there, and i understand that the grief and my dads action have pushed my depression here, but even though I understand or think why I feel some way, Im still stuck and the darker thoughts become more common everyday. The only thing keeping me from doing anything is seeing the effect my dads choice had on those around him and I could never do that to the people I love. I just cant find a way to cope or just feel a little bit better. Im lucky to have great roommates that will listen, but that just helps clean my mind while I talk, but the thoughts come back as soon as I'm alone. I just feel like Im gonna get stuck here.

I am psychotherapy and counseling once a week each and may be adding grief counseling

Im agnostic and grew up in christian household and lost my faith because of how I saw my dad use religion to cope and as Marx says religion is the opium of the people",06Sep2018,5,

20,"Hi, friends!

My therapist sent me to a psychiatric clinician today and I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro to begin taking tomorrow!

I've dealt with minor suicidal ideations, pretty serious depression, and anxiety/panic disorder for the last 9 years or so, and I keep telling myself that it's okay for me to need medication.
I'm really scared, though!

With all of the stigma surrounding medication that I was exposed to while growing up, the awful stories of side effects, and the possibility of them making me feel WORSE, I have always been extremely apprehensive about medication management.

At this point, going to therapy consistently and focusing on coping/calming techniques aren't enough anymore. My life is more or less in order, but I still feel so scared &amp; apathetic &amp; disconnected. So, hopefully medication will help me get it together a little better? But still...

I could really use some encouragement or positive stories! I don't want to keep dreading taking the first pill...

22,"I'm 18m and I've been being more self-aware and honest about my problems. Since about 2-3 years ago I developed a phobia of being alone,specifically at night. Also I worry about intruders in my house. I might be forgeting some but I'm gonna name off the events that likely caused this. About 3 years ago my mom heard knocking on what sounded like our metal door. (She and my brother also appear to have this phobia) she is terrified and says someone is breaking in. For some reason we don't second guess it. Long story short the cops show up and it was our washing machine. Can't remember when this was but it was at least a years ago I was at the park with 2 friends and this homeless guy was staring at us (I think) and i was about to run. I know it's irrational but its scary to me. Now the one that I think really made a mark was when my brother's old friend who he stopped talking to who turned out to be an asshole and he moved away. He would sorta stalk my brother on social media and he eventually moved back. He came to our house when only my mom was home and said he wanted to hangout with my brother. My mom was like no basically. We were really worried that he was gonna come back or break in which never happened. But this was really causing me to worry constantly for the next 2 weeks. My problem isn't as terrible as I might be making it seem but it gets annoying sometimes. What I've been doing to help was to draw back on my past experiences to find the cause as well as telling myself that these things are probably not going to happen. Id think about how I have  2 cops on my block and how I live in a good neighborhood and the thoughts go away but they always come back another time.

23," Do I have OCD? Since I was little I have had strange habits and it was not until a few years ago that these were becoming more and more serious and I found out that this could be OCD. I remember when I was 7 years old I got into trouble for eating something I should not have and my parents punished me, it was there when I told them the following and which I clearly remember: ""I can not control it, it's as if something drives me to do it since I think that if I do not do it, something bad will happen, for example, sometimes I feel that if I pull a string 5 times I will have good luck ""and they just ignored it, and so did I. Since at that age it didn't really matter, I obviously didn't know this would cause problems in the future. Now I am 14 years old and it has been getting worse, I imagine the most atrocious and horrible things and so that it does not happen, I feel that I must do insignificant things. As a child it was something as simple as pulling a list a number of times and things like that, then at age 10 and I imagined that my cousin's baby was going to die, I was in a gymnastics at that time and I forced myself to do a backflip (which I didn't know how to do properly) and I sprained my foot, but I did not care because I knew that I had saved my cousin. Then at age 12 I got into trouble for shattering a glass on purpose, my parents grounded me and I said ""If I had not done that you would be dead"", it got worse little by little. Now I am 14 years old and these things happen to me every day, recently I thought that on August 20 something bad would happen to my mom and for some reason I thought that if cut my thumb with a piece of paper 7 times she will be fine. My parents do not take this very seriously but it is affecting me since I keep thinking about horrible things and feeling that I have to do these things so that they do not happen. ",06Sep2018,1,
24,"*I’LL JUST LIST THE SYMPTOMS AT THE BOTTOM IN CASE YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT THE SITUATION*

I’ve heard people say if you can wonder whether you’re insane then you’re not. My personal opinion on that is that it’s complete shit. My mum was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about a year ago and she’s well aware she’s insane. She has her delusions that she thinks are real, but she knows just from the way she feels that she’s not right. 

So schizophrenia runs down my mum’s side. Addiction runs down my dad’s side - him, his mother, and his father were all alcoholics. This combination doesn’t give me much of a positive outlook for the future of my own mental health. As it is now my mental state is just ugly. I’ve been using amphetamines since October, which is probably the biggest factor in the current state of my mental health. I’ve been using in bursts of extremely heavy use, excluding the first 3 months when I managed to average my use out to slightly more than every other day. This was MDMA and dexamphetamine I was using. My serotonin and dopamine must have been completely depleted. I was basically schizophrenic myself. I was 15 at the time, I’m now 16. I would hear noises, hallucinate sober, occasionally hear voices, occasionally believe there were people trying to break into my house and for about a month I was convinced my face was paralyzed because I had an infection behind my ear which was compressing one of my facial nerves. I was addicted to both drugs, as well as codeine, an opiate. The thing is I don’t feel like I ever got clean, or ever will. After that 3 month period I carried on using enough to keep myself craving the drugs and I don’t know if they’ll ever go away. I still use codeine almost daily. It can take years to recover from the side effects of heavy amphetamine use and I don’t think I’ll ever be in a good enough place mentally to stay sober for that long.

I really do think there’s something wrong with me. So does my closest friend. The drug use I’ve described above is probably the biggest cause of the more worrying symptoms, and a dysfunctional family life is probably the biggest subconscious cause of depression. I never really felt like I had a family. I used to have social anxiety quite badly and would feel uncomfortable around anyone except my mum so I would just isolate myself mostly. My mum’s side of the family lives on a different landmass and my mum would never let me see my dad’s side because they’re generally just not the type of people you’d want around your children, so it was just me, my mum, my dad, my sister and my brother, but there’s an age gap of 12-13 years between me and my siblings and they left home quite early in my life, when I was about 7. My mum and dad were never really a couple, but they tried many times and I had to deal with them splitting up many times. They fought a lot as well, and on one occasion I watched my dad choke my mum. I mostly lived with my mum as a kid but her parenting probably had a negative effect on my emotional growth because she is, after all, insane. 

That was my childhood, the more recent years of my life were probably much more damaging. I’ve struggled with an eating disorder from around the age of 14, and I took this out on my mum which lead to her taking me to live with my dad. Me and my dad lived quite happily for a while even though he was drinking heavily, I didn’t really care. I just really loved him. I’m not sure why. About 6 months after moving in with my dad my mum had to be hospitalized because she couldn’t be trusted anymore as her mental state had degraded so much. She talked about delusions of all kinds and in general just completely changed from the woman who raised me. Her mental illness was my fault. She began to become ill when I moved in with my dad. I treated her like shit to the point where she had to have me removed from the house by the police for no other reason than I was frustrated and wanted someone to take it out on. When I was made to live with my dad I stopped talking to her completely which is when she became ill. 

That’s my mum, me and her get on fine now but I’m having problems with my dad. When I was using MDMA and dexamphetamine heavily I was very close with him but when I sobered up a bit I realized he’s just an awful person. He was drinking 2 bottles of vodka a day, not buying food, and for a few months we had no hot water or central heating. He lost his job because he broke his leg and from there just decided to stay unemployed, spending his welfare money on drink and not trying to get another job. He quit drinking for about 2 months with the help of a drug and alcohol team, made no attempt to get a job, then started drinking again in secret while on a 4 week holiday to Thailand. I have no clue where he got the money for that. No he’s stopped drinking but now he’s taking valium (diazepam). He tells me he’s prescribed them but I can tell from the way he acts on them and the breathing depression he gets from them that he’s abusing them. I don’t think he is prescribed them because he was told when he tried to quit drinking again that they wouldn’t prescribe benzos and he‘s admitted to buying them off a friend before so I know he can. On top of that he keeps kicking me out and the other day I got into a physical fight with him because he was being verbally abusive to my mum when he was drunk. I have nowhere else to live because my mum is living with my sister now because she’s too ill to work and can’t afford a house. 

That’s my dad, I have one more factor which is for some reason the biggest contributing factor to my mood. I was speaking to a girl for just over 4 months and we were the closest I’ve ever seen two people but unfortunately she’s mental too and one day she just blocked me. She keeps fucking with me, like ringing me when she’s drunk and telling me she loves me and acting alright and talking to me for one day and then going weeks or months ignoring me. I still really, really like her and I know I’d fall in love with her again if she gave me the chance but she’s just fucking with me and it’s making me miserable. 

*SYMPTOMS*

•I feel violent and agitated for seemingly no reason
•My emotions and emotional priorities are completely random. For instance: even with everything I’ve been through, I very rarely cry, but when that girl blocked me out of nowhere I cried for 2 weeks straight. Sometimes I cry for no reason at all
•I fantasize about hurting or killing people I dislike
•I find it difficult to complete ordinary tasks such as showering, brushing my teeth, eating, going to school, etc. 
•I fluctuate between being completely narcissistic and hating myself
•I get paranoid that one day something will happen that will ruin my life
•I still hallucinate when sober occasionally 
•I sometimes don’t know whether to trust myself. For instance: I think about whether I really even know who I am
•I have gone more than a week without changing clothes on more than one occasion
•I have major suicidal tendencies
•I feel emotionally numb sometimes, I have no motivation and have lost interest in most of my previous hobbies
•I talk to myself, as if I were talking to someone who isn’t there
•I have lost the ability to concentrate almost entirely in some situations 
•I go 24 hours or more without sleep sometimes
•I have some kind of obsession with religion. I am not religious
•I used to go on long walks that would last hours for no reason
•I go through very short episodes (only lasting a day so) of finding it very difficult to articulate my words
•I go through phases of being obsessed with girls. These obsessions last at the least a few months and at the most a year or more
•I used to think all the girls at school hated me and talked about me behind my back (which turned out to be true, someone told me)

I know I’m not schizophrenic. I just feel like I’m starting a very long phase of getting ill. I know no matter what anybody says that I do not feel normal. ",06Sep2018,1,
25,"Hiii! This is my first post on Reddit. Surprisingly, it's the reason I got a Reddit in the first place, to come here and hopefully some people can listen, and I don't have to worry about my fans reading it all.   
I have a Tumblr, under a different URL, and...I mean I love the site, but sometimes its toxicity is just hard to escape. That and I feel I've exhausted my friends a little with my venting cause they don't know how to help :(

///

(WARNING: I'm gonna be talking a lot about some heavy delusions of mine, and my perception of a false reality.)

///

So, anyways, here's my deal...

I've started having this sort of delusion, I think, that's incredibly hard to shake. It's like the Truman Show syndrome, but...different? I've always, since I was a kid, thought that windows and mirrors were cameras so I would talk to them often as if there were an audience listening.

Lately, since hearing about the plausibility that we live in a supercomputer that we're unaware of, it's somewhat shifted to a kind of mindset that we exist primarily in a video game of sorts. I mean, me openly discussing this with my fiance has garnered some funny jokes, but it's largely because it...kinda scares me. So I use humor to hide that.

I've begun assuming the world changes based on what I say, think, and do - and I've been on the fence that people in my life (family, friends, enemies, even my fiance) are somehow false. That they may be actors, or roleplayers, or NPCs - predestined to serve a role.

I don't think I'm the main character - not at all. I don't think there really is one single ""main character"". If I were one, I'd be one of several. I more often feel that I'm a sort of ""self aware"" or ""meta"" character. The one who knows it's a game and just lives life like that.

Sometimes I'm even convinced that I'm part of a larger group of people, who have been subconsciously sent here to this ""realm"" we're in. From what or why, I'm unsure. Sometimes I've fallen asleep and dreamt of a completely separate life - one that felt so real, and has an actual plot to it akin to any normal life. Sometimes I'm worried that I'm still dreaming, and that the ""realistic life"" in my dreams IS the real me.

Anyways, I don't know what this might be called, or what it might be a symptom of? But maybe someone listening can help a guy out :) if not, then maybe just, anyone out there might be able to relate?

26,I dont remember when this started but it was when I was young. Everytime I have a interaction with someone else negative or positive i keep rethinking the same interaction thinking I may have ruined any possible kind of relationship with the person for days. This has lead to me always stressing even though there doesn't seem like much to stress about leaving me up late at night just full of regret thinking of how I acted. I don't know what I should do or if this is normal im too shy to talk about this to my immigrant parents because they wouldn't understand or talk about this to my close friends because because our whole vibe is to keep things positive.

27,"I have BPD (diagnosed 1st of June 2017) and while I've made tons of progress, I'm still having trouble facing my emotions.

I was aware I had been doing that after I had surgery because I was too sore and exhausted to hide them but now it's happening again and I'm unaware until it all comes out.

32,"My partner of two years, after I expressed my suicidal thoughts, said ‘go on then, stop existing, go away’. The next morning when I expressed I wanted to see a GP about this he said I was lazy and I just wanted drugs. Also that I made him very sad and embarrassed last night when I started crying when we were out with his friends (I didn’t want to cry, but I couldn’t help it). He also, that same night, left me on a bus. I’ve moved to London to live with him, and am not yet fully familiar with the bus routes. He left me on an unfamiliar bus when I was at my most vulnerable. There have been many moments like this in our relationship.

33,"Ok so for context I’m a 16 year old male. So I’m a sophomore in high school, I failed a year after being taken out of school because I was not going at all. Because of this (before I was taken out) I was admitted to a kind of mental hospital? I don’t really know what it’s purpose is but it where a lot of the delinquents and suicidal people go. After I got out the doctors told my mom that I had depression, which makes sense as I would cry all the time before going to school in the 8th grade. I haven’t taken any medicine for it since I was diagnosed. The next year I start just not going to school again so my parents forced me to move in with my dad and my stepmom (which I hate) and my little brother. At school I was always alone, I didn’t have any real friends to hang out with but I stuck through it and got through the year. I moved back in with my mom this school year and so far I’ve already missed 9 days, and you only get 5 unexcused absences before you flunk all your classes automatically. I haven’t had the strength to tell my mom because if she found out she would send me back to my dad and i wouldn’t be able to withstand another year of that. I really want to stay but if I keep missing eventually the truancy officer will contact my mom and everything will come out. But I just can’t force myself to go to school. I’m always alone again, nobody ever talks to me, im socially awkward and I’m always too nervous to talk to anybody, I’m ugly and overweight so nobody wants to talk to me anyway, all of my classes suck and I’m just unmotivated to do anything with my life. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m way too lazy to do anything. I would have already killed myself if it wasn’t for me being too scared and not wanting to make my parents go through that. My life is just a shitty downwards spiral. I always find myself having a panic attack. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like I’m just a burden to my mother.

34,"First of all sorry for my bad english.
I can't really say when it began but in the last few years my mentalhealth got worse. I'm in a state where I lost all my passion for everything. It's hard for me to get exited about things. I isolated myself as far as I could infront of the PC. Literally staring at the screen for ages while thinking about what to play or to do.

I was unable to get to a conclusion what to do with my life - in the sense of working. I always have bad thoughts: ""i am unskilled in life. I can nothing except playing video games. Even if I try i will fail""

I just want to isolate my self more having as less social encounters as possible. I am pretty much in a state where i dont care for anything - not for other people, not for me. There is probably much more i am not aware of. But it sums up to:
I am boring. I dont like myself.

Until my best friend (he also got some social issues) invited me to travel with him on a working holiday visa. My first reaction was an instand no. In the end he convinced me.

And here I am now writing this text while sitting in a hostel on the other side of world from my hometown.

Beeing away from so home so far away doesn't bother me really. But it brings a whole new bunch of problems:
This hostel is more like a big house - many 4-bed rooms, downstairs a kitchen and a living room.
That means even at my room there is no safe harbour.
I feel very uneasy in the shared rooms mit many people around. I Get like a weak paranoia thinking things like: ""everyone is watching me or talking about me in their foreign language"" even if I know that the people i meet here are really nice.

I just cant really get in smalltalk with them. i dont know what to say 99% of the time. They have so many things done in their life and had so many different experiences - and then there is me just able to nicking polite with my head. I mean I dont have to start talking about videogames noone will be interested. Neither I can start talking about my feelings to people i hardly know. 

Talking in general is hard for me. I used to be a happy and loud person but like I said in the beginning the last years made me to a very quite and closed person. Saying ""hi"" when i enter the living room full of people so loud that everyone can hear is almost impossible. Saying ""hi"" or whatever when i pass someone the first time on the day is exhausting and I feel also unwell.

One girl here called me once ""mr.emotionless""
That fits pretty much my outside appearance.

I didn't talked much about my buddy. Most of the time we are together when in the shared room. That helps a little bit but since he is also unskilled as fuc... In having conversations we are the 2 unsocial guys here.

Working unfrequently because of the bad job situation right now is just an extra worry about the money.


I am doing this travel to get a better person but all it has done yet is to face more problems than at home. Should be pretty obvious but it sounded for me like a good idea to therapy myself.

I just don't know how to carry on. Every morning waking up and hoping only we both are in the room, afraid of going downstairs to the kitchen/ living room/ having a smoke.

Don't get me wrong I want to life because i know how much joy it is to be happy and want to achieve my life goal which gets me to stand up every morning again: having a family
...well I am in my early 20's and still a virgin that is also a thing that stucks in my head. 

Sorry for the mess and wall of text but there are so many things right now i cant even sort them myself
I am just hoping that I put most of the important things in a good sense and you guys got some tips/advices.

Cheers

35,"My friend, F, 16, 110 lbs, 5’1, said that this only started yesterday. She’s hearing casual noises that aren’t there like for example a toilet flushing or a door closing or someone walking their dog outside. She hasn’t started any new meds and doesn’t do drugs. She has type 2 bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. She’s only on meds for anxiety (zoloft). She hadn’t had anxiety attacks for two years but the past few weeks she’s been getting 1-2 a day. There’s been no recent trauma in her life. She’s also on birth control. What could be the cause of all this? I’m really worried about her",06Sep2018,1,
36,"Long story short, something set me off and I started to get a really tight chest, my heart was racing, I was really nervous, my hands were shaking more than normally, I was on edge (every noise near me made me jump) and I was very fidgety

But the different part of it was that I was at work and I acted completely normal to anyone around me, like I kept moving and doing my job and anyone who came up to me and asked me something I still acted like I normally would to them. I have no idea why I acted normally when I was completely freaking out on the inside. And this attack lasted a lot longer than the ones I’ve previously experienced have. Usually when I have an attack (I’m going to the doctors tomorrow to figure out exactly what it is) I cry, can’t breathe properly and have to sit down to calm myself before I can function normally (usually about 5 minutes) 

So I guess I just wanted to vent and ask has anyone experienced an attack and still been able to function normally? ",06Sep2018,1,
37,"For years I've tried to ignore and lock away my belief that I'm something akin to the plaything of a malevolent otherworldly entity that's able to reshape and distort my sense of reality. This notion, as seemingly bat-shit crazy as it is, was the only way I could seem to justify to myself, or at least attempt to quantify these incredibly terrifying episodic experiences that I will shortly get into explaining.  


Until very recently I have always thought that this *kind* of experience was unique to me. It isn't something I've never been vocal about or kept to myself, it's just that the truly alien nature of what actually happens during an episode is, without some objective reference, impossible to properly unpack and understand, let alone verbalize cogently. So my attempts at describing it have invariably been met with confused looks, shrugs, and *shot in the dark* attempts from others (doctors, mental health assessors, psychologists, psychiatrists, siblings, family, friends) at what I'm trying to explain to them. Oft misdiagnosed as panic attacks, or the colloquial vagueness *""waking nightmares"",* or some other panic/anxiety centric label, too often focusing on the physiological, outward behavior I exhibit when an episode hits, (re: pace about terror stricken making frightened noises, hyperventilating), and not the inward subjective, qualia-centric level of ontological experience where the seat, seed and sustenance of such terror resides.  


Apparently, what I have actually suffered from since around the age of 6, isn't the periodic, mischievous machinations of some extra planar malevolence, but infact a rare and particularly unknown brain disorder quite peculiarly named *Alice in Wonderland Syndrome.* I have problems with this name, it tends to lean to a presumption of this condition having some positive aesthetic to it. **It doesn't**. When it happens it is without fail an overwhelming and existentially terrifying experience. A more apt name may be something like *infinite hieronymus bosch space-time nightmare syndrome.* It comes closer to the nature of the thing, at least.  


I will be describing these experiences through the lense of my childhood, when the vast majority of these episodes occurred, and also more generally and descriptively. So, where to begin...  


When an episode hits, it starts, I suppose for me, in the somatic domain. Edges of things become too *thin*. Say as you're sitting, you can feel your clothes, maybe the slightly higher pressure on your arm at the edge of an arm rest as it lays on it at an angle. All the little bits of the world around you that are pushing into your skin in some manner. My perception of those *bits* becomes heightened as they shift into something *thinner and harder,* as though all those pieces exist on the tip of a single pin, or along a really thin wire. This then spreads across my whole somatic sense where any part of my touch I focus on seems to exist at a single infinitely small point, there is a very discomforting almost electrical graininess to everything. Like running something very small between your fingers, except that tiny point encompasses everything. My body feels tense, like an anxious rigidity, only while this happens I can touch and see things and I know they're normal. It's just that everything *feels* as though it's all a single point, and that point is infinitely big. The initial wave of panic hits.  


As this occurs, time *goes awol.* Everything becomes manically fast while paradoxically feeling like there's an infinite amount of time between each moment of existence. Every *tick* of reality is an eternity, and each tick is crashing at light speed into the next. This is a terrifying experience. It's too much, it's too overwhelming.  


All the while I'm still in bed, I *know* only a few moments have passed, but time has stopped making sense. In this perceptual *mode* It's as though I've already been here forever and each rushing moment, that forever is getting infinitely longer. I get up and pace around because I'm panicking. I can tell that I'm moving at a normal pace. But I'm also moving at 500 miles an hour. There's this weird temporal echo to everything, like a *trail* in time, or that things have sort of spread out around themselves temporally. Everything takes both forever to happen while also happening at no time at all. It's really hard to explain this. There's a sense of confusion in *when* things are. everything is now, and now is simultaneously an infinite expanse and crashing forwards in manic procession. All the while a sickening, nauseating terror grips.  


Every sound can only be described as *on edge.* Every noise is booming and angry, they're too quick. There's a manic chaos to everything, yet an infinite terrifying vastness and stillness. Someone speaks and it sounds like they're about to cry and angry and terrified. There's a manic urgency, like the world is screaming just behind the curtain of normalcy and it's seeping through into every utterance of sound, coloring it with a desperate urgency. I can *hear* that the sounds are normal, but they're *not.* The absolute alien absurdity of it all makes me want to throw up, I can't handle it, I want it to stop but each terrifying moment crashes into the next.  


As I'm out of bed pacing around I can see my environment, I notice that I'm the size of a titan and the room is a *vast* expanse*.* I look down at my swinging hand and It's a million aeons away. Even though I know it's just right there at the end of my arm. My hand is a single infinitely small point in space permeated with an electric graininess. The space between my focal point and my hand is this titanic, curved arm bridging what can only be described as the non-euclidean expanse between those two reference frames. But I know it's just my arm and I'm just in the room. I can *see* that this is true. But the room and I are *wrong;* and distance, and size, and proportion has all become extremized out to the peripheries of comprehension. Everything still *looks* normal. But it *isn't.* It's as though the entire perceptual make-up has shifted, where a different mode of comprehension, that's all messed up and discombobulated is interpreting what I *know* is just me in a room pacing about for a few minutes.  


Internally, the panicked manicness of my mind is surrounded by a fumbling, sort of verbal garbling. Like an alien tongue reciting some incomprehensible chant that sits somewhere in the middle distance and comes from nowhere at all. It's like a muffled shouting rambling drone that endlessly cycles. Along with the somatic warping, this *""sound""* is the second most predominant indicator that an episode is about to hit.  


\-Sometimes I hallucinate mental imagery, like two giant balls spinning in opposite directions crashing into eachother, with each crash sending waves of panic through me.  


Everything I have described here appears roughly at once. With the weird thin feeling generally being a trigger and leading edge of an episode, with the garbling sound and speeded up pace letting me know a full blown attack is happening. Attacks usually last around 10-15 minutes, but I'm often unsure as to how much time has passed after the fact, until I've settled more and can re-orient myself again properly.  


This is what Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is like for me. my younger years were plagued with these panic inducing experiences, especially frequent when I was sick with fever. Though they have tailed off significantly over the years, where they hardly ever occur any more.  


If anyone else is out there that has experienced these kinds of attack, and, like me, could never get any answers about just what the fuck was going on with you. I want you to understand that you're not alone. I've been there too. I know *that uniquely potent fear.* And There is a name for what happens to us. We're not just crazy.  


I felt I needed to share that, for educational purposes and I suppose to get it off my chest now that I'm going through a real road of discovery and healing having finally *named the beast* after 25 years of having this dark and confusing question mark over my head.

  
It's definitely a very unusual condition. Which is why it's taken me so long to actually even begin to know how to get answers for exactly what happens. And I'm so massively relieved that I've been able to do that. It's been an absolute game changer for me.

And while I’ve gone through periods of anxiety and stress when things get really intense, mostly they feel high energy and they go as quickly as they come, and the anxiety would give way to productivity and I’d get through it. But things feel different now. I got back from the summer and I’m back in grad school and I just feel so, so blank. The anxiety I feel isn’t high energy, it’s just this always-present looming dread that I’m not good enough, and I’ll just sit and cry for a few minutes  at a time and then everything will be flat after that. It’s like my body gets so stressed out that it finally just breaks, and instead of productivity I just feel nothing.

It’s ruining my friendships because I never respond to people and it’s ruining my relationship and I feel so guilty on top of the stress and the numbness, but I still don’t change anything. None of this feels like depression though because I never want to kill myself and it doesn’t feel as horribly sad as what I always though depression was. I’m not sad really, I’m just... flat and excruciatingly bored and unproductive and I feel like I would go to drastic measures to feel something again. Maybe this is TMI but I’ve gotten really into BDSM recently because when I’m being hit (safely and consensually!)

This is a terrible and disturbing story.

[https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/three-year-old-survived-for-4-days-on-scraps-of-bread-after-mum-killed-herself-at-home/](https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/three-year-old-survived-for-4-days-on-scraps-of-bread-after-mum-killed-herself-at-home/)

Short Story: She has 2 kids. 1 was with the dad. 1 was with her. She texts her mom to come get her daughter because she is about to end it. Mom says, ""Don't be daft."" She hangs herself. 3yo struggles to survive on her own on bread and butter for 3/4 days before she is found. Mom says there were no signs of mental illness. Friends say they just wish she would have reached out for help.

She did.

Desperate people do often reach out for help. They either are not taken seriously, or... the person is uncomfortable and doesn't know how to help so they say stuff like, ""It'll be okay. Be positive. etc etc"" Don't be crying at the funeral saying you had no idea when you have messages in your inbox that say otherwise. For anyone that reacts to this story by saying, ""I could NEVER do such a thing with my child present."" Consider yourself blessed/lucky/fortunate. Congrats, you've never had to experience that desperation and lowness.

\*\*\*\*\*If someone reaches out to you, PAY ATTENTION!!! And get them help for God's sake. Professional help. Immediately. Go to their house right away. Take them to the Dr/hospital. You are too far away or can't make it? Call someone that can. No one else can? Call 911. It is an emergency. Treat it like one. Would you rather them be pissed off at you for a few days because you sent them to the hospital or dead? Your choice.\*\*\*\*\*

It doesn't have to be this way. If we would just accept the fact that your mind is part of your body and should be medically treated just like the rest of it, we wouldn't see this as much. The stigma on mental health is still present and strong as ever. Depression is seen as weakness instead of illness. You can't fix your kidneys on will power and positive attitude alone and you can't fix the chemicals in your brain that way either. Grow up. People should be comfortable seeking help and being treated without judgement. In fact, they should be ENCOURAGED to get help. Yes, even by people who don't understand it. You don't have to understand how cancer works to support someone through treatment. You just have to be a caring human.

You can't shame people out of surviving and them shame them when they don't survive.

44,"Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit ever. I've read good things about this place, so I thought maybe getting some extra help here may be useful.

I am a university student with a history of depression, anxiety and insomnia. In the past four years, I have tried many treatments (CBT, counselling, mentoring), including two medications (Sertraline, Mirtazapine). This year in May, I reached the lowest point in my life after being refused more CBT, failing to gain access to counselling, and most importantly realising that Mirtazapine was not working all. I was already suffering from burnout from my studies, and as things got worse, I realised that I could no longer go on like this. I opened up about my mental health to many people, including my family, friends, and a few trusted members of staff at my university. Thanks to the latter, I was allowed extra time on my assignments, which enabled me to take time out from my studies to work on myself and my mental health before I could return to working productively. Since May, I have successfully submitted three assignments on time, and I am now working on my dissertation while I continue to take care of myself. I am very proud of my progress so far, and I feel that I am on the path to recovery, as I go on and learn myself how my mental health works and how to manage it properly.

However, after so many months of examining my own mental health, there is still an aspect of it which baffles me. This is my inability to deal with strong emotions, and in particular with extreme happiness. Basically, anytime something great happens to me -- I go on a date, I have fun with friends, I reach a professional milestone etc. -- I feel the need to cry, and not crying from joy, but despair. My practice of letting my emotions out through crying has developed over the years, but this is what I do now. I lie in bed in my room, with my eyes closed, usually in darkness. Then I put on my headphones and play a certain piece, Hans Zimmer's 'Time' from the soundtrack of 'Inception'. As the music starts and builds up in its wonderful crescendo, my breath becomes deeper. My heartbeat increases. My limbs, then my whole body start tensing and shaking. My throat closes up. And as you imagine, I cry. But it is not a normal cry. It is not like when you watch a film and are moved to tears, and you start weeping gently, sweetly. Mine is a cry of despair. The cry keeps building up until the piece reaches its climax, and so do I, and as I push my body forward, I open my mouth wide in what can only be described as a silent scream. As the piece ends, I remove my headphones and sit on the bed, and then let myself go to weeping. If the emotions behind my crying were not so strong, my weeping lasts no longer than 5 minutes, and then I am free to go back to normality. I find that this is a rather cathartic experience, and sometimes I do it on purpose, to release any pent up emotions and just go on with my life. However, if the emotions which triggered my crying were extreme, then my weeping lasts much longer, and in my despair I will lie on the floor, sob deeply, even struggle to breathe, and have other violent reactions such as screaming, punching things etc. These episodes, which I usually refer to as 'crises', are very rare, but when they occur they are so unhealthy that for the next few hours I feel empty, unable to do or feel anything. For me, it is the worst thing in the world.

Now, last night, I had one of the best evenings of my life. I went out with this girl I chatted to online, and it was incredible. She is very beautiful, definitely out of my league, but also very interesting and kind and sweet. We went for a walk and then for dinner, and we got along so well. At the end of the evening, I told her I had a great time, and to my disbelief, she told me the same! I walked her home, then walked home myself, and as she had asked me, I texted her when I got back. We chatted for a while, with the same vibe as we had had the whole evening. Then I wished her goodnight, and was a bit disappointed that she didn't reply back. But to be fair, the same thing happened the night before our date: she told me she was going to watch some series before going to bed, so I wished her goodnight; she didn't reply then, but she did the next day, so that was cool. Same exact thing happened last night: series, goodnight, no reply. But I didn't care. I was so happy I had met this girl, I told my close friends about it. And I told myself that, you know, even if things do not work out as I hope with this girl (she is way out of my league, so I wouldn't be surprised), I am still so happy we met, since she lives in the area we can still be good friends, as I've done with other girls in my life. 

However, as I was lying on my sofa, drunk and happy, a darkness came upon me. 'That's it', I thought. 'Just like my first date ever: lots of emotions, will cry a bit, then off to bed and goodnight.' Goodness me how wrong I was. I put my headphones on, played the piece. But when the music and my crying reached their climax, what followed was not weeping. I was gasping for air, tears trying to stream from my eyes, but unable to, such was the pain I was feeling. I thought that the worst crisis I had ever had was when my long-term girlfriend and I broke up in February: I had a similar reaction to the one described above, triggered by the sadness of that experience. But this was much worse, and it was not from sadness: it was from happiness, perhaps the most extreme happiness I had experienced in a very long time! How could I feel so desperate? How could I scream and shout and punch the floor and the walls? Ask for God to kill me and to put an end to my misery? And, voice broken with sobbing, lament my existence of always having to feel everything so deeply, so intensely, my blessing and my curse, my destiny of eternal unhappiness. It was grief, as if I had just lost a dear one, perhaps myself, feeling so alive in my emotional outburst that I wish I were dead.

So yeah, that's it, just like I told you. Sometimes, I feel so happy that I have to release my emotions with crying, and sometimes this crying is the most unhealthy thing in the world. Despite all my reading about my mental health, and even my personality (I'm an INFP if that is of any help), I still don't understand how something like this can happen. Like, I can explain my depression, anxiety and insomnia... but this? This is what I would like to ask: Why do you think I do like this? Do you do the same? Especially with extreme happiness turning into utter despair? Also, what would you call these crises that I have? Is it an anxiety attack, or a panic attack, or whatever? Do you think it has to do with mental health or is it part of my personality? Does anyone know how someone can improve at dealing with such strong emotions? And perhaps most importantly... my mental health, I know now how to manage. Routines. Drink and eat well. Exercise. I know what I have to do in terms of managing my lifestyle as a means to take care of my mental health. But this? How can I solve such a problem if it occurs even when I'm feeling at my best, as I was before it happened? Do you think I can do it on my own, or maybe I need some help (perhaps counselling)? 

Also, and this is the most difficult thing... I still don't know exactly what triggered my crisis. Is it because she didn't reply to my message? Or because I still have feelings for someone, i.e. my ex girlfriend, and so my reaction was triggered at like unconscious level? I say this because it's similar to what happened on my first date ever -- before I went out with that girl, I had had feelings for another girl and was still sort of thinking about her at the time. Perhaps it's just that I commit myself emotionally to people or things too easily and I take more time to let go of them than anyone else, and so I need to be more careful before moving forward? And again, is it just because of the way I am, or perhaps there has been some trauma in my life which causes me to behave like this? It just bothers me so much, because I'm so empathetic when it comes to other people, I always want to help them or at least support them in their struggles... and I feel so much about everything, and I love it, because I can love literature, art, music, and I even make music myself, and it's so beautiful! But this is such a dark side of it, it ruins everything. 

I will speak to my family and friends. I will ask them for support. They have been better than I thought so far, especially my family, since in the past they were sort of against me talking about these things when I opened up to them individually, but came to their senses in May as I told them how serious my condition was. Still, I can't help thinking that, like with my mental health, this is something only I can solve. All I ask is, if anyone knows what I'm talking about and feels like they can help me answer my questions, do let me know! Perhaps you can help me make sense of this mess. I am happy to provide further details for anything which may help to make the picture clearer. Sorry for the likely many typos, and thank you in advance for your understanding, patience, and support.",06Sep2018,1,

49,"I just woke up from a dream.  I’ll be careful to say that this wasn’t a nightmare, and I’ll also make very clear that the fact that this woke me up at 2:00 in the morning at the age of 29 is not, as one might assume, some indication that I have been plagued by this in some form or another for any significant portion of my conscious adult life.  It was water under the bridge until about an hour ago, but now it’s time to jump in.

By way of a little context, you should know that, because of a writing project I’m working on that involves a lot of reflection and candor regarding my mental illness, I went to bed just having written some simple facts about the way that mental illness affects the body, and I was describing one’s relationship to physical pain that one can do nothing about; the way you become numb to and “accepting” of the miserable injustice of it, the way that it vanishes in good times and kicks in while you’re weak and vulnerable.  I was writing about the bleak stoicism that it engenders, and about how it shrinks from scrutiny in a way that prevents you from confronting it properly.

In short, the demonic spectre of the physical ills wrought by mental illness is a coward, one that towers over you when you’re small and runs away when you get any kind of strength underneath you.  It was the seeds of these thoughts that were with me as I went to bed, and while I slept they grew into the following:

The dream begins with my mother getting a phone call from a certain person who is known to me as a friend and colleague of my father’s but is a stranger to her.  It’s present day now, and I am not a child.  I overhear this person speaking in carefully guarded legalese that indicates that my father is on some sort of a tear, but admits nothing and is careful not to say anything specific.

A few moments later I open a door because my father has arrived, and I see him but he doesn’t see me.  He’s younger than he is in real life, but not by much, and he’s wearing a lot of black, which is relatively uncharacteristic of him.  As I start, with trust, good faith, and innocence, asking him what’s going on, he catches sight of me and immediately rounds and punches me square in the nose.  I stagger back and flail, disoriented, trying to come swinging back at him, but he catches me again in the same way, blocking my efforts to return and we grapple for a minute before he vanishes.

Now, I think, if this had been a nightmare, that would be where I would have woken up.  But the dream goes on.

Before I know it the confrontation has disappeared, and he’s acting like it was nothing.  He’s sheepish and defensive, asserting that he did nothing wrong, and I can’t seem to get him or anyone else to say otherwise.  The next thing I know he’s sitting a few rows behind me in a darkened movie theater, and I get up and go confront him, sticking my fingers in his shoulder and demanding an answer, and he continues to justify himself.  My view flips back and forth between him in the seat and him on a stage in front of the screen, justifying himself to the audience, making me culpable for his actions and placing the blame on me, and as I turn back to him in the seat and scream, “Liar!” he says, “It’s not as pathological as it seems.”

I snap awake, wide awake with utter physical and mental clarity, angry, and after a cigarette and a few minutes of watching the cursor blink on my phone I press send on a text reading, “You shouldn’t have hit me when I was a kid.”

It is, as far as I can remember, the first time I’ve put this to him.  It’s still the middle of the night now, so I’m not surprised he hasn’t responded, but a part of me was thinking, “Fuck it, if I’m up at 3 in the morning dealing with this shit then he should be too.”  I hope it hits him like a ton of bricks when he wakes up.

I want an apology.  He should show some shame.  And finally, after 20-some years, I’m strong enough to pursue that.

When I was a child, my father’s method of corporal punishment, which he smugly and self-aggrandizingly referred to as “behavior modification”, was peculiar and, I should imagine, relatively unique, in that he often felt compelled to justify his actions by reading me the Bible verses that gave him the divine license to do so, as well as those that prompted him to do so on each particular occasion.

We were a very religious family, which he’s admitted to me in so many words was a function of his and my mother’s complete lack of confidence in being able raise my siblings and me without the guidance of the church and their own narrow explorations of the wisdom of the divine.  Among other things, this involved the classic, “Spare the rod...” bullshit, which he took literally.

He was a lawyer, and I guess he felt the need to conduct mock trial before himself and his god, with him playing all the roles except for that of the duly chastised recalcitrant.  In any case, there was nothing I could do or say about it.  It wasn’t enough that he could bully me with his authority as my father, or that he exploited the threefold difference in our sizes.  No, he had to corner me intellectually too, which he always could because, as I’ll remind you, I was 8.

But the simple fact was, as much as he liked to believe that he was some enlightened father, instilled with the placid, ancient wisdom of the godhead, he was just as subject to frustration and feverish annoyance as the next garden variety parent, and as much as he rationalized it later the impetus to strike me only came from ire and caprice.  As much as he wanted to dress it up as discipline, it was only ever punishment, and retribution.

“And fine,” you might say, “what’s wrong with punishing kids?”  Perhaps that’s a subject for another time, but what I can say is that whether you engage in that sort of thing or not, you’re really, really not supposed to hit ‘em.

People seem not to understand this, so let me explain the obvious:

1. Your inability to control your anger and frustration are not the fault or responsibility of the child.  You’ve had 20 or 30 years to get a handle on that shit, to learn how to manage yourself in general, and they’ve been working on themselves for less than 10 (if we’re generous enough with you to count from the beginning).  You ought to be better at that than they are.  Just because you think you get to make your own rules for what happens when you get mad enough doesn’t make it so, any more than we allow that for the children themselves, or for any other member of our society.  Your lack of self-control is not an appropriate basis for their suffering.

2. Your ability to hit your child without any meaningful backlash is only a function of your exploiting the helplessness of their stature.  A heavyweight and a welterweight are more evenly matched, and you’d treat them with more respect if you thought they could hit you back and do any real damage in the process.  You victimize them by definition from the start, and only because you’re big and they’re small.  Your fear of bodily reprisal is not a good basis for civility.

3. Your failure to think creatively and dynamically about how to engage with your child at a level they can work with and understand is not the child’s problem.  Your child is not a miniature adult.  Their brains and their minds do not play by the same rules as yours, and because yours is more advanced the burden is on YOU to find the common ground.  If you’re so pathetic that you can’t find any medium between adult reasoning and the language of violence, then that’s on you, not on them.  Your stupidity is not a justifiable basis for their pain.

4. Taking the nuclear option, your last big guns in a fight with an opponent over whom you are determined to triumph at all costs, specifically and self-evidently takes it to a level beyond that which the child can understand.  By what is often one’s own admission, the goal is to supercede the intellectual challenge that you can no longer keep up with, and replace it with the imbalance of force that will enable you to win, and this isn’t playing fair.  What’s more, it’s doubly unfair, because only you get to make that decision to take it there.  Your willingness to break the game is not a good basis for victory.

5. Most importantly, though, the actions and the dynamics I have described completely distort and discount everything you claim in fairer weather to be true about the nature of your relationship with your child.  How are they supposed to believe you or trust you when you say that you love them, or that you want what’s best for them when you’ve gone regularly to the dark side just to get your way?  How are they to keep from feeling as if that’s only true when things are good?  Your willingness to sacrifice their wellbeing when it suits you is not a good basis for trust.

6. And by the way, if you’re trying to rescue yourself from any of this by reassuring yourself that you don’t really hit them *that* hard, thinking that there’s some element of self control or restraint in that, ask yourself what it matters when you *could* hit them that hard if you wanted to.  Ask yourself what it matters when that’s as hard as they’ve ever been hit.

The simple fact is that in all of this, the very failures that that kind of violent reaction exhibits are those that it encourages in the child.  Getting to that level of anger and frustration, failing to think beyond it, failing to communicate, failing to preserve the safety of those around you, failing to be constructive, failing to control yourself, all of these things demonstrate in no uncertain terms to the developing brain of that child that making the effort to succeed in those things is not the way that it’s done.

Of course their behavior gets worse, even if they manage to put on an act for you.  Of course it bleeds out onto those around them, and if nothing intervenes, one day onto their spouses and their own children.  Because you’ve shown them, just by breaking the rules yourself, that those rules don’t matter, or at any rate that they don’t matter when you’re really, really upset.

The truth is that when you’re really, really upset is when those rules matter the most, and if you can’t muscle up to that it’ll be that much harder for them to ever know that doing so is even possible.  We all pass things on to the next generation that were passed on to us, but you’re only ever offered one opportunity to break that cycle, dig in your heels, and say, “I’m going to find another way.”

P.S. - I’ve spoken with my father, who responded just the way he should have, and we’re going to work it out.  But I’ll say here what I said to him, which is that I don’t think parenting is a pass/fail kind of thing.  I don’t think it’s all or nothing.  He may have been shit to me at times when I was little, but that on its own isn’t the whole picture.  He’s still my dad and he’s a good one.",06Sep2018,1,

Every couple of months or so I go through these horrible phases where my thoughts aren't me.

 I start dreaming about doing awful, horrible things like cheating on my fiancé, running away with a circus, finding a sugar daddy. I stop wanting to get married and start feeling suffocated. I spend loads of money on stupid crap and my work performance decreases rapidly (my career is very important to me). I want to sleep with every man that I see, and I get obsessed over a man that I met two years ago who probably doesn't even remember my name. I binge and spend way too much money on food even though I'm working very hard at losing weight.

When I'm feeling well, I am committed, reliable, dependable, sensible etc. I wouldn't say I have depression but I do have times when my moods go way down and then way up.

54,"I want to tell a story, how i survived almost 2 years battle to get proper help to my mental issues.

Living in magical fairytaleland Finland, where we have almost free healthcare system, best in the world! Sounds good right? ""Free"" medication and therapy for poor! Where i can sign. No, don't.

I have lot of mental issues (panicattack from age 10, from child abuse family, depression, suicide attemps, anxiety, u name it) so after 10 years if sorrow, breakups, bad habits, drugs/alcoholproblem i finally decided to get help. 

First they sent me to place where they suggest ear acupuncture to my stress. (I tried to kill myself week before) get diagnosed to adult life crises.. well shit, all my problem was the crisis all the time. Soon they realised that maybe this isn't the problem. And they send me to alcohol users psychiatry center. Well soon also they understand that alcohol wasnt my first problem, and then i didnt need help anymore. I was shocked. Trying to get some help, they send me to wrong unit to get wrong care, and now i'm feeling better! This took almost 9 months.

After that something start to happen, finally someone listening to me, get right diagnose: Borderline. And they promise to take care of me. Well guess what. They forgot to send my papers, so i wait 3 months for nothing.... i was at startingpoint again. So finally get myself to psychologist, just to heard that this is going to end soon after three months... well that three months was awesome, but what after that? 

They tried to get me to therapy. And after 4 more months waiting, they said that this isnt right place to me.. almost killed myself again. After that my doctor said that im too ""fuckdup"" to get help or medication. Wow.

So now almost 2 years have passed, and today i got phonecall, im starting 1,5 years therapy in unit where they start taking care my traumatic history, and my borderline. I'm so happy that i cry now. From joy and good. 

I want to say to everyone who is fighting to get some help. Just keep fighting, you are good at it already! I lost 6 friends on past 2 years. They were fighting too. They left behind kids, stories, their life. (everyone was under 40yo) and just because they didnt get help. I hope you all know that you are fighters, keep fighting. Hope someday you will win the battle.

My real war is just starting. Wish me luck, I want to survive and win again.

My thought is that the exercise does work really well and makes me feel good (because I am normally enjoying it and not worrying about anything else in the moment - one of the very rare ways that happens) but only whilst I’m doing it and I then get a pretty instant comedown afterwards once the endorphins have worn off.

57,"I don't want to go to a professional and pay all that money just to get some answer or whatever. It's just a label to me. I don't need a diagnosis or anything. In fact, not having one is best, because then people won't judge me without meeting me. But, I *am* curious as to what you guys think.

So I'll admit I have some quirks. But who doesn't? The stereotypical, such as eye contact and whatever, are present. I, admittedly, don't like eye contact. I make it, because that's how I was raised and my mom forced me to as a kid, but I hate it and if I'm allowed not to then I won't. But I do because I have to.

I rock. I know I rock. It's a tick. It's a thing I do to chill out. Everyone does something to chill out. I either rock or I bounce my leg. If I'm sitting down criss-cross or standing up, I rock. If I'm sitting in a chair, I bounce my leg. It's that simple, nothing too out of hand. And I can stop whenever I want to. I mean, sometimes it starts back up without me knowing, but I can still stop it whenever I want to.

My friends say I can be a bit blunt. Yeah, I can. Yeah, sometimes sarcasm goes over my head or a joke or something doesn't hit me until later. But I still get it. And phrases like ""curiosity killed the cat"" don't confuse me or anything. I mean, I don't know why curiosity did. Maybe because the cat's dumb and shouldn't have tried to chase a pigeon on a power line. Who knows. Not me. But still, like sometimes my friends will say something, and I forget that I'm supposed to ask ""what's wrong"" or ""well why don't you come with me to \[insert place\]"" instead of ""okay"" or ""then I'll go by myself"". It happens.

The thing my friend says is most ""concerning"", however, is the fact that I just don't get some things emotionally or socially. I know how to see emotions. Or I know the formula to emotions. If eyebrows are knitted together and there's a frown tugging at someone's lips, they're upset. If someone is laughing and smiling, arms spread apart and body language open, then they're happy or excited. I know emotions, I'm a writer and an actor, and I've been told I'm pretty damn good so it's not like I have a convoluted sense of emotions and stuff. But, I admit, I don't like emotions. They're stuffy and annoying and they stress me out and I don't do well under stress. I don't like emotions and I don't get some things, such as why people will be unconditionally loving and kind to others. She says that's a sign of autism. I say it's a sign of strict parenting and my personality.

I also don't like touch. Like when I'm happy, yes I'll hug and hold hands and stuff, but when I'm stressed, just don't touch me lol. Leave me be. I need my space.

Oh, and just because I can go on a rant-tangent about things I obsess over, apparently that makes me autistic too. Like, I switch interests pretty quickly but I still remember all the things from the past obsessions I had. I admit, I obsess. And I jump from obsession to obsession. But that doesn't mean anything people fixate. My dad is fixated on his girlfriend that doesn't make him autistic. My brother is obsessed with weed that doesn't make him autistic. I'm fixated, currently, on a videogame. That doesn't make me autistic either.

So, my friend, a psychology major going into grad school next year, says I have low level autism, or I'm low on the autism spectrum. I say I'm just weird and that's how it is. I don't want a diagnosis, she wants me to get one. Why do I need one? It's just a label. It's just saying ""hey you have this congrats"" like if it were depression or schizophrenia where I required medication and, therefore, needed a diagnosis then cool, yeah, I'd get one. But it's autism. I mean I don't have autism (or I don't think I do) but we're *talking* about autism and autism doesn't have a cure or anything so why does it matter?

my mum kicked me out of the house at 17, and through the ages of 17-19/20 i was a homeless teenager strolling the streets and maybe sofa surfing sometimes with all sorts of thought and emotions, i had a girlfriend even through all of that but she fell pregnant and said she couldnt have a tramp as a dad so she got rid of it which cut me real deep as i always wanted to be a father because my dad was never around and i felt like i wanted to do what he couldn't but who was i kidding.. in the position i was in i would of never have succeeded, at 19 i got accepted into a homeless shelter which most people would consider good, but such of a distrust i had for everyone, even the people who tried to help me i couldnt handle being away from where i was homeless as i couldnt be free, i saw so many fucked up but really lovely people in this shelter, i have seen things that they have done in my head that never leave me too... one women taking heroine and when her shot didnt work through the needle she ripped it out of her leg which was gruesome and i still see it to this day, the people in the shelter robbing everyone for like £2 and it leaves you in a vunerable position when you dont know who can help and who cant...

&amp;#x200B;

i got out of the system near my 21st birthday when after almost 3/4 years of unstable moving about i got a flat to live in... well now i know when you see very disgusting places what happens... i didnt know how to live, scared about what was outside my door, so pissing in bottles and cans and throwing them out the window and only really leaving the room if i needed to go for a poo which i would hold and i wouldnt go to the toilet for like 5/6 days i was so scared what was outside, so after 5/6 months the community had a bqq event and everyone was welcome, i decided to overcome my fears and try to meet people after barely leaving my flat... i met a girl (wont be putting names) who i got along with really well but there was no physical attraction it was literally just a friend bases, she wasnt the best person to meet she always kept trying to get money off me in the end and i was a pushover at the time so i always gave it and left myself broke and lonely and empty, after two years of living there and having to deal with this girl making my life a misery she got a boyfriend who robbed me and tried to set me up by dropping my wallet (which he took) in the back on the cab he robbed, the police even come after me and put a warrant out for me so i was constantly living in fear, i went to my housing and got a move to down the road in a new place at 23 where i met my now partner..

&amp;#x200B;

now this is where it gets abit more serious, i got told i had anxiety and depression by the doctors and i didnt know how to react as they offered me little to no help.. i couldnt deal with just some of these problems i had been through, what ive listed is only a few things i went through in those years and they haunted me forever, the mistrust i had received from friends and family i couldnt cope with the thoughts and dreams i was having i had to release i had tried the doctors and they had tried weak antidepressants but it was no help... so i started cutting and stabbing myself alot... only shallow cuts with knifes and stabbing myself with pens.. but cuts &amp; stabs nonetheless..

&amp;#x200B;

i had a massive phobia of hospitals from a young age after seeing my friend in there and i had to go to surgery , the first time i went i had a huge anxiety attack and for nor love nor money could i stop crying and shaking and having this overwhelming feeling of doubt that i wouldnt even leave the hospital... my health started to get worse, weekly i was cutting..  i couldnt get this through when i was signing on at the job centre and they sanctioned me for just under a year, so now im struggling with my mental health big time, the shallow cuts have turned to deeper cuts to cope, suicidal thoughts and actions where happening.. my partner fighting knifes off of me because im trying to slash my juggular because i had nothing and got no help, no money and could do nothing.. i couldnt even speak to my partner because of how bad my mind was.. for 2 years i just deteriorated with no help and doctors just throwing depressants at me and me having to deal with everything by myself because i couldnt trust anyone and with all the side effects from the Anti Depressants i was everywhere, my body was not me anymore and i just felt numb..

&amp;#x200B;

 i go to the doctors and explain how im feeling and i get told now im suffering with psychosis and that im delusional and i need to take these other tablets to combat that, ive also had ADHD test which pretty much came back as i had Hyperactive Tendancies or borderline ADHD.. and now on the exact day as my birthday.. i go to the doctors and they given me a list to best describe who or what i am? i relate to quite a few things on this list and now im starting to think i have 6/7/8/9/10 problems with me and i don't know what to do or who i am anymore?? am i just a stereotypical nut job who destined for an asylum in a straight jacket for the rest of my life and how do i combat these tags of this and that? do i embrace what i have become or do i stop it all before it all comes to much.. i dont know what this is and this is my first post to hear by apart from my partner and a few therapy sessions here and there i never really have trustworthy people to talk to who dont even have to relate to me just understand that they have to be patient with me and that im a really nice person behind all these tags..

59,"Hi all,

For the past year or so I have noticed that my little sister (15 years old) has been exhibiting many signs of depression, anxiety, and also possibly an eating disorder. She does not have a good relationship with my mother at all, and constantly lashes out. My mom is worried but also doesn't really understand mental illness.

I have dealt with depression/anxiety/ED, so I get it, and I've seen her start behaving in ways that I did when those illnesses really started to take shape for me. I don't really even know how to explain the symptoms specifically, I just know that I can see them in her. I've tried talking to her but she never talks about her feelings (much like me.)

(Okay, this is the part where everyone is going to hate me, but) the other day I also read her journal while I was over my parents house. She said over and over how much she hates herself, how she doesnt want anyone to have to deal with her, how everyone is ""sick of her shit,"" she wants to hurt herself etc. I really don't want anyone to lecture me on how I shouldn't have read her journal, I know I shouldn't have but I did. 

I'm really concerned about her and want to help her. In addition to all of this she has the usual ""no one understands me"" teenager feelings to I don't know how to reach out. Does anyone have experience with reaching out to a younger sibling in this way, or advice in general on how to reach out?",06Sep2018,5,
60,"I have schizoaffective disorser- bipolar type which i'm being treated for. I was prescribed antidepressants along with my antipsychotics, but I dont take the antidepressants because I just dont believe i'm depressed. My psychiatrist insists that I am.

From what I understand of depression, it can cause you to feel numb, lose motivation entirely, lose joy in things you once loved, neglect hygiene and surroundings. I do not have those issues.

When I take online diagnostic tests out if curiosity, they score me to have major depressive disorder (I have schizoaffective which would explain scoring that way, but i'm not /that/ depressed.)

Symptoms I believe I have:

-Extreme sadness especially during a low mood swing
-Severe guilt and a feeling I should be punished
-Fatigue 
-Agitation and irritability 
-Isolation
-Suicidal ideation
-Sometimes slowness in activity, especially at work.
-Hoplessness/seeing my future to be very lonely and sad.
-Loneliness
-Poor sleep habits: I stay up late and my sleep is disturbed because I am always waking up in the night. 
-Emotional sensitivity 

However I do not have the ""tell-tale"" signs plastered on social media:

-Neglect of hygiene 
-Over sleeping 
-No motivation (I do what I aim to do, I go on with my life well. I seek my goals)
-Being debilitated by staying in bed all the time
-Neglect of surroundings
-Loss of joy in once enjoyed activities

Is it possible to be severely depressed without those few symptoms? My overall disorder: schizoaffective is debilitating but not depression, which feels more like a side effect than the disorder- if that makes sense. Being depressed does not debilitate me because my actual disorder does that. Depression is just on the side and hard to deal with occasionally.

72,"So if you're depressed and filled with self resentment/loathing/low self esteem, I think it's better to start off thinking positively by avoiding things like ""I am great"" ""life is amazing"" ""i am the number 1 person of all time"".... Start with what feels like a light load - ""life isn't all bad"" ""i do have some good qualities"" - ""i'm not completely fucked up""... also, another tip is use paradoxical intent - if you have an insidious and definitive thought that haunts you that you want to shake off, instead of fighting it, just intentionally think it, almost in a forceful way, and your brain somehow begins realizing how stupid and irrational it is. 

A deep rooted complex can be slowly chiseled away at until it's less neurotic, this way. Don't be afraid to have a period of slightly challenging thought process - it'll get you further to tolerate some negativity at the start, than to just think ""life is amazing I am wonderful and all my insecurities are bullshit"".",06Sep2018,3,
73,"I feel awful and I think there's no way of getting out of this. I've been depressed for over a decade now. I have periods when I feel okay, even happy and healthy, but those are always quickly overcome with periods of meaninglessness, anxiety, self pity, self hatred and guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I have been feeling so awful, it's even hard to explain.  I go to work every morning, and I feel like I'm dead inside. There's nothing I look forward to and nothing that would make me happy. After work, I have whole lot other stuff to take care of, because I thought I'd feel happier when I am busy. But those things don't make me happier either, I just feel tired, drained, like I never have enough time for anything. When I get back home and relax, I feel awful for relaxing, not being productive, I just feel guilty and useless. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many things I'd love to do and try, but I never have the energy and the motivation to do them. That only leads to more guilt and I feel like I'm wasting my time, my life and nothing ever makes me really happy. Sometimes I feel like I'm physically not capable of experiencing happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't experience sadness or melancholy, like I used to, when I was younger. Now it's just pure numbness, emptiness, to the point it scares me how empty and numb everything feels. Sometimes, everything seems almost unreal, not really there.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to a therapist and she told me, that I have a lot of inner energy and life inside of me and that other people with depression can't even get out of bed. She told me to use this energy to do what I love. I really try to do what I love, but I just.... don't have the energy to. My therapist treats me like I'm more or less fine, like I just need a life guide and things will sort out for me, but I feel like a waste of a human existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that on the outside I seem like I'm fine, all sort out, but I'm not. I just have these awful thoughts in my mind that I can't get out like how terrible person I really am, how I'm a waste space and I don't deserve people to like me, because I'm selfish, lazy and careless. It feels like I'm at a war with myself all the time and I keep on losing and losing and losing...

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, I thought that my issues would solve by themselves, but it doesn't work like this. And I feel like it will only get worse, it won't get any better. Like.... I really don't have a chance for a redemption and this will only continue until it will eventually kills me or make me destroy everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about going to a psychiatrist, but... I don't think I'm that bad and maybe... I actually don't fit a diagnosis, maybe I'm just an awful person and that's it. Even my therapist thinks I'm not low enough to visit a psychiatrist. And I don't really know what do to...

Possible CW; drug use and slight self-harm(if it can be called that)

So about three or four months ago is when the ""issue"" started. One night while trying to fall asleep I got this strange sensation in my left arm. The only way I could initially explain it on the first night was it was tingly. I thought it was one of two things, the first, because I always assume the worst, I thought it may have been a heart attack, because that's how people say it starts. The second possibilty in my mind was it was just asleep from laying weird and it just feels different than usual, for some reason. I decided that just going to sleep is my best bet, if I don't wake up it's a heart attack, and if I do then it was just a weird thing. But I couldn't sleep, no matter what I did to take my mind off of it, it was still there in my head, taunting me.(not actually, but that's the only way I can think of to explain how blatantly inadmissible it was in my mind while trying to sleep) As the night continued, this one thought kept coming up, ""this isn't my arm."". I initially just suppressed said thought, it was obnoxious and my tired brain was just being dumb. But it just kept coming up. 
""this isn't my arm.""
""this isn't my arm.""
""this isn't my arm.""
Eventually I woke my boyfriend up. I didn't want to, because I've had past issues when trying to sleep that have made him, and others I've told, consider me ""crazy"". Not in a mean way, I just can't think of a word for it.(I don't want to go into these issues as I feel they're not relevant, but I will talk about them if someone asks or thinks it could be related, but I highly doubt it is.) Anyway, I woke him up. I was extremely tired, angry that I couldn't sleep, and worried he'd dismiss me if he was too asleep to realize I needed help. He turned over and asked what was up, I blurted out that my arm doesn't feel like my arm. He stared for a moment then asked what I meant. I explained everything that had been happening. He said to try and put all of my weight on it to make it go numb, which didn't work to get rid of the thought. Eventually after his tired questions and possible fixes, I told him not to worry about it and to go back to sleep, I'll figure it out. The last thing he said before turning was, maybe I should get up and do something with my hands to see if it helps. So I did, and the sensation was still there after playing a round of a game on my computer that requires that hand to move a lot on the keyboard, and also after using a controller to just force my fingers to move in a different way. I sat on my couch and watched a nature documentary and eventually passed out. I don't even remember falling asleep or laying down on the couch, but like I said, I was extremely tired. I woke up and it was gone, so I chalked it up to a weird night and left it at that. Then it happened the next night. I was quicker to pass out because of the lack of sleep from before. And this continued for a couple more days. 

I was talking to my mom who commented that I looked like shit.(in a loving way, she was worried about me) I had bags under my eyes and looked like death so I couldn't blame her for the comment. I didn't want to tell her about my issue because she was a nurse for the elderly and disabled people, so any issue I have is instantly met with an assumption that it's one of the health issues one of those groups usually experiences. So I just told her that I had been having trouble sleeping, and explained only the portion about not being able to sleep and left out anything about my arm. She's a bit like the ghetto pharmacist(like V from S1 of Shameless if you've watched it) in the sense that she has a lot of prescriptions for various issues and ailments that she doesn't take, and gives or sells them to people who need them but don't have insurance/Medicaid.

81," 

I'm 18 and I am 90% sure I have OCD, going outside is really stressful for me and when I come home I absolutely HAVE TO shower with 99.9% bacteria killer handwash (yes, on my hair aswell) before I can feel comfortable or sane again. I also do alot of other irrational things, the list is far too long to mention here and it grows by 1 new behaviour on average every month or two. Going outside is a sacrifice of sanity that I have had to make to go to school and the consequences are tough, the hand wash is horrible for my hair and even worse for my skin which has always been especially sensitive (I think that's where some of the trauma comes from, I've had more than a few conditions which were really scary to deal with). Thankfully I'm done with school now but that doesn't save me from having to go outside. I've been needing to move away from my family ASAP for the last 2 years, I really can't handle them. Even an average person would say that they have poor cleaning habits and I used to think the house was dirty way before I developed these compulsions. There have been and still are points where I seriously want to die or think I'm going insane. Everyday it's like someone is crying in the background and I'm constantly reminded of all the suffering that makes up our world - childrens suffering, animals suffering and my own that I can't escape.

I have to go outside to earn that money to move out and save myself some suffering. I can't decide on what I should do. I know I 100% absolutely cannot stop the handwash showers, I limited it to twice a week max so I don't harm myself any further - that means I can only go outside and work on two selected days. I also came up with the option of getting another bed and working 5 days a week - between working days I can use this bed instead of my real one, that way I won't have to have a handwash shower for 5 days in a row. I don't know which I should choose - the 5 days a week will let me take on a £20k apprenticeship and ensure I can move out in 12 months but I don't know how long I'll be able to keep it up, it will consume me eventually and I don't know if I'll make it out alive. The two days a week will keep me sane for longer but I won't be able to move out in the next year at all :(

I should also mention that my family are very disfunctional, extremely unsupportive and always closed off. I don't have a healthy relationship (if I can call it that) with either of my parents or siblings. They're quite conservative too, my mum thinks it's shameful to have a child that has mental health challenges (she doesn't know about mine yet) and they fit into the typical homophobic, sexist and religious family. I can picture my mum telling me that Jesus is the answer to all my problems if I ever confessed about how I feel. I've been sharing a single bedroom with 2 sisters and 1 brother since I was about 13. I don't know what to do :(

I want to reiterate the point I made about the 5 days a week without using handwash consuming me because I think most people would automatically advise me to go for that option, when I say consume I'm talking suicidal thoughts everyday and one day per week of what I think is maybe an episode of depression. That was my average week when I was going to school everyday, since the holidays started 3 months ago I have only gone outside twice -I still get the episode once a week (once every two weeks sometimes) but the suicidal thoughts have calmed down. I don't know who to turn to, I have to go outside to see a doctor and I'm terrified of CBT. I also cry REALLY easily, I don't want the doctor to sit and watch me cry for 30 minutes. I have a feeling they might declare me unfit for work, I have dreams and goals that I really want to work on. I really don't know what to do :(

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice would be appreciated.",06Sep2018,2,

Thing is occasionally I can feel exited or happy about something but it doesn't last for more than a minute before I have a flood of thoughts on how I'm worthless or won't succeed or something. Anyway, how can I work to hanging onto that feeling for longer? It's the most amazing thing in the world, and I'm only like this maybe once a week if I'm lucky.

83,"As long as I remember my father has been over baring. I moved out of my fathers house when I was in the 6th grade. 

I went through a lot of verbal abuse. A fucking lot!!  Alcohol made the problem worse. Father almost broke my wrist. You see my father was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 5’11 200LB and a Asshole/smart ass combined with his ADD,Manic episodes and his OCD. 

Father does not work. My mother’s the only one that works. He removed all the handles off the stove because he’s scared we might burn down the house. He won’t let my mother cook. My brothers or me. Btw I’m 27. I’ll be in my room reading a book. He’ll come in and get in my face yell at me saying dumb shit like”you can’t speak up” “ can’t respond” I get pissed every time I think of my father. We’ll be in the house. He’ll tell me to roll the windows in the car up......
One car ride will equal 7 jobs I should apply for when I already have a job. 

I suffer from panic attacks. From my alcohol drug abuse. Btw I’m a year sober. I’ve experienced psychotic episodes while I’m induced. Over work I’ve experienced high high and low lows. Now I suffer chronic depression. I don’t want to end up like my father. 

Btw I’m moving back in. Take a part time job. Get a degree in the health field. So I can help ppl in my situation.  Also I’ll be volunteering for suicide awareness. 

But long story short. Every time I think of my dad. I get angry and I’m pissed all the time. I used to put a smile on dealing with my depression. Being a really nice guy. Now I’m just pissed all the fucking time. My father and my kids mother are TOXIC. It sucks I cant look at life in a positive way like I used to. Thanks for listening ",06Sep2018,1,
84,"Good evening, or whatever is the time where you live!

I don't know how to start, so I'll just do it.
I've suffered from anxiety all my life -- varying from general to social anxiety simptoms. The social ones, there were a lot of them.
Since then, I've come far with the help of therapy. It has changed me, and as of now I have no more panick or anxiety attacks, and my social ""skills"" have gotten a lot better.
Though, something still persists. Some things really specific, actually.
The biggest of these is without a doubt a phone call.
Any phone call.
It makes me really anxious, very agitated, even if it's a really close friend; with the only exception of my family.
With that, it's little things, like buying something, having to ask for something in a store, ringing at someone's door. 
I understand these things may come with a fair amount of either embarassment or even fear, but my anxiety stops me from doing these things, or makes me panic doing so.
I was wondering if someone ever experienced a similiar experience.

I hope I was clear, if I wasn't I'm sorry, english is not my first language.

I’m fresh off a painful breakup, rapidly approaching my 30th birthday, am sleeping poorly, have gained some weight, increasingly despise my job, and am lodged firmly in the worst depressive wave I’ve encountered in recent memory. I’m having pre-suicidal thoughts (wanting to drive my car off a bridge, fantasizing about pressing the knife into my wrist as I prep for dinner). Can’t muster the fortitude to do anything that I know helps—therapy, exercise, reading, sunshine. 

I’m afraid I’m just going to continue existing until I die. What is a life bereft of even small joys?

Also, there’s the guilt over my relative privilege. That’s great, too. My problems are so small.

86,"Hello, first of all I'm a 18 yo male (Spanish), if that changes anything.

A few weeks ago I started to feel somewhat anxious and nervous, but there was no reason for that, and I just assumed my hormones were doing their thing.

Since then, my anxiety has risen dramatically, and I'm extremely irritable. It has started to affect my friendships, or at least I believe it has; I don't know because I have never had this much anxiety before. 

To put an example of what's going on in my mind: I talk to my friend, they joke about something I've done (which normally is no issue for me) I get pissed off and then a few minutes later I worry that I might lose said friend.

I understand that some of you would tell me to fuck off because I'm just a kid but the important thing is the sudden anxiety and irritability. I just don't understand why it's happening, and it's honestly unbearable. 

Does anyone have an idea of why is this happening? Or something I could do to lower my anxiety? I'm worried I'll screw my friendships if I don't put an end to this soon.

87,"My grandmother moved in with us a little over a year and a half ago and her presence has been rapidly eating away at my family's relationships. Her mobility is severely limited, her hearing is pretty shot, and she frequently falls and has bowel accidents. She also has many habits that my father finds disrespectful -like wearing next to nothing and speaking to him condescendingly when any of her sons are around- and he's pretty much reached his limit. As have I. I've never had any kind of emotional bond with her as it's difficult for me to form and maintain them to begin with, but now I just outright don't like her because I'm watching what little I have crumble around me because of her. I know it's not entirely her fault. It just fucking blows because none of my mother's brothers really give much of a shit and my grandmother is so concerned  about not wanting to a burden that it actually makes her a fucking burden. Now things are reaching a boiling point.

My grandmother is currently staying at the home of my uncle but it's clear that he does not want to have her there permanently. He said it would be up to her on where she wants to live. My dad does not want her back. My mom, of course, doesn't want to put her in a home (which I understand), mostly due to the fact that we can't afford a good one where the employees actually give a shit. If she does return, however, my dad says he will tell my mom he wants a separation and leave the house. I know my mom. This will devastate her. Especially since this will happen after she's been gone for over a month due to her job and with major family holidays coming up fast.

I have PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Spectrum 1 Autism (formerly aspergers). I still live with my parents due to my diagnosis being severe in all categories on top of violent psychopathic tendencies. All of that shit leaves me with a mountain's worth of issues to deal with on a daily basis and I don't know how to keep my shit together while everyone else is losing theirs. I have a therapist and I have an appointment with her tomorrow but she only has so much time to give me. My sister lives an hour and a half away with her own family and I have no friends. I feel like I'm on a ship that's on the verge of sinking and taking me with it.

88,"I've been to a clinic for some time, seeing a therapist inside it. This morning, they tell me they will have to kick me out if I do not go in accordance to the psychiatrist's medical recommendation. I went to them for advice and they did not even give me any prescription. Nothing but check-up tasks I need to do on my **free time** in order for them to decide.

I have not the time (and nor the stress either to be honest), and they just do not care - all of a sudden I got a notice that I am to be thrown out if I do not follow their orders.

I have other things on my mind which throw me off them. I have academy, I have taking care of myself needed, I have too many things to take care of but pity check-ups I cannot afford to do. They do not care. They care more about their protocols than their clients as it seems.

The problem with that protocol? I saw no protocol nor was I ever presented with one when I entered. 

This is really a rant, I have problems with everything right now. I was hoping to seek mental health treatment to lift me up, not to put some restrictions and mandatory orders on me that I cannot even follow due to my personal life choices and life conditions. Moreover, it seems that in general, the mental health care pinches out wonderous traits in clients just to decapitate them so they follow suit to the treatment schematics.

I also do not understand why I get downvoted for those posts? Is there no one who can relate? I know I am a bag of complaints, but it seems that I am the only one experiencing these problems. I have very personal problems, and I hate taking medications, and even seeing a therapist. It seems they seek to validate horrible and extremely cruel people, rather than really take care of the client and understand them. I have experienced countless antagonizations from the professionals, and countless depressions and character assassinations from those assholes. Some of them think they are doing the right thing by consciously choosing to decapitate clients, but they are actually hurting their own clients for goodness' sake, and some even take pleasure in doing so.

89,"I never had a mental health diagnosis, and for the past 2/3 years ive been thinking if i have anxiety.

It started in my last year of primary school. I was getting very nervous whenever called to speak during class ^(but doesnt everyone feel like that?) i experienced a fairly bad stuttering problem. It would go away for small periods of time, but it was always there. when i hear my name being called out by the teacher to read a passage my heart starts beating like crazy and i lose the ability to speak. i came to the school councellor with this problem last year but all he suggested is that i ignore that everyones listening to me and just do it. didnt work. im making him sound shallow, but he was truly a good person who i could trust.

but it isnt just the stuttering problem. i find distrust in everything and everyone. i have this one very close friend who, deep down, i know i love and trust, and she loves and trusts me, but i find that hard to believe. i try to see the positivity in everything, but end uo focusing on the negative aspects. 

i think shes the first person to understand what im going through. she noticed me having a small panic attack ^(i feel bad calling it a lanic attack, but i dont have any words for it. sorry) and asked if i have anxiety. without trying to overcomplicate it, i said yes.

90,"***- TRIGGER WARNING / SUICIDE / SELF HARM / WHATEVERRRRRRR / PLEASE DONT READ ON IF THIS'LL MAKE YOU WORSE -***

I'm not sure how long of a rant this is gonna be as I'm just typing this straight from the top of my head but... I could really do with some help. I'm sorry if it's really longo, that wasn't intended. Anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone keeps telling me ""pain/badness is temporary"" But I've been thinking about struggling for a reaaaaaaally long time. I'm seriously considering giving up and I don't really now how much fight I have left in me. I've been struggling with my Anxiety &amp; Depression for 9 years now and I don't know if I will ever feel okay, and that scares the shit out of me. I've tried reaching out to people, but I'm just treated like a Debbie downer or my depression tells me I am one anyway. And honestly? I'm always so torn. I hate it. I reach out to people and then I'm putting my issues on them, making them stressed worrying about me or sometimes even making them feel shit and like they are causing me pain or they aren't good enough to make me happy. But then I don't reach out to anyone? And I'm just making myself worse, letting myself slip into darker times and darker feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

The older I get the worse I become. When I first got diagnosed I was pretty much entirely depression. (I mean I've always had anxiety in social situations but my confidence and extroverted personality would usually cover that) But this past year it's gone the complete opposite. I am riddled with anxiety. Overthinking and over worrying bout every little thing. And the funny thing is... with anxiety comes? ^(haha) That's right, *Depression*. It's like an endless cycle. Every day feels harder than the last and I feel myself getting closer and closer to just ending it all.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part for me is how suicidal I am. It's not even like my life is that shit. I have an incredible boyfriend (who is probably the only reason I'm still here) an okay family (could be worse/could have no one) and great friends. But ultimately it feels like I really have no one - at least no one who understands me or will actually help me. I am not over-exaggerating when I say I think about suicide on a ***daily basis***. The only reasons why I haven't gone through with it is because I'm too caring and too much of a pussy: I don't want my family or some innocent bystander to deal with the trauma of finding my body and/or my suicide to cause someone else's suicide (as egocentric as that sounds, my dad is ridiculously suicidal as well \[**^(haha genetics)**\]  and I feel as though that would push him over the edge) or significant mental trauma to my partner, friends and family. And unfortunately for me my biggest fear is death itself - ironic right? However I do self harm so I feel like if I was breaking down hard enough or blacking out emotionally one day I could have the strength. I just want an easy and calm way out. If I lived in America and had access to guns so easily I probably would've killed myself years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they say ""suicide is selfish"" and I do agree to certain extent but I also thinks its selfish for people to want you to stay in this world for the sake of them when you're suffering so badly. If a dog was severely ill and you could clearly see it was suffering you would have it be put down and ""taken out of its misery"" wouldn't you? Well the same applies here. People don't seem to understand that physical sickness and mental sickness are both still sickness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if any of this made any sense but I just needed to get some of these thoughts out and felt my life deserves one last reach out before I decide to do anything. And in case anyone asks I have tried contacting the Samaritans (UK Suicide hotline) and they did not respond to me (lmao - nearly took that as a sign), I have considered seeing a doctor again and getting therapy and/or put onto medication, but I don't want to be relying on them for the rest of my life and I know it sounds soooooo stereotypical but I tried therapy and they were just patronizing and diminishing towards me. And I know everyone reading this is gonna be like ""sounds like you don't want help if you're not willing to try these things"" or ""you sound lazy"" or ""nobody can help you but yourself"" but I'm past the point of trying, that's the whole point. I would happily give up on myself.

Why take the most significant platforms created by the most brilliant ordinary people and use to cause an unnecessary civil war, when we could be using these platforms to create a community where everyone feels like a unified body. We are destroying each other in person and online, we are telling kids struggling to find a group to belong, that they obviously weren’t meant to be if they don’t conform to the standards of society and the online world we have created and altered. Why are we turning a blind eye to our young killing themselves for being who they are? Why does no one care that we are dying off because of issues that we feel terrified to speak about? Why do blogs like mine receive no attention? Why do our leaders not care that we are slowly fading into graves from ages as early as adolescence? The blame is continuously placed on the menials and generation Y as if we intended to build a platform where we could express ourselves, only to create this massive war against each other. Society and political figures find it easier to paint us as the culprits for the social media war and the cyberbullying crisis and the increased suicide rates.

93,"I'm thinking I have some sort of depression/anxiety/delayed sleep disorder/other?   
I'm no good at chronology, but I think I should start with the daily.  
Though, it's all kind of hard to describe.   
ABSENCE   
I wake up like a phantom. Here, but not really. My mind is often foggy, perpetually confused, and I will space off to nowhere without provocation. It's the hardest one to pin down because I do it constantly but am only aware of a fraction. When my folks have me run errands with them, they always wonder why I'm so underperforming. Whenever I ask for help with anything really, it's like a bubble or a wall of glass is formed and I'm pulled out of the experience and phase out.   
SLEEP  
Sleeping feels like such a gamble.   
Aside from the observation that more sleep equal stronger depressive symptoms, I've noticed that I can't seem to sleep early and actually get increasingly more awake at night. Whether it's because of some sort of mental block or disorder, I don't know. But, being that my personal curfew since middle school is around 2-4am I suspect Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Normally it's was not a problem, but with college starting back up(at 9am), I might be in for a world of hurt like today where I slept an hour.   
DEPRESSION   
Oh boy, my favorite. Almost every other day I feel empty, and lose all will to do anything--something that the night occasionally fixes, but by then it's night, no? I've historically had problems taking care of myself. Never being one for self care I'd never brush my teeth(now I do i in the morning), I don't eat because I don't feel hungry, I only shower about every 5 days.   
Lately, in the past week, I've been having suicidal thoughts. About 3 episodes. Usually it's a little more than once a month.   
ANXIETY   
I think the nail in the coffin is the anxiety. The anxiety of change, of failure, but worst of all, of success. It's all petrifying. The other day my baby brother and I were in the car. He was crying and perhaps I was having an acute misophonic reaction--whenever I hear him cry, I usually run away, or I freeze while panicking out of my I mind. It was the latter this time, stuck as I was. Often it seems when the alarms are blaring and relief is not far away I'd still rather cry and lay petrified in my anxieties because I don't see a door. I think about it, but that devolves into thinking about thinking and then I'm just a rat on a mental treadmill chasing imaginary cheese.   
It feels like I've been dizzily trudging around the foggy maze of my mind. Where I've been looking for a door that clearly doesn't look like a door, with a lock that clearly doesn't look like a lock, and a key that clearly doesn't look a key, bound to follow the broken compass of my conflicting voices/thoughts(but that's another thing).

I am also just really depressed and I feel like I can't shake it. I just want to sit here and cry, which is really unfortunate because I'm at work. 

Lately I've been really stressed out about money since I had to buy a new car and have had a cat in the emergency vet twice in the last month. 

I have also been fighting with my husband a lot, probably stemming from the fact that neither of us thinks that the other does anything and we take each other for granted. I feel like we barely talk anymore, and it's really distressing because we used to have really great relationship chemistry. 

Due to some medical issues, I sometimes can't stand for too long, bend or lift things. So I get where he feels like he has to do a lot of things for me, but every time I do something myself he says I'm doing it passive aggressively and doing things that will end up making my ongoing problems worse and ""make his life harder in the long run"". 

I feel like I'm this giant inconvenient burden. That sucks because I feel like I do a lot of things, but apparently not. 

I also just really can't stand my job. I get my masters degree in three weeks and maybe I can get out of here though. 

Everyone I have tried to talk to has ended up ignoring me, including my husband. So that sucks. 

I go back to my doctor soon ish, but she doesn't think my depression is that bad. I'm on more than the manufacturer's recommended dosage of Welbutrin, which she says is going to help eventually. She just keeps telling me that if my life wasn't so stressful I wouldn't be so stressed out and depressed. 

I did go to therapy for a while, but I felt like she didn't listen to me because she just kept telling me that my depression would improve if I moved out of my house and probably also moved back to where I grew up. I don't think that's going to do it, actually. 

I feel like I matter to literally no one. I keep thinking about how I would rather be dead. I'm not in any danger of actually hurting myself, because I am afraid of pain and death. But just being able to take a freaking break from everything and being away from everything sounds good.

So, I was asked what happened, I couldn't lie but i couldn't say all, I told about the work, about there was something else, I answered I needed to calm down before talking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally it came the moment to talk, I had a few ideas on my mind of how to start it. I couldn't follow a script, I told them about not being sure of my own memories of that time, of being strangled, having been threatened with neddles in front of my eyes... 

&amp;#x200B;

They were so broken. I... this has been for me a catharsis, a moment I could be free, I would have this conversation, throw all the masks... I couldn't tell them even a tenth of what I wanted, I put on a mask and when asked said there was nothing more... I just couldn't bear hurting them more. I have started crying again writing thid by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reasons I don't talk about this is because I dont want to hurt anybody who feels empathy for me.

&amp;#x200B;

They said we need a profesional(therapist) and see how to deal with this. I know thats what people recomend and I understamd why, my personal experiences with therapists have been pretty bad and, certanly knowing a bit of history doesn't give me a lot of confidence but I'm okey with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Then they started to tell me thing I either already know or disagree with them as absolute truths... eventually we calmed down.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I can't tell them more, I don't want to hurt them. I also didn't realize I would fall that far again. I though that wouldn't happen, I mean, I was happy, I was myself, I didn't have to wear any mask...

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought of talking to friends but, at this hours they are probably already sleeping and also last thing I want Is having another person suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucked up, I know people here may differ on opinion but really, I didn't need that talk, I could go without it. I think I was selfish. I was euphoric when I planed it, not in a more adecuated mental state for that and knowing that I kept with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow is gonna be ankward. I also think when we finally go see a therapist ... It will be worse I don't want to share anything more if that means hurting them. I also don't really wanna talk to an stranger (that can easily identify me) about ""Hey so acepting I like to tie women in a sexual manner helped me finally make peace with my past!""(BDSM).

&amp;#x200B;

I may be more fucked up than I thought.

103,"So I’m (m/20) recently out of a very painful break up. I’ve noticed somethings I want to change about myself and I want to be more confident and happy with myself, I have anxiety and it causes me to act very over dramatically over things and I’m pretty sure I have depression (not confirmed it’s just a thought) I get sad over things very easily, not jokes but like personal things and I blow them out of proportion. I also had a thought to write out suicide notes about 2 weeks ago, I wasn’t going to kill myself, I just wanted to see what I would write. I have no clue why I had that thought and I feel like it would have been a step in the wrong direction, I also don’t really know how to properly express myself, I’m very emotional, I just either express too much or not enough and I feel like I come across as clingy and I can’t keep living this way. So for those of you who have been to therapy, was it beneficial and did you see the difference in yourself?",06Sep2018,1,

108,"I am a student who is supposed to be in 11th grade but I am only at an 8th grade level of studys.  I decided to become homeschooled in 7th grade because I was too anxious at school.   I'd fake sick just to stay home,  my grades went down and my attendence was poor. I thought the best choice for me would to be homeschooled but it wasn't.   I am a low income student so my parents can't afford expensive tutors and textbooks.  I am stuck with whatever free or low cost stuff I can find online. I have tried YouTube,   Khan Academy, IXL and just about any other resource I can find.  I have trouble understanding what is being taught and my parents aren't very helpfull. I am self taught because they don't want to put the effort into my education.   I was told that it is my job to find the lessons and teach myself.   I asked my mother to send in the year end report that is two months overdue and she said that she doesn't want to.  I can't move on to the 9th grade unless she sends in that paper that will take under ten minutes to fill out.   I am starting to get the message that my parents don't care if I have to flip burgers at McDonalds for the rest of my life or even worse end up on the streets because finding a career is tough without at least a highschool education.    I am considering taking the GED route but I don't know enough of the material to pass the exam.   I was told the other day by my mother that she ""doesn't want to come up with lesson plans all summer"" and that she ""doesn't want to spend hours each day teaching me"".   What does my mother have better to do?  She'd rather play games on her tablet all day and watch movies.   My father on the other hand thinks he doesn't have to teach me because he ""works all day and is tired when he gets home"". Whenever he is home he just gets hammered off beer and chats with his drinking buddys.    I can't even watch educational videos because my parents complain that it's too loud and annoying.   I had to give my brother my earbuds because my mother bugged me until I did.  Why did he need them?  He wanted to listen to rap music and waste his life on Fortnite. They were already damaged and he broke them with in a day of him using them.   If what I say isn't bad enough,  I get blamed for my brother not doing his school work.  It isn't my fault my brother doesn't give a damn about his education and would rather waste all his time playing PUBG and Fortnite.  If you give a teenage boy the option to play video games or do school work then he is going to play video games.   My parents need to set bounderies when it comes to my brothers gaming and to just be responsible in general.     I don't like bringing the topic of education in my house because my parents start a yelling match each  time when I am the only one who should be upset.  It's my future and education that's one the line, not theirs.   I do whatever I can to learn but I am losing my motivation.  I was not born with the gift of being able to teach myself.  I am wasting all my time on try to find free materials I understand and have little energy to learn.  I signed up to be the student, my parents were supposed to be the teacher but instead I am being forced to be both.  I am not a stupid student,  I simply don't have the proper resources and support system to learn and grow.  I don't feel like I am going to complete high school or my GED any time soon.   I am praying for a mircle to happen.

Thanks for reading, 
                                    A girl in Canada ",06Sep2018,1,
