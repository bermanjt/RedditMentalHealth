0,"Hello, so I've been suffering pretty serious anxiety issues for years now, with nothing to go off of but self diagnosis. I've been suffering and frustrated and I want to start getting it together and seeing someone. I'm not sure what I am doing or if it'll be even worth it. I decided I don't want to do therapy because it's not worth it to sit around and talk to someone, I want to see a psychologist to see if I can actually get diagnosed with anxiety or aspergers at all, and a psychiatrist to get anxiety meds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem though, I have no who to do. I have insurance through BCBS so anyone I have to choose should be in network, for starters. However, there are so many that are in network I don't know who to choose, and all the information on any I try to look up online is super vague, just has pictures of their face (some not even that), what schools they've been to, and so on. I don't see what services they specialize in, if they're LGBT+ friendly, etc. I really have not much to go off of except that they are nearby and I don't want to drive very far. It's not even worth it to go through the 7 pages of in-network doctors that dont have any significant info on them.

&amp;#x200B;

Just how do you even begin to pick a good one? They all seem qualified enough, I guess. Won't be one much different or better, right?",28Sep2018,3
1,For the last couple years all I've ever wanted to do for a living was make pottery. My parents discouraged me from doing it saying that I won't be able to make a living doing it. As the years go by I've tried to think of other things to do for a living and still all I really enjoy is pottery. I feel like now my life is at a point where I have two choices. The first choice being I try and do pottery for a living and go broke and homeless or I work at a job that I don't care to do and feel dissatisfied for the rest of my life. I feel like I have two options and both suck. I almost don't see a point in living anymore.,28Sep2018,2
2,"Just a quick browse of the titles here shows me that there's a lot of people who have it worse than me.  I just need some advice to try and figure out what to do because I'm in a pretty bad funk.  

I'm from USA

The last two weeks have been really draining on me.  I recently broke up with my girlfriend, my job has me working 15 hours of unreported overtime a week (1 man department in charge of volunteers in a non profit), I've been catching a lot of negativity at work lately, and it's all starting to pile on.  I'm in a really deep funk right now, I haven't been eating well, I haven't been exercising, and when I try to hang out with people I feel really disconnected.  

I feel like I'm dealing with a lot of stress and depression.  For most of my life, I feel like I haven't been plagued with much stress and no anxiety.  I've been incredibly blessed in that regard.  But depression runs in the family on both sides.  

I guess I just needed to vent a little.  I can't think of much else to gain from posting here.  Maybe I'm just worried all this is being caught up in my own head.  Sometimes my drive for living fades and I just want to let everything go and just skate by.   

I suppose if I'm looking for one thing from anyone who reads this, I want to know what I can do to help myself.  I try to find time for exercise and eating better, but work sucks me in.  I think I need to take a week off of work.  What else do you all do to stay healthy, mind and body?  I need some good habits in my life.  ",28Sep2018,4

I am 17 yo. Male. Born in Ecuador but currently living in Chile. I have been on antidepressants for a year now and I feel all their power. I am very mixed on them. The biggest pro is that I feel kinda high all the time, I feel relaxed and calm which is cool. My cons however also primarily involve feeling high. It sucks being high all the time. My vision is really blury and can't seem to focus my eye on anything. My memory and concentration are really worrying me. I get lost in the middle of simple 59 second conversations, I stare at nothing for every twenty five breaths I take, I am disassociating all the time and if I am not outside of my body because of disassociation then I am just outside my mind not even thinking about nothing. I am really scared and kinda sad because people are noticing this and are calling me out on it. I have spoken to my psychologist and therapist about it but they tell me it's just the stress and inner conflicts what makes me feel like that. I don't buy it. I don't know what to do.

4,"I recently finished school with a finance degree and started my first “big boy” job a few months ago. It is an accounting position, and since the  day I started I had a weird feeling. It is an oil and gas company with a large international presence. Only a few people made an effort to try to get to know me, and most barely acknowledge my existence. I really do feel like a number, as the popular saying goes. The workload is also insane and the only “training” involved is someone trying to explain you things in a rushed manner while they work on many other tasks. I don’t enjoy what I do at all and the work environment doesn’t help. The only reason I stay is because the pay is very good, and I know how hard it is to find an entry level job these days.

5,"Hi guys, sorry if this is a common question, I tried to look up similar questions but didn’t really find anything. 

Basically, whenever I get in bouts of depression, it might be because I’m PMSing or in a rough patch, my social anxiety takes control and I isolate myself from my friends. 

This started when I was in high school (about 5 or 6 years ago) and made me stop hanging out with my two closest friends. Every time I would get a phone call, text, or any kind of notification on my phone I would get a rush of anxiety. I was constantly lying to my friends, telling them I was busy or didn’t feel well, and this put a huge strain on our relationship. 
At the time, I didn’t really have a word for my anxiety so I didn’t know how to tell them how I was feeling, but now, fast forward a few years later and I find myself in the same exact slump. 

I know my friends and family will understand what I’m going through if I tell them how I’m feeling, really all my friends have experienced depression in one way or another. My biggest problem is that whenever I’m in a depressive episode (like right now), I don’t care enough about my friends to reach out to tell them. I know once I start to feel better, I’ll hang out with my friends again, I just don’t really know how to go about the topic, or if once I start to feel more like myself again they’ll even want to hear me out. 

I’m an anxious and introverted person by nature, so I don’t really know how to fully talk about these issues I’m having. I don’t want it to be a whole big thing, but I’m scared I’ll be opening up a can of worms when I try to talk about how I’m feeling. Any like minded people deal with this? I’d love to hear how you went about it/ and words of encouragement!

TL;DR: bad social anxiety and reoccurring depression that makes me isolate myself from my friends for weeks. What’s the best way to start talking about this and help my friends understand where I’m coming from?",28Sep2018,5

Since Friday I've been feeling really agitated and irritable. I'm getting really obsessive and intrusive thoughts about hurting others. Yesterday I went to the hospital and during the several hours wait time my mom continuously had to stop me from trying to punch anyone. The psychiatrist there gave me Ativan which I don't really understand why. Is an anti anxiety drug going to help with OCD at all? Is it because I'm on an snri and antipsychotic already? Since yesterday I also started getting sexual thoughts about my mom and sister even though I know it is disgusting. My mind wants to yell at them sexual things.

7,"Hey guys, i'm a 20 year old guy who used to be real fat. Not morbidly obese but really not great. I lost a lot of weight a couple years ago and kept it off. However since then I have started weight training (been going 6/7 months now) and need to bulk (have bulked the entire 6/7 months)...

Now i'm sure you can see where this is going - I HATE putting the fat back on but it's necessary for gaining muscle. I keep on going through cycles of wondering if I should start cutting. It weighs on me quite heavy and I push through it but I really don't like it and it messes with me.

He wanted me back the whole time but I kept telling him no.We were seperated for 8 months. We just recently got back together and everything beens great. However, I know he dated some girls and exchanged nudes with others, and it bothers me so much!! I know it is completely irrational, i was with other people aswell but I get so upset and literally want to hit him when I think about him being with another female. I snapped on him once about it and Ive been telling myself that it is unfair and down right stupid/crazy to feel this way. Ive been able to realize that its illogical, but I cant stop the thoughts and sometimes I dwell on it and feel my blood boiling, I want to scream, cry and fight all at the same time.

9,"So idk if this is the right reddit to post in but i've been so lost for the past year or so.

 I got into one of the highest rating academic high schools in florida, i play sports, and i even go out with friends. But for some reason nothing seems fun at all. Sports. Movies. Friends. Parties. Even when im flirting with girls. Everything is boring and i just can't get myself to enjoy life.

 My freshman year was ok i was either happy or really angry but i could deal with it and i did my work and passed.

 **But** towards the end of freshman year to where i am right now it's been very difficult for me, i've been either been **really angry or i've noticed my self going to really dark places and getting really sad for no reason**. I can't pay attention in class, i cant enjoy sports, and i cant enjoy friends or myself anymore. **I also feel very lost i have no idea what to do with my life.**

I decided to come here and make this post because a lot of people have been asking me things like, ""are you ok?"" and a lot of teachers and people have been pulling me to the side and asking me if i'm ok and telling me i've been acting different.

There's a lot more things i could go into but that would be too much to read this is already a lot sorry.

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with having another depressive episode. I thought I was fine but when I explained how I spent my days in my room in the dark for over 12 hours at a time he was concerned. Thinking about it I’m starting to notice that I’m not as “happy”. I used to be extremely suicidal and I used to self harm as well. A few months ago I was close to nearing a self-harm relapse. And recently I’ve been having thoughts of suicide. I know I don’t want to do it but I don’t want to drag myself into this hole where it could take months or a year to get out of. I’m confused and my resources of therapists are of no use, since my mother talks to them behind my back and tells them things about me that even myself aren’t aware of.

13,"Like a black slave in the southern US during slavery, or a concentration camp prisoner, a person could have symptoms of depression or anxiety, but it isn't exactly right to say that they have a mental disorder. The problem is their terrible situation, not a lack of coping skills. It's the same with incels. You wouldn't tell a Jewish person in a concentration camp that they just need to develop their distress tolerance.

You want to bring up Frankl? OK, see the title of this post: let's make your life arbitrarily worse and you can be the one to find meaning in your life. Everything will be just as good as before right?

Let's take away your children, you'll never see them again, and everything will be right with the world, and if you feel bad about it, it is Your Fault. You don't need to see your children, you just have a mental illness. You have to take responsibility for your life. No one did anything bad to you, you're doing it to yourself. You are the problem, the people who took your children away aren't the problem.

Where are the parents who will volunteer to never see their children again? Where are the people in a relationship good relationships who are willing to end them at a moments notice to prove that they can be single and happy? If you won't be single and happy for the rest of your life why do you expect me to be?

I don't have a mental illness as a direct problem, it's just a side effect of the terrible situation I'm in. Focusing on ""treating"" my mental problems is never going to work because the underlying problem is always going to undo any progress.

15,"In my opinion, people, including me, romanticize their own mental illness to help themselves cope with it. I’m in a master’s level mental health degree program and my professor put an image up today that stated “it’s hard to let go of the demons inside you because they were holding you when nobody else did.” And he asked us all what we thought of it. 

I raised my hand and stated that I believed this was a romanticized view of mental illness. I think that we romanticize  as a way to cope with what’s going on. Because in reality, our mental illness, our “demon” is not helping us in any way. But sometimes we take on our mental health as our identity because it’s comforting to us and it’s what we know. It can be scary to break into a normal or healthy state of mind. 

Well, when I stated this, a classmate became angry and felt like I was invalidating her experience, as she had self harmed when she was younger and identified with the quote.

18,"So to preface this whole rant, I was diagnosed 2 years ago with;

* Acute Panic Disorder
* High-Functioning Manic Depression

So I was in a long-term relationship in Secondary School (9 years total) that ended in disaster.

Certain things happened that caused a downward spiral in my own psychology and put pressure on the relationship. During that time I developed a drink problem (towards the end, more college-age); devolving into Alcoholism. Even before this the relationship was doomed.

&amp;#x200B;

I was unemployed, she was working in a Fast Food chain every-other day. Whenever we were together she was on her phone texting ""a friend from work"". I didn't see the signs. We hadn't been intimate in a while; my advances usually met with excuses.

&amp;#x200B;

We eventually broke up early last year (Feb 2017). I'd put my heart and soul into pursuing a new career; desperate to show her that I wasn't a waster. I'd applied for a new Government Initiative here in the UK; Degree Apprenticeship Scheme. This was sort of a last chance scenario before income support. I would go to University, supported by an employer and work full-time, study part-time. She tried to stop me because ""we'd never see each other"" and ""I'd get nothing out of it"". She'd already gone to University and dropped out after a week; accruing £9000-worth of debt because of the Learning Contract she'd signed.

&amp;#x200B;

I found something out that broke me completely from a mutual friend. She'd been sleeping with this ""friend from work"" for the last 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week after we'd split she'd plastered it all over social media that I was abusive, mentally disturbed, and cruel. This simply wasn't the case, as I'd drop EVERYTHING I was doing whenever she asked. I went to her house on Christmas Eve because she'd attempted suicide. Would I have done that if I was cruel and abusive? We lost a child, and I didn't leave her side for a month; waiting on her hand and foot... 

Here's the kicker; she's now engaged to this other guy and expecting twins. I found that little gem out from her sisters; bragging about how ""he'll make a much better father than you will"". Here's the thing; I was Uncle to all of their children; teaching them things their own fathers  wouldn't. \*My\* nephew suffers with ADHD and is quick to anger. I looked after him for a month solo, and taught him;

* Chess
* Programming (Python, Java, C++)
* Meditation
* How to succeed in school

And I'd make a bad father they said... He's now a straight-A student and class rep; where only a month before he was due to be moved to a ""special measures"" school.

&amp;#x200B;

Back on track eh?  
After the above revelation I got a break; An employer I'd met with in April last year called me up and offered me a job on the spot, under the Degree Apprenticeship Scheme... The scheme the ex had tried to dissuade me from going for.

&amp;#x200B;

Roll on a year...

I'm still a broken man. Single and lonely in a strange city (that's becoming more familiar). Over-stressed with University Deadlines &amp; Shortcomings. Enjoying work and my successes thus far... But still alone. 

I've just started my second year, and am already stressed with studies, but it's a nice stress (if that makes sense). I'm talking to a girl that shares a lot of interests with me, and is working in the same field. The ex and her fiancé are now both broke and unemployed, with their children in the care of their families.

&amp;#x200B;

I pity them. I pity them yet I feel vindicated; the phrase ""Karma, she is a bitch"" spiralling around my patchwork-speckled brain. Does that make me a bad person?

20,"I’m having a hard time right now. I don’t really know what’s going on. I’m a sophomore (transfer) in college. I’ve got a few friends. I don’t have social anxiety, but I prefer to spend my time alone. 

My girlfriend of over a year lives on the floor above me. She’s a great, wonderful girl. But every day I can tell she grows more impatient with me. Shes growing tired of waiting for me to be better. I have instances of happiness that can last for about an hour. She is happiest during those moments. Most of the time, however, I’m too negative—and she doesn’t like it. I know I disappoint her daily.

I don’t consider myself a happy person. I thought transferring to this college would raise me out of the discontent I experienced last year. I’m happier here. But I’m not happy. The reason I say I’m not happy is because of how easy it is for me to experience anger, frustration, self hatred, and sadness. 

I tend to ride the waves of the most recent development in my life all the way to its emotional maximum. Can’t solve a math problem quick enough? I suddenly because furious with myself to the point where I smash my hands on the table, yell, and briefly entertain the idea of giving up completely. I get angry with my girlfriend who has already completed the problem. She gets mad at me in response. The 8th wonder of the world is the fact that she still loves me.

I endured an unfortunate amount of physical and emotional abuse as a kid. Because of this, I’ve developed high sensitivities to loud and/or crowded places. Thus, I like to eat my meals at the times of day when the cafeterias aren’t too busy. When my girlfriend or my friends invite me to dinner at a shitty, busy time, I get angry. 
I schedule my whole day around eating at the perfect times. 

I’m going to pause now to mention that I’m making myself sound really shitty. If I talked about all the moments in the last week where I was a good guy doing the right thing, I’d give off a different impression. 

But I guess I do consider myself an overall shitty person even if I do have good moments. I am angry at the drop of a hat.

I think I should blame my dad for this. He taught me that extreme anger is the go-to emotion when something even just moderately upsets you. He taught me that aggressive outbursts are appropriate even when the slight is mild. He taught me that everything bad that happened to me was because of something I brought upon myself. And it makes sense. If I can’t solve the math problem I’m really just a stupid worthless fucking idiot who didn’t spend enough time practicing math in high school.

I don’t even know if I believe that. Things at home were so severe that it feels like several years of my teenage life are just missing. I spent them depressed, scared, angry, and alone. Time moved too quickly and now I’m here wishing I could have it back. 

With all the things I have, I must be a shitty person if I’m still unhappy. I have friends. A girlfriend who loves me. I will not have a *penny* in student debt because my father makes a lot of money. My head feels like it could explode.

I apologize that this prose is about as volatile and disorganized as my personality. Im seeking some sort of confirmation that this is normal and that I’m not truly a piece of shit for the way I feel. My therapist thinks I have CPTSD. My girlfriend thinks I have anger issues. My mom thinks I’m depressed. My dad thinks I’m fine. All I know is that if my bedroom was the only place I was allowed to go, I’d be ok with it.",28Sep2018,2

I recently moved back with my sister because I had a horrible roommate because she used to torment me and she always had such an aggressive attitude when addressing me about anything.

Text messages get me on edge I start imagining the worse anytime I see a notification from someone. I barely have any friends I only have 2 friends left from my long list of friends I used to work with but when I quit they unfriended me.

22,"CW: violence, murder

I’m gonna try to condense this story as to not bore you all to death, but I’ll leave in details that may help readers understand the impact the event had on me and why. 

In April, 2016 I joined a FB group a friend invited me to called Dank Music Stash. It was a group about all types of music, where we’d have theme days and post our favorite songs or music videos. I was always friendly in the comments with a guy who lived a few hours away from me. We chatted casually about music, movies and politics or whatever. He also shared his personal music on the group sometimes, videos of him singing and playing guitar. I would leave supportive comments and whatnot.

In May, 2016, I ended up taking a trip close to where he lived for my job. I asked if he wanted to meet up at the beach or get lunch while I was there (one day trip). We got food and hung out at the beach for about an hour. He seemed like a somewhat tortured artist type. I talked about normal things like my husband and my job and he wanted to talk about deeper things like his childhood and the fact that he lost his virginity at 8 years old, and his anger issues. Before we parted ways, he was trying to persuade me to come back to his place. I was pretty sure he was just trying to have sex with me, and I was, and am, married. So I left. 

He continued to be very flirty and personal through FB towards me afterwards for a few days, and I had to reject him in pretty plain terms. He was annoyed by this and I don’t remember the details but I got a weird vibe by his reaction. I do vaguely remember him saying some disturbing stuff about his mental state at some point but I can’t recall the exact dialogue. This all happened between April/May of 2016. We remained friends on Facebook but I deleted all our messages and stopped talking to him since I was a little creeped out. 

Fast forward to about a month ago (2 years since my trip where I met him), I get a phone call from a defense attorney. She has to literally jog my memory for 5 min to get me to remember this guy. His name is Dave. He lived at the beach. I finally remembered and she started asking me questions about our relationship and what his mental state was like when we spoke. She was specifically asking if he had sent me any of the videos of him playing music and if I still had them. I started feeling really weird about this conversation and asked her what this was about. After all, I had known him for only a month and only ever met him once, which I told her.

She says “he is charged with first degree murder of a woman”. She is following leads to any videos of him playing music to try and humanize him for the jury. I literally said the F word 59 times and said things “holy shit that could have been me” and she was very nice and apologetic but gave me a warning about meeting strangers and to be careful out there in a motherly way. No kidding. I bet she sees some horrible stuff. 

After I hang up with her, I google him. Turns out he had beaten, strangled, stabbed, and dismembered a woman in July of 2016. Less than 2 months after I had met him. He fled the scene, took a bus to Oregon and shortly after arriving, turned himself in. I will post the article link in the comments. My mom called the jail he’s in to ask about trial, which they told her is happening at the end of October. He’s one of two people in the entire jail for murder. They told her there will likely be press, considering the nature of crime and the fact that Morehead City, NC is such a small town. 


So to bring this to a head, I had a literal mental breakdown the day I found all this out. Learning about this shook my whole world view. I couldn’t be alone for days. Hardly any sleeping. I couldn’t even walk on the sidewalk next to strangers because I was so afraid of anyone. I’ve been extra sensitive and paranoid about my daughter and have pervasive though about bad things happening to her that really scare me (I am a stay at home mom now). Since then, I have developed several other mental health symptoms: 


**hyper-vigilance
**Paranoia about those close to me/acquaintances surveying/stalking me

I’ve kept a list for when I can finally make it to a therapist. My husband, 18m old daughter and I just moved to the northeast and finding a therapist with our new insurance has been a huge pain in the neck, but I finally have an appointment for next month. I’m definitely better today than I was the day after I learned about all this, but things are still definitely off in my brain. It seems like all those symptoms wax and wane and are most of the time manageable with distraction or talking about it with my husband. 

I don’t even know what the purpose of this post is. Maybe to tell my story. To get support from someone. I’ve endlessly googled things like “ptsd from almost being murdered” because I’m desperate to find someone to relate to. I did read an old AskReddit thread about people who knew murderers which helped oddly. Anyway, if you’ve gotten this far, thanks for listening. I feel like I’m going crazy a little bit and just typing this out has given me a little clarity. 

TLDR: I met a stranger I talked to on a FB group once randomly by myself, who killed and dismembered a woman 2 months after we met. I speculate I could have been the victim if I’d agreed to go back to his place. I have concerning mental health symptoms after a breakdown triggered by learning of this murder 2 years later. Looking for support or anyone else who has had mental health issues stemming from a similar experience. ",28Sep2018,4

In the past, when I've tried to talk about my challenges, I have often been accused of being melodramatic or histrionic.  I've been told to grow up and get over it because life is hard for everyone.  So, many years ago, I developed a habit of automatically minimizing or trying to cover up my difficulties.  Now I'm applying for SSDI, and I'll need to find a way to accurately and thoroughly talk about my mental health and how it affects my life.  I'm nervous that it will be hard for me to break this deeply ingrained habit of hiding my unique problems.  I have a deep fear of coming across as manipulative and not being believed.  I worry that this fear and this unconscious habit will undermine my conscious efforts to get help. 

Can anyone relate to this?  Any advice?

26,"So I’ve noticed something that’s been going on for a while now, and I’m not sure if this is some sort of mental illness or something else, but I just want some sort of closure. I’ll try to keep it simple without leaving out important bits.
When I was really young (7, I think) my mom and I moved in with the man who would eventually become my stepdad. He was (and is) a genuinely nice person with a good heart and I love him, but it became apparent very quickly that he was easily angered. He would get very angry and yell at my sisters and mom for unjust reasons, and sometimes my mom and him would get in extremely intense (but not physical) fights. Whenever anything like this happened, I naturally got very scared and often cried and would hide in my closet. I need to emphasize that he never physically harmed any of us, from what I remember.
As the years went on, his temper became much less intense but he still had occasional freakout moments that called back to the earlier days.
Fast forward to now, and I’m still living with him and my mom (hopefully won’t be living here for much longer), and he is a much less angry person on the outside and almost never reaches the intensity that he used to. But whenever he comes home or calls my name, I get anxious for a split second, even if there’s no reason for it. But whenever he gets angry at all, even though it’s always at someone else and not me, hell even just the sound of him slamming a door (which he does a lot, just because he doesn’t realize how forceful he’s being) makes me freak out and it often ruins my mood for at least the next couple hours, and in extreme situations, it’s made me self-harm (rare, but it’s happened). This doesn’t happen with anyone else when I see them get angry, only him. I strongly doubt it’s any sort of PTSD, it feels like an insult to PTSD survivors to even mention the possibility. But I feel like there’s definitely something wrong, and if someone could help me figure out what, I would greatly appreciate it.",28Sep2018,2

This could be the wrong sub, so if it is, please link me to a better fitting one.

So anyway, I am best friends with a girl I’ve known about a year and a half or so. She lives in the UK (I live in the US) and is not quite 18, if that info may be needed for any reason. She’s absolutely lovely and I love everything about her, but she also has a lot of problems.

For one, she’s majorly depressed, and has ben since she was 12. She is often feeling too bad to do things with me, and will go long amounts of time doing nothing.  She’s not in school and I don’t think she will be attending college at any point.

Besides that she has what I believe to be fibromyalgia, however she has never been diagnosed, every time she goes to a doctor they say nothing is wrong with her. It’s really hard for her to be in constant pain but to be told she’s fine.

And when I think she already has everything going against her, it looks like she’s psychotic, or schizophrenic, or something.

She told me she was going to sleep, and about an hour after she texted me saying there are little people in her pillow. I made a joke saying something like, “now you’re hearing voices too??” Because i thought she was joking. She wasn’t

This wasn’t enough for me to assume she had something wrong with her causing that, and I still am not sure that’s related to any mental disorder she may have. 

She said it sounded like a sitcom or a radio broadcast coming through her pillow. I started questioning her and she confided to me about how she would hallucinate when she was younger, and that she had an imaginary friend telling her to do things. She even said one time she ate chips and they turned into glass in her mouth and looked like a broken lightbulb. 

On top of that, I asked if she got paranoid, and she said she believed that she was always being watched by everyone in the world, similar to the Truman Show. I didn’t wanna believe it but that sounds a lot like psychosis. 

She also said that she doesn’t think anyone she knows is real. I asked if she thought I was real and she said “I’m gonna be honest, I don’t trust anyone” I can’t explain how much that hurt to hear. She doesn’t even know if I’m real.

I am losing hope, but i won’t ever give up on her. If there is anything you guys think that could be a simple answer to all this, or if you have ideas of how to help her, please tell me. I love her so much and I can’t stand to think about what may happen to her...",28Sep2018,9

Just wanted to write a quick update post about my husbands bout with PTSD, depression and anxiety.

Last year, I didn't know where to turn, my husband had so many problems and I didn't know how to help him. We were disconnecting and he was sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness. If not for this sub, I'd hate to think what might have happened to him.

I am happy to report after all of the advice and information given to me here, I was able to get him the help he needed and he began Cognitive Behavioural Therapy along with medication adjustments. He has been anxiety attack free for about 6 months and has been in such a positive headspace this past little while. He's putting in the work and its paying off. Obviously things are not black and white, he still has bad days, but they are few and far in between vs. every single day as it used to be.

37,"Hey, guys. I should start with a little background info: I had been a self harmer since I was as young as 11 years old and through the few years that followed, it got progressively worse. I’ve been hospitalized once due to friends being worried that I was going to hurt myself and refused to go to mandatory counselling. 

That being said, it’s been a couple years since I last self-harmed. Things started to look up and I found my people. There definitely were times where I had bad thoughts but pushing through them got me here today. 

Just recently, I moved away from home and only after did I realize that I wasn’t ready. I’m in college, thousands of miles away from anyone I know and these thoughts are slowly making their way back in. Being so alone 24/7 has really taken a toll on me and tonight has been a really bad night. It’s so hard to ignore. 

I don’t want to be that person anymore and have actually been thinking about reaching out to a professional for help, such as a therapist.

I'm 29, and you know what? There are a few things about this country that I’ve noticed which are troubling when you connect the dots.

1. Physical and mental health are handled by prescribing medication, while the real cure is a healthy lifestyle and psychotherapy. Medication just masks the symptoms, it’s lunacy. Unhealthy food is EVERYWHERE, cheap and subsidized by the government.

2. The war on drugs has resulted in an upsurge of police spending and record number of prisons being built. Crime rates are down but so many people are in prison and the infrastructure is growing each year. It also seems like the media is trying to create animosity between police and the people they vow to protect.

3. The political parties are more split than ever, making up the radical left and alt right. The genders are increasingly at odds socially and politically. There are message boards with men talking about swearing off women and vice versa. Birth rates are down and more people are single than ever, with the trend continuing downward.

4. Lax divorce and child support laws have led to increasing numbers of children raised by single parents and perhaps this divide mentioned in point 3 between men and women. The literature is clear, children do worse across the board when raised by single parents, and especially men.

5. There’s an opioid epidemic, perhaps because people are more overweight, anxious, depressed, and stressed than ever, combined with the social factors I mentioned in point 3. Also, quite suspiciously, we’ve been at war in Afghanistan since 2001, and it is the place with the world’s largest opioid output, and there are pictures online of US troops guarding the fields.

6. The NSA is in our homes, listening to us and recording our internet use. They claim it’s to keep up safe. But what if it’s not? It doesn't seem like they're doing a good job at keeping us safe/healthy in any other way (due to laws, not the free market). What if it’s to always be one step ahead of the people psychologically. Or even worse, to silence it's opponents, like Stalin did. That’s an awful lot of power.

You could argue this is “all just happening naturally”. ""end stage capitalism"" If that’s the case then why aren’t our leaders fixing it? Why are they passing laws that literally feed this system? For money? They print the damn money. Why are they literally allowing our society and culture to go in the trash? You could say it’s all just the greed of the doctors, wardens, etc who are just profiting? Or is it something more organized, more sinister?

I've noticed that all these result in the weakening of the people, the transfer of power to the state, and ultimately, depopulation (due to health problems and lower birth rates). Is it possible that our “reality” is a completely evil form of social engineering meant to depopulate us? I mean, think about it, humanity is blowing through resources, and a controlled demolition to get rid of people makes sense to the elite. Why couldn't they just pass a one child law? Would we have obliged?

And for even saying this and simply speaking my mind and addressing potential (correct or incorrect concerns) I might be placed on a watch-list myself. That's scary, but i don't care, because the alternative is worse.

I really hope someone can break my logic somewhere here...

I actually take that back, I've been on a watch-list, have been getting strange ads, and think people have been following me.

My new neighbor is always working on the pipes and I've been smelling methane gas. My dog has been sniffing up in the air at our vents. I got a strange prick in my neck when I went out earlier and now I have a sore throat.

My girlfriend (24) suffers from bad depression and anxiety and uses reading as a way to escape(maybe not the right term) from the stresses of life.

So as of writing this shes read through all the books we have multiple times and is kind of spiraling into tv show depression(will come home from work and just wants to watch t.v. for 6 hours a day).

I know I can do more to help her and am actively searching for people she can talk to and trying to get her interested in other hobbys. I'm a gamer and shes shown some interest in playing games with me.

So for the time being while I'm finding ways to help Id ask you guys for any reccomendations on books that may have helped you escape or have just kept your mind of things.

Thanks for reading and I hope to hear some ideas :).",28Sep2018,2

Her dying wish was to see her niece one last time before she died. I didn’t want to. I said I didn’t want to and never did. A week later, she died and I never went to see her. My dad told me and I brushed it off and said “well that’ll happen when you drink a lot and smoke a bunch of cigarettes.” Wasn’t sad at all. Several weeks later, I was thinking about it. I cried. I cried not because she was dead but because I was too selfish to see her. To this day, I am not sad about their deaths. Don’t think about it and it never crosses my mind. Why am I like this?

My experience was entirely different from what’s on paper. I was desperate for help and didn’t know where else to go. The doctor himself did not even speak to me. He just stood there in the psych room, flanked by a nurse, a scribe, a mental health evaluator from the local crisis center, and a fucking security guard. They basically said they couldn’t help me and I could no longer reach out to them for help. I was flabbergasted, because in my mind, the logical place to go when you’re in severe physical OR mental distress, SHOULD be the emergency department. 

In reality, there really is no place for people to go when they’re in acute mental distress but are not psychotic.  Seeking support from the emergency department will only make you feel so much worse.

72,"My father has some mental issues. He's *always* been a bit ""off"", but about 20 years ago he was in a work accident that resulted in some brain damage - dried blood on the brain that is still slowly killing brain cells. This is making his un-diagnosed pre-existing conditions worse.

* I am trying to assist him in getting help and am not sure what exactly to look for in a mental health professional. Do you all have any advice for me? His location is Ocklawaha, Florida. USA.

Context:

He has always resisted seeking help because ""he's not crazy"", and things along that line of reasoning. I am trying to help him find the most appropriate person/type of doctor so he doesn't immediately give up. (He did see someone once right after his accident, and never went back. After his visit, he basically said ""yeah, that guys said I'm a very smart man"" or something along those lines and that was it.)

My family has always suspected he is bi-polar, and likely has some other issues too. I'm no doctor, but he seems terribly depressed. (The accident 20 years ago basically took away his livelihood and kept him from doing all the things he defined himself by. Now he's just constantly in pain and has no hobbies or goals, thinks death will be the only way to change his life, etc.) He's prone to anger, and his thought process isn't really logical. (He can still handle his basic needs and stuff like that, but his interpersonal skills are...non-existent)

His financial situation is not great. He has **no** disposable income. So finding some sort of income-based assistance would be great, otherwise I'll try to cover it.

I read through the FAQ and think I should start by looking for a Therapist or Psychologist (not a psychiatrist, as them seem to focus solely on medicine). How can I decide who would be best suited and would also have the medical knowledge to understand how his brain damage/constant pain situation is impacting his mental health?

A friend (and former partner) of mine is paranoid schizophrenic. Their family admitted them to the hospital against their will, but the system couldn't hold them any longer, so they were released. This person won't acknowledge their condition (I know this can be quite common). They are convinced the CIA, FBI, etc are following them, and that they are being subjected to nerve agents, etc.

Or likewise with visual hallucinations?",28Sep2018,6
76,"Before anti-depressants, I saw no point of life. Hated going to work and felt like everything was pointless. I started taking Effexor and it numbed me. I didn’t look in the future as much and was more “in the present” and content on a daily basis. I didn’t feel great, but I felt fine. I had to get off of it because it was making me too anhedonic and the withdrawal symptoms were too bad for me; had to take it the same time every day and not be off by 30 minutes or my day would be fucked. I was a slave and wanted to end it.

Now it’s pretty much out of my system, but I reverted to my past self. What’s the point of going to work everyday? I hate it. I have things that I am looking forward to such as Red Dead 2, but what about after that wears off? I see my coworkers and they just seem fine with the cycle. Work 5 days, have 2 days off a week, repeat. They come into the bank bright and early with a big, happy expression, and they always ask what’s wrong with me because I seem unhappy every morning. I constantly need something to excite me (expecting a special package, new game coming out, moving, SOMETHING) to keep me distracted. If my life becomes too repetitive, I get extremely depressed. I have hobbies such as lifting, but I just don’t get the happy, body high that people get from just doing small activities I like. Everything is just like a chore to me, actually; maintaining physique, maintaining relationships, existing as a whole. 

I have never been able to see the beauty out of every day life, ever. I always hear people say “I’m happy as long as I’m alive to see another day.” But I disagree; I see no point unless you’re enjoying it. What’s the point of existing if you’re just barely making it and doing the same thing day after day after day? I was not born with a strong, survival, positive mentality. 

I want to move to Colorado, get a small house, and buy a dog, then maybe I would be happy... but I doubt it. What about after that wears off? What about the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years of life. I’m working as a banker and I can’t take doing this much longer. In fact, there’s no job I want that I would classify as a “dream job.” Only thing I want to do is sit out by a beach all day and be left alone.

How do normal, healthy people cope with the monotony? The average person seems too “okay” with everyday life. What is my problem?",28Sep2018,10

At the end of last year I hit nearly every checkbox for things that can trigger a depressive episode. I've completely lost control of myself.

I really wanted to quit my job and crawl under a rock. Somehow I ended up working part-time. I come in late, I take it slow in the mornings, and I cut out a lot of responsibilities. I'm much happier than I was, but now I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I figure I'll do this until I feel ready again.

I hate to dwell on things too long, I'm great in conversation with friends and always look forward to meeting them, and I generally think of myself as someone who is always - or the majority of the time - extremely positive, because being down in the dumps doesn't help anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though I've failed many tests at college, failing resubmissions and such. My friends aren't in the general ""meetup spot"" and are instead hanging out in a subject classroom that I can't access because I'm the only one in the group who doesn't do that subject. I've had a couple of friends and family pass away, most recently exactly six days ago, and so it's generally been a really shit time. Because of my recent change of teachers for one of my subjects, I'm starting to get frustrated and angry that somehow that teacher is the one grading me down, and that it's his fault, even though that's stupid.

86," [Professor Sir Michael Owen](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/57797-owen-michael), director of the [MRC centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics at Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/mrc-centre-neuropsychiatric-genetics-genomics), is looking into the ways genetic information can be used to improve mental health. Michael is quick to stress that whilst genetic studies are informative, they can be difficult to interpret and are rarely able to provide a complete picture of a given mental illness. “Recent research has shown that psychiatric disorders are highly polygenic,” explains Michael. “This means that an individual’s risk of developing a psychiatric disorder is conferred by the combined effects of many hundreds of different genes.” These genetic risk factors act alongside a range of other factors – things like stress, bereavement or physical illness – to determine our overall chances of developing a mental health condition.

In the future, Michael predicts roles for genetic testing in both the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. “The way that we currently diagnose individuals is far from perfect and it is difficult to match the right treatment to the right patient. We are currently hopeful that we will be able to use genetic information to help identify groups of patients that are more likely to respond to a given treatment.”

These aspirations are shared by [Thalia Eley](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/thalia.eley.html), Professor of Developmental Behavioural Genetics at Kings College London. Thalia is a pioneer in the emerging area of [Therapygenetics](https://biolmoodanxietydisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2045-5380-3-4), an exciting subject that aims to improve the way we treat mental illness. “Therapygenetics is a new field which uses genetic information to predict how well an individual does after they receive psychological treatment for anxiety or depression,” Thalia explains. “Specifically, we obtain DNA from individuals who are receiving psychological therapy and we test whether we can predict their treatment outcome from the genetic information we gather.”

When asked about the ethical concerns associated with their research, both Michael and Thalia agree that the responsible handling of patient data is an important issue. “We have to be very careful in how we look after the DNA samples that our participants provide us with,” says Thalia. “There are tight guidelines about how to keep these samples, and the data they produce, safe. We always store samples with a barcode rather than a name, and all data produced is strictly confidential.”

This view is supported by Michael: “Genetic information, like much other personal information, is highly sensitive and we are careful to ensure that we obtain fully-informed consent and comply with high standards of data security.” 

**Do genetic studies over-simplify the causes of mental illness?**

Whilst the handling of patient data is clearly an important issue, it is not the only ethical challenge associated with genetic studies in the field of mental health. [Dr Camillia Kong](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/camillia-kong), Director of Research Strategy for NeuroGenE in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, has been investigating the potential consequences that gene-based approaches can have on people with mental illnesses.

“Psychiatry is moving rapidly towards a direction which focuses on trying to clarify the genetics behind serious mental disorders,” says Camillia.  “I am curious about how this focus on our genes could have unintended consequences.”

A common criticism of genetic based studies is that they paint an unrealistic picture of complex mental health conditions. “It is important that we don’t oversimplify the science and overpromise what it can achieve,” Camillia explains. “Without caution, people can start to believe that their genes ‘predetermine’ whether or not they will have a mental disorder. To be clear, this is *not* the scientific view.”

Camillia believes that people who think their condition is caused solely by their genes may be less likely to see an improvement in their symptoms. “This way of thinking can obstruct the motivation to seek help and participate in treatment,” says Camillia. “If someone believes that their genes make their condition inevitable, it will affect the optimistic outlook that is so vital to successful treatment.”

With this in mind, it is important that we don’t overemphasise the role of genetics in mental health. Mental illnesses are incredibly complex and caused by a multitude of factors. These factors differ from person to person and just because an individual possesses a certain genetic risk factor, it does not mean that they are destined to go on and develop a mental health condition. In the words of Camillia: “Sometimes we can’t help but feel like a positive genetic result will mean we have faulty genes, or that we’ll pass it onto our children, or that it’s inevitable that we’ll experience a particular disorder.  None of these are necessarily the case.”

And people who dont want to spend money to get psychiatric help come to me to ask for help because they believe it ""helped"" because I'm still alive right now. 

They ask me for tips on how to survive but i cant give an answer since i still believe that death is an option if youre f up with this world. 

I dont tell them to kill themselves, im just refusing to answer because i dont want them to hear that i still think death is ""good"".",28Sep2018,1
