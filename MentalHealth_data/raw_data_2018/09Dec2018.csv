1,"They didn’t see it coming. I’m the suffering quietly type.

Didn’t even ask for anything. Didn’t want the attention. When I got back from hospital a few months ago, I found out no one was returning my calls. They had collectively decided to push me out.

One suggested I should begin making amends and start apologizing. I refused and gave up on them.

I have been in therapy 6 years. But haven’t been comfortable talking about my condition with others.

Here’s to my first baby steps. Hello guys.

Maybe if I’m open about my issues, and you don’t like me, it’s your responsibility how to deal with it. I hope. *sigh*",09Dec2018,1
2,So I’m visiting my folks and I’m babysitting while my dad and some other family members go out to get some drinks. I went to the bathroom and I heard my brother and sister laughing and I thought that someone broke in and was entertaining them I keep thinking people are watching but I’m aware all these things are irrational. Is this normal?,09Dec2018,1
3,"Not sure if this fits this sub but its active and I need advice. Like the title says the past year my stress levels have been through the roof. I have zero patients for anything and am constantly worried. Even when things are going fine I'll start freaking out about the next few months. Playing out scenarios in my head about my job, family, friends.

6 months ago I was referred to a oncologist due to very high iron levels in my blood. Being sent to a cancer center with no explanation definitely didnt help my stress levels but after another round of labs with them I was assured the issue was not cancerous but something we need to monitor and treat often. Everyday I hit a wall around 1-2 PM and am just exhausted and cant concentrate. Not sure if this is due to the polycythemia or stress. Or if it's just all related in general. 

Over the past few months when I can actually fall asleep I've been grinding/clinching my jaw at night extremly hard. When I put my teeth together their is a perfect imprint of the opposite teeth. I bought a mouth guard last month that I've already chewed a hole in due to the clinching. 

Everything keep feeling like its getting worse and I cant figure out how to ease any of it. I haven't felt right in a long time and scared if this keeps going downhill eventually I'm going to crash. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.

9,"So...this might get long. I have no easy way or short way to say this. So here's goes my yearning call for help, for answers, for a light in the darkness. Also, I am on the phone. Many errors may occur. My sincerest apologies. I live in central Mississippi, USA if that helps any. I am a white male, 27. 

I am currently living from my car. A car which isn't safe because the insurance totaled it when a friend got the back end messed up (while I was still living in an apt.) and so the car cannot get updated registration. Tags expired in 2017. I placed a plate cover over it to keep eyes from catching it. I cannot get insurance on it. The front tires have metal threads ahowing and the engine is 27,000 miles past it's last oil change. I have no choice though. She still drives for now. 

I lost my job in April of this year. By June 1, I was in my car. I sleep at parks and rear areas in my local area. I give a friend a ride to work (the same work I quit in April) and he keeps me with gas. Me lossing my job is nothing new- I have had over two-dozen jobs since I turned 17. I never keep one longer than a few months, with literally 2 exceptions. Those exceptions lasted less than 6 and 8 months. I used to blame others, move on and get another job. Then, I'd say the last 3 or 4 jobs, I begin thinking it was me that was the problem. I am unable to be fake or fake being nice. A lot of bosses treat you like an employee before they treat you like a human. Being how I am- I speak up and very clearly, loudly. I make no games or bush beating about how i expect to be treated. 80% of the time, I am reacting to workplace drama, gossip and games. I don't play well with such petty dramas and as such, i often won't ""keep my mouth shut"" and will speak up when my ears catch vibrations of folks faslely speaking about me, and I address it mostly when I notice even subtle changes in people's behaviors. 100% of my previois employers, including 1 that I sued successfully w/o a lawyer will say I put 110% of me in my work, a fast learner and loyally dedicated to quality, consistency. Yet, once my bosses promote me, (yes, in those shorts periods  i got promoted), then I became part of their ""circle"" and management has thr same dramas as the workers, just more hidden, private. Well, more money and responsiblity didn't change my direct and bold nature. This and my mouth kept me in conflict. I still cannot stand to sit by while someone lies or does wrong. Even in public, I have the urge to correct certain abusive/criminal/morally shitty shit. This keeps me locked up in tension with others. I do not play well. 

That's my assessment. It doesn't help me any. Jobs suck. But I ran for Mayor once, got 22% of primary vote with no campaign donations. I also started and quit 2 businesses, one which was successful and published in local news. I feel contagious to success after those losses. So apparently, any work sucks. Why? Why can't I keep my damn mouth shut and head down? Why can't I remain commited to anything. I even wrote 225,000 words about my life, after starting to read it, I deleted the copy and burned the papers. I literally hurt myself right when success seems on the cusp of the moment. I do not understand. 

It doesn't help my past is ludicrous. Where do I begin? Birth in 91 to a single 17yr old runaway girl at a Charity Hospital. The man whose sperm made me walked out after he pulled out. Lisa, my mother fought with another man while I was a baby- each pulling my limbs like a tug of war rope. I still feel the seering pain in my body when i think about it. Its my first memory and in my intial therapy sessions, Lisa said I was less than 1 year old and the guy was my ""father"" and he wanted to take me fishing while drunk, she feared for my safety and fought back. I suffered, but lived. Then, the sexual abuse from Lisa's friend/co-worker's daughter  at 3 traumized me because she tried to silenece and/or kill me by shoving my blindfolded body into a fire ant pile. Lisa thought it a sinster joke and physically pounded her into the ground until passerbys stopped her. She came home early that day, lucky me because by all accounts, I was gonna die. I spent 3 days in intensice recovery with 24 hour attention. Lisa learned the sexual abuse occurred in our intial therapy sessions. Lisa was a good ""mother"" for 4 years. She had no lovers and no family. Just me and her and her girlfriends/co-workers. We ate meals together, played games, watched movies, etc. Then...Rodney. A tall slender man shows up and never leaves at 4 years old. Lisa became someone else. No longer a mother. Rodney abused her, drugs and alcohol were used everyday. She was once passed around aexually to his friends while I watched and listened from the hallway. Then the physical abuse. The screams and yelling. At first between themselves. Then it was me and my sister. As if physical abuse wasn't enough, around age 6 the neglect begun. At first it was just a few hours, then days and then weeks. By 8, the state took me away when all ""adults"" responsibke for me were kon-responsive to state investigations of make-up covered brusies my teachers found. Needless to say, the state took me away at 8. 

I was a ""middle-aged boy fron a troubled home"" and therefore utterly ""unmarketable"" and ""unwanted"" by adoptive and foster parents- quotes from actual state case/social workers. Therefore, i was in need of special care. The truth is, the state had no where to house me. The system would pay for me to cycle through institutions, but i had to have a ""diagnosis"" and ""reason for treatment"". Orphan wasnt good enough, but my ""troubled family and past"" was and bam, 10 years of one place to the next. Never with a word from family or friends or anyone. When Lisa ran away, she cut ties with EVERYONE, period. So, the state had no family or family friends. My sister got a foster home and eventually adopted, I always thought she was lucky. She was a baby when we got taken away. However, her foster father sexually abused her and she endured a life of physical abused as i later found out when we reconnected as adults. She ended up moving to be with Lisa, longing for a family. Lisa still being Lisa, keep my sis tied up with wrong people. A couple years ago, my sister was shot in the head at point blank while sitting in her car waiting for a friend at an apartment. The guy pulled up and shot her dead, with a baby in the womb and a infant in the back seat, directly behind her. I partially blame Lisa, duh. The blame doesnt bring peace- it is an immeasurable and  eternal loss. This is the shortest summary ever and so much is left out, obviously. 

I am dying inside. I have no idea what is wrong with me. I cannot keep friends. (I only have the one, he been my friend for over 8 years, but he too is struggling). I do not do drugs. I am not a criminal (the few crimes i commited I didn't get caught). I tried college several times. Not my cup of tea. 

I am lost and blindly confused in a world stranger than nature. I almost prefer the calm and soothing, nurturing nature of the wild outdoors. I, however, also want to write a book about my life, tell my story. Help other. I aspire to be President one day. I hope to take a private craft to the Moon and beyond. I want a nural lace, and to genetically better myself. I want to teach and share. I want to love and show people real loyalty and compassion isn't frail or dead. Yet, deapsite my biggest dreams, my most ideal ideas of myself, and my powerful yearning for life over death, I am still. I am quiet. I am alone. I am afraid. I am lost in a world i never made. 

I know this might seem all over the place. The tick here is that i am on a phone, which screen i have ductape to hold together. I am cold, and I simply don't know what to say or convey. What will get people's attention these days? What is real? Does anyone care about our experiences anymore? Is there help for someone like me? Am I doomed? 

I am finally getting SNAP benifits, applied today after the last of my ego eroded. I am asking for help because I have no other option. I am at my wits end. Jordan Peterson, Alan Watts and so many others sound great, but why can't I apply their advice? Do i need more professional help or am I being lazy? I am draining. My body grows weaker. I have lost 30 pounds since April. I am literally not even getting out of my car anymore- I used to go for walks on nature trails with my dog. Now my friend feeds him and walks him. My dog refuses to leave the car to live with him though. Endearing, but not profitable or helpful to my situation. I am kissing death and lossening my embrace of life. I fear I am halfway to the drain and the dark hole waiting to swallow me is an eternal grave of not just my body, but of me. And whatever I could become. 

How do I live? What do I do? Where can I go for help or am I hopelessly on my own? I am desperate to know I am human, and therefore, nothing human can be alien to me. Maya Angelou said that quoting soemone else, but I feel good and happiness and growth and human propersity is as alien to me as a star I have never seen. I love this bright blue and watery rock I find myself on, but love of life is no substitute for living a life. 

Anything? Anyone?

15,"Hey everyone, how do you deal with feelings of guilt when you are depressed. 

A little background, I’m in the middle of a bipolar depression and I am being consumed with guilt. Many years ago (over a decade) I shattered a girl’s life. We broke up (I broke up with her) and she ended up in a depression for quite awhile after. Dunno if it was DEPRESSION but certainly like that. Despite the way she treated me being bad to say the least, I felt bad. 

Never thought much of her (random thoughts here and there) but nothing major. 2 months ago I hit an extreme low. On par with my lowest ever. All of a sudden I am swamped with thoughts of our break up and it is starting to drag me further down. I know these are intrusive thoughts but my usual methods of dealing aren’t working. And I feel even worse as I am married and I feel this is somehow disrespectful to my wife. 

Help anyone? How do you guys deal with it and stop it from pulling you down? ",09Dec2018,1
16,"This is the first time I've talked to him in a long time, I've only ever met him once when I was nine and I'm 31 now. He said he was surprised that I would forgive him or that I even wanted to talk to him. He said he didn't know how often I'd want to talk and asked if he could call back in a few days. I told him that I would enjoy talking to him and wouldn't be mad either way, that he couldn't call too little or too much, so not to worry about that. 

I found out that his mom died last month and that I have a brother who is three years older than me.  He said he went to prison for manufacturing meth. He did 5 years in a regular penitentiary, he's been in a prison work camp for the past 4 years and he's going to remain there for another three years. He said he has become a born-again Christian and then he created a Facebook so that me and my long lost brother would be able to find him hopefully. 

The first time I saw him I had carried my brother and sisters father's last name and had not known that I had a different father for 9 years. So when I suddenly met him, I knew I should have been in shock or ecstatic or maybe upset but I wasn't. I was like okay cool. I was very neutral about the whole thing it was nice and all but I really didn't feel much about it. I went to his house and met his wife and his three step kids and we played alien on the PlayStation. I was there for about an hour and then he took me back to my mom and I never saw him again. 

When I was 19 I went with a friend to where I had known his house to be and found he didn't live there. At that time I had some sort of drive to at least catch up with them and say hi. I went to box over to where I had known his mom lived and she came to the door and didn't even open it all the way and told me I didn't look like me. I stopped and said, “wasn't I a baby the last time you saw me?” I asked her if she wanted to see my ID. She said my dad wasn't in the state and that he didn't want to be found. She wouldn't even take my number. 

Even then, what she was doing didn't upset me as much as the fact that she was doing it, if you know what I mean. I never cried about it, I never built up any sort of hate. I AM going to try to get to know him.. It DOES feel weird to have a dad all of the sudden. Suddenly conscious of what he might think of me and my life choices. 

He says the reason he wasn't in my life is because he was with that woman whose kids he was raising and she was really jealous of my mom even though my mom was remarried with two more kids of her own. I'm just being really cautious of a man who hasn't cared for 30 years and suddenly does. ",09Dec2018,1

I've been battling depression and anxiety for at least half of my life. I have received other diagnoses, such as bipolar/schizoaffective disorder, possibly AD(H)D...I'm more convinced on the latter since times like right now I have zero concentration and it's very infuriating. It's ruining what little of a life I have. Everyone is moving on, getting married, having children while to have completed school and launching in their careers. Where am I? Still at home, broke/jobless, barely making it through university... Sounds like minor problems but it all has built up and I'm not sure how much longer I can take it. I don't have anyone to reach out to and cry for help. I dread on going back to my psychiatrist who's prescribed pills that don't even work because I don't like his demeanor when we talk in his office. If anything, I feel more judged by the very professionals who are supposed to help on issues that others would deem you as insane of. Had incidents on multiple occasions with them. I never asked for this and wish to live a normal life. I don't see that happening and I contemplate on whether to die often.

I don't expect anyone to sympathize. I just need someone who can understand where I come from with these issues and concerns.

28,"I'll just try and tell a bit about me in the Hope's that someone else can give me a bit of advice or direction as I am more than a bit lost in my life.
I was born in a small town while my parents were pursuing religion or possibly morality for their family. After a few years attending a Baptist church, and my parents becoming disgruntled by the poor behavior of the pastor and other members they stopped going to the church.
Not long after we started meeting in our houses with this lunatic ex-cop/self proclaimed pastor, he was by most definitions I would say the leader of a cult and it was very tough most days. Our families were both already homeschooling and I had only my siblings and the children of the other families to befriend.  Things like the radio, movies and even reading materials were all heavily censored to be sure there was absolutely zero ""secular influences"".
After several years of this my family and the leader decided that the town/state was not a good place to raise us, they then moved us to the south east into a very small redneck town full of yee yas that further rejected us due to the fact we were ""Yankees"".
I left when I was 18 moving up to the new England states area where I started working, right off the bat I realized that my social skills were less developed than mere children and I could not relate with anyone about anything. I had completely rejected pretty much everything I had been tought about religion and so many other things in my life. I worked retail, I worked at a factory and then I started as a mechanic helper. I found that when given a chance I could far surpass other techs, even at the beginning. Over the years I had a relationship lasting 5 of which, but never any true friendships. After about 10 years of wrenching and making pay well in excess of 65k a year I started to want more out of life, I left the east and moved to Co, finding myself working and evermore alone, just in another place I decided to further challenge myself by joining the military.  
No I am 30, completely miserable about the knuckle dragging job I have. I do literally nothing 90% of the work day and am confident I could do the jobs of 50 people here and still not even work as hard as I used to.

Then, once the hair was all knotted, I would either rip it out bit by bit or just yank that sucker out of my scalp. I gave myself bald spots. Other kids noticed and teased me about it so I just kept tearing hair out from the stress. 

I recently started doing it again, since my hair is getting a bit long now. I'm not really sure why. It's nowhere near as bad as when I was little but...still.

Now 2 months into unemployment and the stress and pressure placed by my parents and myself into finding a job is getting too much. 

A week or so ago I drove past my local dominoes and a sign that said “Delivery Drivers Wanted, Apply Inside”, which I thought may be cool but with every other job listing I’ve seen I have doubted myself: “What if I stuff up while answering calls?”, “What if I stuff up making a pizza if I need to?”, “What if my hands get shaking with change?” Etc etc and so for the last week or so my plan has been to order a pizza, go in there, casually ask about the position and go from there..but every time I think about it, the doubt sets in and I put it off for another day..like I do with most things.

38,"Hello. First time poster. And... I don’t like what I am. 

I suffered a fall when I was five years old from a six foot wall and I hit my head on concrete. My frontal lobe was damaged in a way that didn’t reveal itself until I was a teenager. I come from a normal family with no history of mental illness and I didn’t suffer any kind of abuse or deprivation. But I ended up acting out in sexually inappropriate ways, there was no filter for my emotions and I was physically and emotionally abusive to my family, I developed severe substance abuse problems, I failed in school. 

My parents didn’t know how to help me. I went to one doctor after another and accumulated so many diagnoses and medications. They thought that I was just being bad and rebellious. They didn’t think of the head injury. That wasn’t explored by professionals until I was already well into adulthood. They just wanted me to stop behaving like I was.  Maybe they felt guilty that it had happened. 

I have been institutionalized four times since I was 15. Once at 15 for behavior, I was put in a therapeutic boarding school for two years at 17, again at 21 for suicidal thoughts ans alcoholism and a break down, and again at 33 after being addicted to amphetamines and having a breakdown. I’ve been battling addiction to drugs and alcohol for the past two decades. I married a person in my right mind I wouldn’t have anything to do with and had two precious children. The marriage ended horrifically after he cheated on me three times. I lost custody of my two young girls due to drug usage. 

Five years ago, at my last hospitalization they diagnosed me with BPD and bipolar. The lithium and seroquel gave me a degree of stability I had never experienced. I have now been sober in AA for three years this January.  I eventually got custody of my children back. And I just finished student teaching and am about to finish my second master’s degree this year. 

But existing is still so hard for me. I work with a therapist on DBT skills but I still struggle with having a filter with my romantic partner when it comes to anger and I fear I will eventually drive him away even though I am doing all I can and working as hard as I can to recover. My life shows progress. 

But... I’m still me. I’m this person with a damaged brain that has made her have two mental illnesses and substance abuse problems. My life has been such a struggle. It takes so much to keep me at baseline....two medicines, meetings, a sponsor, a psychiatrist, a therapist... I don’t like myself sometimes. I wish no one could see what I truly am. And my partner can see it. It is hard to have close relationships because I’m quite ashamed to be this inherently damaged. 

I know I should look to the positive. Sometimes it’s harder to do that than others. I hope I can make it. I hope I can overcome this. I hope I can have a happy life. I don’t think about actually killing myself or anything, but having to struggle against all these things makes existing a real challenge. 

I just needed to share this in a place where I hope others can relate and understand. ",09Dec2018,1
39,"I’m not sure how this works so I’m sorry if I broke any rules.

My anxiety has made me a seclude and has left me feeling distant from the people I’m close to. But the more I think about it, they haven’t reached out either and any chance of connecting falls through.

They either ghost. Or just leave me with one word responses. ..

It seems great at first with them, but then it ends up with me feeling like a randomness person trying to fit in. 

This has been going on for some time and needed to convince myself that they are maybe I need change the way I am (tone down my anxiety when I’m around them). But I even ask them what’s wrong and they don’t tell me or even respond to the question.

Now I’m even more anxious thinking where I made a mistake. I cant even make the effort to reach out to someone else because they may feel the same way as my other friends...

I don’t know where I belong at this moment in my life and it wasn’t like this before. 

I feel that I’ve tried consistently to share my feelings but I can’t overcome the anxious notion that it’s my fault this is happening.

40,"Not asking for help or anything, just sharing something I'm feeling kinda burdened with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently realized that I had a habit of oversharing with everyone I met and knew throughout my life - this was partly learnt from home (and having controlling, abusive parents) and it was partly cultural, everyone in my town kinda still overshares to this day. The trick seems to be to overshare about certain things while keeping other things to yourself - people overshare about their sexuality all the time at my work, while keeping their insecurities hidden.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I didn't really have any instruction on keeping things to myself when out in the world, so I kinda carried myself like this throughout the time, until I received a lot of intentional and unintentional abuse and manipulation which pretty much wrecked all my progress mental-health wise upto that point, and forced me into isolation. I should've known better then, I'm glad I know at least now. I don't have to justify everything to everyone, and I can make decisions for myself (though it feels alien and weird to not constantly worry about everyone else's approval of me). And in the middle of a hypomanic rant, I can actually stop myself if I try really hard and excuse myself to go to the washroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's a tiresome, tiresome process of trying to reintegrate myself to this society again. Some people still remember me as the guy who is entertaining with his oversharing, and edge me on and ask loaded questions. I am susceptible to people asking me to put on a show - it's like booze to an alcoholic. These are paralysing, and oftentimes I get caught up in the moment and speak up only to feel letdown later. There are lines that can be drawn, it's just so confusing to know when and how - and to not be an absolute bastard to myself when people ridicule me for not knowing where to draw lines, or not drawing lines like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Most good friends I had, I estranged when I isolated myself, because of all the mistrust and my spiralling anxiety and paranoia. They're around, but they seem to be walking on eggshells around me. Maybe they're right to do so - the closest I have come to having matching symptoms was with histrionic personality, and I can kinda see why someone would not want a shit ton of drama in their lives when their own plate is full :|

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda don't want sympathy now, but I do want to not be mocked for being a certain way. I also realize I kinda decided to withdraw from many people who seemed to be pushing me around(I'm about 80% sure they were having fun at my expense, but they also seem to be hurt now - weird), for the first time ever in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm learning boundaries now, and I don't quite know what they really work like. I wish I had good friends, but then again I don't want to parentify them, nobody has to go through that. I won't be seeing my counselor until the end of holidays again, and I am going to be alone during this time. I hope to put all the newfound realizations to work during this time, and hopefully not lead myself into weirder spots. It's possible that I'm in an upswing mood-wise as I'm writing this, sorry if it was triggering in any way. I'm glad I had the internet during all my times of struggle, just needed to get this out somewhere.

I looked and the kid hadn’t left the room then I started to spiral with fear. This has been a problem for me but it’s getting worse as I often say on this subreddit. I was worried that I would have a panic attack and not be able to make sure that the kid was ok and I was worried that the kid would fall down or something and I couldn’t do anything but I didn’t have a panic attack.

44,"I will preface this with some basic information about me. I’m 22, I’m male, I’m British, and I’m in my final year of university. As a result of multiple things, I have been feeling extremely low for a long time. Long post incoming, if anyone has the time to read this, thank you. Alll I want is advice. 

The big ones are: 

* my first true relationship ended after 2 years, I ended it, and I wouldn’t want it back. But the feelings of loneliness haven’t abated since.

* I became extremely reliant on marijuana and other drugs (specifically alcohol, although I used to use MDMA and Cocaine fairly regularly too [once a week/per drug, 3-4 times a week for alcohol, every waking moment for marijuana]

* I became extremely disillusioned with my studies and degree and have begun to loathe them. Personal debt and being **this** close to the finish line have prevented be dropping out.

I lived in China for my third year of university and my mental state began to deteriorate seriously. I began drinking daily, I had enough weed in my possession in China to warrant the death penalty, but didn’t care. I was even snorting whatever the fuck the Chinese drug dealers were selling to me without any care at all that it could be literal poison. I lost all control of my life. I began to experience extreme suicidal urges, and had to be pulled from the 26th floor window apartment I lived in by my best friend in two occasions. I wrote a lengthy suicide note to my parents, begging for their forgiveness. This is something they don’t know to this day.
And one day, I cracked. My parents are both intelligent and open minded people, but to them, mental illness can be explained away as ‘sadness’

The day I broke was literally the busiest day of the year for my mum, the only day I’d been told not to contact her. I rang her and told her I was dangerously suicidal and had to come home immediately, or I probably wouldn’t live to see the end of the week.

Her first response? “Is this for real or are you just being dramatic?” I replied “this is for real.” And suddenly, I had a flight booked the very next day. I love and adore my mum for doing this, and if very probably saved my life.

When I got home, the questioning began immediately. The crux of their arguments is **always**: you live an amazing life and want for nothing. You live in a lovely home with a middl class family and you don’t even have to buy your own food! Me [mum] and your dad have gone through much tougher things in our lives, bailiffs at the door, the deaths of our parents, how dare you put us through these worries when you live in nothing but happiness?!

I explained that I didn’t understand why I felt like this, and when my head is clear, death and suicide is never on my mind. I do truly love my life. I don’t want to die. I have wonderful and very achievable future plans after university. But every day seems worthless. I feel worthless; even though I know that I am not. I struggle to explain to them my feelings clearly, because I do not understand them myself. I understand the root causes, but I do not understand why I have such a deeply nihilistic view of everything despite the majority of my life going incredibly well. My dad often calls me selfish for even telling them that I contemplate[d] suicide. 

I decided to help myself, firstly. I quit weed. I started going to the gym again and cycling. Got a good job. Attended all of my university classes. Everything was looking up.

And then, for no good reason at all; I crashed again. I’ve lost around a stone in weight, and countless people comment on how skinny I’ve become. My mum commonly laughs at me for my inability to finish a small meal and tells me that she will start making me ‘baby portions’. I have begun resorting to eating plain bread to take hunger away when it rarely comes to me these days.
I started smoking weed again, as it made the bad thoughts (well, all thoughts, really) go away in that sweet brain fog. I have since quit again because I know it isn’t good for me with my addictive personality.
I finally came out and told my parents this, and my mum booked me a doctor’s appointment. It is on Monday. Despite this, my parents rhetoric has barely changed.
Furthermore, mum has started trying to fear monger me: “if you tell the doctor you’re suicidal, they HAVE to section you, you’re going to be in a mental hospital, do you want that?” And: “Anti-Depressants won’t help the root cause [this I do agree with to an extent] and you’ll only become addicted to them as you did weed, do you want another drug addiction?!”

No, mum. I want to get better. And I want you and my dad to understand that I don’t understand why I feel like this. And I just want help or guidance or anything. I’m so lost.

[since leaving China ~8 months ago, I have not attempted or **seriously thought about** suicide, except on one particularly bad panic attack a few months back, I thought about it then but never did anything close to the climbing out a window shit I did when I lived abroad. I am very concerned that my returning darkening moods and overall lack of contention with anything in life could cause a resurgence in these feelings, hence going to see a medical professional in two days]",09Dec2018,1

48,"Due to the apathy and ego-death that I've experienced with depression, I've been struggling a lot with knowing what I want to become/do in the future. At first, I thought I was just struggling with picking something (i.e. a career, a persona, a lifestyle, etc), but the more that I've thought about it, the more I've realized I simply don't have a preference for any of the aforementioned due to my lack of pleasurable feelings. I don't feel any less depressed when I do something that is in alignment with what I think of as my true self, the self underneath of the depression. I feel pretty similarly regardless of what choices I'm making in my life.

Now, I'm not saying that I don't see the point in ambition or making good choices-- I certainly do still, simply due to my own personal will. But motivation? Actual pleasure from making progress or living in alignment with my values? I struggle to even feel these things anymore. It makes it hard to know WHICH goals I even want to work towards, what person I even want to be, etc. So, while I have the desire to have a good and successful life still, due to a lack of pleasure I simply don't even know what that looks like anymore, and when I am living it I struggle to really feel it or realize I'm in a ""good"" place.

Yesterday was a very triggering day for me. Haven't had such in a very long time.Basically I had to go to a cardiologist(I am fine, no worries), but I had to lift my shirt there, for them to hear my heart and so on.

However, after I came back home, I saw that my shirt, which was tuck into my jeans, has come in contact with my underwear, and there was a wet spot on my underwear, so now I am freaking out. I had touched that shirt when i was lifting it, and I know the spot was from preseminal fluid, which is what I am afraid of, as well as semen. 

So of course my brain got into the loop of thinking that I had contaminated my hands while lifting the shirt and then contaminated everything else that I had touched afterwards.

I feel terrible, because of this, obviously I cannot clean everything that I have come in contact with. But moreover I feel terrible that I did not predict/envision this happening. I should have put a second pair of underwear, just in case, as this situation has happened before, as well. And I hate myself for not learning my lesson.Nope, I am not concerned about a health hazard, at all.Nothing will happen, but it is morally wrong to spread fluids around. Especially these fluids. And it is not just the clothes. If I have touched a ""contaminated"" spot and then touched so many other things, especially things I cannot wash like documents and things in public, then these things are forever contaminated, and it is all my fault, just because I tucked the stupid t shirt in my jeans. I shouldn't have worn the t shirt in the first place or I should have worn two pairs of underwear as to prevent any leaks. There were ways I could have avoided this situation and I knew those ways and I didn't take any action. That is what drives me nuts.

Hell, I do it more often on school nights. However, I don't usually have too much trouble getting to sleep once I actually put everything away and crawl into bed.

One night recently I recognized that I had the chance to get to bed by 12 after having gone to bed at a (relatively) healthy hour for two nights in a row, and I actually had a thought along the lines of, ""I can't keep going to sleep this early."" This could be partially explained by the fact that I've made a habit of telling people the next day the hour at which I got to sleep that morning. I do this for the sake of ""comedy,"" although the look on their faces gets significantly less funny after repeated attempts. Also, I stop caring when I'm really tired.

It seems evident that there's something (okay, maybe a few things) wrong up there. Could this qualify as insomnia? Any other ideas as to what it could be?",09Dec2018,1
61,"Im 18 years old and ive been through quite a lot of events in my life the past two years, which has just made my mental health so much worse. I worked for a retail company for a year where I would often have days off due to my anxiety (currently prescribed sertraline) and I even had a sick note from my GP giving me two weeks off because of it. 
I recently started a new job that has the potential to grow into a career - but its a 40 hour contract. I find that i dont have any time to let my brain heal, which i know a lot of people will feel when working full time. I hate the fact i sound so entitled. 
I just dont think that I can do it anymore. The two days a week that I have off is just trying to catch up with sleep and making any attempt at a social life. I am the most depressed I have been in a long time.  I thrive in a working environment, and I never want to not work, but I just dont think that I can ever work full time. 
Whats putting extra pressure on me is that ive already had two sick days and also was sent home early due to constant panic attacks that day. My boss didnt even bother replying or answering the phone to me calling in sick for the second time. However she let other staff members know that she read my message (I sent because I couldn't get hold of her by phone). I feel like theyre already annoyed at me. 
I feel like im a waste, like my brain is too stupid to let me work. My mum always wanted me to have a good job, but I dont think I can ever get that. I feel like im letting her down and everyone will think im dumb. 
Its all just getting too much for me. On top of that, I never managed to complete my a-levels or college courses due to the events I underwent, so ill never be able to go to uni, which is stressing me out because I just want a decent job. I really don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the little vent im just hoping someone has some advice. ",09Dec2018,1
62,"Hi,  
I've been on paroxetine for OCD/anxiety for six weeks now (first week 10mg/now 20mg/day) and for last two weeks I feel like I am not sleeping well, mostly to the end of my sleep cycle (i get up sooner and tired, then I try to sleep again but I doesn't help much) and it takes me loong time to even get out of bed.

I was just wondering as paroxetine has 21 hour elimination half-life, if it cannot somehow affect this. I take my pill at cca 9.45, I tend to go to sleep around midnight, 00:30ish, I usually spontaneously wake up around 8-9.

And I'm curious in general - any experiences with regards to SSRI/other medication elimination half-times?

(I have difficulty reaching orgasm, so I have yet to try if trying before taking my pill when there should be less paroxetine in my system could help)

Thanks and crossed fingers for everyone struggling &lt;3

1) you can write  exams this year but you have panic attacks, no breaks, can't do what you love,in a toxic school,no way to deal with depression than move on, you can't breathe properly for 3 months therefore producing low results in the exam 

2)you can write exams next year but all your friends are in a grade above you, study at home without stress or panic attacks, can deal with depression by doing whatever you love or exercise, actually have time to study, get sleep,may reduce anxiety and depression,no toxic environment, actually have time, but you loose almost a year but you can use that year for the above and write exams and get better results.

69,"I'll start off saying I have talked to my parents about my feelings before and my mom actually brought the idea up of getting someone to talk to because I dont open up. This was about 4 years ago and nothing has happened. She asked through out the years but more recently when my boyfriend started going. She asked him questions about it for me but I dont think I need it. But a couple of weeks ago she said she never get me ""help"" so I think it's the end of that.  I dont like talking to her about how I'm feeling because she is religious and says if I kill myself it's a sin and how i choose to make myself sad. She also uses things i say against me and tells me the devil is inside of me and it doesnt make me feel great and I dont see the point.

Anyways my boyfriend has been telling me more recently that I should talk to my parents about a therapist. I've been cutting for years and had periods where I've stopped but recently it's been almost every night. I mentioned it before he saw after a couple of months of being together. I also dont like talking about it, it makes me feel like I'm begging for intention or something and I dont feel it's very important to. He says that I have depression but I disagree. I know I get sad sometimes and stuff but I dont think that's what's going on but he says if I wasnt depressed I would do that but I dont get that. My older sister that is very close in age, knows and often goes through my things and finds things like blades or razors I've hidden and completely forgot about. She is also trying to get me to tell my parents and that I need help but I will if I feel like I need help, I know I would bring it up. She says if I dont she will tell them herself because she feels it's only getting worse and she feels guilty for keeping it from them.

I dont know why I do things that I do. Sometimes I dont feel okay and certain things will happen and I feel like I found a way to show myself some sort of feeling. But other times I feel like I need to and that I should hurt more then I am. I'm not good at anything I dont have a hobby or something I enjoy doing, I dont even go to school. I feel like it's a way to just deal with things   and shouldnt be a big deal as much as like a hobby or something but I dont know how I feel about being told i need help.

I dont feel like I need help, I'm doing things safely and it's not hurting anyone. It's not like I am trying to kill myself when I do. People can go through life a figure things out for themselves why would I have to go and talk to someone else about my life to try and help me understand things when I should be able to do it myself?

I don’t know how to ask the doctor and last time I was there I meant to ask but aborted mission at the last second. I never told anyone how I’ve been feeling and don’t know how to go about.

71,"When I was a kid I went through events that most would say is traumatic. It wasnt violent, but it wasnt good. So most of the time when people talk about trauma they talk about flashbacks and remembering the typically violent act and how to process it. But I dont have anything like that. I hardly remember what happened, to the point of where I question if it even happened. I dont have issues with having it come up at random times. The only thing MAYBE I deal with that I see about is body memories, cause whenever I really try to remember what happened its kinda like I feel it, even though I dont know the details of what ""it"" is.
So basically all my therapist wants to know about me is what happened, even though I dont wanna talk about it. He tries to give me books about trauma, but I never relate to any of it and they arent helpful. Ive been thinking about the trauma more since Im in therapy and my therapist brings it up all the time and thinks its the root of all my issues, even though he doesnt exactly know what happened. I used to never ever have it cross my mind, but now I think about it every day. Isnt suppose to be when you process through things it gets better and not worse? It never bothered me before but now it really bothers me a lot, and I cant find any help online or anywhere cause I dont relate to any of what or trauma victims have to say.",09Dec2018,1

I also could not imagine any form of responsibility other than my job right now. A lot of guys my age are married with kids and a wife, while I’m scared of taking on the responsibility of a dog. The thought of having to be the man in a marriage and make sure my family has everything they need terrifies me. I get anxiety thinking about it.

I also noticed that I am not as emotionally strong compared to most people my age. Everyone I talk to is determined to do well in life and will work two-three jobs in order to maintain what they need, while I feel like I would commit suicide if I were in a financial situation like that.

83,"Hello I apologise for my bad english and thank you if you read my story and give me an advice because I have no idea how to continue with my life.

I am 20 years old male and I suffer from big depressions and anxiety everyday. I do not remember when I felt relaxed or not worried whole day, I feel scared whole day and stressed I can not even learn or live a normal life. I have social problems, like if I go to college for class or talk with random people I feel terrible and I start to vomit(or try to vomit), I cant even eat in the morning or before class because I will start vomiting at moment before entering college institution or meet random people. ( I do not really visit college, only preparing course) 

This year I have finished the secondary school, it was one of the most terrible years of my life, I will explain further.

I always had to have the best results from class and I learnt everyday for school and felt happy, previous year before final year I became a sick(throat infection) and was at home for 2 weeks and taking antibiotics, unfortunatelly my ex-classmates did not want to help and noone sent me notes from last 2 weeks (even they were preparing and learning for school, they could not waste 5 minutes of their time?) I had to go school on next day and I started feeling terrible, that noone helped me and I will come unprepared and then it became, I started vomiting and feel sick in stomach. Since then became one of worst years of my life. Before every test I wanted to vomit,(that feel when you want to vomit and you actually feel you are going and open mouth but nothing goes out) and also before oral exam I started to have same feeling so I hide my face with my arm so noone sees. I couldnt even do presentation of my project because of this, so I sent project to teacher and I went to WC that I feel bad so I dont have to present it, after the lesson ended I felt normal again. I also noticed that I am not ABLE TO LEARN, that everything new takes me 2x more time to learn and I forget the curriculum after 1-2 weeks and when we we did revision I felt like I never heard of this (Maybe you think that I am a bad student, that i did not learn and prepare so thats why I do not remember, but I will be honest with you, last 4 years I had only the best marks on final paper, so I prepared everyday). In the week of final oral exams, I vommited every morning and did not sleep so good but still I somehow got the best results again. 

This all ""vomiting"" started since I was very small, always before I went to kindergarten or somewhere outside of my home I started vomiting or trying to vomit, then I did not want to eat anything there. My parents were arguing a lot like every year and I felt scared every year because of them and their bullshit, they destroyed my mental health. There was a period when I did not have any of these issues it was when I was 11-15. At that time I didnt really cared for good results and future. When im telling my parents now about this issue now they act like im retarded that I am 20 yo, and I should GET OVER it, so I tried to get over it, started going to GYM but it did not get away. 

Now I am preparing for college, because I was not accepted, I am not concentrated I feel scared and before going to college course I do same thing, want to vomit. I again dont remember much what I have learnt even after revision. My dad told me last year that they will not accept me and he did this again to get me mentally down.

I tried to find a normal institution which would help me in this issue, but in my country there is nothing like that and everyone cares about money.

I understand that stress is normal part of life, but I dont want to feel to vomit or want to vomit anymore just to eat and work like a normal human...

Please recommend me something to do, or how to get over it. I cant let this to destroy my life. ",09Dec2018,1

It’s not the first time it has happened and I’m embarrassed to admit that this actually makes me sad. I’ve even been trying to rely on them less as friends and have closer relationships with other people, but I still turn into a middle school girl when I don’t have the chance to decline an invite.

I’ve struggled with feelings for years that I’m not real and no one around me is real. My emotions have never felt sincere, like I have to fake any joy/excitement/surprise etc. I’ve struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts because of it for a very long time.

92,"When we were young we would play imaginary games. We were each others only friends. From the very beginning I noticed that he was a little bit off from everyone else, not stupid per say, just kind of eccentric and odd... I didn’t take it much to mind because I was only like 7 at the time and I didn’t even know what mental illness was or that it even existed... So we continued to play these imaginary games involving imaginary people, places, things, and creatures. I always knew that it was imaginary and just for fun, but he seemed to take it more seriously, however I didn’t think it was weird, I just thought “wow he’s really into this game”. As time went on we both enjoyed imaging new things in the game and playing things out (as kids would do), but eventually I noticed that we were starting to get a little too old for this. We were about in grade 7-8 at the time this came to mind. I decided to just confront him and say “you know this is a game right?” And he laughed and said “yeah sure it is.” I kind of laughed back thinking that he knows it’s a game he’s just still playing around. Well more time went on it was the end of grade 8 and it was summer break. At the end of summer break I was expecting to go back to school to see him there like every other year previously, but he wasn’t. It turns out he moved somewhere else about 3 hours away and we didn’t have each other’s phone numbers so I never knew what happened. 5 years later, I got a message on Facebook from an account with his name. I waved back curiously and sure enough it was him. I was amazed that he still remembered me after 5 years and we exchanged phone numbers and started talking, and the first thing he wanted to talk about was the imaginary game that we used to play. I said “Man you can’t be real lol, your still playing that game?” And he said “(my name) it’s not a game.”. After hearing this, I started to get scared because not only has he not stopped believing in this game, he’s become obsessed with it and he’s also talking about very dark and morbid things. He insists now on talking to me every day and claims he’s going crazy if he doesn’t. I want to get away from him but im afraid that if I just vanish like he did, he’ll actually go crazy. And if he’s actually schizophrenic, who knows what he would do and if I’d get in shit for it for making him this way.

93,"(Fresh account because people know my main account)

Okay so I’m here mostly to vent because I’ve kept my mental state to myself almost entirely for my whole life. I consider myself in an okay place mentally right now (far better than when I was a teenager). I’d also like to see what any of you think about the effect of my physical injuries had on my mental health. I’m not expecting legitimate advice, just trying to discuss. I’m considering seeing a physiatrist once I get my insurance figured out. 

Quick log of my mental state. 

•8th Grade
Was always kind of an emotional and shy kid but I wouldn’t say depressed really. Throughout the year I started being more social and kind of started to find myself a little bit. I had night terrors but didn’t really affect much accept for a few sleepless nights a month. Finished out the school year with good grades in my honors classes. I had been for the most part a straight A student up until 8 grade. Never had a problem with schoolwork accept for occasionally procrastinating on large projects. 

•Freshmen Year
Start going to aggressive underground hardcore music shows. If you know, you know. If you don’t, a lot of shows are basically fight clubs with a live soundtrack. I took a good handful of really hard hits to the head over the course of the year. Most of them with headaches for a couple days. The only time i went to hospital was when I took a spin kick to the eye and could see that my cornea was scratched. This happened three hours away from where I lived and I didn’t go to the hospital til the following afternoon. Asked my doctor about concussions and he basically told me not to worry about it and gave me some eye drops. 

 A couple months after that incident, a guy I knew jokingly put me in a headlock while I was sitting at a table at a friends house. He locked up and I tapped but he didn’t stop. A few minutes later I wake up face down on the table in my own drool. My friends said I was having a seizure and they were about to call an ambulance but I came to so they didn’t. Me being 15 years old I didn’t know what to do, so I didn’t do anything. The whole next week I was still groggy. I still feel like I never came back from that 100%. I don’t think I got hit at any more shows after that but I’ve been to hundreds of shows so who knows. 

I no longer felt I could complete my honors classes and I didn’t really have anyone to tutor me so I stuck it out for the year and dropped down to normal classes the next year. 


•Sophomore Year
My sleep schedule was a nightmare. Some days I would lay in bed all night trying to sleep and couldn’t so I would go to school the next day and sleep through most of my classes. When I got home I would immediately hit the bed, wake up around midnight, then go off to school the next day. If I had to do anything after school I was fucked. It got to the point where the best sleep I was getting was in my English class. All of the stress from lack of sleep and pressure from family to keep good grades, took a toll on my digestive system. I missed about 7 days of school for exams and procedures (not consecutively) before they told me I had IBS. I missed about another 10-15 days from the pain and exhaustion. The county took me to truancy court and I provided all the documentation so they let me off. They gave me acid reflux meds and told me to change my diet but nothing really helped. At this point if became very difficult for me to maintain relationships. I was always irritable and in pain and most of my friends wrote me off without really trying to understand what was happening. I passed with mostly C’s. 

•Junior Year
I transferred to an online school to try and see if I could gain control of my situation. At this point I would say I became depressed. Most days I seemed to be in a fog and I wouldn’t get out of bed. I preferred being awake at night because I would get extremely tired in the daylight sometimes. It took everything in me to complete even one lesson a day. Eventually stopped doing my school work until the last week of the semester then I would cram it all in a few days. I searched for weeks to try and find jobs and the few I got I would quit after a month or two because of how anxious I was. 

•Senior Year
Still had sever motivational issues. Blew off all my lessons and crammed in the last day of the school and just barely passed. 

This continued up until I was 19 when I got a part time job that I could really just focus on my work and I was interested in it. By the time I moved out at 20 I would say I was doing good. I started sleeping mostly normal and my stomach issues rarely flared up.

Now I’m 22 and I’m starting feel like my senior year again . Work is going okay. I don’t feel like I’m progressing myself or my skills but I’m maintaining. I don’t have a set schedule so sometimes I’ll get a big project and work 60 hour weeks, sometimes 10 when we’re slow. Somehow this works for me and I still get my work done. A lot of days I won’t get out of bed til 2 and I can’t bring myself to do even the smallest chores. I’ll scroll reddit for hours just to put off eating and I don’t know why. I don’t ever really feel “sad” just not happy. Washing the dishes or doing the laundry mentally drains me. Social interaction is even worse. My girlfriend takes it the hardest because she thinks that she’s inadequate because of my mood.

Don’t get me wrong, throughout all of this I’ve had plenty of good moments, but I’ve never felt that I was in the right state of mind. There’s always that fog hanging overhead, no matter how small it seems it’s still there. 

I know this wasn’t the smartest thing to do but the other day a friend gave me a 10mg adderal to try and I’ve never felt so content. I didn’t feel high or numb or overclocked but It didn’t feel like there was an emotional hurdle to jump just to do simple things. I just felt like that’s how I’m supposed to be. I don’t want to rely on medication and I’m definitely not going to use anything further without prescription. I don’t want to feel like a waste of life and I don’t want to blame my problems on a mental illness. 


So that’s my mental health history. Just wanted to know someone else’s thoughts since I don’t feel comfortable talking to friends or family about this just yet. What steps did you take if you were in a similar situation?

97,"I'm 24. At school I was always the quiet one. I literally never spoke. I had a small group of friends and of course I spoke to them like normal, but everyone else got the silent treatment. This is because I used to be really anxious about speaking and thought I didn't have anything interesting to say... I just couldn't think of anything! My mind was a blank. I used to think I wasn't funny enough. I used to overthink EVERY single little detail of conversations and cringe.

These days, I am the opposite. I talk to people easily, I come across friendly and confident. I have good friends. I am very sociable. However, I still have the insecurity and low self-worth of the teenager I used to be inside me. I just learnt to overcome it on the outside. 

I found that I still give people a ""get out clause""... if we make plans, sometimes I'll say ""if you want to"" or ""do you still want to come? you don't have to I don't mind!"" ... even when they have given no indication of having changed their mind and it's rare that someone has said ""actually, lets take a raincheck"".

I still feel like other people are more funny, more confident, more likable, more open. I am constantly comparing myself and feel like people do not want me around even though there's nothing at all to suggest that. It's all coming from me.

Can I overcome this?",09Dec2018,1
98,"So back in late 2014, I started taking Effexor which improved my mood drastically and honestly gave me some of the best years of my life (Junior year of HS to Freshman year of college). During this time, I didn't do anything drug or alcohol related other than rarely having a glass of wine a dinner. 

Then, I went up to college. For my first semester, I didn't drink at all but during the second semester, my friends and I started to drink often and in fairly large amounts. And while I haven't drank in excess in nearly a year, I still feel as if my brain, mood, and thought processes have been permanently changed and starting to drink in early 2017 is where I feel there was a turning point. 

To make matters worse, as I was on Effexor at the time, my response to alcohol was far more sensitive than my friends. This was to the point that I would at least black out for a few moments during the majority of nights out. There were also then several times in which I would black out completely en bloc and would wake up with no recollection of the rest of the past a very clear point in my mind where I my memories cut off. 

In the fall of 2017, I began to crash into deep depression with other serious issues alongside it. It appeared that the Effexor also stopped working so I came off of that in December 2017 as well, but despite an initial feeling of positively and improvement, I'm back to being worse than before. 

I wish I had not been so stupid and negligent but at this point there is nothing that I can do about the past. However, it feels as if my mind as been negatively affected by this so much so that even experimentation with other substances (marijuana, LSD) weren't even that 'altering' to my mind. 

It feels like after I binge drank only a few times my mind was already fucked in a way, and if feels like there is no going back. When I think about it, even after having reduced my intake to light or moderate amounts and then later stopping completely for a long period of time, it feels like the effects are permanent, particularly with mood instability, derealization, and dissociation (I was also diagnosed with BPD earlier this year).

Am I just permanently fucked? Over the past year, I've tried a total of 9 medications ranging from SSRIs to stimulants to serotonin modulators to anti-psychotics, all while going through therapy, and here I am still too fucked up to function normally. This has reached the point that I'm either going to have to drop out temporary or go into inpatient or intensive out-patient. I just do know how much longer I can deal with this. ",09Dec2018,1

My mom doesn’t really like him either, but it’s not like me. I don’t like either of them, and in general I don’t really like any of my family except my brothers.

100,"This could probably be a post in a less specific sub, but I thought some of you might struggle with the same things I do. 

One of my biggest road blocks is I constantly start new journals. I have 5 or 6 right now that have maybe 5 pages with writing. It’s like different types of thoughts need to go in it’s own journal, or each one needs it’s own purpose. I think the ones I have right now are:

-	A diary for jotting down events and how life is going / feelings / mental inventory
-	Poems and ponderings
-	Ideas for writings and notes / quotes (things that never get turned into anything)
-	General life organization (to do lists and such)
-	A bullet journal

I know the simplest answer is to just put it all in one journal. It just feels so... wrong. I thought the bullet journal was my answer, but that made me feel so overwhelmed with having to stick to a structure, I just felt like I was doing it wrong, even though you can really do whatever you want with it. 

That’s the other thing, I feel like these journal need to be perfect. If I make a mistake on the dumbest thing I want to throw the whole thing out and start a new one. Or if I write something I don’t really like in the poems one.

It started when I was 7 up till I was 17 although it was significantly reduced by then. The worst one was when my dad slapped me so hard I fell off the chair and he still continued after I was down. As an Asian, I guess it was part of our culture back then to use physical force to discipline children but I for one swear never to use it. Not sure if this is relevant but my parents also heavily restricted my leisurely time and cash expenditure, and frequently used negative reinforcement. My dad used to have this habit where whenever he and I came home, he would lock me out of the house while I was still taking off my shoes. Because of this, there was once when I ran away from home and considered jumping out an open window of our building to commit suicide but didn't do anything yet as my mum chased after me.

107,"Hi all,

I am wondering if anyone else has experienced any symptoms like I have been the past few days. I'd like to preface this with saying that I have been diagnosed with Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the past, and am very familiar with what symptoms are normal for me and how my illnesses affect me.

Lately, all I want to do is stay in bed. I've been sleeping for about 12 hours a day when I can, and I have never experienced this before (yes, even with my depression - I feel exhaustion a lot normally, but never like this where I am unable to get out of bed for hours). I also generally find it hard to concentrate but things seem to be getting out of control. 

My suicidal ideation has gone absolutely bonkers. I have had suicidal thoughts on and off for years now but they have also never been this bad. It takes all of my energy sometimes to not act on my dark thoughts. (I am in contact with crisis people to make sure I'm safe).

Also (within the past few days) my balance has gotten weird I think? It takes me longer to walk places than it usually does. Sometimes it's like my brain gets confused about what it's supposed to do, and I have to pause and make sure I don't fall over). On a similar note, I just noticed that words sometimes look weird? Like, They some words appear slightly bigger than others, and some in a sentence seem to slant, if that makes sense? And it seems like there's a fog in my brain, almost.

All of this sounds really weird, I know. But I kinda feel like I'm losing it. Anyone have any thoughts about what I could be experiencing? Or suggestions on how to proceed? ",09Dec2018,1
108,"I \[20F\] do not have social anxiety. However, my good friend \[20F\] does and I am having a hard time being supportive because I just don't get it. Most days she is fine but anytime we eat in the university cafeteria she always talks about how she gets nervous eating in public because she thinks people are staring at her. Honestly, I have no idea how to respond anymore. The thoughts that go through my head are: ""Who cares if you're eating in a place where everybody is eating? Why do you think strangers care about you that much, isn't that sort of self-centered?""

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time I begin to feel awkward cause she goes on about how people must be judging her for doing really anything and I get the feeling that if she believes this because she is constantly judging me and other people. She asks me to order food and drinks for her sometimes because she is too nervous to talk to the cashier. So I will go do that and when I come back she goes on to guilt me about how it was agonizing to sit alone for a couple minutes while **I brought her food**. 

&amp;#x200B;

She got mad at me for about a week one time because we were in line at a coffee place and she ordered a 3-cheese bagel with cream cheese and I joked and said ""Haha, I guess that makes it a 4-cheese bagel."" to her and the cashier laughed too then said ""Oh man, you can put shredded cheese on it too and make an ultimate 5-cheese bagel!"" back. She got embarrassed and just left, leaving her food. I got it and ran after her and she freaked out at me saying that me and the cashier were ***making fun of her***. I have no idea how talking about cheese on a bagel could be construed as making fun of her, and again, I feel like it is very self-centered that she thinks everything needs to relate back to her.

&amp;#x200B;

She also throws these huge parties. I dislike parties, I feel unsafe at them and if it is more than 10-15 people I am not interested, so I never go. She *insists* that my distaste for parties is some form of social anxiety but I have tried to explain it to her that just because I dislike and avoid something doesn't mean I have a mental illness. Anyways -- she throws parties with her roommates that are 50-80 people, full of alcohol and drugs. She sort of brags about a time that somebody brought coke to her high-school party and snorted it off a twister board. So I don't get how she can't order food and expects me to do it but can throw huge raging parties all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just at my wits-end trying to put up with her when she guilt me about her social issues. At this point I just feel like she is really self absorbed and needy after putting up with it for two years. But perhaps this is because I just don't understand, and I really do want to get it. I am sorry if anything I have said seems insensitive, but I am just really tired of having to walk on egg-shells with her and I want somebody to explain it to me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - my friend with social anxiety makes me order her food. She guilts me about how her having to sit alone or when I talk to strangers in her presence it makes her nervous. I don't understand because she throws these huge raging parties all the time and is happy being a hostess.",09Dec2018,1

Credit rating is a low as it could get. I have Bipolar disorder and anxiety and right now I don’t even feel like I can live much longer like this. 

I have a full time job but had a bad episode in July with my mental health which resulted in me being admitted to hospital for a week and having about 2 months off work, my employer overpaid me sickness pay which is being deducted from my wages monthly.

I struggle to make ends meet and regularly go without food as I cannot afford to buy any, especially during the week before payday. I need help to manage money and debts. I don’t know where to start, I feel so overwhelmed and depressed and I literally have nothing at all for the next 2 weeks. I don’t even have anything of value I can sell to get temporary cash. 

I’m 32 on Thursday, I’m single, no kids, no where near being able to buy a house and I don’t even drive. I feel like I haven’t met any of the adult milestones and quite frankly I don’t even want to live anymore. My life is a constant battle. I feel like everything is completely out of control and I struggle to even sleep at night with worry.

I’m 25 and I’ve had bad mental health for as long as I can remember. I have diagnosed anxiety and depression atm but a previous psychiatrist diagnosed me with bpd as well. I’m not sure if my current systems align with bpd. I literally feel like I’M going nuts. I am extremely harsh and hateful of everything around me. If I see something normal on Instagram I will judge harshly and be hateful of the person in the post (especially if it’s a popular/pretty girl). Now I’ve never been popular and all my life I was told I was ugly until puberty (lol). Everyone started telling me I was beautiful after that but I was never able to like myself much. Every time I look in a mirror all I can see are the things wrong with me. My nose isn’t the right shape, my skin isn’t the right shade. This negativity has bled into my relationship. I’m in an LDR with a wonderful man. We got engaged a while ago. The only problem is I hate him more often than like him nowadays. Small things like him not asking to call for a day set me off. I tell him to leave me and ask him why he hasn’t. I tell him I don’t want to marry him and that I don’t like him or his family. I say vile things to him. There is a part of my mind that knows these things aren’t true and that I shouldn’t be saying them. I cannot help myself though. This pressure on my mind makes me cut myself. feel like I’m going crazy. Please don’t say that I don’t deserve a good relationship or I should leave him because there isn’t hope.

I was wondering if I could get any help from anyone. I suffer from anxiety and have gone to my doctors so many times to try and get help. They tried me on propranolol and also recently tried me on setraline for depression. 

I stuck to both and nothing helped if anything they made me worse. I have nothing against people who use medication but I have seen what it has done to my mum being on it for so long and I don’t want to end up like that. 

I’ve tried CBT and that did nothing at all. 

My question is does anyone have any tips at all on how I could help myself. I will have some good days but one thing will happen and then I will have a few bad days and I’m just getting sick of it now.

113,"My mom has been suffering from paranoid delusions for several weeks now and I’m the only one here taking care of her. Needless to say I’m worried to death about her...

I did what no son should ever have to do and put my mom in the hospital where she was eventually sent to psychiatric care. She only spent two days inside the facility and I don’t know whether or not she was medicated while inside but I do know that she’s on no medications nor does she think that she needs to be.

She doesn’t think anything is wrong with her. After being discharged from the facility she even waxed poetic about how “damaged some people are” telling me that one person thought they were a shapeshifter and another think they’re a grape slowly turning into a raisin (not a bad metaphor, honestly) whilst pitying them... and believing that she herself has a microchip implanted into her lip that somehow moves throughout her body at will. Which goes to show me that she bullshit her way through the steps she needed to in order to get out without being medicated or treated for her delusions. 

She’s a smart woman, well put together, cunning, and thoroughly convinced that the world is out to get her. So much so that she wouldn’t let me leave for my mini vacation, crying about how I couldn’t leave and that the proverbial “they” are out to get me. Then after I leave she refused to take mine or anyone else’s calls for several days basically ruining any time I had to get my head right. 

Needless to say; I’m tired of her bullshit and am at a loss for what to do. I don’t want to recommit her but if these paranoid delusions worsen (which they seem to be) she’s going to leave me no choice. And if she’s readmitted there’s no telling how it will go; she could get better, get worse, or stay the same- the latter two are unacceptable to me at this point.

Is there anyone out there with any experience in this area? Any caretakers for their parents out there? I could use some advice... 

Tl;dr - Mom is paranoid and delusional, refuses to seek help or admit that she’s sick, and refuses to take medication. This condition is ruining both our lives and I’m at a loss as to what I can do now. ",09Dec2018,1

121,"I've been depressed for about 6 weeks. I finally went and saw my doctor because I couldn't deal with it anymore. He prescribed wellbutrin to go along with my antiphsychotic and light therapy. I started those things two days ago. I have a horse arriving today as well. Horses are my hobby and my passion and it's exciting thing for me. 

Yesterday was a pretty different day. I went to bed Friday early since I was depressed. Around 6:30 pm. But then I was up by 4. Usually when I'm depressed I can sleep in longer, at least til my normal wake up time of 6. I got tired around noon. I expected to take a 3 hour nap with how tired I was but I only napped for an hour and then I had tons of energy. Like enough to go grocery shopping, do the cooking for the week, organize my shed and other stuff. I stayed up until 8:30 which is good for me and then woke up around 5:30 today. 

Today I've had so much energy. I've taken out the trash, gone shopping, gone to see friends, packed up my car to take things to the barn, cleaned my house and more. 

Idk if my meds and light are working that fast, if I'm just anxious for my horse or what. My mood is all over the place and I don't want to come out of a depression just to go manic right away.

Pretty much the only three thoughts that run through my head are

1. I replay the last sexual encounter I had, and basically wish I could meet up with him again even though that absolutely won’t happen.

2. I think about the fact that I’ve never been in any kind of relationship or felt “wanted.” I realize I’m young, but sometimes it’s just depressing to think about all of my friends in their relationships and nobody has ever expressed a desire to want one with me. 

3. I think about how I wish my roommate wasn’t in a relationship so that I wouldn’t feel alone. Basically I’m jealous and want her to be alone too I guess. 

No matter what I try and do, those three thoughts are the only thing I can think about, even if I’m trying to watch tv or do homework or sleep. I should also mention I don’t have any other friends besides my roommate. I talk to people in my classes, but can’t seem to take those relationships outside of class.

123,"Me (32F) together with boyfriend (36M) for 1 year - feeling like Plan B

About a year ago, boyfriend and I matched on Bumble.  We talked for a week, met for dinner, and started dating shortly after. From the beginning he was laying it on thick - incredibly flirty and way over the top forward (almost too forward) about us getting together, dating, etc.


We've been together a year now and it's been the most fulfilling (least drama filled) relationship I've had. He drives 2 hours to see me every weekend and gets a hotel with no complaints and regularly tells me he can't wait to start a family and build a life together. 


Recently, he applied for a job out closer to me and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we're extra excited about, we've been checking his emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point I googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email he sent to his ex (girl he dated right before me) the day right after we matched on Bumble: I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.


My heart just shattered. I realize I have no right to feel this way considering we weren't exclusive at this point and hadn't even met face to face. But I just can't help kick this feeling of ""If you say you were so absolutely sure of me right from the beginning, how could you reach out to your ex the day after we started talking? I feel like your Plan B, like you're only with me because you couldn't be with her""


For example earlier that same day he sent her that email, he wrote me, ""I want you to know if you end up wanting to be together, I am going to delete these accounts in a heartbeat! Because I want you and only you! There is no need to ever talk to anyone else. I am very old school in the sense that I talk to one woman and never would even begin to talk to someone else while I'm talking to someone."" 


He says he swears on his mother's life had zero intent on winning this girl back, but rather he was so desperate for answers, he sent that message just looking for some closure as to why she would've just up and left him out of nowhere without explanation. I said ""Soooo...why not ask that then instead of telling her you love her?"" He said if he straight up just laid it out and asked, ""What was the reason for ending things?"" she'd threaten she's getting him arrested (background info below). He said if he sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe that would prompt her to reply something that would clue him in on why she ended things.


(Some background info about his previous relationship - they dated 2 months and she was pursuer, wanted him to move in right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week). So he gets a job lined up and starts slowly moving his stuff in. 

The week before he's due to move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over nothing. The day he's due to move in, he gets a call from the cops telling him she has requested he no longer contact her and if he does, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her - I speculate she was on a ""break"" with the past guy, re-made up with him, and wanted to avoid the confrontation of having to explain things/be the bad guy.)


Does anyone have any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice? Am I the backup here?


I should note that yes I have relationship anxiety and have had therapy for it for about 5 years now. 


TL;DR boyfriend messaged his ex the day after matching online with me (before meeting officially). I now feel like Plan B.

It's annoying. I've tried multiple antidepressants .I'm on Klonopin for gad  which my doctor and I agree to taper off of because I've been on it looks enough and docs are cracking down on benzos anyways . I'm supposed to be off by the end of this month. I dropped my dose from 1 mg to .5 a few days ago.i take Ambien for chronic insomnia. That's another thing I've tried multiple otcs , melatonin, sleep hygiene. My sleep issues is chronic and Ambien was a last resort. I've been on it since 2011. I have no idea what else is there to do.

Most days I’d summon the courage to go in. I always go in early. I go in an hour before the receptionists comes in. 15 mins before editorial meetings (EVERY FUCKING DAY!!!), I go into the bathroom stall and hyperventilate. I’d cry! Then walk into the boardroom. Most days I walk out of there without knowing how or remembering what I said. They think I’m respectful and present and attentive. I’m busy fucking calming my anxiety down. Too late. Then I black out or I don’t even know what it is.

I came into the office one day and had to fill in on an on-camera interview with the CEO of a top poker company. Wait, what? In 40 mins? Oh no, fuck that! There’s no one else in the newsroom? I was physically ill, I think. The pro that this CEO was, he carried that fucking interview like a boss. From one former TV executive to a youngin reporter, he saw the fear in me.

He’s finished answering the question and I’m completely lost in thought. Oh now I’ve forgotten the question I even asked him.

I've already been suffering for like years now and it's only gotten worse recently with just a massive collateral of events happening recently, I really just can't find it in myself to do anything I enjoy or even get any help. I'm just realizing more and more how little anyone is on my side. But I feel like I'm selfish for wanting to die because I know there are some people out there going through so much worse than I am right now. Anyone I try to talk to ignores me, even close friends of mine. It's just gotten so much worse after I found out my girlfriend cheated on me, my best friend blocks me and avoids me at all times at University, all my friends outright ignoring me, my family being distant and my great uncle passing all within the past week. On top of all that, exams. I'm just trying to find comfort, but end up just lying in bed all day. I want to die, but I'm scared of it. Like in the style of Queen, it's not that I want to commit suicide, I just wish I was never born in the first place. I guess this is what they call a cry for help. I don't know really, I probably just want attention. Yeah",09Dec2018,1
135,"I am so goddamned fucking tired today. These damn thoughts haven't let up at all today. I've been hammered by them all day long, and they STILL won't let up. It is 6:19 pm. I behaved myself though...for the most part. Urges telling me to do something that I KNOW I shouldn't do (again). I didn't do it. I simply told that part of me ""NO"" and it backed off. For a few minutes. I am sick of being strong. I want someone to just hold me so I can cry on their shoulder. I don't know if the tears would even come though. I am so tired. Feeling hopeless again like I am just a piece of crap because of what I am. I get hate I don't deserve.  


I did see a pretty kick-ass train today, though. That was pretty neat. The rail worker saw me sitting there on the side (far away from the tracks) and complained that it was so cold today. I told him that I am out there every single day, several times a day, so the cold doesn't bother me at all. I actually had a conversation with someone other than my family. Wow. That is rare. I watched the train go by, they hooked up the cars, and then left some cars behind to be picked up at another time. It was loud, but still pretty cool. I love how the ground vibrates when the train is going by on the tracks. I remember THAT from my childhood! Trains. Dodging them. Hopping them and then hopping off a half-mile down the tracks just before we would get caught. Racing them. Watching them. Fuzzy memories, but memories nonetheless!  


Sorry if this is all over the fucking place, but I am feeling low tonight. I didn't get to do much of what I usually do so I am feeling very anxious and tense right now, and there isn't much I can do about it but bitch and complain here. I'm sorry. You guys don't want to hear my stupidity. I just need a kind word.",09Dec2018,1
136,"Last school year, I was in lesson and a teacher asked me if I had trouble concentratingand all that,I ignored him, and left a year worth of assignments to do in a week.
 (I did go to a gp and he gave a website for “help”)
Three months ago, after some research I decided to go to a psychiatrist. He’d done a Qb test and an assessment and prescribed me concerta all in the first appointment. I left with the Qb test, a prescription and a follow up appointment in two weeks. 
In two weeks time I managed to lose my job and stopped attending lessons after finding out Bupa would not cover the appointment and after paying for the private prescription. I didn’t go to the follow up since I have yet to pay for the appointment. 
I then managed to buy a MacBook Pro go on a two week holiday and have a fight with my mum, claiming that my family was trying to sabotage my life and that I had this illness bc of her and that there was nothing she or anyone could do to help. Passed my theory  and, planning to buy a car with what funds? God knows
So we are know one month and a half a go. Depressed AF. Had no job, was getting withdrawn from college and still thinking my family’s purpose was my life to fail. 
Somehow managed through that... and I’m here. I have to submit all my assignments due by tomorrow or I’m withdrawn and I the only GP appointments available are for pharmacists (bc of Christmas)for Wednesday. 


I messed up big time in a 3 months span. 

Will the pharmacists appointments be of any help? 

Will he think I’m just a hypochondriac or an addict?
 
Or will he just freak out and send me to a mental institution?🙃

Make your bets ppl! ",09Dec2018,1
137,"Soo.. the title says it, but my situation of awkward and I’m worried about letting one person ruin going to my favorite coffee shop for me. 
   At an open mic night I was getting ready to perform and I met this guy (Jesus I think he’s old enough to be my dad? Like maybe mid/late forties? I just turned 18, also) who brought his guitar.. he’s huge, he’s over 6’ (I’m 5’4) and very muscular. He has.. a large chin, like the distance from his mouth to his chin just put me off, and his voice is very harsh and nearly rachety. I felt bad about that thought but god I cannot stand him now. I was only okay with it at first because of his musicality. I was a little intimidated by him at first but we ended up talking about music and I could tell he was flirting with me. When I put my forearms down in front of me to lean against the table he pushed his toward mine and I didn’t say anything. I was honestly afraid that if I said something that would set him off that I would be in danger. There were people around where we talked but we were also in a mostly-empty room(no door) where other performers were prepping.
  I was just smiling and laughing, carrying on as I would with a /friend/.. (I dislike how being nice to bad men seems to mean I’m out for dick or something!!) and I just “uh-huh” and nodded because I didn’t want to say “go away” in case something would happen. I genuinely thought he was a cool person, being musical and nothing more. He kept complimenting my playing and I just “ahaha okay thanks” nervously?? I laugh when I’m nervous too.  It felt even more awkward when he mentioned that he’d been divorced recently and takes care of his daughter. (Definitely. Old. Creepy.) I just nodded and tried to not act super interested, I didn’t know how else to respond to a guy that I just met who was telling me about his sensitive.. personal life.
  We were one of the last people to leave with 2-3 other people, and we had parked near each other. He suggested practicing together outside of the cafe to I guess form a group or something and I thought it was cool, so we exchanged numbers . See, I did this to expand my hobby, not to enter any kind of a romantic/sexual relationship with this person. 
  It made me all the more uncomfortable because I have a partner. The guy.. stood outside my car talking to me for nearly 20 minutes. More or less, him talking to me while I sit in my car uncomfortably. We were alone at this point. I kept trying to subtly say “wow it’s late” “look at the time”, and finally managed to drive away and get home.. I was hoping to actually learn from him because he’s awesome at guitar. 

But no. 

  We’d texted about what songs we were working on every few weeks (and I even just stopped taking to him for 3 weeks), and we’d talk about when we’d perform again. He kept saying that I should sing while he plays and I politely declined multiple times (I don’t even sing, so.) 
  One Friday night was open mic, and I was going there early anyway to study with a friend (whom I told about all of this in case something happened), and he’s texted me that he was going. I said, “okay see you there”. 
  Funnily, being in the corner on a laptop towards a wall the whole time made me invisible because he didn’t notice I was there for 5 hours. I went up to talk to him after they were cleaning up, and he was on the phone. I waved to him (and wanted to say that his music was good) and as soon as he saw me his face lit up, he held his arms around and exclaimed my name. I jolted. He hurriedly tried to get off the phone and so we talked about how I was in the corner the whole time, he seemed upset about it a little. He complained( as a joke?) about how busy I am, and I just “y’know, college can’t help that”. 
  It got worse when his half-brother came into the cafe.
The guy introduced me to his half brother, and I hesitantly shook his hand.. Mind you, this was the SECOND time ever that I had met this guy. They were talking about jobs/etc and asked about my major, I replied, and then the guy asked what year in college I was in. I replied “first year”, and his eyes went wide?? He started laughing (his half brother awkwardly) and said “well I guess we’re gonna have to break this off then” and I stood there confused. I said quietly, and unsure “our friendship?” He and his half brother looked each other in the face and started laughing even harder. I didn’t know what I was in. He asked me if I’d stay for the ‘after party next door’ and explained that I had to be home soon because of my curfew (I still live with my parents and they’re protective.)  His body language turned to alarmed(?) and he backed up, laughing nervously and saying “ohoh I don’t want to get in trouble with your parents, don’t tell them about me haha” . And I just laughed.. I eventually was able to leave and went home, and the guy texted me good night. He uses emojis when he texts me.. and I just said “good night, your playing was beautiful” (I was tired), and we ended up talking about thanksgiving plans.. the texts got weird and uncomfortable. If I could post screenshots I would, as of recent (after I sent him curving messages) I deleted his contact and blocked him number, but I was keeping the texts in case anything ever happens..



Now, lately I’ve been seeing him in my dreams. They’re nightmares. Every time a thought of him comes to mind I literally cringe and get uncomfortable and upset.. I think I’m feeling this way because it was the same feeling of danger with my sexual assault (which I’m having a hard time recovering from, recently on medication and starting EMDR). I feel like I literally can’t get him out of my head, and my friend/coworker whom I told this about likes to get my attention and say the guy’s name out loud. Which literally sends me into a panic. My stomach turns and I feel like I’ll die. I don’t understand this, and why else or how to get him out of my head. It’s ruining every time I go to the same coffee shop with my friends (I’m gonna tell the staff to keep him away from me or let me have somewhere safe to go to if he tries shit.) I feel so disgusted just by the thought of him and they way he says my name and what he texted me keeps replaying/coming up in my mind and it’s so hard to focus on my schoolwork AND work, everything else because of it.


I think I might ask my therapist if we can cover this in EMDR. I’m going to tell her about this.

Any thoughts? Similar situations and how to cope? I feel like this is driving me insane.
