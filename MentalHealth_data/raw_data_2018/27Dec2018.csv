Specifically I can’t stop imagining the sound my Dad would make if he woke up beside her body. I’m just curled up in my bed sobbing and I can’t get it out of my head. Please help.

1,"Money is tight. I'm on winter break from college and struggling to find a job until I can start working at my university job again. I have some money I received from Christmas but I keep spending. I can't stop. I mean it. I. Can't. Stop.

I'll be in the store and see something and convince myself I need it. Yet, there's still a voice in my head screaming at me that I can't afford to buy it. I just got home from seeing *Vice* as a Christmas present to myself. It was an okay movie. But I knew the $15 for popcorn and a water was ridiculous and that I had no business shelling out for that crap. Yet, I still bought it. While I was in line, I kept begging myself not to give in. I have no control. It legitimately feels like I'm two people - the thinking person, and the acting person. The thinking guy is always telling me to **fucking stop**. He knows that I'm destroying myself. But I can't fight it. I still go through with buying shit. It's been a problem all year since I started working, and I've gotten better. But I'm at a financial low for the year and this issue is the most detrimental to my life right now than it's ever been, no matter how much progress I've made in controlling myself.

What's wrong with me? Why am I two people in my head? Why can't the ""acting me"" listen to the ""thinking me?"" It sounds pathetic but I truly can't fight it in most cases. I just keep going. I feel helpless.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess some background is that I had to take care of my borderline mother for a long time. Maybe some of it rubbed off on me but I can't diagnose myself. I also had to overcome a drug addiction that I've struggled with for about half my life. I was clean for almost all of 2018 but relapsed at the end of November. Though I've been treating it as a speed bump and I've been clean since that incident. I don't even know if that matters because spending is always a problem. If I have money, I'm going to spend it. How do I stop? I'm ruining myself.",27Dec2018,1
2,"It's like everyone wants to use me somehow or have my attention, walk into my room unannounced, interrupt any and everything I'm doing either to just talk or have me do some kind of task. I'm so f\*\*\*ing sick of it. Even as much as I make it clear I pretty much want nothing to do with anyone, and don't ask for anything, I'm still overridden and just tired. I can't sit in one spot for more than 10 minutes without being summoned or talked at. I go online to play games, I get 10's of invites and people damn near begging me to play with them, I live at home and am actually being WATCHED and have no personal space.  I really do just want to die sometimes ",27Dec2018,1
3,"I am a stereotypical “gifted underachiever” who started out in school doing great and slowly started doing worse once I hit high school and hated the environment I was in. One of the things I used to love doing was reading. I would read so much that I literally always had a book in my hand. I could read very fast as well, which lead to me reading even more books. I mean, I set school records for the amount of books I read. 

While I was never as proportionally as great at math as I was reading, I still excelled at it and was usually way ahead of my class in terms of what I knew, since during one part of elementary school we had a sort of self-taught and self-paced computer program we learned from.

Once I got to about the 8th or 9th grade I became lazy. I felt that the stuff I was doing was pointless and wished I was learning  cool things that I actually cared about. I was still making all As though. At this point, I also started reading way less. I had moved to a school with a hardly functional library (it was never open because there wasn’t actually a librarian), and I didn’t really care that much. 

My second year of high school was my downfall. My math teacher have immense amounts of homework and I hated most of my teachers and I ended up developing my still occurring habit of just not doing anything. The rest of high school was about the same. I managed to pass my classes and have a decent GPA as a result of easy electives. I got into college because I had great SAT and ACT scores. 

Now I just finished my first semester of college. I ended up dropping both 7 hours of classes because I didn’t do the work. Fortunately I pulled out with a 3.0 in the rest of my classes, so I haven’t tanked my gpa yet. My attention span is shit. I try to read, and I simply cannot stay focused on what I’m reading even if I’m interested. I have about fifteen books I’ve started but quit because I can’t pay attention. 

I’m planning to cut back my internet time drastically and try and spend more time reading, but what else can I do to improve my attention span and focus? ",27Dec2018,1
4,"The title pretty much explains what I’m asking. I feel so exhausted and suicidal that I don’t want to have to endure another year. I know I need to tell her this but I won’t unless I have something pushing me to do it. Any advice?

5,"I feel like I'm either heartless or lacking in emotions. I can feel emotions but I just feel like I don't feel it like others. I feel happiness, sadness, anger, etc but most of the time I'm pretty neutral in emotions. I'm also pretty careless when it comes to emotions. When something happens that would spike an emotion in most people I just kind of don't care.   


For instance, my parents just got in a fight and my mom says she's leaving. My sister is freaking out and shaking and I'm just kinda like ""whatever"" and I don't really care; obviously this isn't normal. I just feel like my emotions are suppressed and when I should feel emotions I don't.  


Another example is with dating. I'd like to have a girlfriend but I don't really care enough to make it happen.  


The best description I can come up with is that I don't feel emotions when I feel like I should and if I do feel an emotion it's not as strong as I feel like it should be and it doesn't last as long as it should. My emotions are just very mild in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also probably the best definition of a loaner. I love to be alone and I cannot think of anything better than being alone. Sometimes I'll go out to the airport and watch the airplanes just so I can be alone. I only have a few friends and even then I don't hang out with them much because I'd actually prefer to be alone than to hang out with them. It's not them, it's me.  


I'm not depressed or anything nor do I even consider suicide. I'm actually quite happy and I love my life and the opportunities that are being given to me. I'm totally fine with who I am, I just feel like something isn't quite right. I don't really know what I'm asking, I'm just wondering if it's normal to be like this. ",27Dec2018,1
6,"Hi all,

Recently, a person I went to high school with added me on Facebook. Their posts seem to indicate that they might be experiencing pretty pronounced mental illness (it seems like paranoid schizophrenia, which is something that someone in my family has dealt with for many years). 

Their posts are increasingly bizarre, and indicate some degree of hostility towards certain people (ex. the Rothschilds and financial elites). 

Is there any way I could get them any help?",27Dec2018,1
7,"I've always suffered from an introverted personality that I force myself to break out of paired with a pretty low self esteem, I got into good shape a while ago and that worked out for me for a while, but a year and some change ago I had a serious mental breakdown leading to a massive weight gain and even further to a suicidal point. My sense of self worth broke down and in between attempts and drinking myself stupid I stopped any human communication my longest time without speaking being 2-3 weeks. 
I managed to overcome this through sheer force of will, luck and dropping out of university for a year. I'm back to hanging out with my friends being much more careful with my drinking and such. It's just that at times I feel like I've recovered but sometimes I feel like I'm slipping back into bad habits, not washing for a few days or reaching out to friends, not great behaviour in general. I've felt like I've slipped back into my depression phase in a way but I don't know whether I'm just having a bad week or if I'm just exaggerating in my head whilst I'm trying to force myself to be more social.
If anyone has a similar experience or any advice it would be appreciated, I just want to be the friend that everyone wants to talk to and build my sense of self worth.

9,"I am 19 years old and a biology student at my state’s university. Recently, I have been experiencing depersonalizaton and derealization, and I have done some research which indicates that those correlate with stress and anxiety. However, throughout my last semester I never felt overwhelming stress or anxiety -just the typical amount a student should feel. 
My last final exam (Dec. 2) I felt this overwhelming sensation of shakiness and cloudy state which lead to me feeling like I was about to faint. I had drank a large black coffee before which is something I normally do not do so I chalked it up to the coffee.
The next day, I went home and felt like my heart was going to explode which caused me to freak out, so I went to the hospital and they pumped me of fluids, found nothing wrong with my blood, and I went home that night. 
Since then, I have been going through DP/DR which leads to these little panic attacks.
However today, nearly a month later, I was with my mother figuring out a car situation that involved my car being towed. I felt little-to-no anxiety throughout the endeavor. My mother and I were even joking around about the situation. But near the end of it, it felt like my body was going to shut down. It felt like I was falling into the “sunken place” (referring to the movie Get Out). This again caused another panic attack, because I have no clue what is going on.
I just woke up from a nap after my panic attack, so I apologize if this text is a little all over the place. I am extremely exhausted at the moment and just feel disconnected again.
Some notes to add: I am a vegetarian of 4 years. I have a low heart rate (~56bpm) which could be due to the fact that I exercise 4-5 times a week. I lost 30lbs in about 5 months (from 178-148), since the hospital visit I am back up to 160. My blood pressure was high when I had gone to the hospital, but it did not seem to concern the doctors. My obese grandmother was hypoglycemic (so I was told). I took Anxiocalm a couple times but I feel like it might have made my anxiety worse.

Overall, I just want to know if any of you guys have thoughts of what could be going on with me, and any tips help. I have started eating more to get to a better weight, meditated more, and stay socially and physically actuve. Feel free to ask more clarifying questions if this makes no sense.
Thanks!

12,"Before we can judge ourselves (which ties into self-esteem, extremely important!), we need to know what are the most important values in life. 

To me, the most valuable commodity in life is happiness and nothing else comes close. People try to become rich because they believe they'll be happier, people get plastic surgery because they believe they'll be happier. We can agree that success in life is not measured by how much money you have in the bank or by how you look, it's measured by how good you feel. 


You may be thinking oh shit I'm screwed then, well here's the part where it gets good. Your value as a person is based on how much happiness you can bring to the people around you or to the world in general, you don't need looks or a big bank balance or a big social circle. If you can brighten people's days, you're valuable. If you can tell a joke and make someone laugh, you're valuable. If you can make someone smile, you're valuable. If you can offer advice to someone in a dark place and help them, you're valuable. 
If people bring your mood down, they are literally worthless to you. If you bring people's moods down, you are worthless to them. 


I hope I was valuable.

16,"I use to have undiagnosed anxiety and when I became diagnosed I started dating someone at the time who led me to almost commit suicide and since then mine anxiety has gotten extremely worse  me being constantly worried about constant change (there’s my own personal adverse childhood tragedies) The back story is triggering and isn’t necessarily.

 The last two years of my life I have been focusing on my own mental health and becoming more self-aware and concerned about how I am as a person and opening up. The problem with all this wonderful and great change is that i don’t know how to limit that openness while dating. 

When I’ve attempted to date; I’ve just become so open, where they become extremely uncomfortable. I just want to know how to manage. This New Years is coming up, I feel like that’s what I should focus more on, my mental health.

The unfortunate part is I just want someone who I can just be okay with, to date, to make out with, to have fun with. Just my anxiety from the last few months that I’ve been actually actively trying to date has been horrendous. At this point I don’t know what to do. 

The last year I’ve grown so much from being comfortable with being on my own and enjoying my own company and growing as a person; that’s why I presumed I was wanting and okay with maybe wanting a relationship. Just my anxiety has effected me so much that maybe I’m not meant to have a relationship.

In a normal light,my lives pretty good and I understand that it's pretty good, but I feel ungrateful and I don't understand why.

I was pretty young when I was diagnosed, maybe 13 or 14 ? I can't exactly remember - but I got avoidant personality disorder. Layer on top a sprinkling of drinking dad and subservient mom and you get some trauma too, apparently.

I've been with my partner nearly 9 years, and we are HONESTLY happy - she's always been good to me, taken care of the parts of my personality others struggle with, dealt with the temper snaps and the nigh-on-suicides because I'd just lose interest, I'd like to add she lost her mother to suicide.

But before her, before I was diagnosed - back when my friends just thought I was this wild unstable thing, I had a girl and MAN was it passionate. There was alot of alcohol and cigarettes, and drugs and sex - but there a certain intensity to her ? I haven't seen her since she left me, 8 years ago.

Then I decide to fuck my anxiety, and finally go to a gig my friend was playing, I'd promised him for years I'd go and I always anxiety lied my way out of - but this time I went. And who walks through the fucking door ? Just guess. So I avoid her like the plague, drink away the pressure, and get my train home - then bang into some friends and end up going to a party so I'm more drunk - and I fold.

I tell her I saw her tonight, and fully expected to be ignored because bruh, this was a NASTY break up - but I wasent. and days later I find myself waking up every morning checking for a good morning message - and we chat all day about how shit stuff is, and were rapidly growing close AF.

And now I'm panicking, she was the first ""love"" I had, and now im maybe feeling I love her again ? Or maybe I never stopped - I don't know what to do, she makes me feel so ... Different from my current partner, but in a totally different way - while my current partner panders to me I feel like my ex PUSHES me to be different, and it's strangely alright with me.

With my anxiety I get extremely overwhelmed with my future. First off I am terrible with social  interactions and I need to fix that. Also Ihave times where my mind races super fast and I can't think for a couple seconds or people are asking me questions about my studies and I get overwhelmed with what I can't do.

I have a pretty bad case of depression and have left it alone for far too long. I feel like shit a lot and don't have a ton of great of friends and it makes me feel bad. There was a period about a year ago I was seriously considering suicide, but I getting better than that but still need a lot of work.

Then with my compulsive disorder I compulsively pick at my skin. If I see any imperfection, pimple, or scab I have to pick at it and get it off/out of my skin. It has gotten to a point where I am disgusted with my body from all of my scars.

He began by telling us his brain had exploded (insisting that he physically felt a pop) , and that he now knew the answer to everything and couldn't die, speaking a million miles a minute. He was living on no sleep or food and surviving by ""willpower"". He was going to change the world with his knowledge but at the same time no one could understand his thoughts. 
The following day one of us checked on him but he kept insisting that he had planned to be alone. With obvious worry we had a crisis team along with police do a wellness check. They had him brought to hospital for 3 days and was discharged home.
 Since that time he has been extremely paranoid that the police are watching him. Breaking his cell phone and not using electronics (typically he is a pretty huge gamer). One day he had in plugged everything and sat in the bathtub with all the blinds closed. He doesn't see anything wrong if you try to rationalize his thoughts, he will just responded with either ""right?!?"", Or ""you don't understand"". And will leave social engagements suddenly and abruptly, often times followed by sitting in his car with music on full blast. 
At this point we feel at a loss because he hasn't done anything illegal, has not lead us to believe he will hurt himself or others, but is clearly NOT okay.

Everything about existence seems completely arbitrary and meaningless now. Nothing means anything. Our minds are trying to input meaning into things but it doesn't mean anything. Nothing matters. Is this dp doing this to me? I'm so scared this is the worst thoughts I have had yet. I feel so disillusioned with everything. Nothing about existence makes sense anymore. What should I do? I'm so freaked out. ",27Dec2018,1

33,"I am gonna do my best to describe my life as shortly as possible and with the best english i can muster as its not my native language.  


Early on in my life I was a hyperactive kid and I had an unlimited amount of energy, always playing outside, climbing trees, sports and whatever.. This gave me some troubles in elementary school where I would drive teachers crazy and I wouldnt have the best relation with them because of that, my parents often had bad comebacks from teachers and the principal, I wouldn't say I hated school but I sure as hell didn't enjoy it.

On the summer preceding the first year of high school a few kids and I played spin the bottle  where u have to give the girl a kiss on the mouth if the bottle pointed her im sure you know what im talking about.. anyways when it came to my turn and this girl who was good looking, she made this disgusted face and said eww or something and she just couldnt bring herself to do it, I was really eager but to her it was apparently the end of the world.  
So it was at that time I realized I was an ugly little kid, not fat or too small or anything but I then knew girls didnt like my features.  
So eventually summer reached its end and it was time to go to highschool. I was 1 full year younger then everyone else at that time due to my elementary school having selected me and 2 other students to skip a full year probably due to different reasons.  
Anyways I came in highschool with an already destroyed self esteem, I imagined all the girls doing this disgusted face and that they were thinking ""eww"" when they saw me, I had absolutely no confidence and probably fell into a mild depression by the first year of high school, the girls and other boys seemed way more confident then me, the girls already looked like dammn sexy almost womanly some of them, while i was still an ugly boy who was starting to grow like a twig, I didnt look muscular even tho I was probably one of the strongest in high school due to my hyperactivity and dad genes lol. I was often sad when i looked in the mirror I didn't like my long twiggy arms and I felt like my legs were too tall for the rest of my body, I had a deviated sepsum (crooked nose) and pretty bad teeth.  


So the first few years of highschool went by eventually and then when I was about 14 or 15 my friend offered me to try marijuana, it started like, every month or maybe even more we would smoke together and do silly stuff like walk on skating rink or stuff and everything felt crazy wild lol.  
Eventually it started creeping up on me, by my senior highschool year I was already smoking weed every day during lunch hour on top of taking my prescribed ritalin or something, needeless to say I was pretty fucking high when i went back to class on the afternoon.  


It was probably already at the point where i was self medicating to forget my personal issues without really realizing it, all  I knew is that it made school bearable and it made me feel good inside, I would spend my afternoons thinking about videogames or stuff like that, not paying attention at all. Had to have at least 1 summer class every year because of my fucking up all year..also I would be kicked out of class on a regular basis in all my years of high school, I was sorta the rebel / clown / comedian sometimes and teachers had no patience for me lol.  


Anwyays so when I was finally done with highschool I was so damn tired of the education system I pretty much started working shitty jobs because I wanted money to get high and go do fun stuff with my buddies (I had only guy friends)

I didn't want to consider going back to school anytime soon but eventually i went back a few times in different areas but never got a diploma because of inconsistency and my addiction problems and my impulsive and excessive personality, my hyperactivity made it hard for me to sit down and study as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 28 and I have absoultely no confidence when it comes to woman, if im not attracted to her its ok i guess but even then I tend to think they are not humans and they dont feel the same emotions and they cant really relate to me, they have differnt hobbies and interests and ways of thinking,Ever since HS Ive always felt like they were the superior sex and intimidating and this society is becoming more and more matriarchal, theyve always acted like they dont need men and men have always acted like thirsty animals around them so it leaves me to think that they hold the bigger part of the pie if u see what i mean. Thats basically what being at the mercy of someone means... a girl is showered with affirmation and confirmation while boys have to work their asses for it and they have to actually work on themselves, aka not handed everything on a god damn silver platter. A good looking girl cant walk to the bus station without being offered sex while men are stuck on tinder with their auto swiping programs in the hopes of matching with that 1 in a milllion woman who will swipe him back, and forget anything in real life lol no girl is going to approach you and good fucking luck dealing with all the rejections when youre self esteem is already crushed beyond belief..

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways at 28 im already a bitter old fuck, I smoke up to 14 grams of weed a day. Seeing a young couple or even sometimes just a pretty woman always triggers negative feelings inside me, it can range from sadness to jealousy to burning rage. I dont go out with people anymore because it just triggers me too much also guys in couples think theyre fucking better then me or at least I think they do I just feel like smashing their teeth in. Ive developped a silent anger towards woman especially the good looking ones. The prettier they are the bigger the bitches and the uglier the personality.  


I can't even proprely work or keep a job anymore because of my addiction and the way I feel around people.  
I blew almost 30k$ on cannabis products this last year, my brother died last september due to an overdose and I did stop smoking when he passed but I started about a month later and my consumption went over the roof..  


I have absolutely no hope in detox centers and Im not doing the facking 12 step program because I dont believe in god and it just feels like its never gonna end, I already went in detox twice for a month and a half each time and It didn't do jack other then I got in good shape because I had to work out alot to avoid going crazy.  


Also I dont believe in psychologists I think they can work on some people but not me, I'm way too fackin stubborn and I dont have much intellectual flexibility.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see myself ever having a cookie cutter life, I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a girlfriend who I find good looking, I'm sad that I don't see myself  bringing grand childrens to my parents anytime soon and theyre already over 60... I'm often depressed that my parents have nothing to be proud of me for.. I hate that they know how much fucking dope i smoke and how fucked up I am socially...

TLDR: I'm fucked.

36,"This is a general PSA to parents, and my story. I was born the youngest of 4, my older siblings all have the same dad, while my father stole from and left my mom. Growing up i had 2 step-dads, the first one i was so young i blocked him out of my memory. The second one and my moms current husband came into my life when i was 7, he is retired from the navy and he was really hard on me and essentially tried to teach me to be ""tough"" by treating me how they did in the navy. I grew up being told that i was stupid, lazy and a disappointment. When i was 11 i made a very stupid choice and spray painted on the side of a building and got caught, this was about 3 weeks before my family was supposed to go to disney. I had dream of going to Disney my entire life, and my parents told me i couldnt go, but they still were. I was so devastated and crushed, i made plans to commit suicide while they were gone. I was allowed to go, but at the age of 11 no kid should have a suicide plan. Fast forward to high school, i started getting into drugs because it was the only thing that made me happy. By sophomore year i was a full blown opiod addict, i made the decision to get clean and ask for psychiatric help. My parents told me that i was faking depression and anxiety for attention, it took months of constant badgering and a complete mental breakdown including me hitting my head off a wall to get them to believe me. I saw a therapist and was put on zoloft by my pediatrician. Zoloft didnt work and i had to wait for an appointment with a psychiatrist, i had to wait almost 3 months for an opening. In these 3 months i started hearing and seeing things that werent there. I got to my appointment and i was diagnosed with  Psychotic Depression, and Social phobia. I was put on celexa and sent home, i went in for the follow up and told him it wasnt working, i was still having panic attacks and i also mentioned i couldnt focus for anything in the world in school. He said he was upping the dose of celexa and then putting me on adderall 2 weeks later, i told him im starting the adderall first because i need to function in school. Best decision of my life, adderall gave me my life back, i could finally see good in life, getting out of bed wasnt such a hastle, i could actually laugh. Things slowly started to click after the adderall, all of my problems stem from my parents and adhd. The first traumatic incident i can remember, is when i started getting low grades in 5th grade, and my step dad sat me down every day and screamed about how stupid i was. My parents would always yell about my grades and say that i didnt put in effort, and i would always tell them i was trying my hardest but that just made them angry, but it made me feel empty inside. Now my mom apologizes for everything and not having me tested sooner. Please if you are a parent, get your child tested if something changes. If your kid asks for help, get them help. And PLEASE never insult your kids.",27Dec2018,1
37,"About a year and a half ago I started getting sick on the job as a consultant. After talking with some experts I learned I developed a burnout. Now this is not the overworked type of burnout, in fact quite the opposite. My therapist called it a bored-out. I wasn't being challenged, was forced to do things inefficiently and lie to clients about results. 

In March I lost my job (my contract ended exactly on my birthday). I traveled to South American for a 3 month solo trip. In hindsight maybe not the best move while recovering from a burnout, but amazing nonetheless. It was the hardest thing I ever did and when I came back my tank was completely on empty. 

I have suffered from a Dysthemic Disorder (Chronic depression) for as long as I can remember as well. And slowly my burnout developed into a depressive episode. 

Nowadays I'm unemployed, on welfare and barely leave the house anymore. I don't really like my friends and I hate my relatives. I have nausea or migraines almost every day. I'm on anti depressants but I don't think they work at all. I've been on the waiting list for group therapy for about 3 months now and I feel stuck.

tw - parents, bullying, self harm, suicidal thoughts, disassociation 

  
I call myself Crystill, and I'm a 22 year old female living in a small, southern town. I was raised in an extremely christian household, and my whole family was Pentecostal. They had very strict views, such as the women wearing only skirts, not cutting their hair or wearing makeup/jewelry. We went to church almost every night, and the church families were... interesting, to say the least. To give some insight, the pastor's wife ""talked to god through her t.v."" and often told the church that someone in the church would die nearly every night. My mother was torn to bits by this, as she suffered greatly from anxiety. My dad worked almost all the time and my two older brothers were often off with friends, leaving me and my mom home together. I watched her destroy herself from the inside out, all while refusing to believe that anything remotely wrong was going on inside her head. She'd throw herself against the wall, wailing about whatever worried her that day, or sit on the couch for hours in an eerie silence, her eyes void of any life. I would worry quite a bit about her when she got into moods like that, and would watch silently from the doorway, watching her finger move ever so slightly as she traced objects obsessively. My father, a strong willed man of very old world values and ideas, would offer her little help.   


This anxiety created a good bit of anger in my mother, so much that she couldn't handle it. Every little thing would set her off into a fury, from my brothers getting failing grades or my father's seemingly blatant disregard for her well being, to simple things like a sock being in the floor. Seeing how I was home with her nearly all the time aside from school and church, the majority of her anger was deflected onto me. I learned very quickly to defend myself from her onslaught of yells and curses and the two of us would often have to walk away in order to avoid it going physical. Of course the fact that I was her only daughter and wasn't the preppy girly girl she wanted didn't help. I was reminded quite a bit of how much of a disappointment I was, though usually in passive remarks about my hair, style choices, weight, and looks.   


School was hell for me. Due to being raised in a judgmental household who all but worshiped a judgmental church, I was pretty opinionated. I was ""that kid"" in school - Ya know, the one who carried a bible and couldn't do the line dances we were for some reason forced to do due to religious reasons. I wasn't rude with it, just very much so the ""good girl"". I'm not sure if it's because of this that I was so relentlessly bullied, or perhaps something trivial like my lack of nice clothes or looks. Either way, there wasn't a day that went by without me coming up with some sort of fabricated physical ailment in attempts to be excused from school. My mom even started keeping a journal of every complaint I made, from every upset stomach to every headache I so desperately complained of. Looking back, any parent should have been able to pick up on the fact that I was being bullied, but I was the quiet kid in the family. Besides the arguments with my mother, I was the good one. I went to school, came home, did homework, and excused myself to my room to waste the day reading or watching movies. They had their hands full of my teenage brothers, who were the stereotypical ""sk8 or die"" kids. Middle school offered no relief in the bullying department, despite my transition from wearing only skirts and blouses to jeans and t-shirts. I wasn't as religious and fought hard to fit in with any group I could. I was often the comic relief friend, and was framed on multiple occasions, stolen from, set up for public embarrassment, and ridiculed by so called 'friends' who only kept me around for laughs. There was an instance where I had a crush on the most popular kid in school, and one of my 'friends' found out (though the whole school already knew). She promised to ask him out for me, on the day I was out sick. I called her later, excitedly asking what he had said. She told me, with little hesitation, that he merely laughed. In fact, the whole class had a good laugh. For months my 'friends' would bring it up in class, reminding everyone. Everyone would laugh, and I was forced to laugh along with them in fear of being ostracized even more. After all, it *was* hilarious that someone like me dared to think that someone like him may consider even giving me the time of day.  High school wasn't as bad, as I had managed to fade from everyone's mind. I had people I would talk to in class, but overall I was an extremely lonely child. I never went to anyone's house, aside from family arranged play dates. I never had birthday parties with kids other than cousins who bullied me just as much as school kids, and never went to anyone else's parties. I spent my days reading, writing, and playing the same 3 video games religiously.   


I was in the fourth grade when I first discovered the beauty of self harm. I had a nasty habit of biting my nails and skin around my fingers, playing with the severed nail in my mouth for a bit before spitting it out. One day I was sitting in the floor in front of my bed, doing a puzzle while chewing on a nail I had bitten off earlier. While twirling it about and playing with it, it turned sideways and jabbed into my gum between my molars. It shocked me, and I saw a flash of white light before my eyes, a squeal in my ears it seemed like. My gum stung and itched but it felt... *amazing.* Hesitantly, I gripped the nail with my fingers and shoved it through my gums. With enough pushing and jiggling, it slipped through the pink meat and I felt it push through to the other side. I prodded it with my tongue, feeling the sharp heat waves radiate with each movement. It felt so amazing, and the blood that beaded out onto my tongue tasted sweet. For the next few weeks I played around with it, seeing how much pain I could produce, finding the best ways to push the nail through and the sweet spots in the spaces between my teeth. It didn't take me long to switch to shoving pieces of lead from mechanical pencils through my gums. My favorite thing was when chunks of my gums would hang off and I could play with it with my tongue before finally grabbing it with tweezers or my fingers and pulling it off. Soon, I could fit safety pins through the spaces between most of my teeth with ease, with no more tearing or ripping of my gums. To this day, mouth pain is my favorite. My fingers are hideous due to me chewing off nails to shove through, and I chew on anything sharp I can to shove through. There are 3 spots on my lips that I alternate between picking and biting as to avoid visible sores. I eventually got lip piercings and use the backing of the piercings to dig into my gums and lips. My tongue has permanent bumps on both sides from me biting it.    
About 2 years ago, I found how amazing sharp pain on my fingers felt. I pick at the first knuckles on my pinkie and pointer fingers, to the point where all 4 have calluses. I pick at the callus then press my finger down, bending it to irritate the skin. I recently cut the areas to pick at the wounds on my pointer fingers, something I promised myself I'd never do. I have cut in the past and have scars up my arms and thighs, but nothing compares to the pleasure I get from harming my fingers and lips. Plus, no one can see that unless they look closely or see me doing it. I don't harm myself when I'm only sad. I do it all the time, when I'm happy, mad, empty- anything. I don't even realize I'm doing it most of the time. Few people know how bad it is, but there are things I don't tell anyone. I fantasize about cutting my wrists. I fear death, despite craving it, but the thought of slicing the tender skin on my wrist makes my mouth water. When I'm particularly dramatic and bored, I lay in bed and scratch my wrists to hurt, then lay back and listen to the song I'd like to be found to, sprawled out, blood pouring from the open wounds on my wrists. I can only imagine how beautiful that pain must feel.   


My self harm aside, there are things in my mind that are difficult to explain. I dissociate nearly all the time. It's rare that I feel here, like I'm not in a dream and where reality makes sense. I often walk around with auto pilot on, feeling as if someone else is controlling my body. The emotions I feel are on the surface, rarely leaking into the depths of my mind. It's a comfortable numb that I fear losing. There are times when I'm slammed back to reality, so to speak. When suddenly I realize that this *is real* and I'm real, and that what's happening to me isn't a dream. This happens at random times, with little warning and no provoking. I've learned to recognize the signs that happen mere seconds before I'm slammed back, and have learned to use this to better prepare myself for the panic that's sure to come. Colors, for example, look odd. I view life as if it's a t.v. show. I stereotype everyone according to what sort of character they'd be on a reality or sitcom show. When I realize life isn't a show, colors seem odd, surreal almost. They seem too dull or too bright and vibrant, like I wasn't aware of them beforehand. I have violent panic attacks that I struggle to pull myself out of when I come back so harshly like this. Sometimes coming back is nice, as I'm able to enjoy the moment. Often these enjoyable moments are when I'm with my girlfriend, and we're doing something that I would have laid in bed and daydreamed about years ago, like cuddling and watching a movie or going out and doing something I could never see myself doing, like going to a concert or event. These moments are ones that usually seem fake to me, because they're basically too good to be true. But when I realize they are true, they're beautiful and breath taking. Being lonely for so long has taught me to appreciate little things like going to the store with her. I guess there's a silver lining to everything, hm?   


There's another way that I'm slammed back to reality, and this one can go good or bad as well. My brain is very obsessive, and a thousand thoughts are flitting through my mind at a million miles a minute. My brain hooks onto one, like catching a fish, and reels it in. These thoughts are often ones that hurt me, such as hurtful things from my past or thoughts of abandonment or worries of not being good enough. Sometimes, though, they're simply realizing what's going on around me, and putting that scenario into something you'd read out of a book or see in a movie. For example, I had a friend come over who I hadn't talked to since high school. The moment was very awkward, and my brain kept making it out to be like a bad episode from a sitcom surrounding high school kids.   Everything he did seemed like something poorly written for a show like that, and I panicked because I couldn't tell if I *actually was* in a show like that and just didn't realize it. If a thought or moment can't hurt me, though, my brain just moves onto the next one, trying to find one that will eventually spiral me into a depression or panic.   


The logical side of my brain knew that wasn't true, but that's my problem. I'm often at battle with the logical and emotional sides of my brain. The emotional side is screaming, crying that I'm not good enough and everyone hates me, that everything is just a plot to hurt me and that I don't even exist. The logical side, though, KNOWS that's not true. It knows that I AM here, and that there are people who love me and I shouldn't treat myself like this. I'm not in a t.v. show, I'm not worthless, and I should love myself. Existence isn't all bad, but what do you do when the loudest part of your mind is wailing that it is? I'm also an angry person, for no reason. I'll just get furious out of no where, and while my brain is telling me that there's no reason to be so mad, I just am. I break things, threaten to hurt myself and others, and cause scenes that only make me hate myself later. And for what?   


My mom found out I was cutting when I was in the 6th grade. She refused to take my mental health serious for years, ignoring any times I'd tell her I wanted to kill myself, and even ignored it when I was diagnosed, as well as her diagnose of anxiety with OCD thoughts. When I went to therapy that one time, I kept telling my therapist that I was fine, that I shouldn't even be there. I believe I'm faking all of this, that my inappropriate anger and violent thoughts towards myself and others is all a fabrication of my own mind, and I'm desperately searching attention.  Am I? I can't tell.  
Sometimes, though, things aren't so gray. If something seems like its from a movie or I obsessively hook onto a thought or something I did, I don't *hate* it. Sometimes, rarely, my mind doesn't make everything so bad. Though here lately, it's been so bad that hurting myself doesn't even bring me pleasure. The cuts I did on my fingers have healed due to me not picking at them. What do you do when hurting yourself doesn't bring you the pleasure it once did?

I hate the way I look, I weigh 125 pounds and I’m about 5’6. I feel super fat and ugly all the time. So over the last 2 years I have struggled with this and a need to be skinny. I have gone on countless diets and other things but about a year and a half ago I slowly started to stop eating in a day. So apparently someone my age and height needs over 1000 calories a day but I just can’t bring my self to eat that so I started skipping breakfast and then lunch. Until it got to a point where I was counting every single calorie I ate in a day.  My daily limit was 150 calories. I really hated the way I looked. I had work out plans and everything but I was pushing everyone away from me. So I relized I had a problem and that I was starving myself so I worked really hard to build back up my support system and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. I finally got to a point where I was eating three meals a day really healthy. But now I feel like my mental health is taking a turn for the worst again and I have noticed I have stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I don’t think I can get better again and everything just looks so dark and doomed. I just don’t know what to do. 

Tl;dr: I have a history with disordered eating and I worked really hard and I thought I had gotten better but lately I have noticed my mental health going down hill and I have stopped eating most meals and I’m just not sure what to do at this point. ",27Dec2018,1
51,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I don't know who will read this but it feel kinda good to open up and express to people what my emotions, thoughts and feelings are at this very moment. To start, my longtime GF of 7 years suffers from severe anxiety and depression. This is remnant from her past before me and with the person she had been before me. In the first third of our relationship it seem like everything was working out good, she had confided to me what she suffered from and I got to see and understand it, to a certain extent. She was going to therapy and was taking medication for her depression and another one for her anxiety. Mid-way through our relationship, she was having her ups and downs and we went out, enjoyed time together, traveled a bit and I would try my best to always be by her side when she needed me. We don't live together, thus I would try to stay on the phone or keep texting her when she was experiencing harder nights. At this point, I had seen her at her very bottom and I kept being by her side and I always reminded her that I loved her for who she is and I'll support her no matter what. Fast forward a few years of ups and downs and still supporting her, loving her and trying to understand her as much as possible, I am now facing a situation where I feel as though I am at an ultimatum. 

To give a bit of context, she always told me that she had a very difficult time fully trusting people. She trusts me and her family the most but yet still felt as though she couldn't trust us %100. Now, through the years, she made good progress and is now only on one medication and out of therapy. She does do very well and I see her cope with her depression and anxiety really well. 

Now, I have always wanted her to trust me %100 and I am still fighting for it, but today she told me to chose between my work or her. I am a university student and after this upcoming semester I am applying for an internship in an engineering firm. I work at a lounge where there is interaction with a vast amount of different clientele that ranges from douches to very nice people. I've shared my encounters and my working experiences with her so she could understand me and my work as well. But I learned today that she feels as though my workplace has changed me since I started a few years ago and she concludes that my workplace is a big part of what makes her feel insecure, sick, anxious, and that she cannot fully trust me because of it. I've been faithful to her since day one, and always told her what she wanted to hear, but today she is asking me to leave the place that allows me to pay for my tuition and expenses, to help her and feel better. 

I live with my parents, which are not in the greatest of places financially, thus me having to pay for my own things. I could always go find another job of course, but I would have to go through the process if being trained for the position, whilst also having to study during the semester and trying to focus on both things at the same time. Yes I could get a student loan but I really detest the thought of having debts to pay after and I am also scared that I will not make it through the semester with paying my expenses without an income (She mentioned me all these options)... This makes me feel guilty and makes me feel like I'm not supporting her enough. She is begging me to leave but I have experienced this before with her at another workplace and I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I can't make the right decision without hurting her or not giving myself self-worth. I've asked her to compromise a bit and give me this semester until my internship but she says she can not handle it anymore and she had a panic attack whilst we were ""arguing"" about it....

She is a very caring person and genuinely cares and supports my decisions but right now I feel stuck and selfish for not agreeing to quit my job now... 

I just need some comforting, or thoughts... Am I doing wrong for asking her to compromise? Should I go for the student loan even if I can pay everything with my current job? Or should I find another job and start from scratch at that place whilst studying?...  ",27Dec2018,1

55,"Visiting my parents over the holidays has been incredibly challenging for me. My parents dont approve of some of the choices I've been making, and they dont feel ready for me to be living on my own and exercising independence from them. I know that sounds really angsty, but I've been living on my own for almost 3 years now because my parents were living in Bolivia, and as I couldn't continue to do school there I needed to move out. 
I have dealt with so much emotional trauma because of this decision. I didnt feel like my parents were able to be a support to me as they had so much of their own shit to deal with, so I was stuck making decisions for myself. And not just small decisions; which universities I wanted to get into, where I was going to live for my gap year, who I was going to live with, how I was going to make money. 
In that time I also found a boyfriend. He is absolutely amazing. He makes me feel safe, he is respectful of my struggles and loves me despite my anger and anxiety, he is so perfect. BUT I've had this feeling that my parents dont approve of our relationship (even tho they say they do) and it makes me feel endlessly upset. The worst part is a part of me still wants their approval and when times get really hard I find myself doubting our relationship. It just feels like theres this ""force"" trying to keep us apart, and I think it is very closely tied to my struggles with my family. 
 I'm really just trying to do what I think is right for myself after years of not having their guidance, and I hate that I still look for their approval for this. Im not trying to be defiant or rebellious towards them. The years following my moving out of my parents house have without a doubt been the most difficult years of my life. Persistent anxiety and depression, and just so much added responsibility have been almost too much to bear at times. I honestly dont think I would have survived the past year if my boyfriend hadn't been a part of it. He gives me hope for the future, and he is truly the light of my life. I just wish my parents could see that, and I'm wondering how much longer I can keep up this balancing act before I break. ",27Dec2018,1

I've seen a lot of doctors. Psychiatrists. Psychologists. Counselors. NPs. I've received a lot of diagnoses. I've had some doctors discredit other doctors' opinions.

59,"So firstly, I just want to clarify that I'm not substituting Redditors opinions for going to a therapist - I'll be setting up an appointment soon.

For context - my mum is bipolar, today I remembered how when I was 12, she would get depressed and go to the terrace for a walk at which point my dad would try to get me or my brother to follow her and make sure she doesn't suicide. This memory came as a surprise and idk what to about that. Also my dad is OCD, Islamophobic and misogynistic

Coming back to me, I feel like I'm constantly exhausted. I sleep roughly 9 hours a day and still wake up feeling incredibly tired. Plus I started meditating recently and I noticed that my muscles are always so tense and it's impossible to loosen up. 

People are constantly asking me why I look so tired and I fall ill so often its a problem. 

My legs are super restless its almost impossible for me to sit still at times. In fact being restless is something that is quite typical of me - I get reprimanded for talking too much during my classes and I find it hard to follow through on rules. 

I also find it quite hard to structure my thoughts out and sometimes my mind feels so cluttered its hard to fall asleep.

If I'm not working, out with friends, drunk, working out or high I find myself feeling quite miserable and I don't quite get it? Because on paper I have it all - I get all the best internships, I get the guys, I have plenty of friends who care about me and I've managed to stay quite fit for the last couple of years.

None of these things have affected the quality of my work or friendships. But when it comes to committing to someone I find myself constantly worrying and then growing avoidant.

75,"Title may be dramatic, I'm not suicidal and never have been snd I don't really know why because it would be a lot simpler. I've chosen to hide my feelings most of my life until a mental breakdown 4 years ago leading to therapy.

I've battle social anxiety, depression most of my life. Always reluctant inside to do things with friends like holidays. I haven't looked forward to an event ever, I just chronically worry and torture myself with what could go wrong even stupid things like worrying about the location of toilets. It forced me to shut everything out and become a recluse who played video games and substance abuse most of my life. I had recluse friends who were in similar situations (hated the world and eventually stopped going out etc) 

I was a touchless virgin until 29, I had gone through therapy to deal with my problems and was at a stage I wanted to push out and experience things and not see myself as a disgusting mess that was a stain on society. I met a girl talking on mental health websites with similar problems and we ended up meeting and hooking up. This lasted for a year right up to now. We text and meet every month or so and fuck each other mindless. We are in a friends with benefits agreement, she doesn't want a relationship and honestly I don't think I do either but we've grown dependent on each other and are both struggling to end it.

We discussed ending it. She told me a relationship isn't possible because we're mostly physical and she does trust that I'm not just using her for sex unknowingly out of my lack of experience and partners, and she could be right.

I recently finally moved out of my parents, and my friends with benefits and I have planned to spend a couple of days together (usually we only spend a night together and it's mostly physical) great, right? Not for my stupid head. It's non stop worrying and panic attacks. Thoughts I'll stuff it up, I've never been a host, we'll just be sat in awkward silence. And the anxiety brings indecisiveness. Is this what I want, am I better off alone than being a burden, what minute I can't wait to see her the next I'm dreading it and feel I want to just be alone with my PC and drugs and booze. And it's not just indecisive on that, it's things like should I get out of bed or just lie in it safe from my problems, should I go shopping to get food or live off takeaway. Should I try and get my house tidy and ready for my guest or should I just end it with her to keep things simple. And the days fly by while I accomplish fuck all but procrastination. 

I just feel fucked. I need a new job but the act of getting one just makes me panic and worry that I just push it to the side. Am I happy at work? Maybe, maybe not. Meeting new people? Fuck that I'd rather live in misery alone than go through that. But why?

And if the mental strain weren't enough, I'm constantly tired and my libido will be in tatters. And she'll want sex. I want sex but I can't relax and just enjoy myself anymore. I constantly lose my errection because of this shit going on in my head, second guessing everything. 

I don't expect anyone can help me, I should go back to therapy but it's expensive and awkward to arrange with minimal free time around work.

I feel fucked, lost, incapable of the basics of human interaction. I try to explain to my friends and family but they just say the usual ""stop panicking"" ""don't think about it that way"" ""just relax and stop caring"" but it's NOT THAT FUCKING EASY. Ffs.

I honestly think my condition is pushing me towards being asexual, that the pleasure from sex and human interaction isn't worth the misery I put myself through.

82,"I posted this in another subreddit and didn’t get much feedback on the matter. i’ve been dealing with this for many years and i’m afraid its going to get worse but im also to the point of being comfortable with it and i’m afraid thats dangerous too. help. 


since i was younger, i always felt i wouldnt see the day of my high school graduation, have kids or get married. i always felt like i was going to die at a young age, maybe 20-40s.  i still didnt get to see the day of my graduation, as things happened and i didn’t graduate on time. i’m trying to use that scenario for the other “milestones” throughout my life. like maybe when the time is right, i wont be able to have kids or maybe the marriage thing wont work out. but I can’t help but feeling like its because i am going to die. 

i know it’s incredibly fucked up but its taking over my daily life. I am in my 20s without a drivers license (dont even have my permit) because i am terrified that i will die in a car accident. I also try to associate that with the fact that my mother was in a awful car accident when i was in 8th grade and i was supposed to go with her, but i decided to stay home. she almost died. 

I go into public places, and i immediately look for exits or hiding spots in case of something going tragically wrong. 

i know its most likely anxiety but im also too afraid of trying to relax because what if something were to happen and i wasn’t prepared? i used to be free-thinking, striving for new things but for the past year and a half i have been trapped in my own head and I dont know what to do. 

has anyone else experienced this or something similar? if so, what has helped? ",27Dec2018,1
83,"My grandmother is about to turn 84, but she'll swear it is 83. She was  sick during her birthday 2-3 years ago and ""lost"" a year. For most or  possibly all of her life, she has been unable to do simple tasks  properly. I mean stuff like washing a dish/cup/utensil properly (she'll  leave food stuck on them, have them greasy, etc., and insist that it is  clean) to things like opening any type of package properly. A pack of  lunchmeat, pack of cookies, etc. I don't think she has been unable to do  that properly in her entire life. She'll bring a package with ""Open  Here"" printed on it and say, ""I don't know how to open this."" Her  literal life seems to have been not trying at all and not following  directions for anything. She just doesn't want to be accountable for  anything in life. That seems to be the jist of it all. She'd break laws,  do things she wasn't supposed to do, trespass on other people's  property (but get offended if they came anywhere near the property she  was living at) and has been a complete disaster for all of her life.

She has a lot of odd stories/events from her younger years, all the way  back to her childhood. They don't make sense. Sometimes it seems like  she is making it up as she goes. As an adult, she somehow barely raised  two sons and a daughter. However, she also moved them from apartment to  apartment frequently, skipping out on the rent because she said she  ""couldn't afford to pay the rent"" and would go from place to place doing  that. Never owned her own home. My mother/her daughter has told me of  the horror stories of changing schools every year as a kid. My  grandmother was not stable, didn't keep jobs for long and now gets the  bare minimum social security. She blames everyone else for it. My  grandmother has a lot of odd stories from her younger years and  childhood that do not make sense. She associates things wildly that are  of no relation. She thinks everything is connected. I understand this to  be a symptom of schizophrenia. Her assumptions of others are just wild  and random. She hurls racial slurs at the TV, talks about the reporter's  hair/teeth/whatever. Most of her life she seems to have bashed on other  people who were doing and accomplishing something, while she was doing  nothing. She spited her own self for everything in life. She does the  same thing with family. Her own son...she can't stand for him to have  friends and hates on his friends, calling them ""an old drunk"" and  whatever she can come up with. She calls people prostitutes randomly,  says they're gay and all of that. She has the former president (Obama)  being a ""street bum who used to sleep over there on x street"" and that  he just stood up and declared himself president one day. Her knowledge  of how the world works, how political and scientific processes work and  all of that are...gone.

She has no  emotions. Every picture that I have seen of her, she has these wild eyes  like a deer in headlights and just stares into space. She has no pity,  remorse, sadness, happiness, etc. She's just ""existing"" and that's about  it. Her day consists of running from window to window every few minutes  peeping out at the neighbors to see when they come and go. She also has  hallucinations. She thinks a neighbor who lived down the street decades  ago (she claims to have called the police on him) set up  speakers/microphones throughout the neighborhood to bother her.  Hallucinations include things said against her and family, sexual  things, grinding noises, screams, ""death tapes"" of people dying in  various ways and such. So she's tormented all day and night by the guy  ""talking"" and playing sounds and such. She obviously has severe mental  issues, but is physically ""there"" enough to basically refuse any  treatment.

Her anxiety is through the  roof. I have never in my life seen someone with that much anxiety to the  point where she can't even be still for long or can't sit still and  stands a few feet in front of the TV. Anyone who says something to her  in response to her violating laws, doing something she shouldn't be with  neighbors, etc...they're automatically ""arguing"" with her and she'll  start the, ""I don't want to argue! You always want to argue!"" and try to  turn the tables against you as if you're the problem. She's like a  little child in a lot of ways and goes around making childish noises  sometimes.",27Dec2018,1
84,"I thought the post-psychosis depression would never go away. For about a year I lied in bed, tethered to it, like I had no choice. I didn't talk to anyone. I slept and slept and ate and ate and slept and ate some more. I developed prediabetes and pain so bad I had to get physical therapy.

Now I am going to the gym everyday, waking up with a fresh perspective and finally losing weight again, potentially reversing the prediabetes. 

Some folks in my life including my therapist and psychiatrist get a little worried when I do better because it could be a symptom of an oncoming psychosis. Recovery is a double-edged sword for me. It can mean good things; it can lead to bad things if I'm not careful about sleep, my meds or self care. 

I have made many friends aware of my situation, and many friends tell me I've been glowing lately. That I should be allowed to enjoy my recovery. 

Yes, there have been psychotic symptoms; mostly magical thinking to do with my spiritual beliefs, but I am taking my meds, even sometimes the antipsychotics just to feel more grounded. 

My dad passed a little over five months ago. I don't know how to explain without sounding like an asshole; I feel so relieved. He was suffering and suicidal. He had a heart attack on his way to  meet with a lawyer to fight for his right to see his autistic son, my brother, who's in the care of the state. He died fighting for something he loved. I think he died nobly. I feel he is finally free of his earthly burdens. In my spiritual beliefs I often think of having a connection to those passed on. I feel him every so often and it's like reassurance that he's okay. That I'm doing well and he's proud of me. He would want me to be healthy. 

So in the face of his death, and the grief that comes with it, I've managed to crawl out of the hole of the depression I had before. The anxiety is kicking in full force but I feel so much more better than I have in a while.

Let me be happy, please. 

I hope others can relate. ",27Dec2018,1
85,"My sleep schedule was pretty reversed until recently...I would stay up all night and sleep during the day. The last few days, with a concerted effort, I've been able to readjust to where I'm sleeping all night and getting up at a reasonable hour. Last night, however, I had trouble falling asleep so I got less sleep than I'm used to (normal for me is around 9 hours, I got 5.5-6 hours last night). I got up at my normal time, but now that it's midday and I'm done with the things I needed to do, I feel exhausted. I've always tried to be careful with naps because my sleep patterns tend to be so sensitive. Should I take a nap if I feel tired? And how long would be ideal if I do?

86,"There should be studies on this. There should be research and studies done to look at this and tell me how to fix this because I'm drowning.

They say to lean on your friends.I have two friends that I still feel connected to but one is now an hour away and the other is 3. I feel like I'm driving them up a wall with my near constant need for someone to talk to about how horrible I feel every day. They put up with so much. 
There's people in my life that would count me as a friend but I haven't heard from them in months. No one's even noticed I deleted my Facebook. 

My daughter struggles to make friends but the ones she has.....their upper middle class moms don't seem interested in the single mom 10-15 years their junior. 

Everything says to reach out to loved ones....we live with my father, which I know is a much better situation than most have in my situation....but he treats our home as more of a flop pad than a home he is partially responsible for and has little-to-no interest in having a relationship with myself or his grand daughter now that he has a girlfriend. My sisters are two hours away and three hours away. The majority of my dad's family is in Florida. I don't speak with my mom or her family. 

Money's about to get really tight as my dad's moving out so I'll be responsible for everything. That means not only no money for babysitters but insane amounts of stress accompanying that. 

I've been doing talk therapy with a psychiatrist for over and year and a half and the only progress that we've made is getting me over my extreme anxiety about being on medication again. 

Every day it gets worse and more hopeless. I don't see it getting better. I have no hope. I sought out help. I talked to my friends. It doesn't help.",27Dec2018,1
87,"   Sorry if this post is all over the place. I've been researching it a lot lately.I don't have many friends to talk to anymore because a lot of them are partying a lot and doing drugs and just not really being motivated in life. Everyone else is just busy or our schedules don't match up, but a lot of them are trying to convince me to seek therapy. I hate therapists though. I'll give you some background on my life. Something I've never done before so I can elaborate why. I got into a heated debate with a psychologist on reddit earlier and she assumed I was trolling her after being super critical. I can understand why but that's not my goal.

   I had to go to a lot of therapists and a lot of psychiatrists from as far back as can remember through my freshman year of high school. I was on so many meds growing up, as far back as I can remember isn't really that far back. And from the bits I remember, I was either off the wall making an ass of myself, or I was simply tired. The one's I was on in Jr High were weird. I simply couldn't talk to people. That chunk of time from maybe like 2nd or 3rd grade up to my freshman year of high school are still blurry though. Like somebody taped over a VHS but some of the old footage manages to bleed through. I have a memory of singing a Tom Petty song with the music video playing on the TV, and looking up at my mom and dad and seeing a proud look on their face. I also remember my parents getting drunk a lot. My dad drunkenly and savagely beating the crap out of one of both of my parent's friends from high school. Surely someone could have looked into that before. Because it's pretty bizarre and sad when there is a lot of time where you almost didn't even really take that much part or have that much of a say in your own existence. 

   When everyone else was signing up for college and deciding what they wanted to do with the rest of their lives, I was simply trying to figure out who I was and establish an identity for myself. Ages 18 - 23 were simply me just catching up. I'm 27 now, and it was only a few years ago I feel like I was able to feel comfortable enough with myself to socialize. I have a pretty good group of friends but a lot of them are busy. Or like I said, a lot of them are going down a path that I don't want to. I have a pretty decent job but I wish I had gone to college earlier. Even then though. I still don't know what I want to do with my life. I'm still having hardcore identity issues which I don't even know how to elaborate on. I could use some help, but now professionals in the mental health community make me angry. I just feel like they don't know what they're doing or what they're talking about. I'm not trying to put anyone down for going out of their way to go to college and pursue a career in helping people. But I feel like a lot of my life was robbed from me by professionals who thought they knew what they were doing.

  So here's how I feel about mental health professionals. At best they seem like expensive life coaches. Talking helps. I get that. But can they take criticism well? Because that's where I would start. I would need to vent that and I wouldn't sugar coat anything. Other than that I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing. Despite my accomplishments, I'm a very sad or angry man. I couldn't tell you what I want to do with my life because I still couldn't tell you who I am. I don't know what my friend situation will look like going further. That leads to some dark thoughts and this is the longest stretch of sadness I've really ever had in my adulting. Going on 2 months now. But I don't like how much power therapists have when it comes to that kind of thing and I'm afraid of telling the wrong person who might overreact. And I've read enough stories on reddit to feel terrified of the 72 hour hold. I don't even know why the idea of it triggered so much fear in me.  
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this? If anything is blunt or mean, that's how I feel. I'm still young. I need to figure something out going forward. Maybe the people I dealt with growing up were the bottom of the barrel? I'll try my best to keep an open mind here.",27Dec2018,1
88,"A few days before Christmas I called NHS 24 for self harm and my episodes being more promimant (blackout, personality switch, etc) and they said I would receive a call from an NHS nurse in my area at most an hour later. An hour and 45 minutes later I grt a call (roughly 3:45am) from the nurse who was yawning constantly through my tears asking for help, she then said the reason I have depression and anxiety (alongside more problems that I'm waiting to be diagnosed) was due to the rape and sexual assault I endured in the previous year. When I tried explaining I've had these mental problems for years she cut me off asking ""Why would [you] call if you're not listening to a professional's advice?"" which just made me feel more hopeless.

I still get intrusive thoughts from time to time. Yesterday in particular I wondered what it feels like to be standing in front of imminent death. Like, not how it feels like to want to die. Not at all! Just, what does it feel like... To have the gun in your hand, what does it feel like to hold onto the rail of the motorway bridge behind you. To stand next to the tracks staring at the approaching ICE in the distance ready to take a step to the left so it can hit you. What's it like to have that much power over your life, to be that close to the end? Having the complete choice of stepping over or stepping back. What if I were to magically find myself in that situation. I'm certain it wouldn't be me who entered that situation. I'm scared to. But what if.... What would I do.... Would I get scared of having this much control, and start crying? I can imagine that. Would I stay there for a minute, taking in the feeling, and then step back? Or would I hastily step back? I honestly doubt I'd step over. But I kinda wanna know what it feels like. In a controlled way. Have someone to pull me out just in case. I'd love to explore it. That's one of my deep dark desires.

I'm hoping to explore myself a little, in discussion or conversation. Any questions about me or any input is welcome.

Mself and the psych nurse tried to talk to her and encourage her to get some help. But unfortunately  at the moment she cannot see, or is in denial there is an any issue. She has now been discharged to the care of her GP and has been given information on local services to support her.

About 10 years ago I was in the same place myself. It took me reaching rock bottom and nearly ending up dead, to realise I needed help. My mum was there for me then, supported me, and convinced me to get help. It would be a lie to say there hasn't been struggles since, but generally am happy now and glad I am still here.

I keep thinking things would be better if i was dead. Not in a “i want to kill myself way” because i don’t, at all. I can’t stress that enough.  But every time i get sick, or if I’m day dreaming, it brings me to these scenarios of what i would do with my time if i was dying, and how freeing it would be. And how much better things would be if I was. I hate my job (even though i make great money), I don’t ever want to go out anymore, I’ve been in limbo with my ex for over 3 years. I’ve had multiple new relationships but everything things start to get close it’s like i just go emotionally dead inside and push them away ( not in an abusive way or anything just like a “this isn’t working” kind of thing) even if i do like them. I can’t bring myself to the gym like i use to. Every day i feel like I’m just drifting in this overwhelming tailspin with no clear exit in sight. And when things do start to moderately improve, I manage to self Sabotage to create a new problem. I’m in crippling student loan debt from college, living with my parents, and have now gained more weight than i care to even think about. My credit is trashed and i have zero savings. If i watch a movie or a tv show that triggers any emotion (by myself) i cry like a baby. Then i go back and watch it again (most times because now i know it will make me cry and illicit some emotional response other than what I’m feeling. I play video games all the time because it’s the only thing that totally allows me to mentally check out from the world around me. 

 Now the interesting part about this is literally no one in my life knows I’m like this. To them I’m charismatic, charming, friendly, and helpful. Girls like me,I’m the guy my friends call when they have problems, I’m the voice of reason in stressful situations, I’m legitimately the opposite of what i truly feel on the outside. It’s like I’ve created this mask and no one can see through it. Not even my family (what are absolutely amazing people to me)

I'm trying to gain a sense of what I can do in the arena of psychology/behavioral science without having a degree in either respected field. I know that most people would simply say go back to school, however, I've weighed that option and I don't think it's a possibility for me at this juncture. I'm currently working an inside sales position that manages to pay my bills and also take up the majority of my time. This doesn't leave much in the way for school. And quitting to pursue more education would put me in a whole different category of debt. We've all heard the cliché, ""it's never too late to go back to school"", but I am 30, and well that seems too late to me. This is not to say I'm not educated. I did earn a degree in Economics from Texas A&amp;M University. It soon became clear though that economics was never going to be the career path for me. Although I did stick it out, and by continuously reassuring myself a degree is a degree, I finally finished. The thing is I've always been interested in psychology and the study of why people are the way they are. Better yet, why people do what they do. I became even more interested as I've gotten older due to my own battles with anxiety and depression. This is what has compelled me to follow this path and hopefully make a difference.

I just can't seem to find anything similar to my symptoms, also have a hard time explaining it.

Since less than a year, I became very jealous of my wife's colleagues (that I never met, and totally don't want to) very needy, very paranoid to the extreme that I convince myself that my wife is cheating, even if deep inside I know or is it hope? it to not be true ... it is very conflicting. She works a lot of hours and likes to wind down with her colleagues (girls &amp; boys), having a drink, or once in a while go out ... which I don't accept. Knowing her to be away and enjoying herself with others drives me mad, resulting to sleepless nights and fights when she is back. She is inviting me to come with her, but I just hate her colleagues without having met them. 

It's hard to explain, I think I have depression since I was a young teen (I'm in my mid thirties!), but this is something else ... I'm afraid that all that negative stuff, the absence of trust, paranoia ... will lead us apart, me pushing her away being needy etc .. 

I hear that voice in my head (more thoughts than really hearing, I'm fully aware it's my subconcious ""talking"") reacting to EACH thing in the negative way about her. 

I'm at a point where I wish my wife to be transferred to another location (branch) of her work (she isn't against, just not yet) and try to start fresh from there : meet her new (other) colleagues, maybe GO out with them a few times and see things with my own eyes, but I'm also afraid things will just be the same ...

103,I’m suffering from terrible anxiety and social anxiety and today it is off the rails. I just need advice on how to cool down please. My hands and body are shaking and my mind is racing.. I can’t calm down. Please suggestions. ,27Dec2018,1
104,"This is a post that I kept postponing for a long time, for various reasons. First of all, I don't want people to think I'm being overly dramatic, which I've got to admit I can sometimes be guilty of. But not this time. This time I want to unload that emotional baggage that has been weighing me down for ages. That something that has been a huge part of my life, sadly, for the past few years, and still haunts me to this day. So many people are experiencing the same thing daily, yet they're afraid to talk about it because people are judgemental. ""There's no such thing as depression"", ""you're just sad, you'll be ok"", ""God is punishing you for your sins"", ""mental illness isn't real"", etc...and those are just a few of the things that I keep hearing regularly and it breaks my heart because some people are fighting this illness in silence and a lot of them sadly succumb to the pain and self destruct because self-destructive behavior is rooted deep in our DNA - it's something we do when our survival instincts kicks in (the IRONY) and when we're severely sick.

So how does exactly depression affect people? I'm writing this post mostly for those who have never experienced depression. Hopefully, this post will answer some questions about this misunderstood illness, and make people more empathetic towards those who are suffering of it. 
Imagine the world's cruelest illnesses. I don't know what you're thinking of, might be cancer, might be AIDS, might be diabetes or whatever. These are illnesses that are widely recognized because there's been a lot of research on them and also because they're very lethal. Yet depression has maybe the same lethality rate but people don't even recognize it as an official illness. It's merely a blame game for them, those who are depressed are ""attention seeking"" and those who commit suicide are the ""cowards"". Classic thing to say. Take the pain caused by a severe, chronic illness such as those I've mentioned before and add the loneliness. The blame. The self-hatred. Everything that people don't even think about. People who suffer from other illnesses don't loathe themselves because of it. Meanwhile, depressed people constantly feel like they deserve to burn and rot because society makes them feel guilty of feeling that way.

Depression isn't just waking up sad and going back to sleep sad. It's much more. If anything, depression legit feels like being possessed. When people ask me what it feels like to be depressed, this is always how I answer their question: if demonic possession existed, this is what it would feel like. At first, it's discrete, but as time passes, it keeps getting more and more upsetting.

The first stage, that initial phase when you usually realize something's wrong, occurs when you feel physically exhausted for no reason. You wake up and you don't look forward to anything because you don't feel rested. No matter what you do, everything makes you feel tired it seems like regular things require more effort than they used to before. You wake up thinking of going back to bed. The second phase starts when you slowly begin to realize that everything bores you. The things you used to like and enjoy and dull and insignificant now. ""Maybe I just need a break from my old preferences and try something new instead"", you think to yourself. So you try out new stuff. You pick up a new hobby, a new TV show, a new book, a new game. Something to distract yourself. And then you realize you're not interested in new things either. It feels as if everything has lost its charm. You lose interest permanently in the things that you used to love. However, you keep pushing through the days maintain a routine, thinking that things will get back to normal soon. The next phase begins when you start feeling bad physically and emotionally. Your chest begins to feel heavy and you're starting to struggle with breathing. Your muscles are constantly aching, your back hurts, you feel physically nauseous and unwell, you have frequent headaches. Mentally, you feel ""out of place"". You feel wrapped in a sudden surge of negative energy that's making you unable to function and focus properly. This is where the demon starts to show its face. It starts telling you nasty things, for instance that life is purposeless, that you're meaningless, that no one loves you and that you hate everything and everyone. Your relationships start to shatter. You crave socializing but you can't maintain connections anymore. In fact, depression makes you completely unable to feel human connection and love. You feel isolated, outcast, and you start ruining your relationships on purpose because you don't want to take advantage of people, you don't want to pretend. Suddenly, all you ever want to talk about with people is death and morbid things. You begin to feel uninterested in other discussion topics and you end up isolating yourself because you want to be left alone (even though you feel lonely). If you're in a romantic relationship, you'll slowly fall out of love with your partner. If you're single, you'll lose interest in dating and romance. All you want to do now is sleep.

At this point, you realize you're seriously fucked up. You realize that there's something genuinely wrong with you yet you can't explain what it is. You suddenly feel irritated and constantly on edge. You feel anxious and scared of everything, and literally every single interaction with the outside world makes you feel negative emotions. Slowly but surely, your brain becomes immune to good feelings. All you can feel is negativity and negative energy and feelings. You start taking everything as a personal attack and you become angry and hateful. No matter how many good things happen to you, your brain will always find a way to invalidate them and make you feel like you're the most miserable person on planet earth. At this point, you're in constant pain and nothing makes you happy anymore. You just go through the motions. You do things but don't really enjoy them. You force yourself to go out and maintain a normal life but you're starting to struggle more and more everyday, to the point where even eating and proper hygiene becomes too much of a burden. All you can feel is hate and fear and pain and you don't even know why. You have a roof above your head, a comfy bed to sleep in, a family, and whatever. Why do I feel this way? I don't know. Yet I do. You tell yourself that things will get better but at this point, you're actually starting to lose hope.

You try to fight your way through the daily agony and rejection that you face. Your social anxiety and depression prevent you from engaging in social activities. Every time you meet someone, you're afraid you'll come off as stupid because of your anxiety. You're not really confident and you're scared of what the world thinks about you. You're not yourself anymore, you're just a shell of the person you used to be, now controlled by fear and insecurities. ""They hate me"", ""they think I'm lame"", ""I'm useless"", ""life is not for me"", the little devil I was talking about keeps pushing these constant negative thoughts and you can't stop them. Can't stop them at all. This is all you're going to be thinking of 24/7.

Then comes a point where you've been through so much pain that you lose touch with reality. Things start to become blurred, you don't really rationalize things. You can see and hear yet your brain is refusing to process the information. You live in constant confusion. It's difficult to explain, but even the most basic things become strange and unfamiliar to you. You feel like an infant trapped in the body of an adult, with little to no information about how life works. Time and space become super blurred and relative, you lose track of time and you start to fail recognizing places you've seen before or people you've met. You start seeing things from a screwed up perspective, you start feeling like nothing is real and that you're losing your sanity. You see people laughing, having fun, holding hands, and you don't understand how they can be like that. Human emotion becomes a distant memory, so distant that you actually start to forget what it feels like to FEEL. You become numb, while still feeling pain (I know it sounds illogical because numbness means the absence to ALL feelings, but in this case, you become numb to happiness and good feelings...the bad feelings don't disappear but they don't even feel human anymore, they feel weird. Hate, anger and pain are starting to feel weird but they're still there). You sometimes find yourself staring at a wall and thinking nothing. You're empty. There's no thoughts, no feelings and no remains of logic inside of you. You lose your personality entirely, you forget how to laugh, cry, smile and just simply BE human. You become a mechanoid, some sort of robot that ""lives"" life on autopilot. You experience things, but they don't feel real. It doesn't feel like you're actually experiencing anything, you feel like everything just bypasses your psyche and you can't make sense of anything. Your consciousness starts to fade and day by day you're less and less self aware, and less aware of what's happening around you. Your brain will not react to anything, refusing to allow you to FEEL ALIVE. Your ego disappears, your sense of self disappears as well. You don't process emotion. You see things but you don't understand them. You hear things but don't comprehend them. Everything feels messed up, weird and fundamentally wrong. Everything becomes foreign to you. The process of dehumanization has begun. You feel less human with each passing day.

And you know what's the worst? People on the outside have NO FUCKING IDEA. They don't know even one percent of what you're going through. They have no idea you're losing it. They think you're okay because you don't show it. You don't want people to think you're insane, despite the fact that you feel insane yourself. You don't want to be a burden. You can't talk to anyone, family, parents, friends, no one. No one understands. It's only YOUR battle and you're losing it. And no one knows.

So, don't you just want to just stab yourself in the eyes when someone tells you that you're attention seeking? That your grief is not real? That you're not suffering from a valid and real illness because it's mental illness and people don't believe in it? Mental illness is real and it's the closes thing to demonic possession we have. You can't know until you've been there. And if you haven't, I hope you never will, because it makes you lose your soul, yourself. I think there's truly no way back to who you used to be. That's why all I ask for is empathy. Please, just try to understand. Don't blame. You never know what someone is experiencing, you don't know what they feel. Be kind. I hope I managed to explain depression to those who have never experienced it. I hope everything is clear and that people will stop being hateful just because they can't understand certain things in life.",27Dec2018,1

Any advice? How do you cope?",27Dec2018,1
106,I have listened to lots of music over my life. I have on many occasions heard a song and thought “damn that person must be suffering from the same illness that I am” because of the words being said or issues being eluded to. ,27Dec2018,1
107,"I'm in need of advice - To summarise the situation I'm in:

I was raised by working-class parents, my mum (unemployed) and my dad (ambulance driver). My mum suffers with bi-polar disorder, depression, anxiety, obesity, and more recently, fibromyalgia. On the other hand, my dad is an avid smoker, who suffers with frequent back and knee issues, and has very little hygiene.

My direct family has never been financially secure, but even if we were, free day-trips - like to a local historic battlefield - used to be met with my mum panicking (even though she takes medication for her disorders), or my dad ""wanting a rest day"" or ""can't afford the car fuel"". Therefore, our weekends consist of doing nothing - especially now, with my mum's back problem - except chores, watching television, or playing video games. This has been the case for the twenty-three years of me being alive, and I think this idle mindset has severely influenced my character. I have other issues, like anxiety, but this has played the major factor in my life...

I get up early, go to work, and get home late. For a lengthy period, I forced myself to go gym after work, but I lost interest. The weekend comes, and I have the money to go places and do things, but my mum can't (she now has a mobility scooter for her back issue), and my dad is ""too tired"" or ""too concerned about my mum"". Because of our secluded lifestyle, family do not visit or contact us, except at events like birthdays or X-mas. My old school friends gave up on inviting me to places, because I'm an introvert, and their idea of enjoying themselves involve alcohol and clubbing. I haven't had a girlfriend, ever. I've got used to staying in my free time; browsing the internet, gaming, and doing chores. Hobbies that interest me - I can't bring myself to join, because of my introverted and anxious personality. My confidence is non-existent.

108,"I'm an 18 year old who just finished my first semester of school. It was a semester that was absolutely brutal on my mental health. In the beginning of the semester I was on Pristiq and remeron. A few weeks in, new meds started to get thrown into the mix. Now I am on Pristiq, Wellbutrin, and Resperidone. My doctors at school firmly believe that I am bipolar, but today at an appointment with my doctor at home he said the anti-psychotic (resperidone) that I was put on was shit, and that I'm not bipolar but rather borderline. My doctor says that but my therapist doesn't believe teenagers can have personality disorders and she also doesnt think I am bipolar. Does anyone have a similar experience? As of lately, I have been feeling extremely depressed. The panic attacks have decreased dramatically but the suicidal ideation has increased. I don't see myself living into proper adulthood - it just doesnt seem realistic. I have no motivation to do anything to change the outcome of my life like work or school. It seems like a huge waste of time because if life plays out like it does in my mind, I won't be alive at that point. I have urges to self harm but the suicidal thoughts are remaining more on the passive side, but I dont know when I'll get to the point of acting. It's scary and I feel so misunderstood.

110,"How do you differentiate?

I am... a very sick young man. (Am I still young at 32?) I have a lot of solid diagnoses - dystonia, migraine with aura, CRPS, etc - as well as some diagnoses in flux/being worked out - a bunch of GI issues, some of the chronic pain, a new cardio issue with fluctuating BP and high hematocrit. I've had a couple cancer scares but so far I'm safe and for what's going on, my brain, liver, and kidney look safe. 

I believe in my PTSD diagnosis. I also have anxiety/depression but both my therapist (current) and friends doubt this one. 

A lot of the symptoms overlap though. Is my heart pounding because I am anxious or because I'm having a cardio episode? Do I not want to leave the house because I'm depressed or because I'm in so much pain I just can't? Do I sleep 16 hours because I'm depressed or because my body is exhausted from being so sick?

And yes the difference is important because the treatment is completely different. A cardio episode might need an ER, panic attack doesn't. Sleeping 16 hours because of depression needs antidepressants; sleeping 16 hours because I am that exhausted means embracing this new sleep schedule. ",27Dec2018,1
111,"This'll be a long post, thanks in advance to everyone who'll stick with it :) 

I'm a 23 year old male, from the Netherlands, and I have ADD and problems with social anxiety. As a kid and as a teenager I was unhappy pretty much all the time. My life has been looking brighter for a few years now though. I've been working very hard on improving myself, like putting myself out there to do things I'm afraid to. In general my life so far has been a gentle slope upwards, but always 2 steps forward and then 1 back again, and only when I was putting in the effort. 

Every New Year's I always kind of reflect on the year I've had and every year I find myself thinking ""20XX really needs to be my year"". My life has been alright for a few years now. I've been happy to gradually make more friends and expand my social life, which has always been my biggest problem. I also usually get some other small successes. None of them ever really made it feel like ""my year"" though because it always took a huge amount of effort to take 2 steps forward with an inevitable step back in there.

2018 though, 2018 really was my year. It feels like all my work paid off.

I'll talk about some successes. At the end of 2017 I was still looking for a job since I completed my education in the summer. Applying for jobs is really stressful because of my social anxiety, so that was pretty rough. In February of this year, I finally found a job and although I won't be happy doing it forever, it is actually the best job I've ever had. 

Part of the improvements in my life was that I started dating a few years ago. However, up until this year dating was more failures than successes for me, and I had never been in a relationship. In May I went to a festival with some friends and friends of theirs (again, putting myself out there). One of those friends of friends just happened to be a single girl. We had an okay time at the festival, nothing special, but we started texting after and had a great time with that. Then we went on a first date, just having an ice cream and talking, and I was sold. We have now been dating 7 months and officially together for 5. My girlfriend alone would've made this the best year of my life, but that still wasn't all. 

In the summer, I bought my first car. It's a minor thing, but I love my car and it does bring me another step closer to having my life figured out. 

Also in the summer, I went on a holiday with my best friend. So far I had only been abroad with family, and although going with family is great, I always wished I had good enough friends to do something so grand with them. This summer it happened, and it really was awesome. Just having a best friend at all is a huge victory for me. I tend to behave sort of flat and unoffensive which makes people accept and maybe even like me, but not many people really love having me as a friend. The quality of my friendships is now improving though which means I must be doing something right. I also did several day trips with other friends, again making me feel pretty awesome. 

All things considered I'm really happy with what happened in my life this year. New opportunities always come with new threats, so I will continue to work on improving my life in 2019. If anyone read to the end of my huge post, thank you. I hope 2019 will be as awesome to you as this year was to me. There's always a reason to have hope :)

I feel that me and a close friend of mine are in this cycle (me the anxious and him the avoidant). The article in its entirety fit the description of our friendship 100%.  Basically, the anxious desires the attention of the avoidant, and the avoidant purposefully pushes the anxious away despite being in a close relationship to each other. The anxious eventually pushes the avoidant away, and then the avoidant apologizes/makes-up for everything and promises a better relationship. Ultimately, the cycle continues and nothing changes.

113,"Okay, so I don't know how to call this and how to cope with this, maybe anyone of you has the same issue or at least experience, maybe you've had a partner like this.

So my problem is being in a relationship makes a part of me instable. I'm now in a relationship of soon 2 years, it's long distance and he loves me, no doubts. I'm fully aware of this and I trust him. But it's me, who can be quite controlling sometimes (I got this \*mostly\* under control, ba dum tss btw) and jealous (very annoying). We've already had several fights and discussions about this and as I'm in therapy (depression and panic disorder), I talked about this there too. I understand that I hate those traits and want to get rid of them. They make life harder than it really is and in addition to that, expose me to a lot of emotional stress. So e.g. when he goes out with friends (particularly those hangouts, where I don't know any of the people) to NYE, like he is planning to next week, I somehow start to get worried. Or: my emotions start to be uncontrollable and there the vicious circle begins. I start thinking about maybe him cheating but then I know he wouldn't do it, then I feel agitated as fuck, can only concentrate on this topic and wait for him for even hours (fortunately, this has only happened twice by now - in those moments I even wake up multiple times at night). I feel dependent as hell and this exhausts me. In this moments, I'm having a really really hard time calming down because my emotions have started hell inside me. 

This is why I'm asking: I'm not the only one, am I? Do you know any strategies how to cope with this? And how the hell is this phenomenon called?

In recent years I’ve wondered if I’m a sociopath. I don’t know how to explain it, but I hope I do it well enough for someone to understand. Growing up, I lived in a mostly conservative military community (and yes, mostly white too) I was the only few Black girls at any of my schools. I’m sorry to get personal here but…even though I was always told I was pretty, when I got into Middle School and High School  people would always say that I was “Pretty for a Black girl,” or something to that effect. It’s like I was designated the Token Black Girl. Boys at school would always use me as an example of the pretty black girl or the black girl that’s pretty enough to be desired.
I don’t know how exactly o get this across, but they would be like, “Would date her?” basically saying, “All the other black girls are ugly but she’s pretty enough for our white standards so what about her?” It’s embarrassing and I hate. I’m tried. There was even a situation were these two White boys were talking and one was like, “Would you date a black girl?” And the other was like, “I don’t know…” than the other guy said, “Would you date ….”, than the guy said he would date me. I hate this because it’s like I’m token Black girl that’s just white looking enough that people like her. I also hate it because it’s embarrassment to all the other black girls at my school that aren’t considered “good enough”. 

It didn’t stop there it kept going and going. They never cared about how I felt, how this would effect me and everyone around me. When I got to high school I decided NO MORE, I wasn’t going to let them control me. I started stringing White boys at my school along. Seducing them, making them think that I loves them when I didn’t. I would let them hold my hand and hug me but I would never have sex with them. Never tell them I love them, EVER.

I just don't know at this point if I'm that retarded or it's standardized testing that's making me stupid. For anyone that's reading this thanks for listening to me vent.",27Dec2018,1
128,"For a while now I've been having these ""moments"" when I experience a sudden shock and start feeling like something very normal I saw/read about/heard at that moment is bizzare and I would wonder if it is even real. For example not too long ago I was reading about Spain and as soon as I read the word ""Spain"" something struck me. My mind started racing with questions like ""What is Spain? Is Spain real?"". Is this normal or is this something serious?",27Dec2018,1
129,"I’ve always thought my mental health was great, and that I was a very strong minded individual. However, in the last couple years I’ve realized that’s not the case. I’m having destructive thoughts, and sometimes I just get really sad out of nowhere. I don’t want to talk about things like this to people in my every day life. However, I’m scared to see a therapist. Because, I don’t want to be told something is wrong with me. I don’t ever want to be told to take medicine for anything regarding my mental health. I also don’t know if I can even afford a therapist. I don’t even know what advice I’m even seeking with this post. If anyone is similar to me, or has thought about this as well, share what you did.",27Dec2018,1
