2,"A little bit of personal context: I'm 30, originally from France, currently living in the U.S. with my wife, and working for an international non-profit.

I've always been relatively shy, but I never really felt (or wanted to acknowledge) that I had any specific psychological issues. My father passed away when I was young, and it's always been a topic that has been avoided in my family. To this day, I don't really talk about it with anyone, and just thinking about it (and typing this) is bring tears to my eyes. I didn't have trouble make friends when I was a kid, but it's become a real struggle now, which makes me feel bad about myself. I've also often tended to let myself be ""influenced"" for some decisions in my life: I changed topics of studies when I was younger after a friend convinced me to do it (it was most likely a very good idea though), I changed career plans to follow my wife (although we never discussed it and I never acknowledged that to her; and it was also a good thing to go away from what I was going for, but maybe not such a good one to go for what I do now).

I was promoted at work over a year ago and started assuming new responsibilities, which have made me become more stressed about it. This led me to start reading about mental and psychological issues, and I think I might have anxiety disorder. I haven't gone to a therapist yet, but it is in my plans, and hopefully I will soon manage to summon the courage (although I'm a little afraid it will be very expensive...). I might have other issues as well (maybe some type of OCD).

Apart from the anxiety that originates from work, I have some tendency to overthink, to obsess over things, and to make myself even more miserable that way.

For instance, I've wanted to visit Japan for a while, and every time I see something about someone visiting there or living there, it makes me wish it was me, and I start imagining how much better life would be there, all the stuff I would be doing there and, it makes me think that my life is boring and worthless. Or when a friend is telling me about something they've done recently that sounds interesting, I'm thinking why I'm not doing the same thing, how their life is better than mine, etc.

I always dig really deep into these fantasies and it makes me feel terrible about myself. My mind starts spiraling out of control, and it takes me a lot of effort to manage to stop myself from going deeper and deeper. Sometimes I almost want to ""give up"" (whatever I mean by that, stop caring about anything, stop interacting with people when I don't have to,...) so that I wouldn't have these thoughts anymore.

Is therapy the only option at this point? Is there anything else I can do to make me feel less anxious and prevent me from going crazy when this type of thoughts appear?",29Jan2018,1
4,"I had a nervous breakdown in June 2017 (i.e. crippling anxiety, intense panic attacks; had to quit my job because I couldn't function) -- triggered I believe by the fact I've lived at home with my parents since moving college, and underlying baggage coming to the surface. It made me realize a lot of groundbreaking things about myself, which I've been working through in therapy since October.

It's now February, and I still haven't quite reached ""THE"" breakthrough I've wanted to in therapy. It feels so close yet so far away... my therapist said I've made such impressively quick progress since we started. I'm pretty self-aware and high in emotional intelligence.

However, I realize how it hasn't been so healthy that I've put ALL my energy and focus on this breakthrough. While it's helped a lot in terms of therapy, it has come to a cost at my stress levels, panic, and more -- leaving me mentally exhausted. I've been so determined, because I just want to get better and be the person I've always dreamed of.

But it's like reality has suddenly hit me -- I need to move on from this shitty situation, re-socialize myself, and make plans. For some reason this is depressing me so much -- because it feels like I'm so close to where I want to be mentally, but I realize how unhealthy it is. At the same time, I know therapy is a process and requires patience.

I'm at such a weird point -- has anyone else experienced this? I feel so disappointed for some reason... my compromise in this situation would I guess be to go on antidepressants to stabilize, still go to therapy while making my life plans?",29Jan2018,1
5,"For those of you with schizophrenia or people with family members with schizophrenia is there a certain way to speak to people with the illness? Are there things I shouldnt be asking? ex- ""have the voices calmed down? Are you taking your medication? Are you having any poor side effects?""

8,"I know I need an official diagnosis and a credible therapist, but please, just hear me out and tell me what you think?

I've always been a paranoid person, but lately, I question if my friends are really my friends. I question if people really like me, or if they're lying behind my back.

But I also sometimes feel like...nothing's real? In a way? I feel like I might be in a simulation, and though this sounds narcissistic, I've always felt like I'm the only real person. That everyone around me is...fake? And I'm the only real one. I just can't shake that feeling.

I'm always hyper. I'm always alert. I always feel like people are watching me - it gets so bad that I put tape over my webcams, my phone camera, and I hate pictures.

Lately, however, I've felt that I just can't concentrate in school. I can't read without losing interest no matter how many times I try, and I keep forgetting things. The other day, I walked into my room *three times* just to grab things for my morning shower. I kept forgetting things. I've been locking myself out of my room recently, and forgetting what I'm doing or where I'm going or where I've put something.

I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Not to mention I always see shit out of the corners of my eyes and it's starting to bug me.

Am I just anxious? Or am I going crazy? What's going on here?",29Jan2018,1

15,"I don't mean to insult individuals with actual mental illnesses, because I know there's a huge disrespect that comes with an individual putting normal traits out of proportion (I.e, being a neat freak and calling yourself OCD)

However, ever since I was younger I've experienced these insane fits of anger. When I was younger I'm sure my parents just wrote them off as me being a kid. It was usually just characterized by these bouts of anger and nastiness when I got frustrated or aggravated (rarely physical, mostly just verbal and behavioral). I was otherwise a pretty sweet and empathetic kid so it wasn't like I was in general ""problematic"". I distinctly remember getting so frustrated because I felt like i couldn't control these fits of being generally just a horrible person, and no matter how hard I tried, and I kept getting in huge trouble over something I felt like I couldn't control.

I haven't grown out of it. When I get slightly irritated, stressed, or frustrated, it takes no time at all for me to spiral. I've gotten a little better at controlling it, but for someone my age (18F) I feel like this absolutely should not be happening. I just suddenly turn into a horrible person and all I want is to make people feel terrible and to tear them down and be angry.  When people are kind and patient with me, it just makes me angrier because all I want is a rise out of them I want them to match my level of insane anger. If I'm texting someone while this happening, I'll have this urge to say something horrible and nasty and if I don't respond or I say something else, i get this feeling like I'm going to lose my mind and my heart starts pounding and I feel myself physically just becoming so overcome with anger. 

Just tonight I freaked out at my boyfriend over the phone because the stress of other situations was boiling up and he was trying to be so sweet and patient and it just made me even angrier for some reason. It makes me sick to type this but in that moment I just wanted to tell him that I hated him. He hadn't done anything wrong and he's one of the most amazing people I know but I just got overcome with this urge to tell him that I hate him and to go off on him and to scream and just...my heart was pounding and racing and I felt stick to my stomach. I made him block my number because I was afraid of what I might say.

Ten minutes later and I feel horrible and I absolutely hate myself and I'm instead spiraling into this really dark place of self loathing.

This is not unusual. This cycle happens all the time with people I become very close with and as I grow older I feel like its seriously starting to impede my ability to maintain healthy relationships with people I love and with myself.

Is there something fundamentally wrong with me?? Am I just having really strange panic attacks? I'm so tired of being someone I hate.",29Jan2018,2
16,"I'm 17 so I still live with my mom and everything but we're not close at all, she's incredibly bipolar so it can be hard to get close to her, that's not her fault though. The problem is I can't tell her I'm depressed because she would freak out and never let me go anywhere or do anything or treat me the same because she would think it would mean I could die at any moment. But I know I really need a therapist, however because she doesn't know how bad things really are she super slow to get one because she's so forgetful. I've also been trying to get sleep medication for my insomnia but again she forgets all the time to get me a prescription. I don't know what to do anymore, I've tried a ton of stuff to better my mental state and to make me happier in life but I'm still getting worse. Everything seems pointless. What do I do?

17,"When I was a little kid, I used to freak and stress out over the smallest things to the point it was unhealthy. I was also a perfectionist and would be irritated by the smallest flaws. (For example, I would be afraid of situations that were extremely unlikely to occur and once I had emotional breakdown over the imperfections in the plastic mold of a toy I had bought.) 

Then in middle school, I started to not care as much as possible and/or just consciously forget about things so I wouldn’t feel so stressed out. 

Now, I’ve been doing this for so long, I don’t feel much passion or feeling unless I’m feeling self pity or sadness. Even my long time hobby feels like a form of escapism but not of enjoyment. I just feel completely dispassionate.

 My parents don’t believe in therapy or in mental illness as a whole so I cannot get external help. Is there any way I can reverse this lack of emotion on my own? (Ie self therapy..? Is that even a thing?)",29Jan2018,1
18,"Much of human experience grows out of two root emotions - those of love and fear. Within us as individuals, and as a collective, the tension of this apparent duality breeds our internal and external battles as human beings. I think this is a deeply spiritual struggle, to act out of love, and to choose to live love

And part of that might be realizing that love is actually all there is. There's no duality. Raw fear, fear not wearing the mask of anger, disgust, greed, etc., is the most burning thing to experience. But it also means your that far ahead in the spiritual progression of things. You've already progressed through some superficial forms of fear. Maybe in past lives or alternative incarnations or just throughout your development in this life. But this is true - your intimacy with fear reflects how close you are to getting to the root of it all.

Because once u face raw fear, experience it, suffer with it, and then realize that it is actually just loves final challenge... you can be free.

You wouldn't have this fear if you weren't able to create goodness from it. The more fear you seem to have, the more potential energy there exists to turn into love. I can explain it in terms of biophysics if it would be more convincing. But I think u probably get it. Fear isn't the enemy, it's the teacher.

And our teachers wouldn't be so harsh if we weren't such advanced students.

This is a classic symptom of pots and he referred me to a neurologist who will do a tilt table test on me or possibly a nuclear test. I  begged my doctor over and over to refer me, though and he finally did. Before doing that, he started bringing up my past trauma while I was hyperventilating after running to the visit (I was close to being late for the appointment) my heart rate was going up and I thought I was going to pass out. He randomly started bringing up all the trauma, and then said ""See, I think me talking about this is causing you to hyperventilate and feel how you're feeling""

What I want to know is, are doctors allowed to just bring up past trauma like this?

24,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this. I am in southern California USA and I think my brother in law might be severely mentally ill but I am not sure how to get him help. This is going to be long because I want to fully explain what hes been experiencing. A tl;dr is at the bottom. Here's what happened:

Last night my wife gets a call from her brother. He's frantic. He was mumbling nonsensical things for a few minutes before my wife could understand what was going on. He had fallen off his bike, hurt himself pretty bad and was in the hospital. He's 40 years old and since I have known him, he's been just a little off but this was a whole other level.

He started rambling about how he was in a fake hospital and that the staff were planning on taking him away through the underground tunnels that run under the city. There are of course no such tunnels and we aren't sure where he got this idea. While on the phone he heard a beep come from a piece of the equipment in the emergency room. *Why the fuck is there a beeping?! There's nothing connected to me! Why would there be beeping?!*

We try to get through the rambling and ask him what hospital he's in. Finally he asks a staff member, and she wasn't really sure. Turns out this was her first week in this hospital and she wasn't completely familiar with the area. This set him off even further. *See! This bitch doesn't even know where we are! How can she be a real doctor?! They are going to take me away!*

At this point he has to get taken for x-rays so my wife and I get ready to go to the hospital. On the way there he calls back and begins raving about the underground tunnels that he KNOWS people have disappeared in. Finally we get there and he is pacing around the small ER room they put him in, rambling about random things. My wife tries to calm him down but he keeps talking about the underground tunnels. He now informs us that there are abandoned hospitals in a nearby city that they lure people to and capture them. This of course could be one of them

He was pretty argumentative toward the hospital staff because he felt they were there to hurt him in some way. He kept insisting that we call our family members to tell them where we are so that if we were to be captured, someone would know where we are.

This continued for a little while longer but once we were discharged, his thoughts and speech continued to be disorganized. He told us that his astrological sign was ares, so he would heal very quickly and that he wasn't worried about the torn ligament in his shoulder. Then he jumped to taking about god and how he knows that god is made up of radiation or some sort of energy all around us. He then said that he sent a telepathic message to his sister (my wife) and told her to come to the hospital. In the past he has mentioned to my wife that he believes he is superhuman in some way.

Once we got him back to where he was staying, he insisted that he give my his phone number. He told me that some sort of world wide catastrophe is going to happen and that I needed to contact him when it did so that he can come find us. 

My brother in law had always been a little bit off I think but I have never seen anything like this. He seems to have lost touch with reality. He doesn't seem to want to listen to the evidence against his paranoid delusions. It's pretty scary. I don't think hes a danger to himself or others at this moment but I know he is capable of lashing out if he feels threatened. I need to get him some help.

What kind of professional should I seek out to diagnose him?

How can we convince him to see a professional? 

Does anyone have any experience with a family member like this?

tl;dr: Brother in law seems to be having paranoid delusions, out of touch with reality. Desperately want to help him lead a normal life. Please see above questions.

Other times he feels like he set it up for something completely innocuous to happen (such as a friend waving at him) and that bothers him.

Here we go.
--------------------------------------------------

**not good with the girls or... people, in general**

My brother, 33, has always been a little bit... off. His romantic relationships have failed in the past-- he once was engaged but his fiancee got cold feet at the last moment very suddenly. The woman he loved after her actually got a restraining order against him as he showed stalker/obsessive behavior towards her after she broke up with him. His most recent girlfriend we thought was a great match and could settle him down but she, too, seemed to have been worn down and left him. So his relationships have never really been good (probably his fault, though it's unclear) but he considers romance and having a life partner his only goal in life to achieve happiness. He seemed to have few friends and his humor is really immature to a degree that it's downright inappropriate for his age. He made terrible jokes at our grandmother's funeral (which was the first major death in the family for all of us!) and basically wrecked the organization of one side of the family. He was... making jokes.


**the crutch**

Here's where I come in. He would come to only me and not our other siblings or my parents for advice and for support. He and I both kind of have been black sheep in our family due to our different beliefs and to the unfortunate attention we got from the rest of our family for our lifestyles (which is more a conversation related to /r/raisedbynarcissists but slightly off topic, so I won't quite go there). But his connection to me was obsessive to a degree in the past that bothered me... and then something happened when I was 14 that scarred me and forever changed my view of him.

One day when I was 14, he approached me when I was alone and made an extremely sexual request of me. Though I did not let it happen, he persisted in asking until finally he left me alone. He is eight years older than me, so he was a young adult when he asked. It scared the living hell out of me, but I was too afraid to tell my parents because I didn't think they would believe me (my relationship with them has never been the best). But friends knew I was acting off at school and they pieced it together until one of them ended up reporting it to a counselor, who then got the police involved. 

My brother ended up running away but eventually was found. My parents talked to him. He didn't really get in trouble. They just basically chalked it down to him being a stupid boy. 

**forgive your brother**

So that's one of the main base points of why I never really felt comfortable around him, but because my parents encourage forgiveness and don't like there being any bad blood between any family members (ha...) they encouraged me to support him since I seemed to be the only person who would understand him. He dealt with deep depression with his failed relationships and he and I had a lot of interests in common. He even told me me he tries to date girls like me, as if that is some weird way of saying he somehow respects me. Idk. 

**other means of abuse**

He's also really aggressive. When he was a teenager, he would often slam doors and yell in rebellion, but he also eventually began to break things. He kicked a large hole in the wall once. To my disgust and utter shock, I also found out only a few months ago he used to beat up one of my brothers secretly. He would verbally torment all of us, would go through people's things, take belongings... it was like him being an eldest sibling meant he felt entitled to anything whatsoever in our house. He read through my journals and made bizarre assumptions about them... he once called me a slut (I was a virgin and had only had 1 serious relationship at that time) and then a liar when I explained he was wrong and how offended I was that he went through my things. No remorse for this. He would actively seek out things that were hidden from him.

It's like something never clicked in his head that you're supposed to treat people a certain way. He treats them... the opposite, sometimes, of what you would hope.

Now I believe most definitely he has a mental illness (or multiple), which is what *finally* brings me to my current issue:

**slamming the doors**

I believe he is both strongly paranoid and also had a sleep disorder. The problem is that he refuses to seek help and has started to believe people are out to get him. Including me. The one he has hurt the most, but my family believes I'm the one he loves the most simultaneously.

When he lived with his last girlfriend, he made her sleep in another room because he believed he couldn't sleep at night with any interruption. He started to believe his neighbors were purposefully waking him up at night, banging around garbage cans in the middle of the night. Or that the old lady upstairs was banging on metal pipes on purpose. Eventually, he *stopped living in his own house* to move back in with my parents. Where he currently is. With me. 

He said he would see shadows outside of my windows. And eventually his own windows. He took the cameras he'd had installed at his house, which has fallen into a severe state of disrepair that he cannot afford to fix thus meaning he can't leave my parents' house, and I believe he intends to set up his cameras here. He blamed all of our neighbors, none of which talk to any of us because it's a more private neighborhood.

Here's when shit started REALLY getting insane. He started telling me that my ""friends"" were doing it to him. I explained, again, I don't know our neighbors and I don't have any friends who even live in the same county as me. He didn't believe me. Then he started to believe that my parents were doing it to him. Don't get me wrong, as I mentioned above, my parents are really not the best, but they do try to at least support their children when they can. I'm living at home so I can finish off my student loan payments before moving in with my fiance (plus they heavily disbelieve I can move in before marriage-- separate story, sorry. Bear with me). So we are both stuck at home to be in a better financial situation.

Despite the fact my parents have let him come home multiple times in times of trouble, he has started to believe they are sneaking around at odd hours of the night, specifically when he is trying to sleep... and he believes they are trying to wake him up. He says he hears doors slamming. He says he can feel the floor shake whenever my mother walks (she's obese, but it's literally on the other side of our ranch house... on carpet. It's obviously impossible). He says he sees people walking around in the kitchen at night... It goes on. 

One day recently he came into my room, seemingly in a daze, at like 2 in the morning. No knocking, nothing. I asked him what was wrong and he mumbled, ""I thought I heard something."" He walked a few steps towards the room I let my cat sleep in at night, and then turned around and walked out. It was bizarre. 

**a pair of insomniacs**

He explains he cannot sleep ever anymore. This is yet another thing he connects with me on because I have two diagnosed-by-a-sleep-specialist sleeping disorders, severe insomnia being one of them. I've suggested he see my sleep doctor but he claims it's a waste of time. His version of self-help is drinking sometimes but it doesn't help him, of course. On Christmas morning he told me he had solved his sleep problem. I asked him what he was going to do... 

He said he was going to remotely set off his car alarm to wake all the neighbors and our family at 3 in the morning so we all know what it feels like, and that somehow will stop the people from waking him up on purpose. It was... the most mentally insane thing I have ever heard him say. I was shocked... He had no remorse at all. I told him he could get arrested and he said didn't think he would and that he didn't care. It's like... the social cue needed there to understand how wrong it was just didn't exist in his head.

**where I try to love him or call the police**

Then he started to wake us up. He slams doors in the middle of the night. And *last night*, he actually *screamed* WAKE UP!! outside of my door at 6:15am. I couldn't fall back asleep and was a mess at work.

My dad heard it. He came out to investigate but decided to not approach him. I tried to approach my brother the next morning but he looked at me and was silent, and walked away. That was him saying, ""that was for you."" And I don't fucking know why. 

We have told him to seek doctors. My parents, despite their weakness and enabling of this, despite me saying I have felt unsafe around him for 10 years, despite agreeing with me that he's mentally insane... they feel like they can't do anything. And I feel like I can't get police involved because there is no ""proof"" right now that he will harm himself or anyone. There's just the fear in my head. Who would even listen to me? My parents want him to own up and apologize to me because they know he believes he is connected to me, but I don't fucking want this connection anymore. I don't want his words. I want action. 

Last week he apologized to me for waking me up and said he would get help. But he screamed at me last night and proved he was a liar. I don't know what to do.

It’s more difficult than it has any right to be, and that coupled with a general lethargic feeling and disinterest building up, I think I can reasonably say I’m probably depressed. I mean, I know I have I few issues, confrontation gives me an anxiety like nothing else, my grudges could rival a god. Those I can deal with.

37,"Hello good people of /r/Mentalhealth, I need your help. This is going to be a longer text but I hope that at least some will read it and I am utmost grateful for any piece of advice. 

I am currently in a long distance relationship with a girl with severe anxiety problems. The distance makes it really hard to support her. She cannot get any support in her country, mental health awareness is almost 0 and her family basically does not want to talk to her other than blaming her for shit. I am the only one to support her at this point, and I am 10,000+km away. 

Our current situation: 

We set up a plan for her to start a new life at my country after she dropped out of university due to her mental problems. Tickets are already bought and all she needs is some money to get a health insurance. Otherwise she wont get a visa. She works part-time and was on a good track to earn enough money until April when her flight is. She does not really like her job but it pays really well and she is flexible.

Tthings got really worse after Christmas. Meeting her parents kinda destroyed her a bit and she could not go to work in 3 weeks. She lives alone far away from her parents, but since she came back she can barely leave her room. Working is out of question 6 out of 7 days per week. Her texts are mostly stuff like: ""I am garbage, I can't do anything, I can't move"" and so on. I feel really helpless and I am also partly to blame for the current situation. 

I am also not very strong mentally and tend to vent my anger at random people. I am aware that this is devastating for her current situation so I try my absolute best to not let any anger come out when I talk to her. It is just really hard as this whole situation makes me really angry, mostly directed at myself. I know that she cannot do anything about it. I was in her situation, I lost 3 school years to a severe depression where I could not leave my room during daytime for weeks. I took me 3 years to pull myself out of it and get my life together. She has only 3 months left and she needs my support. 

Her life would get 100x better after she comes here. We have the mental health facilities to help her, my family would welcome her, she could find work fairly easily and she would be on my side. Her family always rejected her from a young age, telling her that she was unwanted at age 6, making her feel like human garbage. She has the lowest self-esteem you could imagine.  

But I truely love her and I will not abandon her. I want to help her so please help me. I am happy to receive any advice, anything I can tell her that will make her day better.",29Jan2018,1
40,"My girlfriend has diagnosed bipolar. Occasionally (maybe once every other week), usually when she's upset, she'll start acting very different. Not normal she's upset different, but like she's a completely different person. She has totally different opinions on a lot of really big issues, it seems like what she wants out of life is completely different, and she does things she would never normally do. This usually doesn't last long (1 to 2 hours) and then she's completely back to normal. When she's normal again she says she can't tell when she switches, she thinks she's being totally normal, but when she switches back she realizes her thought processes were completely different and it feels like another person was in her head. 

About a week ago she switched medications to Depakote. Since she started, she's been acting like the other version of herself all the time.

I've been to psychiatrists before and I know it's just trial and error to find the right medication. I don't see why I need to see a psychiatrist when I can just try a low dose of this Zoloft I have a huge supply of. I'll go to a psychiatrist if it doesn't work.

44,"I spend 2 months in a ward, and was diagnosed with 2 comorbid PD's. Naturally friends and family were curious about results, so I ended up telling some of them. 

What surprised me is that some of my friends seemed envious, and straight up wished they had a personality disorder too. Since my time in a ward my view on mental health changed a lot, and I saw how a sufficiently horrible environment can influence your personality and mental well being. Confused about the gap between the rather miserable reality of having a PD and the outside appeal of having one, I am asking you wise people.

49,"This is the first time I’ve actually vocalised any of these thoughts so I may ramble on a bit. Over the past 6 months or so I’ve been feeling my mental state decline. This includes a lot of things from my outlook on life to my memory. 

I can’t pinpoint an exact event or moment where this began but now I feel it’s at an alarming point. I no longer have any enthusiasm for anything and severely struggle to stick to any sort of routine, this is starting to affect my studies (third year university). I’m unsure how to word this, but I feel I’ve lost all sense of myself. This is due to the fact my mind is the least active it’s ever been, and in turn my memory is the worst it’s ever been to the point I feel I’ve forgotten who I am or what I stand for. My social ability has declined to almost nothing, even 6 months ago I was a bubbly, outgoing person who always had something to say. Most of the time these days I’m socially inept, i never really have anything to say to anyone, mainly because I’m so unsure of myself. But by far the worst change in my behaviour is that I never really follow anything that’s going on, wether that’s in a lecture or just in a group conversation. I zone out far too easily and have no idea what’s being discussed. I could use the metaphor of a plastic bag in the wind, it’s going along but has no idea what it’s doing or why it’s there, it’s just moving. Again this was never the case with me before, in school I was a straight A student and the class clown. 

There’s absolutely no structure to any of this but I felt it’s about time I say something. Because I haven’t vocalised it I’ve never really considered that I may be suffering from something. Any comments or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",29Jan2018,4
50,"I have been suffering from mental illness from a very young age, at least 6 yo. Only had my depression and anxiety professionally confirmed at the age of 15, went through the gamut of antidepressants ""acceptable"" for minors, ended up abusing the xanax I was given; started abusing painkillers because of how disinhibited xanax had me (not to mention self-medicating for various physically painful issues doctors would essentially shrug at), stole drugs etc. etc. stayed for a week in mental hospital when this drug abuse led to an overdose/ my only suicide attempt.

Fast forward a bit, medical marijuana essentially saved me from a downward spiral of painkiller abuse/possible death. It was also very helpful in reducing cravings for benzodiazepines. (IMPORTANT NOTE: marijuana is not right for everyone, I live in a medical state that recently legalized and had the support of my mental health practitioners in using it!) Had some slip ups with the pills but nothing I wasn't able to recover from. Currently my physical health is okay enough to manage without cannabis, but I still struggle with pain and the road to recovery will be long; possibly my whole life. This is something I have more or less come to terms with.

Now an adult, ostensibly, still trying to build a life and it's a slow process but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't improved immensely from my teen years. However, I still have suicidal ideation almost daily. I have some hope with my current mix of medication (sertraline/bupropion/low dose lithium) Bupropion seems to help somewhat help with motivation, and somewhat mediates the notorious SSRI/SNRI sexual dysfunction. I thought perhaps the lithium would make the sertraline unnecessary, although I quickly learned that stepping down in dose was a huge mistake when invasive thoughts came back and hit me like a palette of bricks. I don't regret learning this though, if only psychiatry didn't involve so much trial and error! (Hang in there anyone who feels like they've tried everything, and make sure you talk to your doctors/therapists about how things effect you, and make sure they LISTEN!) The nature and frequency of these invasive thoughts (and a few tics) has me suspecting I fall somewhere on the OCD spectrum, but I'm trying very hard not to feed any hypochondriac tendencies and this is another conversation I need to have with  my healthcare professionals.

I have tried almost every type of psychiatric drug, supplement, and various types of therapy. The ones I took the longest were, unfortunately, usually the ones that that gave me the most problems. For example, venlafaxine had me convinced it was helping but was putting me into depersonalized/near dissociative states which my psychiatrist didn't believe me about, and the excessive sweating did WAAAY more to increase my anxiety than the drug did to help it. I still don't know what to think about lamotrigine, people who swear by it often seem to doubt it does anything at all. Buspirone never offered me any kind of consistent benefit, did not seem to have any correlation with dose/effect; beyond the terrifying chest pains from an accidental overdose.
I have been offered anti-psychotic mood stabilizers multiple times, but I have a couple problems with these; chiefly the high frequency and nature of the side effects. Weight gain is kind of not acceptable; new or worsening heart problems, muscle/movement disorders, and the possibility of them causing hallucinations are all absolutely unacceptable for me. I have known too many people who had terrible experiences with these drugs. The only people I have ever heard of benefitting from these long-term are people with legitimate psychoses/schizophrenia.
Of course, I have taken plenty of drugs that had some kind of risk (deadly rashes, anyone?)

I feel that psychiatrists might have been leaning toward bipolar 2 for me, but I really doubt it. The only times I've experienced something approaching hypomania were definitely because of drugs, prescribed or otherwise.

I feel that the lithium has slightly reduced the suicidal ideation. Could easily be a placebo, but why look a gift-placebo in the mouth if it's doing good, right? I am reluctant to take bi-polar doses but in the future, who knows. 

There are plenty of other things I've taken but this is kind of rambling, so to the point: Everyday is still very much a battle, the danger of the modestly helping meds suddenly not working seems to loom on the horizon, and I don't want the suicidal ideation to wear me down.

Is electroconvulsive therapy worth it? Is the memory loss an acceptable risk? Can it be attenuated, beyond just using the one hemisphere at time method? It has a very troublesome past but after all I've been through I feel the need to consider everything. Sorry if TL;DR but this is a big choice to make.",29Jan2018,3
56,"I'm 22, male and diagnosed with Schizotypal personality disorder. Originally this post was a part of a longer comment [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7ttwe1/what_is_an_unfair_aspect_of_society_that_doesnt/dtf9ifr/) but because the comment got way too long and started to trail off topic I decided to split it in two and post the rest here.

I was a violent kid. Explosive temper, scratching, biting, hitting, it never ended. Luckily my parents found a way for me to vent my anger before I hurt anyone seriously. I was given my own private space that no one was allowed to enter if I was in it (it was a closet under the stairs, classic). In that space were several stuffed animals that I have ripped to shreds, pillows and a mattress because sometimes I yelled so loud and long I nearly passed out from the lack of oxygen, and then there was a notebook. My own private notebook that no one else was allowed to see. I had the permission to draw and write absolutely anything in that notebook. Any time violent thoughts flooded my brain I went into that closet, abused the stuffed animals and then drew in my notebook. The pictures were extremely disturbing. Decapitations, torture, guts ripped out, people torn in half, people on fire, limbs getting ripped off, all kinds of horrifying shit with a surprising amount of detail considering I was about 5 years old.

The notebook method worked, and by the time I started school I was able to contain my violence. It was all in my head. There were a few instances where I got in trouble at school for violence, but they were all because a bully had pushed me too far; I once kneed this one asshole in the balls 3 times in a row because he had his friends hold my arms while he slapped me around and tried to spit on my face (the loser spat on his own shirt instead). I lost it and somehow ripped myself free from his friends who were both taller and bigger than me. I remember seeing nothing but red and hearing the bully start to cry from the pain. This incident gave me a bad reputation as a weirdo, someone insane (they were right, I was insane, but you know how cruel kids can be). Kids started to avoid me. No one wanted to have anything to do with me. With time the bullying got worse and worse since I never acted out again, I just let it happen. It took 5 years for me to lay my hand on another person again.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. I had my head filled with nightmarish thoughts almost 24/7. All the images of torture, cruelty and gore were still in my head. Imagine seeing someone's face every day and wanting nothing more than to rip his eyeballs out but you know you can't do that. You know you have to contain yourself, that you can't do anything about the rage. I was once so angry, so full of rage that I couldn't calm down until I hit a brick chimney until my knuckles bled. I still have the scar from that to this day. The only thing that could reliably calm me down was household pets. I wanted nothing more than to have a dog to keep me company, to be the friend I never had, but my parents refused to get any pets. Not even a cat, even though they largely take care of themselves. I wanted to kill both of them so bad. I had fantasies about kidnapping people from my school, my parents, anyone that pissed me off and torturing them until they begged for forgivness. This was the darkest time of my life.

What calmed me down? Getting a diagnosis. When I got diagnosed my parents finally understood and didn't treat me poorly anymore. That helped a little bit. Moving away from home, alcohol and cannabis have mellowed me an incredible amount. The violence is still in my head and it will be there forever, but it isn't a daily struggle anymore. What used to be rage near breaking point has turned into a morbid and very dark sense of humour. What used to be fantasies of torture has turned into a morbid fascination with death. I don't want to hurt anyone, but violence will always be an integral part of my thought process. I still think about death, pain and violence every day, but it's no longer me who commits those acts in my thoughts. It's always someone else. I no longer fantasize about causing death and destruction, I'm merely fascinated by it.

That's how I turned into this fucked up person I am, by being much much worse as a kid.",29Jan2018,4

59,"So one of my good friends went through a serious alcoholic drinking binge last summer. I was living in another area during this time but he was completely out of it when I would talk to him. Crying and saying he was talking to dead people and many things, but I thought it was the alcohol. And there was something that he said he wanted to tell me but would only do it in person, not on the phone.

At some point, he decided and immediately moved from SF to LA. And then quickly to Arizona. And then to Texas. And then to New Mexico. And now is going back to Arizona. He's been changing his phone number constantly during this time.

Last night he finally told me what is going on. First off he's completely sober now. He thinks the cartel is watching him, or maybe the government. And they are following him and listening to his phone calls. And he can recognize them by just looking at them, and this puts him in extreme danger. He has been extremely concerned about me and my wellbeing, but I've told him that I am safe and fine. He even recommended that I potentially get a gun to protect myself, but I know he doesn't have one. He says over and over ""maybe I'm just paranoid"" but I can tell that he doesn't believe that.

Anyway, I just want to support my friend. I love this guy and can tell he is really scared. I haven't told him that his ideas sound like they aren't true. I know everything he is going through is real for him, but I also know he isn't being watched by the cartel.

63,"Hello everyone, I’d like to apologize for the length of this post, but there’s a lot of information to cover and without some of it, the post wouldn’t make much sense.

Today I’ll be sharing my story and asking for some pointers, because the events that have transpired in my life the past couple years have sent me into quite a tailspin.

I’m 20 years old, two time college dropout, with almost 0 life experience. In other words, I don’t know how to adult.

Here’s a little information to help anyone who reads understand the dynamic in my family, specifically between me and my father. For starters, my father and I have never had a good relationship. He has always been a very distant man, and doesn’t do a very good job building or maintaining healthy relationships. He’s an avid self-blamer who sometimes sends himself on crazy alcohol fueled guilt trips but never tries to solve the problem he’s feeling guilt over. 

Basically, he’s just a lone wolf who’s never been a great people person, and it shows in his life. He’s almost 60 and has no friends left because he wronged them all, he used to sell and use a number of drugs, you get the picture. Something to note as well, he has never been physically abusive to me or my mother, but verbal abuse was and still is a regular occurrence.

Above all though, my dad is a control freak. He has a certain way to do everything, gets upset when it isn’t done the way he wants it done, and then gets mad when nobody wants to help him because all he does is critique and *pick* at people until he gets what he wants. To give you an example, I once filled up a Brita filter from the sink incorrectly, and was made to empty it and put it on the counter until the almighty Dad could fill it up the *right* way.

With my dad being the way that he is, I clung to my mother for the majority of my childhood. She was my “protector” so to speak, and would intervene whenever Dad was being an ass. As a result, my mom became my best friend, and I was very much a  proud “momma’s boy.” In fact, there are no words to describe how close we were. Anyone with a great mom will understand!

This dynamic was very unhealthy as my mom often found herself quite literally in the middle of my father and I, trying to defuse our differences. I wanted my dad gone, and whenever my mom wasn’t home, the thought of even walking past a room he was sat in scared the shit out of me. “What was he gonna say? What did I do wrong? What isn’t good enough this time?”

So I grew into adolescence developing an arguably unhealthy attachment to my mother and a bitter hatred toward my father. And at the end of that adolescence, the year I turned 18, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

I still remember in vivid detail everything that happened the day of the diagnosis, it was one of the only moments my dad and I completely said “fuck our differences” and hugged it out crying in the hall of the hospital. 

After the diagnosis, my dad and I inexplicably switched personalities, and I still can’t figure out why I acted this way to this day, but while he jumped onto the caregiver role without a second thought and started waiting on my mom hand and foot despite all the years of dysfunction, I curled up down in the basement, smoked copious amounts of weed, and drank a shit ton of liquor. My daily routine was waking up, getting high as a kite until about 1 o clock, and finishing almost a liter of Jagermeister every single night for almost a year. By that time, the cancer had progressed to the terminal stage. It was in my mom’s brain, liver, and lymph nodes.

I was terrified, I really didn’t know how to process my mom’s diagnosis, and I wanted to help her be comfortable and feel better, but I’m still just a kid, and trying to balance preparing for the worst and hoping for the best just became a big gray blobby area of my consciousness. 

Toward the end of my mom’s life, her brother drove down from Michigan to visit and say his goodbyes. He stayed with us for almost a month, and much like myself, he and my dad did NOT get along at all.

This is where my dad starts to turn psychotic.

My dad had fucked up so many years with my mom without a second thought, and right as the diagnosis came he was trying to patch things up to repair his own guilt about everything. I think the reason he became so eager to help all of a sudden was to ease his own feelings of guilt and finally see himself as the good guy, sorta tying up loose ends and whatnot. This amazing act of kindness and dedication turned into a selfish battle to keep my mom alive and in pain. 

Back to my mom’s brother. When he arrived about a month before my mother died, he knew what was happening and he knew that she was going to die. And so he started working with the medical staff to find the best way to keep her comfortable on her way out, and eventually they just decided to up the dosage of pain meds she was getting in order to keep her from squirming around in the bed and getting agitated. 

I thought this was great, because once the cancer progressed past a certain point, my mom became a different person. I really think she died before she actually died, you know? She was very upset, couldn’t articulate any words, and whenever she woke up, she’d try to get out of the bed every single time, and she’d get so mad when we had to put her back in. She had many accidents and needed cleaning, it was a very traumatic thing to watch your own mother go through.

My dad then became hysterical and started to believe that the medicine was what was causing her condition to plummet. He got in several verbal altercations with the nurse, started knocking things over when they said they weren’t going to just cut her meds, and ended up getting the cops called on him and faced the possibility of not being with his wife as she died.

This led to my dad becoming increasingly aggressive toward my mom’s brother, and eventually it got so bad that he went back to Michigan, fearing for his own safety. He did not get to see his sister out of this world because of my selfish fucking father. 

My mother died in pain, and I was holding her hand as she left this world. It sits somberly with me, and I’m not convinced I don’t have PTSD because sometimes when I close my eyes I see her helpless face, jaundiced and scared, looking up at the ceiling of the hospice facility. 

It’s been a year since I lost her, and I still live with my dad, who sulks around the house to this day. If you looked at him the day after he lost his wife, and then looked at him today, you’d notice no difference. He’s a lonely, sad, shell of a man who still lives with guilt. We don’t talk much and our lives are very separated even though we live under the same roof.

Today I was thinking about everything and I’m starting to realize that I’ve never allowed myself to fully grieve and process everything that’s happened. I can’t make myself cry, I can’t make myself focus on the subject, it’s like my brain took all of this and locked it away somewhere. I almost feel as though none of it happened, even though my mom isn’t here, like it was all a Dream. I have no idea how to go about dissecting this because it’s like a 100 pound weight I carry on my shoulders every day.

I miss my mom, my dad is still a controlling asshole, and I don’t know what to do.

64,"I have recently been sent back home from university due to being in an extremely depressive sate. It is best to begin back when I returned to university after Christmas. For the first day or two I was fine. After I went into a highly anxious and self-loathing sate that had daily up and down periods. Though it was mostly down I had moments where my mental state was fine and confident. This continued for a bit over a week. 

This ended when I had to return home for a few days were my mental state changed to being more confident. However, this changed again when I went back first I was felling supremely confident for a few hours. My mental state then again changed to feeling extremely depressed and not wanting to do anything at all and wanting to go home.

At this point I went to the university's mental health team and at the time linked my current mental state and the one I had been in before I went home together and said I was felling homesick and depressed. After this my mood picked back up again and I felt in a reasonably normal mood. The depressive mood though returned the next day and the university mental health team set me home for the weekend.

Over the weekend the depressive mood continued. I spend the weekend barely talking and interacting with people and mental regressed in age and being slightly clingy.

I had still at this time attributed all of this with homesickness and ignored the anomalies. However, events today have made me reconsider this. Today I started of the day as I had previously feeling extremely depressed. By the evening thought this had worn off and my mood had gone to being anxious and worried about my future and what was going to happen and coming up with unrealistic bad scenarios. This mood though quickly wore off in a few hours. Now I am feeling confident and energetic.

Sorry for the wall of text. As the post title says can anyone tell me what is going on or really if it is what I think it is. Also, another thing of note in each of these different moods I find it hard to remember what it felt like in the other moods and my memory of it feels distant and disconnected.

Edit: In fact right now it feels like I have just drunk ten espresso shots and this morning I was pretty much the complete opposite of that.

Edit 2: Okay it has gone way beyond espresso to felling like I am drunk or high on something now. ",29Jan2018,2
65,"Hi friends,

I hope this kind of post is allowed - I think it is within the rules but I am relatively new to this sub. 

More so lately I have had abusive and cruel thoughts, and fantasies. I would never want someone mistreated at all in reality, but I have imagined some upsetting things. I realize we are all human and have animistic urges, but I feel disappointed and saddened by my own daydreams. It has honestly left me feeling like slightly worse of a person. It's all fiction but in a way I feel like I have let down not only myself but people whom I love and admire. It is definitely a low point in my life so far. 

Anyway, I'm not sure what I am looking for exactly. Any suggestions or comments you have would be welcomed. I have been dragging my feet in considering different options for professional help, but it feels like I should get serious about that. I think I am not taking care of myself as well as I should.

Thank you for listening. ",29Jan2018,2
66,"How do you manage your mental health with the current news cycle without completely hiding your heads in the sand?

I had an evening of fairly bad suicidality and then I wake up to a slew of articles on nuclear war likelihoods, LGBT murder rates, and general mortality rates and it doesn't make it easier to try to hold on. Everyone around me is just like ""yeah we gone die"" so it's not like putting down the newspaper will improve this. It's like being trapped in a particularly heavy handed French existentialist play about being at the threshold of death without crossing it. ",29Jan2018,2
67,"He is 21, goes to university for IT and i see him on the weekend. We have been together for 4 years but recently he developed some sort of anxiety. I am not quite sure how i should describe it: sometimes he stares at the wall, then his facial expression changes and if i ask him about it he breaks down and cries. He said, he just worries about everything and doesnt know why. In the past he had aggression issues if this is relevant. I support him and we talk about it a lot, most times i hug him and tell him that i love him, he is going to see a doctor soon but i just feel so helpless. Does anybody know what else i could do?",29Jan2018,2
70,"Asking for a friend:
Usually a calm, happy, enthusiastic person. But when they get hungry, they get extremely angry and irritated. They begin to get irrational thoughts and self-describe as ""my life feels like shit"" and feel hopeless. They describe these incidents as traumatic. They don't want to be around people or do anything. This happens when even mildly not eating enough- like after 2-3 hours after a meal. What could this be?",29Jan2018,1
72,"I have many things on my mind so I put them in one post, I hope it's not a problem.

1. I feel great pressure on my chest and have problems breathing. It's as if somebody put a brick or two on my chest.
2. I'm feeling OK for some time and then, at any time, I start feeling like lying down and doing nothing because everything feels pointless.
3. I feel like I can never be myself. Nearly whatever I do I feel like I'm not doing of my free will. I only feel like myself when I'm depressed.
4. I have problems describing/understanding emotions. E.g. When somebody asks me how am I feeling I can't answer because I don't know how am I feeling; so I just say ""fine"".

I'd be glad if you could help me with these ""problems"".

I'm sorry if this post bothered anyone. ",29Jan2018,2
73,"Hello! My name's Anna. I am writing this because I am very worried about my mental statate. About two years ago I started college but had to stop for a while on my eleventh mouth, because I started having auditory hallucinations, that, acording to my psychologist were caused by stress. After that I tried to keep studying normally but the hallucinations kept getting worse so I locked my course to get treatment. I've stayed a lot of time at home, not leaving a single time for two months until the hallucinations stopped, and when they did I  started going to the gym more often, picked up a hobby, travelled, and tried to do everything to be 100% good so I could go back to studying. Now I finally feel okay but I am really worried not only about the hallucinations, but also about some mood swings I've been having for a while. Some weeks I am extroverted but needy, very positive, very motivated, and really happy and energetic. Other weeks I feel like utter shit, like nothing matters and just stay in bed all day long, I also become completely anti social and shut in not talking to people for days. This has been going on for a while and sometimes I abstain for doing things I like because of it. Could this be something like bipolar disorder?",29Jan2018,2
74,"Looking through old emails, and I can see the jacket I was wearing.  I liked ~~some~~ a lot of the things I said, those were my true interests and thoughts.  I just wanted someone to listen.  I can see the persona though, I can see the air of look how innocent and great and quirky, and smart I am.  I could see it.  I could see it and I can see it now.  I'm trying to tear it off, and I'm trying to be myself, and I wonder if I'm doing it right now.  I think I am. Perhaps, when all thought ceases, I'll know who I am.  I think I care. I think I care about you.

Do we all carry around personas that change from situation to situation to suit our needs? I know I'm wearing one as I write that question.  The ones I hope are listening, aren't. They are the phantoms in my mind.

On an unrelated note I went to a bar a week or two ago where I usually catch metal / punk shows... they had a SNES/Genesis/NES set up I was playing it, some weird dude comes up to me and starts talking to me.  I didn't mind the conversation, but he began to spit as he talked. He spat and it was in my face.  Douchebag.  I didn't deserve that.  ",29Jan2018,1
76,"Hi all,

For anyone here who is knowledgeable about Freud/psychology, I have a question for you about a personal issue of mine. 

There have been times in the past where, when I perceive myself as having ""done something wrong"", so to speak, my body will feel... almost... paralyzed, if that makes sense. I feel almost emotionally hurt/injured first, and unnaturally tense in a way that can't be easily described, as if my brain has almost ""shut down"" my nervous system; it sounds extreme but that's exactly what appears to be happening... This ""bad thing"" could be something as simple as, for example, buying a drink at a bar but being slightly short on cash, or someone ""telling me off"", just some minor thing like that. This feeling is also occasionally accompanied by intense anger. Weird huh.

I started reading about Freud's theory on the id, ego, and superego. Supposedly, the superego is the part of the psyche which controls moral/social principles, and in individual who have an overdeveloped superego (i.e. me; I've been diagnosed with ""mild ""OCPD before), this controls most of their psyche. When a certain 'strict' moral principle is violated, the superego punishes the person with shame or guilt, however, in some cases it might punish them with psychosomatic symptoms, like the one I described earlier. 

With all that said, am I right in my assumption that this may be the case with me? It's really starting to get me down and I don't know if therapy would help with this. Could it be something else? Does anyone here relate to this bizarre issue that I have?",29Jan2018,1
77,But I just want to fall in love again..or infatuation or limerence or whatever the mix of it all is..I'm not in the mood to deconstruct love or talk about the politics right now..I want to stare into her eyes in ecstatic nothingness and tell her she has gypsy eyes as in the Jimmy Hendrix song or wherever I got that from. ,29Jan2018,2
