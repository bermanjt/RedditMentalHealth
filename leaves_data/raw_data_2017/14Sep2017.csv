713,"We are VyprVPN, a VPN provider dedicated to a free and open Internet, and Greatfire.org, a non-profit that helps Chinese Internet users circumvent censorship and restrictions imposed by China’s Great Firewall.
 
Internet freedom has been under assault around the world for quite some time, and this year we’ve seen China escalate its censorship practices by implementing new regulations and requiring Apple to remove VPN applications, news applications, and other content from their app stores. While China has long controlled what its citizens can access online, the latest events are a clear attempt to intensify their efforts. Recent events become all the more concerning, because major companies such as Apple are participating in censorship by complying with China's demands.
 
We recognize doing business in China requires editorial control by the government and compliance with local regulations. However, this fact does not excuse actions any company takes to embolden China's authoritarian efforts. To say we're concerned about Apple's recent actions would be an understatement. In response, we wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook in which we ask for more transparency into his company’s dealing with China, to enable Internet users to better understand regulations and how Apple's compliance decisions impact their Internet experience.
 
All individuals around the world should be afforded the right to a free and open Internet, and the ability to fight for that right if and when it's threatened. But we cannot fight what we cannot see. Join us in asking Apple for more transparency into practices in China, and in upholding the right of a free and open Internet for all. Ask me anything!
