692,"We’re Will FitzGibbon, Scilla Alecci, Emilia Diaz-Struck and Amy Wilson-Chapman from ICIJ - the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists -who worked on the Paradise Papers investigation!
 
 
Hopefully you’ve heard of our latest project, the [Paradise Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/), which was an investigation that explored 13.4 million leaked files from a combination of offshore service providers. We worked with more than 380 journalists on the project and stories are still being published across the globe. Our reporting revealed the interest and activities of more than 120 politicians and world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II and 13 allies of U.S. President Donald Trump. We also exposed the latest tax maneuvers of some of the world’s largest corporations - such as Apple and Nike.
 
 
There will be a few of us answering your questions! While we’re all based in Washington, D.C. we all hail from different countries. We’ve listed Amy here, but she’s pretty new to the team so will be the least active of us all!

While we will try our best to answer **all** your questions, we often get asked very specific questions relating to our research and what we found in our data. We’d love to answer all of these questions, ICIJ is a small team and we just couldn’t search the data for every single person from every country in the world! So don’t take it personally. We make a lot of our data available for searching - so that we can give you the power to find out what people in your home countries are up to.
 

**UPDATE** We're gunna take off now! We might duck back in and answer questions if you want to leave them... but we can't guarantee anything!! Thanks for all the questions and being so great!

If you want to know when we launch our next project, or keep up with our latest news - sign up to our [email list] (https://www.icij.org/signup/)! You can also follow us on all the usual places (@ICIJORG).

And don't forget, ICIJ is *fully* funded by donations. Without our supporters, these stories would never get told. If you'd like to support us financially you can donate [online] (https://www.icij.org/donate/) using a variety of methods!
 
We really enjoyed answering your questions! Thanks so much!
 
 
Amy, Scilla, Will, and Emi.
