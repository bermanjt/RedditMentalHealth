920,"Hello, I'm Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield and I've been reporting on North Korea for more than a decade. I've been to North Korea a dozen times, and even managed to do [a Facebook Live video](https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/videos/10153793753594565/) from my hotel room in Pyongyang. 

You might remember me [from my last AMA here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6t3tey/i_am_anna_fifield_north_korea_reporter_for_the/ ), which I really enjoyed, so I’m back for more.

Most recently, [I spent six months interviewing 25 North Korean refugees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/north-korea-defectors/?tid=sm_rd) who managed to flee Kim Jong Un’s regime. The refugees I spoke to painted a picture of  brutal punishments, constant surveillance and disillusionment.

My focus is writing about life inside North Korea. Life in North Korea is changing and so are people’s reasons for escaping. When Kim Jong Un became leader, many North Koreans thought that life would improve. But after six years in power, the ""Great Successor"" has proved to be just as brutal as past leaders.

I’m obsessed with North Korea! So go ahead, ask me anything. I’ll be ready to go at 5 p.m. ET.

Talk soon,
