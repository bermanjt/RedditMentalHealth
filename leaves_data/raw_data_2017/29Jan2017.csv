831,"On January 27, 2017, US President Donald Trump signed the [""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_the_Nation_from_Foreign_Terrorist_Entry_into_the_United_States) Executive Order, the most prominent provision of which involves blocking entry for citizens of Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Yemen for 90 days.  The Order has led to international responses by various world leaders, as well as complications and consequences for international citizens seeking entry to the United States.
