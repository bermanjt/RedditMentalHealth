Promoters have abruptly canceled Sound Relief 2020, a concert fundraiser aimed at contributing to Australian bushfire relief efforts.

The benefit series, which [**was slated to take place over two weekends in March**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/sound-relief-australia-benefit-concert/), became a joint effort from promoters like IMC, Chugg Entertainment, Secret Sounds, Frontier Touring and Live Nation. However, organizers will no longer see the project through.

“Since announcing our intention to undertake Sound Relief 2020 the offer of assistance from International and Domestic artists, industry, media and suppliers has been second to none,” organizers wrote in a [**statement**](https://www.facebook.com/soundreliefau/photos/a.10157063056888250/10157119383473250/?type=3). “However Sound Relief is a series of concert events that we don’t wish to stage lightly and after careful consideration, we believe proceeding with the concerts[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/planned-bushfire-relief-concerts-canceled-by-promoters/)",31Jan2020,1
1088,"I’m Alasdair Sandford, a journalist with Euronews where I write for its digital output, and appear on-screen as a reporter, analyst and presenter for Euronews World and its programmes Good Morning Europe, Euronews Now and Euronews Tonight.
 
I’m a UK and now also a French citizen, having lived in France for 20 years, and speak French fluently. I’ve been working for Euronews at our base in Lyon since 2010.
 
I cover a wide range of international affairs – but for the past few years I’ve closely followed Brexit and the rollercoaster ride since the UK’s EU referendum in 2016.
 
Three and a half years later the UK is finally leaving the European entity it joined nearly half a century ago. Little will change in practice for now, but it’s a hugely symbolic moment: the first time the EU has lost a member, and for the UK a major step into the unknown.
 
Like many people I’ve been alternately gripped, amazed, shocked, occasionally bored and more often baffled by the saga’s endless twists and turns. And we can be sure there’s plenty more to come! The UK and the EU will soon embark on a race to determine their future relationship.
 
Ultimately this is about people’s lives and livelihoods. I add to Euronews’ regular coverage with the latest developments and by trying to [explain the issues](https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/01/brexit-draft-deal-first-of-many-hurdles-to-a-smooth-exit) and the impact the rule changes will have.
 
I particularly enjoyed exploring the historical background to the divorce – which I turned into [a series based on song titles](https://www.euronews.com/2016/06/23/the-uk-and-the-eu-part-1-je-t-aime-moi-non-plus). 
 
Covering it all is a major challenge as a journalist, a former European law student – and also from a personal point of view, given my attachment to both sides of the English Channel. After all, Brexit affects me!
 
I look forward to trying to answer every question you might have. AMA on Brexit Day, what the divorce deal means, what happens next, the UK’s relationship with Europe… or anything you might ask yourself about Brexit!
