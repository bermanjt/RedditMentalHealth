878,"As of February 17 at 10:43 a.m. EST, there were 71,902 confirmed coronavirus cases across 29 countries, and 1,775 deaths attributed to the illness. The majority of the confirmed cases, and all but five of the deaths, have been in mainland China. We only have 15 cases in the United States, 13 of which are travel, two of which are spouses of the travelers. As of Monday morning, we now have 14 additional cases, because people were flown in from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. One U.S. citizen diagnosed with the coronavirus has died in Wuhan.
 
The potency and movement of the virus has rallied the international cooperation of various agencies and governments. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" followed a day later by the United States’ own declaration.
 
At stake in the outbreak is not only the health of thousands of people but also significant parts of the world economy, including trade, manufacturing, travel and tourism.

989,"How do you handle those students who never come to class but still hand things in? It's like they feel personally exempt from attending (which is fine, I suppose). If they never show and never give me grief, I just grade the work and move on. But, sometimes they email me repeatedly and ask for accommodations of one sort or another, offering all sorts of reasons and excuses. Then, when the work is subpar and piss-poor, they bitch and whine when they fail. At this point, I usually pull out attendance records and explain the slight possibility that attendance might promote learning and success. All this without sarcasm. Yet, they persist.

I have an attendance grade, for which they seem happy to receive zero.",18Feb2020,1
