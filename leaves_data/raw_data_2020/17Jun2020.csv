453," Melt-blown cloth is an important material for the production of medical surgical mask and N95 mask, is the ""heart layer"" of the mask. It has good filtration, barrier, heat preservation and adsorption, and is an important raw material for the production of face masks. One ton of melt-blown special material can produce about 1 million disposable medical masks.

 According to the survey, because China is not a big producer of melt-blown cloth, except for several large leading enterprises, most of them are small and medium-sized enterprises with limited production capacity. Coupled with the resumption of a large number of mask production enterprises, as well as clothing, automotive and other enterprises to switch to the production of masks, which leads to melt-blown cloth as the core raw material ""difficult to obtain."" 

Melt blown cloth, commonly known as the ""heart"" of the mask, is the filter layer in the middle of the mask, which can filter particles and bacteria in the air and prevent the spread of germs. Melt blown cloth is a kind of film made of polypropylene with high melt index and composed of many crisscross fibers stacked in random directions. the diameter of the fiber ranges from 0.5 to 10 microns, and the diameter of the fiber is about 1/30 of that of the hair. Melt blown cloth equipment Melt blown cloth mainly uses polypropylene as the main raw material, the fiber diameter can reach 1 to 5 microns. With many voids, fluffy structure and good anti-wrinkle ability, these ultra-fine fibers with unique capillary structure increase the number and surface area of fibers per unit area, so that the melt-blown cloth has good filtration, shielding, thermal insulation and oil absorption.

 In order to facilitate mask manufacturers to purchase melt-blown cloth, here is a list of Guangdong Province to make meltblown cloth, mask production enterprises contact information, hoping to bring help to you. Email: [karenshi516@gmail.com](mailto:karenshi516@gmail.com)  wechat: 19128681413
