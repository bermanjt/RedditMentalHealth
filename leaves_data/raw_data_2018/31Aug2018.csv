998,"Hello. I’m a London-based foreign correspondent for USA TODAY. I have worked for USA TODAY for five years and recently returned to London after two years in Berlin. I report on a broad range of foreign affairs-related topics, with an emphasis on making comparisons to U.S. policy and experience. In Europe, I have covered refugee crises, immigration, terrorism, the lingering impact of disasters, Russia-related topics, the conflict in Ukraine and, above all, the extraordinary stories and experiences of ordinary people. It took me almost two years to get a visa to Iran. Before reporting the stories for our series [INSIDE IRAN](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/world/inside-iran/2018/08/29/iran-trump-reimposes-sanctions-tensions-countries-enemies-nuclear-deal/886692002/) I had never traveled to the country.
