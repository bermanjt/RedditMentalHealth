899,"Hello, my name is Isobel Yeung. I'm a reporter for the Emmy award-winning show VICE on HBO. We make documentaries from all over the world, on whatever topics that tickle our fancy. I do a lot of reports on conflict and crisis from across the Middle East and beyond. 

One region I continue to report on and that I'm pretty obsessed with is Syria. Last year, I visited [regime-held Syria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESWCzPy7SgQ) and a few months ago I went to the one-time Islamic State caliphate of Raqqa. You can see our report [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJCLrmTLE8) 

In these documentaries, we try to tell human stories of those living through this new reality. The war that has ravaged Syria has enormous global ramifications and is a truly heartbreaking story to tell. 

I'll be here at 2:00 PM EDT to answer all of your questions. Looking forward to it.
