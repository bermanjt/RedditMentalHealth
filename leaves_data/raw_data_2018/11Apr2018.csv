623,"Hi, I’m Juliana Liu, senior editor at the newly launched [Inkstone](https://www.inkstonenews.com/), an English-language daily digest and news platform covering China. I believe that covering US-China relations is now more critical than ever, and I’m hoping that Inkstone can help others to better understand what’s going on in China and why it matters. I was born in China and brought up in the US (Texas and New York) and attended Stanford before starting my career at Reuters where I initially covered the Sri Lankan civil war. Eventually, I became one of their Beijing correspondents covering stories in China. My Reuters experience led me to Hong Kong as a correspondent for the BBC, reporting for television, radio and online. Before became an editor of Inkstone, I was known for being the most pregnant person to cover a major breaking story; this was during the 2014 Occupy Central protests, where my unborn child and I were tear gassed. So, ask me anything!

769,"President Trump lashed out Wednesday at the “never ending and corrupt” investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, and decried the “unthinkable” raid to seize documents from his personal lawyer.

Taking to Twitter before 7 a.m., Trump also took issue with widespread media reports of chaos gripping the White House, asserting that the atmosphere is “very calm and calculated.”

The tweets come as Trump has been fuming about the latest developments in the probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whom press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted on Tuesday Trump has the power to fire.
Trump’s morning tweets did not give any clearer hints on his intentions regarding Mueller or others he has considered firing, including Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s probe.

But he took aim at both Mueller and Rosenstein as “conflicted” and attempting to overreach with their authority.

“Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!” Trump wrote.

In a blitz of earlier tweets, Trump said that his team is “doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus.”

Trump suggested that the Manhattan raid targeting his longtime lawyer Michael D. Cohen was the result of a special counsel investigation that he said has found no collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia.

“No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!” Trump wrote in the tweets.

Trump said in his tweets that he is focused on trade relations with China, an upcoming meeting with North Korea’s leader and “the vicious gas attack in Syria,” a reference to a suspected chemical attack over the weekend, blamed for the deaths of at least 49 people in the opposition-held town of Douma.

“So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House,” Trump wrote.

The White House has said it was keeping all options open for a possible response in Syria. But Trump suggested that a missile strike was likely.

“Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” the president tweeted. He also condemned Russia’s backing of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” Trump wrote.

Recent weeks have been an unusually tumultuous period of Trump’s presidency.

On Tuesday, the White House announced Trump was canceling a planned three-day trip to the Summit of the Americas in Peru, citing a need to remain in the United States to monitor the response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria.

In addition to managing that, Trump has been monitoring what he fears may be a migrant crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico. The president last week deployed National Guard troops to bolster security at the southern border.

In addition, the wide ranging Russian investigation has intensified, as have converging legal battles pertaining to Trump and his associates.

Legal controversies have monopolized much of the president’s attention in recent days. Trump has been consumed by the Cohen raids, fuming both publicly and privately.

Meanwhile, Trump has been undergoing a shake-up of his Cabinet and senior staff. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert became the latest to announce his departure on Tuesday. ",11Apr2018,23
