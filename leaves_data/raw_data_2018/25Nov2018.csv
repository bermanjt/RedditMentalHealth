We might get a hand from Amy (ICIJ’s Community Engagement Editor) who helps run ICIJ’s Reddit account too. Proof: https://twitter.com/amytheblue?lang=en

Our year long investigation looked at the harm caused by poorly tested medical devices and how these are marketed and sold across the world.

Our first stories were published today (icij.org/implantfiles) but we will continue to publish from now on. We also published the International Medical Device Database - the world’s only global database relating to medical devices.

We worked with more than 250 reporters in 36 countries. Our partners are planning to keep reporting in the days, weeks, and months.

So… what can we tell you? Ask us anything! :) ",25Nov2018,1
