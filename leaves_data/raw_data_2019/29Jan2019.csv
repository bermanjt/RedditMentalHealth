1002,"Hi r/worldnews! I'm Jason Rezaian, and I've served as Tehran bureau chief for the Washington Post and am now an opinion writer for the paper and contributor to CNN. I was convicted—but never sentenced—of espionage in a closed-door trial in Iran in 2015. I now live in Washington, DC, with my wife.

[In my book ""Prisoner,""](https://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Prison-Solitary-Confinement-High-Stakes-Extraordinary/dp/0062691570) I write about exhausting interrogations, a farcical trial, especially since my reporting in Iran was a mix of human interest stories and political analysis. I initially thought it was a misunderstanding, but I soon realize it was much more dire as it eventually became an 18-month prison term with impossibly high diplomatic stakes. [This post details my first few hours as I came to this realization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/their-job-is-to-scare-me-jason-rezaian-describes-first-terrifying-hours-inside-iranian-prison/2019/01/11/e536fff6-0fa2-11e9-8f0c-6f878a26288a_story.html?utm_term=.80913938d8a7&amp;tid=sm_rd). 

AMA starts at 3 p.m. ET, noon PST! Talk to you soon! Big thanks to the r/worldnews mods for helping us set this up!
