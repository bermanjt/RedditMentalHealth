We recently published the ""Dark Side of the Kremlin"" collection of 175 gigabytes of data that included hundreds of thousands of messages and files from Russian politicians, journalists, oligarchs, religious figures, and nationalists/terrorists in Ukraine, making years of efforts by different hacker groups available in one place.

Ask Me Anything relating to DDoSecrets, but keep in mind that I don't speak Russian, so my analysis of the archive was limited to verification.
