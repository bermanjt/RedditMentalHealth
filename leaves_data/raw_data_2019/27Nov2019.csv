Our community engagement editor, Amy, might also jump in and help!

We plan to be here for the next hour or so (until 2pm ET), but we'll let you know when we're done! We always try to answer all your questions,  but given the scale of our collaboration (we worked with 75 reporters in 14 countries) we can't always answer very specific questions... so please be kind! We'll do our best though!

If you have no idea what the China Cables is then you can find all our reporting [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations). We published the six documents at the heart of the investigation too – in their original language and in English!

We can't wait to answer all your questions on this very important topic.",27Nov2019,1
