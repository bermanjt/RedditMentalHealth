732,"Hello Reddit, Iâ€™m Nahlah Ayed a foreign correspondent based in London for CBC News, the news division of Canadaâ€™s public broadcaster. 

I have just returned from Mozambique, where I was covering the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai on the small south African country.  The official death toll in Mozambique now stands at nearly 600 and authorities have warned that number will climb as flood waters recede.  Cases of cholera have reached more than 1000 and climbing, as officials struggle to provide clean water to affected areas.  Three weeks after Cyclone Idai hit the city of Beira and swept across central Mozambique, near 140,000 people are displaced - either in schools, churches, or camps.

Here is one of my reports on Mozambiqueâ€™s unfolding catastrophe: https://youtu.be/qjaW4JcBq-w

I have covered major events around the world from the refugee crisis unfolding across Europe, to the displacement of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims, to the attacks in Paris, to the conflict in Ukraine and many other stories. I spent over a decade working in the Middle East reporting on numerous conflicts, every day life, and later, the Arab uprisings.

I also wrote a book on refugeehood, A Thousand Farewells, (https://www.cbc.ca/books/a-thousand-farewells-1.3984284) which explores the myriad of ways in which ordinary citizens of the Arab world have coped with conflict, oppression and loss.
