0,Im really struggling and running out of options.,"Im 19 and suffer with a long list of mental illnesses, im tired of having to do the same things everyday although I try new things, I feel numb, I try having relationships but they don't work  because I ruin them, but I cant handle the overbearing feeling of loneliness.

 I recently had an argument with my GF which I doubt has any chance of being fixed and now am really feeling that she's trying to turn all my friends against me, I feel like I cant trust anyone anymore not even those I feel closest too.

I hate living with all the stress I wake up too, I've seeked help, therapy, meditation, medication and none of them work. I want to believe things will be better but that hope is dwindling with everyday. I've been trying so hard to think about what makes me happy and me reasons for living but I dont have anything. But I cant kill myself no matter how hard I try to convince myself that its easier this way.

I need some new kind of help, a new kind of therapy or treatment cause I cant keep this going much longer.

Thank you so much if you read this, any help would be really appreciated."
1,I need as a matter of utmost importance to be able to speak to a psychologist and I don't know how to get one,"I am in the UK and under the NHS. I am 27M.

So, my head is a total mess. I don't know whether or not I may actually be insane or whether I've just uncovered truths which are true that I'm just unable to live with.

I have come to the conclusion that all romantic relationships are inherently selfish, and I cannot and do not feel happy or comfortable living or being with someone in a situation I therefore see as superficial and meaningless.

I need to speak to someone to prove me wrong. Or show me where I've gone wrong. I'm scientifically minded and I can't accept anything but facts, so all the advice of my friends and family just wash over me as it's just anecdotal and I can't trust it and in many cases see straight through their reasoning but don't say anything because I dont want to screw their head up as mine is.

But I beleive that no one quite understands me. I know from reading a lot about things to try and help heal myself etc that there is a well known psychological phenomenon whereby people subconsciously without even being aware of it, tend to ignore, overlook, or ""explain away"" anything which would cause them cognitive dissonance, or in other words, anything that would break their belief system and make them feel sh*tty. They will continue to do so until they are faced with hard, utterly unavoidable evidence. And then they will be forced to go through a kind of painful ego death and acceptance process. So where I am is that I think I'm that person who's gone through that process, and I can't bear the reality that's staring me in the face. And nobody can help me because they can't even see what I'm going on about, what I'm saying just gets subconsciously batted aside and redirected by the psychological shield that protects their ego.

For the last 7 years or so I've only spent time with friends and not relationships because of this belief. But I'm getting older now and I can't do that anymore because all my friends are settling down into relationships of their own. I feel I need to sort out my issue now, or alternatively stay alone, find more friends but ultimately only come of secondary importance to everybody else because they will always deem their family the priority and I won't have a family of my own.

I need to see a psychologist as a matter of urgency before my thoughts cause me complete destruction. I can't talk to any of my friends or family or councillors because they don't know what I'm on about, offering well meaning but fruitless support, or just getting frustrated at me because they don't get me. EVERY time I try to talk to anyone, I am left feeling WORSE than I did before. I keep trying because I am desperate but actually it's just making me worse so I should stop trying to talk to people and just pretend I'm alright because even though its damaging to bottle things up it's less damaging that what is currently happening to me by trying to talk and excarbaerting my issues and stress as well as everybody elses.

My parents are seriously concerned with me and my dad says I at times make him feel suicidal. My friends get frustrated with me. At least one other friend says talking to me makes him feel suicidal. I really ought NOT to talk to these people but please understand I'm desperate and don't know what else I'm supposed to do.

I keep going to my GP for asking to get a psychologist but I feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall because what will happen is she will refer me somewhere and then that place will either refer me back to her (I ring IAPT and they said go to my GP and I ring her and she sends me to IAPT) or the places I try and talk to try to offer me group sessions or counsellors who are well meaning but not medical ""shrinks"" or /psychologists/psychiatrists. I ring mental health talk likes and again their advice tends to make me feel worse not better. I honestly want a psychologist who understands deeply the human mind and I don't know how to get one because it just feels like I just get batted around the system like a pinball without ever getting anywhere, just getting referred in circles or persuaded I need antidepressants or to go to a group therapy or whatever until I give up trying.

Why is it like this.

What do I actually need to do to be heard because I will just do that.

Do I need to run down the street naked cuckooing?

Do I need to check myself into a mental hospital?

Do I need to go and stand on a bridge and say I will jump?

Why can I not just have my god damn psychologist who can understand me and help make me better?

What do I have to do I will do it..

P.S. I don't self harm, I never have and don't want to or see the point, and I don't want to commit suicide, it's the last thing I want to do and I will do everything I can possibly think of first but I am being quite honest I am getting quite exasperated and in the end I may be pushed to it even though I don't want to because living with my beliefs are hell, and I'm not going back on medication because theres nothing wrong in that aspect of me, I know for a fact once I have my answers and my help I will feel much better and I know antidepressants are not the answer and I do not need them, I've tried them I know. Any negative thoughts in my head are from logical places  and they only exist either because I'm too smart for my own good, because I am insane, or because I've just got something somewhere very wrong and I need to that identifying by a doctor.

Nothing will make me feel better except getting a psychologist and not being batted around the system and onto other sh*t I don't need like I'm not worthy of what I'm actually asking for.

2,Mental Health Workbooks,"I was texting a mental health crisis line earlier and was given a link to this helpful resource: [https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself)

There are a lot of different workbooks for tackling various mental health issues, and I've started working on the Procrastination workbook as a start.

Just thought this might help some people out there! It seems like a great resource and is quite detailed."
3,Questions about getting help,"I’ll (16M) basically give you the context of my mental health leading up to now. Around the 7th grade, I was cracking under pressure of low grades (i know pretty stupid lol) and was going to kill myself. Last minute I got so scared of what I was doing and thinking about how much I’d hurt people I swore that I’d never do anything like that again. Up until now I have been living life pretty good, and never looking back. 

Flash forward to now, I’ve recently changed schools. It’s all online besides sports (I am playing, but it’s hard to make friends on a soccer team with like 70 people). All of my insecurities have been drastically exacerbating themselves and I have just been feeling like I want to run away from all these thoughts but they just keep following me. The other day I thought “what if I killed myself to get away from all this”. I am WELL aware that this is not the answer, but these harrowing thoughts just live in my head and have started to interject with my slowly growing social life. i hate having these thoughts and have been considering getting mental help. 

My questions, should I try to go to a mental health hospital? I’m thinking (or my insecure part is thinking, idk) that people will think that i’m a lunatic who should be avoided and that I shouldn’t go. I also have been considering my school counselor, but I don’t know if i’ll get the help i need from them. my other concern is parents. I have no idea how they’ll react, i don’t want them to start treating me different and like i have special needs. i just want to start living a normal life and have fun at my new school. Any help is appreciated."
4,I don’t know what to do.,"I have struggled with depression and ocd my whole life, it runs in my family so unfortunately almost all of my immediate family have at least one mental illness. I am really suffering right now but I’m also worried about my brother (he’s a year younger than me) because he never seemed to have any problems in the past and I guess I kind of figured he might end up being the one person in my family that never develops a mental illness like the rest of us. However, he recently told me and our 2 close friends that he thinks he might have depression. He definitely seems a bit more down and quiet lately, so that’s probably the case.

My parents, despite also having mental health problems were never very good at communication so we never really talked about it (especially my mom). And whenever I did try and talk about my mental health with them, my dad would like hug me and stuff but my mom would only try and offer solutions and her opinions and not be supportive or understanding, then the next day they’d both act like I never said anything and nothing was going on. My mom said my brother told her that he has been feeling kind of depressed lately but she isn’t really doing anything about it except guilt tripping him for not talking to her anymore.

I don’t know what I should do. I want to help him and usually I have no problem offering support to others but when it comes to my family it’s different somehow? I feel so bad that I’m perpetuating the cycle of poor communication that has persisted in my family but I don’t know how to approach him about it or what I should do. I guess I just need advice. Sorry for the long post. Thanks everyone."
5,Please help me.,"I think... I think I might be worthless. I can't keep a job, I can't keep a healthy relationship with my loved ones, I can't find somewhere to live for more than a few months at a time. 
I'm tired. I'm tired of trying to convince people I have value. I don't truly believe I do either. I've felt like a burden my whole life. 
I hurt people, a lot. I have borderline personality disorder and I'm just... bad. I think I'm a bad person. My boyfriend and I have been fighting more and more. I feel more lonely every single day. 
I don't know why I'm here anymore. I want to die so bad. My parents are tired of helping me, financially or emotionally. The only person I really feel safe around is my therapist, and I pay her to give a shit about me. 

My life feels like a never ending cycle of disappointment and pain. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I don't want to be a burden anymore. I don't want to exist here anymore. I want to go home, but I haven't had a home in years. I have no home to go to. 

I don't know who to reach out to anymore. I don't know where to turn. I am a financial and emotional burden on everyone around me. I've been to therapy for almost a decade now. I've been in inpatient. I've tried and changed medications more times than I can count. I've read books and gone to group and I've done it all. I've tried to help myself. No one wants to help me anymore. 

I think I'm just wrong. I think I came into the world wrong and I'll leave the world wrong too. 

The only, only thing I really think would be truly hurt by my death is my dog. She is very attached to me and very anxious. 

But I can barely provide for her. I just can't find any reasons to stay here anymore. I want to die. I believe I deserve death. I can't afford more care. My family doesn't want me, not the way I am. Even my boyfriend.... he looks at me with stress and pain in his eyes. I can't remember the last time I saw him happy. I feel like I'm destroying everything around me, and I know I can stop it. I know I can make it end and it feels wrong for me to put others through pain just to selfishly keep living. 

I don't know what to do. I'm at the end of my rope. I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I'm scared, and I'm lost, and I'm tired. Someone please help me. Please, I am trying to do the right thing, I am trying so hard to be a good person who has value in society. 

Please, someone help me. Please."

7,Threw out a self harm tool.,"Today I threw out an object that I knew I could hurt myself badly with. It was extremely hard, but I did it. 

I’ve been self harming since 2014, however, i’ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then. I recently have been self harming on and off since December, and today I took the object I had been using, that i knew i could do a lot with, and threw it away outside of my home. I did this so I can’t go back and get it. It was really hard, but I knew I could do a lot of harm with it. I hate hiding self harm, but it’s an addiction I deal with. 

Anything is possible, even when things are hard, know you can get through it. Self harm has been a major part of my mental health issues over the years. The courage and strength it takes to get rid of something you can harm yourself with is enormous, but if I could, you can too. ❤️"

9,Thoughts about the Right to Fail,"Hi all, 
As much as we want to see our clientele succeed, the choices they make, for better or worse, are up to them. Which makes me wonder sometimes if agencies have this in mind, or is the delineation between caring and coddling a very thin one (I honestly don't know).

Natural consequences being what they are means that there's not much or no safety net, and while individuals who have mental health issues and illnesses need additional help, is it somewhat impeded? Again I wonder about caring becoming coddling.

What are your thoughts?"
10,I REALLY need help finding out what's wrong with me.,"Hello there! To give some background information, I am an 18 year who has gone through verbal and physical abuse throughout their childhood as well as growing up in a generally toxic environment. When I was about 15, I experienced a change in my life that I have yet to fully return back from, which was getting derealization/depersonalization or DPDR. At first it terrified me and plagued my existence every single day, but through therapy and self-aware improvements, I've been able to live for the past 1.5 - 2 years without it negatively affecting my life at all. 

In lou of that, since the DPDR was initially caused by smoking weed, I avoided smoking for a long while, but eventually I began smoking weed everyday for the past 2 years and only this previous week did I take a full week off. Alongside that, I consider myself somewhat of an experienced psychedelic user with having had multiple unbelievably eye-opening and life-changing acid and mushroom trips that connected me closer to myself, the world and others more than I ever thought I could. The only parts of these trips that scared me, were sometimes during my come up, I'd get this very specific feeling of panic in my stomach that I'd lose my mind, I began to become terrified with the perceived fragility of my mind. Yet this feeling always passed. Yet, fast forward to my week of taking a break from marijuana, every single night was filled with restlessness and the endless feeling of butterflies in my stomach with absolutely no way of calming it down. I was driving my **insane** over the fact that my anxiety just would not go away and my stomach was in knots. The feeling in my stomach is what feels inescapable. How do I get it to stop? In these moments it feels like I'm stuck in with THAT feeling and I will literally go **insane** due to the fact that it's just constant 10/10 anxiety and butterflies in my stomach. 

At the end of my tolerance break, I smoked again, and I felt as if I was high, but I wasn't high at the same time, and that feeling of anxiety in my stomach was amplified to a degree I couldn't even fathom. I looked all over the internet to find some sort of solace or somebody understanding what I'm going through, but it feels very specific and nowhere online has something that describes what I'm talking about. ***It's really not the only feeling of anxiety and discomfort that's bothering me,*** I **know** that happens to everybody and especially when abstaining from something such as marijuana, it's the feeling of it being inescapable, and there seems to be no amount of breathing, reading, meditating or thinking I can do to return myself to baseline. I feel like my reality is warped and terrifying, this is never something I experienced in my life before this, even during times of derealization or abuse. I can't seem to stop thinking when the feeling will come on again, what's wrong me and whether or not I'm totally insane now with no hope of returning back to baseline. I hope and assume that isn't the case, **but I NEED guidance!** 

&amp;#x200B;

Every-time I think about anything even remotely worrisome, ESPECIALLY internally/existentially, I plunge into intense waves of these feelings and I turn pale as ghost, sick to my stomach. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all can help, thank you very much!"
11,Mental illness has held me back in every aspect of life,"I've had an incredibly privileged and easy life on the surface, but my mental health has always been like a  shadow following my every move. Reflecting on my childhood dreams and aspirations reminds me that every regret I have is from when I was too ashamed, too afraid, to do something. Finally starting to feel the beginnings of confidence and acceptance of myself makes me aware of all the things I could have done had I simply been able to overcome that mental  barrier.

Fear and shame have dictated nearly all of my decisions in life, and at 28 years old, I feel close to finding the key to freedom. It's not something I can explain, but I feel like certain connections have been developing in my brain and I'm finally able to learn some basic principles of behavior that lead to positive outcomes.

I've tried therapy and medication but every time I eventually reject it. I think I'm driven to find the answer for myself, no matter what the emotional or health costs of facing my demons alone may be.

I didn't even realize what a mental illness was until I was at least 23 or so, but suddenly all of the inexplicable things I felt or thought suddenly had context. ""This is why I feel different, this is why I struggle to relate to people I should be forming connections with, this is why I have terrifying unstoppable thoughts.."" It's because I AM different. But it isn't my fault. I have an illness, or a disorder. And there are many other people who do too. People that understand!

It's good that we know so much more about the brain now, I just hope that one day everyone has free access to mental health care and screenings so we can help each other heal.

12,For those with anger issues how do you cope?,[removed]
13,Im stuck. Need help urgently.,"I don't care for life, I have no self control. I came inchs from ending it last night but didn't because I thought of my mom (It would destroy her and in turn the family) I dont feel anything. Ever. I have ADD and Aspergers. Im not sure what else to put here but will answer all questions 100% truthfully. I just don't know what to do anymore. Thanks"
14,How to get rid of jealousy?,"I’m at a point in my life where I feel very stagnant. I’ve been at the same job for 5 years and I’m not happy. The things I’ve endured there have brought me severe depression and anxiety. I’ve never been happy at the place, but I was dealing with major mental health/ self esteem  issues that made me not want to leave. Never felt good enough and was always scared to leave. Over the years I’ve  succeeded . People have asked me to be their mentor. People have asked me to come into their jobs and help train their staff. I’ve won awards. I’ve  worked hard and proud of myself  and now I feel it’s time for me to leave. However when I see people with less experience than Me, move to bigger jobs , I can’t help but feel jealous. I’ve been struggling a bit trying to find new jobs. So when I see people who I may have helped trained move up, it just brings me into a range of emotions of wondering what’s wrong with me and what am I doing wrong. I don’t want to be that way. I hate it. I want to be happy for others and not let their accomplishments lower my already low self esteem. How can I fix this? I’ve been meditating, going to therapy , praying and working out more. I’m still fairly new to this, but I just get upset with myself when I feel this way and can’t control it . How can I stop being jealous ?"
15,High school is ruining my life; I desperately need it to feel like it doesn't carry so much weight...,"So, I go to a prep school where most of the people are pretty smart. I'm in tenth grade, and this year, it's been really rough. I've always been bright, and up until now, I've applied myself at school, but I've never felt the need to really put the pedal to the metal. I don't get perfect 100s on everything, but I'm a straight-A student and just going with the flow has worked for me up until now. This year, I'm taking four honors and AP Euro (college level history) and I'm realizing that this isn't going to work for me anymore. I procrastinate a ton, and if I keep doing that, my sleep is going to suffer, and my grades as well... especially this week, I'm under a ton of stress. I have a History test on Monday, which has an insane amount of information on it. I've studied some, but I'm in no place to take the test. I still have the rest of this week and the weekend, so I'm not in full panic mode yet. I just feel so so overwhelmed. I won't bore you with telling you about all the work I have, but the next two weeks are kind of hell for me... The main thing I'm asking about though, is how to not let all the negativity get to me. I am a good student, but the fact that I get more A minuses now (and the occasional B plus) on my report card bothers me. Reading over this, I'm sure it sounds so so entitled and braggy, but please, hear me out. I'm not gunning to go to Harvard anything, I'm actually hoping to go to a small liberal arts school. So, my thoughts are, if I keep my grades relatively good, I have some chances. But, the negativity always comes in and tells me that it won't be enough, that most people are smarter than me. And, without even considering college, school just makes me feel like complete crap. I'm so stressed, and guilty above anything, when I don't do as well as I'd hoped on an assignment. There's a lot of peer pressure at my school (everyone's feeling insecure as well and searching for self-validation, so there's a lot of bragging and competition), so my grades feel like they're then only part of me. I just am really needing some validation about the future, and about the real importance of high school..."
16,I lost the love of my life,"Me and my girlfriend were forced to break up today, because our relationship shouldnt exist by society's standards. She is my reason to live and she gave me happiness i never had. The months is spent with her were the best times in my entire life. She is my soulmate and even tho we both made eachother happy and we helped each other better ourselves and grow as people. For others they only see our love as something shameful.

So now im alone again, Im back where i started but now everything hurts 10 times more, and I just dont know how Im gonna deal with this. I promised her Im gonna be strong and I wont do anything to myself. But I dont want to, i cant live without her when she gave my life meaning, she was the sunshine in all my existence and now its gone, Im left in the darkness again, but now knowing light, the darkness is so much more scary and overwhelming.

I dont want to keep on going, I just want to disappear. I want to be with her again, but I cant. I dont know how Im gonna keep up the strong act. I dont know if I can do it at all.

If any of you know some resources i may use, I live in Poland"
17,I hope everyone is doing okay tonight. Hang in there,I care about you
18,I don't know what's wrong with me?,"I feel like this sounds a little dumb, but I don't really know who to talk to or what to even say. I guess I've felt depressed for a long time, really, but it's never been to the point where I feel like an immediate danger to myself/others. I've always been able to function pretty properly and get stuff done, but I just constantly feel emotionally exhausted. Always. I did have a bit of a traumatic childhood, and I attributed most of these icky feelings towards situational stuff. It's been about four years since the bad situation was resolved, and while it's been an upward trend in terms of mental health, the exhaustion has never really gone away. Sometimes I wonder if I have unresolved PTSD, too, but that's an entirely different battle which I don't know how to approach either. I've pretty much always felt predisposed to sadness. I don't think there's ever been a period in my life where I've been able to confidently say I'm doing better than just fine or OK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, it's never been to the point where my everyday functioning is impaired, but I've been feeling severely funky lately. Like severely. I've been having trouble eating and being tired all the time kind of has me stuck in bed or on the couch if I'm not doing some type of important work. A few days ago, I did LSD for the first time, and the euphoria literally ransacked my body. I felt so terrifyingly oversaturated with emotion for the first time in my life, and the last few days since then have been almost rougher than before. It's like I'm even more sad because I don't feel as excited about living as I did when I was on acid, and admitting to myself that I'd never felt that good in my life was kind of heartbreaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if LSD contributed to this revelation or if it's just been a long time coming, but I've been thinking a lot about why I am the way that I am. I know I've been sad for a very long time, but it's always been manageable. Ish. I've fluctuated between my highs and lows. I've been seeing a therapist as needed (I make the appointments at my own discretion, we go months without talking sometimes when I'm feeling OK or just too tired to go) for about four years now as well, but it's never really felt like a huge help. I always just feel extra drained after. I also kinda figured that if I were depressed or anything, my therapist would have picked it out already? And diagnosed me? I don't really know how any of this works, but I'm tired of being tired. I don't really know where to go from here. I want to stop feeling like I'll just always be a little gray underneath, but I don't know if that's even possible, and if it is, then what do I do? This week scared me a lot with how particularly dead and unmotivated I've felt, and I want it to stop. If you have any clue what my next step should be, I'd appreciate it a lot."
19,Gf has bipolar disorder and I need advice,[removed]
20,psychiatrist ghosted me during med withdrawal &amp; no therapist. in crisis,"I'm seriously in a nightmare. I was having really, really bad side effects from Latuda and it wasn't even working great, so my psychiatrist had me taper off over a couple weeks. Stopped taking it last week. She started me on Lithium at same time and was going to build up from 150mg. Continued on 200mg Lamotrigine too.

Past few days have been crying all day, intensely suicidal to the point of have urges to impulsively act, completely unable to work whatsoever despite Adderall, no motivation for anything, irrational emotional episodes. I'm seriously having a crisis.

Emailed psychiatrist 2 days ago, no reply. Texted today at 2pm, nothing.

I have no therapist because I'm between IOP and a new one and my psychiatrist knows this. No friends or family, live alone. The only thing I want to do is drink, but can't even get myself to go to the store across the street to buy alcohol.

I have no idea what to do and I'm freaking out and having a meltdown. I truly don't know how to cope or what could do anything to help me."
21,"I think I had cannabis induced psychosis for a year, and would really appreciate opinions.","I was the heaviest smoker I knew by a long shot. I wouldn’t go an hour without it. All day everyday, concentrates and dabs as well. I did this for months in a row.

One day at work, I was very in my head, quiet, and anxious. Out of nowhere, I get this overwhelming panicked feeling, couldn’t talk to anyone at work, and was hyper aware that I was being quiet and starting getting more panicked thinking what others must think, even though there was nothing o was doing wrong I just probably came across as more quiet than usual. 

Since then, for a year, I was panicked all the time, lost all my confidence, thought I looked different and less attractive, thought my girlfriend could never like me, was so hyper aware of everything thought and action that happened I was analyzing everything, I couldn’t stop doing this. I thought nobody could like me the way I was at the time that I started avoiding social situations and stopped hanging w my friends.

At the time, I would describe my symptoms as being panicked/anxious and having OCD(intrusive thoughts, couldn’t stop thinking or analyzing everything). No SSRI worked. I would look at people living their normal lives, and literally couldn’t imagine how anyone does that without being anxious, I literally couldn’t comprehend it or imagine anyone being like that genuinely, I just thought they were kind of faking it. Thoughts would ruminate in my head trying to figure out what is causing this “feeling”, and I would convince myself that certain things were the reason, and then I would think of a different reason, etc. I would always say “yea I feel panicked and anxious, but there is something else wrong, some other feeling that I can’t describe”. It was like falling into a hole, different from other “panic” I’ve experienced. 

Ironically, I eventually said fuck it a year later and started smoking again. Slowly, I got my confidence back, am able to talk to people even when sober, and my perception on myself is not “off” anymore. I don’t smoke nearly as much as I did last year. Does this sound like a psychosis or thought disorder, and not just anxiety? Thank you."

23,Not being heard by my psychiatrist?,"So I’ve been on Pregabalin (on top of other stuff) that has been causing me some issues. Since starting it (over the fact that I had a small handful of days of feeling on edge), my depressive lows have gotten more intense. I’ve also developed migraines which weren’t there before. 

I brought it up after working with it for 1 month. My psychiatrist said that “it’s not possible for the Pregabalin to be causing it”. Doubled my dose, put me on Agomelatine (which already didn’t work before, but I’m back on it again). My lows and migraines have gotten worse since. 

I raised it up again over email and my case manager (corresponding with my psychiatrist) both still insist on me taking it and monitoring until November. 

I’m at my wits’ end. I feel so unheard by my psychiatrist. And now I have to live with daily migraines until Nov, no matter how many times I bring it up, just because “it’s not possible”. I don’t even know if I’ll still be forced to stay on it come the appointment in November."
24,what do i do?,"im tried of something, i dont know why but im really depressed. i feel like i cant be because my friend is suicidal and if my parents think its because of her they wont let me hang out with her and theyll swich me schools. i feel like i cant do anything. i tried to tell her but she acted like i was faking. she keeps telling me its just a phase when it comes to my sexuality and how i feel. i feel bubbled in. what can i do? i want to run away but there no place for me to go. i just cant stay here."

30,How do you know if you are mentally healthy ?,"Hmmm, that's a good question. I always think that Body + mind = Health. We see our body in the mirror every day, that's how it is. But we have to feel how good the mind is. Let's talk about this--

    First I ask a question, how do we know that our body is very good?

     When we see that our bone and muscle capacity is very good and there is no problem in our body to do any hard work. Then we will understand that we have very good physical power.

     If we look at this formula with our mind, then we will understand how our mental health is!

     What is our inner reaction to any problem in life? Do we give up on a small problem? Or, solve a big problem effortlessly by planning? Or, solve many complicated events in a simple way?

     Look closely at your attitude, then you will understand that the state of your mental muscle.

     Let me tell you a story I heard: When it rains, when all the birds return to their homes, the eagle flies in the sky to enjoy the rain. The problem is the same for everyone.  The way you look, that's where the power of your mind lies. Thank you!"
31,I feel trapped and it's been like this for so long. I don't know what to do anymore.," 

I also posted this on r/venting. Sorry, really long post. I'm not sure what I really want to say. I don't really ever talk about what's going on inside my mind, to anyone. Not on the internet, not to my family, not to any friends. But I feel like I should because I feel so trapped. So I'm just gonna write a whole ass essay about the past 5 years of my life to put it down somewhere. Possibly triggering

I just turned 19. I've been smoking weed daily since I was 15, a few months before I turned 16. It started out as a nightly thing, and then slowly has transformed into a constant crutch that I can't imagine life without. I didn't ever think I could possibly smoke as much as I do now, the amount of money I've spent(even just since covid started especially) is insane. It's basically become my personality. I'm not trying to ask for sympathy or ways to quit or anything. I don't really want to, but I could slow down for sure. It makes me feel so disconnected from life sometimes though.

I've been depressed since way before I started smoking weed, especially in 8th grade and my freshmen year of highschool. I always hid it, I never let anyone know that on the inside I felt so horrible(except one of my closest friends). It's hard for me to remember a lot of things now, but I started cutting myself and smoking cigarettes' I stole from my dad during 8th grade and 9th grade respectively. I went in and out of periods of doing both often. I don't really know what was going on in my head at the time. No one ever found out I cut myself, I did get caught stealing cigarettes though.

I thought when I started smoking weed things were getting better. My parents let me do it as long as it was only at night and I maintained good grades. I slowly quit cutting myself. I got a job during the summer going into junior year as well, so I could support the habit much easier. I don't think things ever really got better though. It was just harder to see. Until recently I forgot that only like 6 months after I started smoking I had a friend who constantly had xanax, so I often bought a few bars and took a bar a night for 3 months until we fell out of contact in my sophomore year. I also never had many friends overall, so at my new job I made a lot of new connections (including my current weed dealer who is extremely reliable) and someone who sold me huge bottles of vodka whenever I asked all throughout the year(I always drank alone). I started vaping all the time, with my friends on the bus mainly.

Over the course of my sophomore year I really got into being high, that summer it really ramped up and going into my junior year I was allowed to smoke all day basically. Not very many memories that stand out to me when I think about it, again I can't remember my feelings at the time very well at all despite how recent it is. I didn't drink near as much though.

I'm ashamed to admit it but I started heavily abusing Benadryl. I had some experience with taking more than the suggested dose before, but it ramped up a lot at some point. I think it was towarsd the end of my junior year because how bored I was with life, with weed. I got a new job that I deeply care about and still have now and is one of the reasons I still strive for anything in life. This slowed it down for a while, but then I was just figuring out which nights I could get destroyed on Benadryl to not have to wake up for work or school the next morning. Honestly my memory is so fucked up that this may have been more in my senior year than junior year, and it was also horrible during quarantine, I just really messed my brain up doing this I think. I bought bottles at giant, it started out as ""it intensifies my weed high"" and turned into something I needed to dull everything. I dropped my closest(and only tbh) friend of multiple years, and felt so guilty about it for so long. But the guilt passed and I'm still so scared to talk to them.. I remember nights falling asleep on the couch in my garage smoking weed. I usually started taking it right when I got home and just slowly took more and more until I fell asleep. One of the main things I remember is always seeing a really thin smoke in the air and just getting lost staring into it. I don't take it near as often now, I've tried to completely quit, but sometimes I just feel like I still need that escape.

Now I've been trying to face reality more often, but I smoke so much weed it's hard. I need to figure out college stuff, and I still haven't despite it already having started. No one at work would ever know any of this, they all think I'm an extremely hard worker and my parents just think I'm a stoner. I feel so lost. Since quarantine I've started cutting again. A lot. I'll have multiple 'attacks' daily where I just go crazy on myself, for a week or two, and then go back to being normal stoner guy. But right now I feel like I'm just trapped in the former. I don't know how to stop. Or how to face my feelings or thoughts. I have started drinking again, my dad let's me on weekends fairly often as long as I don't go overboard. I want to tell my parents everything, to be honest with them about how I've felt over the years, but it feels like I've been lying for so long and I'm so trapped. I don't really have any friends left. I'm just so sad and I dont know how to move forward or what is next for me in life."

33,"need help eliminating horrific, recurring mental image","Does anyone have any techniques for banishing disturbing images? 

Basically, the past few nights I've been plagued by this horrible thought / image and it's causing serious problems with my ability to fall asleep, and also with my mental health in general.   It's an intrusive image / thought, but it's unfortunately not something I can talk myself out of, unlike with certain images / thoughts, as the scenario I picture really did happen, although I did not witness it. 

I called a mental health support line and the person I spoke to  recommended using progressive muscle relaxation. I find this somewhat useful but i could use more recommendations of similar things. de"
34,So weak and tired 😭just so so tired mentally and physically,"In 20’s &amp; I can’t breathe another day. I promised myself I’d stay just a little longer and I did. Nothing will ever change. Every single day I feel the same way and it’s been like this for an entire year. Just why, why another day 😭I hate this world so so much"
35,Any ideas on why I keep feeling like this?,"I have so much energy it feels like electric waves running through my body my mind is going so fast and I’m not able to slow down I can’t control my hyperactivity and anger i can’t sleep but I’m not tired I feel like I’m on the highest peak of a roller coaster I feel like I can’t get hurt like I could do risky things and be fine like a god complex I can’t come down but I like it in a way but I also hate it.

This isn’t even the lot of it either."
36,What is this?,Ok so whenever something sad happens I'll cry for a couple of minutes then be fine. And then I'll break down and either get extremely angry or exstremly sad or both and it will be like a reset and then I'll be completely fine. Ever though I was crying and thinking about killing myself just a couple of minutes ago.
37,"How can I get out of this rat race, classist mentality?","I used to be worse with this. I used to be really arrogant and cocky. I used to feel ""above"" people for going to certain schools. I used to work extremely hard (talking work full time, school full time, ECs, etc.) to the point where I was constantly burning out. I have come a long way from where I was around age 19. I am 24 now. However, I still have biases and feelings that I want to eliminate when it comes to this. Maybe it is because I don't feel enough recognition for my own accomplishments? My first thought when certain people accomplish things is negative. I hate it. I am completely aware of these thoughts and feelings with no idea how to erase them. I am never openly negative towards people but I sometimes feel the urge to put them down. I always try to be supportive because I have those thoughts under control. Wth is wrong with me? Can I have some advice/help?"

39,Low self-esteem and Anxiety,[removed]
40,Trying to figure it out,"This is my first time on here so this’ll be fun.



Honestly, life has been kinda shitty for me lately. Lots of not so good days ya know.....idk. Work, relationships, Covid, family, ect are all just catching up. I’ve been self medicating with smoking n drinking but even of course....that only leads to more issues. Depression and anxiety are the two major things I’ve been dealing with lately and it’s been a bit of ups and downs. Sober October starts tomorrow so that should start freshening things up......idk. I guess I’m just here waving a flag saying “I’m trying”. Haha hope you all have a good day. Thanks"
41,Okay so is anyone really mentally stable?,"This may sound stupid but it’s getting more and more incomprehensible to me that there are people out there that don’t hate themselves, don’t cry on a daily basis, don’t always feel the need to punish themselves and don’t constantly consider death? This isn’t a troll or a joke I genuinely want to know... what is it like being mentally stable. Not really sure if this is the right place to ask but any input would be appreciated as right now I’m feeling very confused about everything. Feel free to ask me questions or anything that you think of."
42,"I get emotional, then I get defensive, then I get rational, all in four paragraphs.","I'm sad. What's the point of having people in my life if I end up feeling this isolated and alone? I can do this without the fear of abandonment. I can feel this alone by myself. I hate that I rely on people to feel human. That reliance makes me weak. I am already weak. Everything is a bandaid to make me feel like I still have a purpose in life. Everything I've surrounded myself with is a placebo for life and love. I've never felt either. it feels like a rough draft of a note I'll write someday. 

I've always been supportive. But I push boundaries to feel less alone. When I need support I feel abandoned and unwanted. a burden. Am I a problem? I want to be held. and told I'm not going to die the way I lived. What's the point of being loved if I don't feel anything but fear. 

I don't need a hotline or words of encouragement or caution. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow.  I just needed a place to share and didn't know where the appropriate forum or community was and this was the first thing I thought to search for. I'm sorry if this is the incorrect place. Please ignore me.  

Realistically what's going on is I'm in my family home and I'm working through therapy having to do with childhood trauma surrounding homeschooling and extended bouts of isolation as a child. I am exploring those memories while simultaneously reliving them. I haven't seen anyone but my parents in passing in the past 8 days. I've been trying to exercise and go on walks and have zoom calls with friends but non of it is enough and its all very triggering to my childhood. I was alone for many years."

44,My boyfriend made me feel like shit earlier for having anxiety,"so i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression march of 2019, but before i was officially diagnosed, it was making my life a living hell. 

my boyfriend is aware of this and how shit my life has been. well, life’s been even harder lately, with us taking care of our newborn son and finding a place to live.. my mental health hasn’t been this bad in forever. well, we got in a fight earlier about something really stupid, and at one point, he called me a psychopath for not remembering something minor i said in the past, and he said i “cry over everything like a baby” (which is what anxiety fucking does to me...). he apologized a couple times but i really don’t know how to forgive him for this, idk if i can. that statement really broke me. 

**tl;dr** — my boyfriend and i got in a fight earlier, he said i “cry over everything like a baby”. i have bad anxiety and i don’t know how to feel about him saying that. i’m shattered."

47,Places That Offer Affordable Therapy,"I found this post on reddit that can be helpful for many. 

Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ibz91q/ysk\_if\_you\_feel\_you\_need\_therapy\_but\_cant\_afford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ibz91q/ysk_if_you_feel_you_need_therapy_but_cant_afford/)

So if you feel like you need  help—depression, anxiety, grief, trauma, etc—but don’t think you can  afford it, make sure that’s not the case. I’m happy to help anyone look  into their options.

Another great resource if you’re in the States is [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/September-2016/How-Texting-Can-Help-Save-a-Life). You can literally text them for resources in your area.

Finally,  we tend to treat the brain differently than other parts of the body. As  I often say to my students who are struggling, if you had low blood  sugar, would you yell at it to raise itself? A broken foot? Of course  not. You’d go to the doctor. The same should apply to the brain. There  is no shame in seeking help. I’m fact, I’d argue it’s courageous.

48,I wouldn’t mind being dead even though i’m not suicidal.,"Is this normal? I am not diagnosed with anything, and I have not told anybody about how I feel. I have been sad, lonely, and felt very down for almost a year. I am in no way suicidal and I have not ever harmed myself. I just wouldn’t care if I died. If I could see into the future and I died in 10 minutes, and if I just moved I would be alive I wouldn’t move. What do I do. I feel guilty for feeling like this. I have a great family and I feel like I am letting them down by feeling like this."
49,Suicides,I'm going to kill myself if he doesn't come back...
50,Is making up stories in my mind considered a mental disorder? (I'll do my best to explain),[removed]
51,I keep fixing problems when it's too late (read whole thing),"most of my life it's been like this and it was usually fine, like assignments or problems with people, there wasn't much consequence. Now however I've been in a relationship and it's been seriously effecting it, I don't notice things that annoy or upset my SO and we get into a small argument. I'm trying to fix it but I'm not sure how to tackle this problem. Something I'm sure that's affecting it is the fact I have Asperger's, everyone thinks it not affecting me much but I think it's worth noting. Any help would be welcomed, even a name of this if there's a name for this so I can read into it more."
52,Is this normal,So I have this weird memory and I just need an answer from an adult to ask what would you do. If a child (like 4-6 years old) asked to touch your genitalia out of curiosity would you say yes?
53,"i find it funny that i’m the one always giving advice, but whenever i need it no one knows how to help. or even worse i don’t use my own advice.","even on reddit here i comment ideas and thoughts for people struggling, yet here i am completely ignoring my own advice 🤡"
54,I want to stop feeling this way.,"Would some be able to explain to me why whenever the *slightest* thing goes wrong my brain immediately goes back to a suicidal mindset? I have spent so much time going through treatment and trying to better myself and it feels as though whenever the smallest thing happens it almost all goes down the drain. I'm honestly not quite sure what to do, usually I'm really bad at asking for help/ advice but I'm starting to get sick of it and I want it to stop but I just don't know how."
55,I have no where to go for help,"I've been through all the therapists and psychiatrists in my area that take my insurance. I'm starting to branch out into surrounding counties but the drive is hell.




My current therapist says she can no longer help me. I see a new therapist next Monday for the first time in many years. I see my psychiatrist every 2 weeks while we work on cross tapering my meds.




But it's not enough. I'm so scared. So close to self harming despite being 2.5 years clean. So close to breaking.




I can't trust my local hospital anymore. I just recently walked out mid treatment because of how poorly it went. The nurses were a joke and when I finally got to talk to an actual doctor he was condescending and judgemental and refused to change my meds. He spent an hour berating my life that he knew nothing about, telling me things like my whole mindset and relationship were built on shame, before I walked out. I can't go back there.




The next closest hospital is an hour away, but I don't know if I could do it. I don't think I could drive an hour there and back every day for outpatient therapy and certainly don't think I'd do well in inpatient therapy.



I feel like I'm out of options. I have no where left to turn for help. My intrusive thoughts are screaming ""I just need some help"". I don't know what help means but I can't keep going like this."
56,Can anyone see a therapist or does there need to be certain conditions met?,I think seeing a therapist would be beneficial for me. Would there be a reason for them to not want to see me? Are there rules and stipulations for getting in to see one?
57,Confronting a guy who sexually assaulted me,"Recently, I confronted the guy who sexually assaulted me, I weirdly feel guilty about it and I don’t know why. He has done it twice on 2 separate occasions, both of which I still have nightmares about to this day. Why do I feel guilty about confronting him about it? I told him it wasn’t okay what he did and what he did was sexual assault, and it felt good but it felt serious as well and I don’t know if I feel like it’s serious idk :( just confused and muddled it’s messy with my head"
58,Help with a diagnosis???,"Hey guys!!! So I have been looking all over the internet for a possible self diagnosis, if it’s even a real problem. I thought that someone else might be similar so I thought I’d ask. I’ve been noticing tic-like impulses, however I have complete control over them, it just seems much more comfortable to do them, wether it be bouncing my leg(the longer I do it the more violent the shaking gets) to hitting the palms of my hands together(also gets very violent with time). Another thing is that if I begin tapping a pattern onto my skin or tapping my fingers/hand against something, it seems like I need to keep up the pattern. Again, I don’t know if this is really something with a diagnosis, and I don’t want to offend anyone with things such as Tourette’s and ADHD. It’s just getting pretty annoying and it would be nice to get some answers. Tysm!!!!"
59,i feel empty,"i have experienced these feelings of emptiness and utter pain for about 2 years now but it’s been on and off for about a few months. but now it’s been getting more frequent and lasts longer. it feels like i don’t have anybody, i miss my friends and my family. i’m so overwhelmed with school and i feel suffocated with my educational burdens that i have just given up on doing anything at all and it is nothing like me. i just don’t know what is wrong with me, nothing is fun anymore and the days all blur together, and i can’t sleep at all. i just don’t feel like myself."
60,I just wish I had someone I could be 100% honest with,I dont have many people I could just say all my feelings to and be honest with and I have so much i wish I could just talk with someone about
61,Potential podcast.,"Hi all,

I'm busy working a podcast. Currently I'm on the look out for some interesting topics, ideas and theories relating to mental health and psychology that you would like to share?
 
Is there anything you would like to hear being discussed on my podcast?

Thanks"
62,I think I have ADHD,"I (23F) started seeing a psychiatrist because of my suspicions of ADHD and I think oversharing my experiences has led them the wrong direction.

We’re no longer talking about my serious attention issues that have caused me to almost drop out of school twice last year. We only ever talk about the possibility of me having bipolar 2 and my anxiety. I’ve been prescribed antidepressants that may help with my attention issues (wellbutrin xl) and a mild dosage of meds for my anxiety, but I’m afraid this won’t help my core issue right now.

I deeply believe that I have ADHD/ADD and that it’s manifested itself differently in adulthood, which is why I’m only now experiencing difficulties around it. I just don’t know how to bring it back into the conversation."
63,Dealing with sibling with mental illness... while struggling with mental illness.,[removed]
64,What are antidepressants suppose to feel like?,"I get what antidepressants do chemically in our body. I had a unit on how SSRI’s affect the brain in a psychology course. However, I want to know what they feel like when you do take them.

I am asking because my mom is convinced I have had depression &amp; anxiety for a couple years. Ironically, you would think someone who has studied psychology for 4 years, would freaking know if they have it or not. However, I am not very good with self evaluating.

Emotional I feel good. I’m never sad/angry, nor am I “numb” as other people explain it. What I am though, is freaking “lazy”—as I was often told as a teenager. Since I have moved out &amp; on my own, I am now free to do whatever I want. That is where I have the problem. Any chance I am given, I am laying in bed. I am either scrolling through my phone or sleeping. I am well known for sleeping 16 hours, getting some food &amp; then going right back to sleep. I have also started to take up the fasting lifestyle, because I am too lazy to grocery shop or even eat most of the day. So I try to eat a lot in one sitting at about 10pm every night. I also don’t exercise anymore. I use to be huge into martial arts, but had to quit due to a nasty sprain that almost cost me my job. 

I definitely do the bare minimum. So Ill get my school work done, often very late at night—but always from my bed. I find I get the most energy at night so thats when I get ahead on my studies because I know Ill be down &amp; out the whole next day. I also show up to work on time &amp; get through. I love my job so thats no big deal. 

My problem is, I want that drive to stay out of bed. But I always think about when I can be in bed next. When I talk to people about how all I do is live in my bed, they can’t wrap their head around it. They tell me they watch tv in their living room &amp; actually cook dinner in the kitchen &amp; eat at the dinner table. Things I cannot fathom unless I am being forced to by my family. People actually have the desire to do these things!? 

I saw a therapist about a year ago who I tried explaining this to. She asked me what makes me sad. I said, “well, I am not sad about anything. I have everything I could want. I have the job of my dreams, the car I’ve always wanted, I love where I live &amp; I have a supportive family.” She said, “you’re not depressed then because you are happy with your life &amp; have everything you want. Paint your walls a bright color, make yourself exercise &amp; open the blinds for sunlight if you want motivation back in your life.” So I walked out &amp; never looked back. The blinds are always open, &amp; I have a class thats making me work out for a grade. My apartment doesn’t allow paint, so oh well there. But I am lazier than ever.

My therapist (when I was a teen) told me I would be 5x more likely to have depression as an adult than others for being in there for what I was in for. I think she also may have tried to tell my parents I had depression, however my parents told her I was not to be diagnosed because “kids &amp; teens can’t be diagnosed with a made up illness such as depression”. Since then my mom has been diagnosed with BPD &amp; depression so now all the sudden she advocates for therapy. 


So will antidepressants actually give someone magical energy &amp; motivation to do things? Or is it just something that’s supposed to make the user happy &amp; the rest is on the user to get the motivation? I am still not even sure I have depression, but Im not about to look like a fool AGAIN for seeing a therapist for “self diagnosed depression”. The therapist last year made me go home &amp; cry because I looked like such an idiot for thinking I had depression. I would bet she probably still laughs that I went in to see her over that. I really don’t want to do that all over again. I am pretty convinced I am just lazy because I do feel emotionally good. I just freaking want the drive to do anything. Even just the desire to shower because I keep getting rashes in my armpits that come &amp; go from not showering for days when I don’t have to leave the house. I also would like the ability to not have to pay people to grocery shop once a month for me. I live on ramen noodles because its cheap &amp; can be done in 5 minutes in the microwave."
65,I need help. Bad.,"I certainly didn't think I would end up on Reddit for this, but I am not sure where else to turn. I'll try to keep this short as possible, but will leave a TL;DR at the bottom if it gets out of hand. Also, I apologize in advance for the format, as I'm on mobile. 

To sum things up: 2020 has royally fucked me, as I'm sure it has everyone else. I am diagnosed BPD (borderline), chronic depression, generalized anxiety. I have a history of abusing marijuana, though that's been managed. I also have a history of self harm and an eating disorder, though that's been managed as well. Currently I am struggling with intense BPD symptoms and depression, which are leading to suicidal thoughts. I was heavily medicated since the age of 14. I'm currently a 25F who spent the last year off all mood related medications thinking I could manage on my own. It has not gone as planned. 

I spent the last two months attempting to plan a safe suicide that wouldn't hurt too many people, where my possessions should go, etc. It only ended up in me feeling guilty and asking for help. I requested some sort of medication from my psychiatrist. He prescribed Lemictal. Unfortunately I've only been on them for a week and already had a slew of intense and horrible side affects, from increased back and neck pain, migraines worse than I've ever had, nausea, etc. 

I had a Genocept Assay done, so I may reference that despite knowing it's not 100%. I'm asking for any recommendations on medications that can help me at least MANAGE my BPD symtoms, I know there's no cure through medication. I've tried them all but unfortunately a lot of my memories no longer exist, so it's hard to remember what worked and didn't. If no one can assist in specific recommendations, I'm wondering if there's a website or app where others post their experiences. I'm just trying to manage here. If anyone can offer any advice on how to cope with the side effects or if they'll ever dwindle on this specific med, I'll take that too. I just need help. 

I'm still in therapy and see my doctors regularly. I want to have some information to discuss and ask questions when I see my psychiatrist next. 

TIA."
66,I don't think my antidepressants are working,"I have been on Wellbutrin for just about a year but I don't feel like it is helping me anymore. I haven't tried to get off the medicine for the entire year since starting so I am scared. I am extremely stressed out because school through my university is picking up at full speed again and having all online classes has been a difficult adjustment for me. I don't know if I should switch or stop or keep trying to push through. I am not at all all time low but things are definitely still hard. 

I have tried sertraline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine but have had bad experiences will all of them. The side affects have been too severe.  I don't know if now would be a good time to try anything new either now because it might just escalate my stress levels. I have a therapist but I haven't seen her in over 3 months because I was doing well over the summer. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
67,I just need help,"I feel so worthless. I feel like a failure. I’m failing all my classes. I have no work ethic. I can barely pay attention to anything. I’m so stressed all the time because of it. Just thinking about having to go to school makes me tear up. My mental health has never been this bad and I have no idea how to deal with it. The more I think about what’s making the feel this way the more I cry because I feel like I’m letting everyone down. This is the third time just this week I’ve cried and I never cry. 

Please. If anyone has any advice on how I could get better tell me. I really need it."
68,My roommate believes she’s a vampire HELP,"My (F 20) roommate (F 27) believes that she is a vampire. HELP

My (F 20) roommate (F 27) believes that she is a vampire. HELP

So I moved into a new apartment with roommates that I found on Facebook. They’re nice people and are easygoing. But one of them, Amy (F 27), seems to have a lot of severe delusions and mental health issues. I’m not sure if it’s schizophrenia or perhaps something else.

Th first day I moved in, she “came out” to me as a witch, vampire, and the “avatar” (like from the last air bender), and told me that she’s psychic. I was pretty shocked and unsettled by it, but I just kind of listened and went along with it. My other two roommates responded the same way when she came out to them. For a while she stopped talking about it, but lately, she’s been bringing up her delusional beliefs in pretty much every conversation.

I try not to enable or validate the beliefs much, but the other day, I made the mistake of asking her questions in order to get a better understanding of what she believes. Now, I am pretty disturbed. 

Here’s some of what she said:
- She hears voices, and believes that they are people telepathically communicating with her. She believes that her EX boyfriend talks to her telepathically, even though he blocked her on everything. She also thinks that she hears people’s thoughts 

- She believes that the guy she’s seeing is a wizard (and has told her telepathically, NOT verbally) and she wants to turn him into a vampire so she can be with him forever. I asked her how she plans on doing this, and she said she wants to do a blood ritual where she 
“kills his soul” and makes him drink her blood

- She told me she thinks about drinking people’s blood. I asked her how she plans on doing that, and she said that she could “maybe sedate them and then harmlessly feed off them without them knowing” 

- She said that a ghost has possessed her body and killed her soul. The ghost was controlling her and making her say and do things that she didn’t want to do. 

- believes she is immortal and is immune to COVID-19

- she claims that she is “the last witch” and there are no other witches in the world other than her

- She is the Avatar, but she didn’t talk about it much

- Any time I questioned her, she told me I won’t understand because I’m a human. 

Last week Amy announced that it was her “25th birthday”, even though she is actually legally 27 and her birthday is in January. When my other roommate (M 20) questioned her, she said that she celebrates three birthdays in a year and that she has three different ages. She thinks that she is simultaneously, 18, 25, and 27. 18 because that’s the age she was when the “ghost took away her soul”. She’s 25 because that’s when the began her immortal life as a vampire, but she’s legally 27. 

Amy seems completely detached from reality, and it’s very unsettling to me. I don’t think she’ll harm me in any way, but it still makes me quite uncomfortable.
 
She also gets very hostile if you question her at all. I don’t want to rock the boat by telling her I don’t believe her, but I also don’t want to enable the beliefs.

I know that she’s dealt with a lot of traumatic things in her life, but she refuses to get help because therapists don’t believe she a vampire. I think that she is clinging to these delusions to help her to escape from reality or to possibly make her feel as though she has power and is over other people. 

Besides this, she is a very nice person and it’s sad that she’s so consumed by these delusions.

TL;DR My roommate (F27) has severe untreated mental issues. She has delusions of being a vampire, a witch, and the Avatar. A lot of her beliefs seem like they’re straight from movies. She hears voices and believes that ghosts possess her body. I started feeling uncomfortable when she started talking about wanting to drink blood, and I’m not sure what to do

If anyone can give me some advice or insight, I would really appreciate it! I have no idea how to get her so seek help since she doesn’t believe she has a problem 

What does this sound like??? A plea of attention? possible schizophrenia?

Edit: I’m not sure if I added this, but her brother also had schizophrenia and hears voices. Amy believe that he doesn’t have schizophrenia and that the voices he hears are “real”"
69,"Nothing feels real and I keep making myself have intense daydreams to cope, what is wrong with me?","Since the beginning of the summer I’ve been in a dream like state where nothing feels real, as if this isn’t the reality I’m supposed to be in and I’ll wake up at some point. I make myself have intense daydreams where I literally act out conversing with someone at a fictional place like hogwarts, with marvel characters etc. I feel so sad and numb due to this and it almost feels as though I could injure myself greatly and it wouldn’t matter because I’m in a dream and nothing I perceive is real. What is wrong with me?"
70,I tend to have a very manipulative behavior towards my female friends,"For some background:  I had a lot of issues in my childhood, one trauma followed by the next. The consequences of that is that I lack some communication abilities, which I try to learn in my therapy.

I met my best friend (21 F) 2 years ago through an online friend. We became really close really fast. She helped me through alot and so did I. Eventually she became my litte sister and I love her to pieces. At first my feelings towards her would be part of my trauma, but I just caught feelings. We even made a pact that if someone would catch feelings we would tell eachothter. Since I denied it untill recently I never told her. 

In the 2 years we had some great memes like getting married, roleplaying as couples for a couple of seconds and these kind of things. And I kind  of liked that alot. I said I love ya a bunch of times, we would call every evening and for me I really started to see this friendship as a relationship. 

She caught feelings for one of my best friends, and I became so envy, since I thought we were a couple. I was expecting things she should never ever do like saying I love you back. I got so mad and sad about it that I tried to guilttrap her perfectly. Saying things like ""I wouldn't have done such things without you"" or ""I dont wanna take your freedom away from you"" and did the opposite. 

Yesterday wr had a huge fight, were we would shout at each other for some of these things and then she said ""you are acting like we are in a relationship, and I think you just broke up with me."" (the context is not important, just the sentence.) 

I didn't even realise what I had done and I feel so much regret towards her, especially when my friend which she is into is around. 

I think that will heal after a while, but I need some advice towards my manipulative behavior towards her. Do you guys have any suggestions, like Subreddits, books and such? 
I will talk. with my therapist about it aswell."
71,I have to break up with my partner and I can’t stop crying.,"I didn’t ever want it to come to this, but I don’t see another option for me. I know this is what’s best for both of us, but I never ever wanted to break his heart in a million years. I truly love him, but love isn’t enough to keep the fire burning. There are too many issues to continue.

I just want a hug."
72,It is a weird feeling,"I have suffered with mental illness since a child. I was always stressed, depressed and always had something going on that was difficult. I have self-harmed, always beat myself up but lately I have changed. I don’t think for the better but who knows.

I have stopped wanting to end everything, I’m at a place where I am not scared anymore. I used to be scared of death, scared of missing out on things... I’m not actively wanting to die but I don’t have motivation for living. I think I want to lose weight but what’s the point. Think about finishing school but why? I’m not sad about it. I could live the rest of my life like this and be content. I don’t know how to explain this feeling. There’s no pleasure in doing things. 

I think of it as the feeling right before you die. Where you just accept everything as it is. Like a clarity that this is life. You live - you die. I’m bored. Life has no meaning. 

And because I’m autistic I’m still stressed all day but just because I get out of bed when really I’d just like to lay here forever. 

Does this make sense? Does anyone else get this feeling? It is a bad feeling?"
73,I started eating again!!!!,I finally ate something today! I haven’t tasted anything in a while. The nice tasting of egg in the morning was amazing! At lunch my friends sent me these bagel bite things to try and we ate lunch all together on a FaceTime call! It was the greatest! At dinner my (again) my friends helped me make spaghetti on The FaceTime call!  They were so proud of me! I feel amazing! And I hope you feel amazing too! Have an amazing day/night Thank you!
74,I don't know how to help my brother,[removed]
75,I am wrong?,"If therapy hasn’t worked for me, am I expecting others to fix my problem. If therapy hasn’t worked for me, do I need a new therapist. But I need to see what I CAN and CAN NOT control. Am I being honest and willing to accept suggestions? We are all flawed and we will all experience folks who have no compassion, folks who don’t seem to listen, and folks who don’t support us. Am I taking as much action as I can? Because there are people with mental health illnesses living healthy and happy lives..can we share each other’s experiences and learn from each other? Let’s blame no one but give ourselves power to become who we want to be. Let’s inspire each other. Thank you for listening!"
76,How can I feel more like me,"Hey my name is Ethan I’m 19 and I’m on a journey to be myself and recover from my depression and In the recent days I have discovered a big problem that causes a lot of my negative symptoms is avoiding my feelings. Since I was little I was very sensitive and that was both a good thing and a bad thing, as I got older I started to hate how I feel and just avoided my feelings thinking it would make my life easier and that has caused a dissociation with myself. I manipulated myself to not feel and I’m at the point now where I know I have feelings(for the longest I felt like a robot without feelings) but it’s like I keep on disconnecting and reconnecting with my feelings. It’s like my unconscious self is so deeply scared to feel bad emotions. Does anyone know any habits or practices or things to do to help me connect myself to my feelings and get me out of my head? Btw I’m in therapy and in antidepressants which aren’t really helping."
77,Should I go to the hospital?,"Hello. I [18F], had a bit of an anxiety attack a few days ago and I think went through a psychotic episode. I was sitting in the corner of my room playing with the LED lights attached to my bed and blasting music as loud as I could. Then I photoshopped pictures of my family members onto a picture of a worm and was laughing hysterically about it all while feeling extremely anxious and battling s.h. urges. I feel one of those episodes coming on again tonight. If it happens again, should I admit myself to the hospital? I’m afraid it’ll get worse and I’ll actually end up self harming."
78,Constantly Thinking About Suicide But Scared To Die,"I (19F) have an okay life. I have a beautiful 9 month old daughter, and a nice boyfriend. I’ve always had mental health issues, since about grade 6 when I first started dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. 
My mom doesn’t support taking medication so I never got to go to the dr for anything up until maybe two years ago. They gave me lorazepam and another thing for anxiety. I had to be hospitalized a few times due to panic attacks, especially ones in my sleep that would make me stop breathing. 
During my pregnancy and after, my mental health started to deteriorate. Just life and relationship issues. And for like the past 5 months I’ve been having major symptoms of BPD, every day. And it’s a struggle. I haven’t been to the doctor in about 7 months, the last time I was there I told him I was having suicidal thoughts and stuff. He said he was putting me on medication and getting me a therapist but idk what happened to that. 
It’s weird because I think of suicide on my HAPPY days, and not on my bad ones. The worst days are where I feel empty and do want to die. I don’t think I could ever act on it, I’m terrified of death and what comes after and I constantly think about it. 
I wonder if it really is peaceful and then I feel shitty, because my life isn’t terrible. 
I’m going to get help soon, I just need to actually push myself to make the call. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say, just anything that comes to mind I guess. 
Especially since almost a week ago, this guy I used to like killed himself. Makes me wonder like, it can’t be that bad right?
And with my mental health issues I have this attention seeking tendency, and I think “I wish I could kill myself, and then come back to life a week later just to see how people miss me and what they would say.”
I wonder how much it would hurt and how I would do it. I think about randomly jumping out of my car while my boyfriend drives us down a highway. I just felt like I needed to say it somewhere without offending any family members about my suicidal ideation. 

Thanks for reading, if you read it all. I just needed to get that out."
79,P!ease someone just support me right now. Im losing my gf and life because of my mental health.,I have borderline personality disorder and this paranoia came out of nowhere and i spewed toxic crap out of my mouth about life and people to her for the first time. I think i left her speechless. I think im gonna get broken up with again. Im having visual hallucinations like blue strings of light bolting across the sky. I cant keep a job. What else can i do now. Im reading dbt
80,Distinguished Gentleman's Ride,"This past Sunday was the ""Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"". It's an annual event where people dress up dapper and ride vintage motorcycles to raise money for mental health resources and prostate cancer research.  This was my first year riding for this cause. I've been riding over 10yrs but mainly keep to myself and to be honest have been to depressed to ride for many years. This year was different though.
I've struggled with anxiety and depression the majority of my life so this was pretty easy to get behind. Riding solo took the pressure of riding with a million people away (solo ride was the theme because of the pandemic). I was able to stop by a friend's house and my sisters which was nice. 

Over the years I've been on over 40 medications, in and out of hospitals and treatment centers etc, I've been working my ass of for years trying to find some quality of life. Granted, I still struggle a lot, (even today I was stuck on my couch all day for the first time in a while) but I get back up and have more tools then ever to stay functional. Just wanted to say there is hope! You never know how things can change, there's always something else to try. I recently became a certified yoga instructor, who knew?! 


Anyway, I took my 10yr old niece (very slowly!) around the block. It was her first time on a bike and the most exciting thing that's ever happened to her! I've raised almost $800 which is very humbling. There's still time to donate if you want to raise funds for mental health resources alongside prostate cancer research until Oct 11th. Any amount helps.

Just wanted to share. Hang in there everyone. We don't have to be defined by our diagnosis. At the same time it's so important to reduce the stigma.

81,I’m new here I don’t know if this is allowed,
82,Finally admitting it to myself.,"I've tried to bottle up and deny how much everything has affected me this year just so I can carry on with daily life and pretend theres some normalcy left.
But there really isn't. It's easy to say 'thats obvious' but to truly comprehend is a whole nother concept. I haven't been oblivious or ignorant but very numb. I'd snap if I wasn't.
But it fell into full blown depression.
Nothing makes me happy anymore. I don't want to talk to people or to my friends. I just want to be alone. I'm a little introverted but I've never experienced dejection like this before. No desire to seek anyone out. No need to interact. I've become bitter."
83,Really cool eye opener,"Hey everyone, I came across this podcast episode from some Aussie podcast. I found it super helpful and informative and you might too 😊
I really liked the guys point about money and positive mentality! But the whole thing was really cool and surprisingly upbeat! 
Hope you enjoy 😊

84,lonely af,damn why is it so hard to find friends who actually give a shit. i mean i don't expect them to literally take care of me but itd be nice if someone understood and took the time to educate themselves on what i experience and give unconditional love cause damn id do the same
85,Trouble crying and laughing?,"I would say I am a pretty happy guy (19yrs old) I’m at a good stage in my life and I’ve learned a lot from my experiences and I try to keep growing. Compared to my past. I’ve been exercising a lot, eating healthy, drinking lots of water, and focusing on self love everyday.

This one issue I have is with being able to express genuine emotion. I think I’ve suppressed my emotions in the past, like forced myself to stop crying when I felt the need to or forced myself not to laugh at something I found funny because of the setting I was in. I went through some stuff in high school that put me through the ringer emotionally, and I think I’ve struggled to really put that behind me and forgive myself for things out of my control. But like I said, I’m working on it everyday.

Nowadays, it’s extremely hard for me to get an honest laugh out. Like I watch and read things that I believe are funny, and I get the humour, but I just don’t have that genuine reaction of a laugh. And I’ve tried as hard as I possibly can to cry, thinking of the saddest things imaginable to me and I just can’t get a tear out. One time a few months ago I just started crying after getting angry and couldn’t stop for like 20 minutes and it felt amazing. I want to release myself here and there with some emotion, but I just can’t get it out.

I’ve been doing some research on suppressing emotions and the connection to the nervous system, and I’m aware it’s very unhealthy to hold back emotions so I’m trying to reverse what I may have done.

If I keep trying to let my emotions out, instead of holding them in, will it get easier? Will I eventually be able to cry if I get more used to pulling that emotion out? Would that help me to laugh more as well? Would love some opinions :)"
86,Help with boundaries?,"Hi, my (39f) now exhusband (39m) and I broke up about 3 weeks ago after 12 years. We have to live together till he finds a place to go which I fear may be a while. We also have a 6 yr old daughter. The issue is I have an anxiety and panic disorder and he’s staying out all night or till 3 or 4 am often. Those nights I have full blown panic attacks. I’ve explained many times and different ways and asked him not to do this till he moves out but he does it anyways. How do I establish boundaries in this situation? What would be good boundaries to have? What would be a fair compromise on the staying out? What do I do if he keeps coming home late or not at all? Is it fair to ask him to leave if he has nowhere to go? I get he needs to have a life and do things too. I’m also at home with just our daughter due to schools being virtual while he works 50 hours a week and I don’t get much of a break ever. Tonight he went out drinking at a bar and I have $22 in my account after getting our daughter a haircut today. How do I not hate him?"

88,"My parents claim to want to help yet almost everything they do is harmful. I'm so sick of it, and I'm so tired of them controlling me so hard that I just had a meltdown over a cupcake.","My mother is the worst control freak I have ever met and my father's helicopter parenting caused me to miss out on so much growing up, as well as keeping me stuck in the house with my mom. I hate calling her that. I hate it so much. I have PTSD because of some of the things this woman has done to me and she gets mad at me when I freeze up because of it and labels me disrespectful. She has been made aware that I have PTSD and that she is a big trigger for me but won't leave me alone anyway. She claims she wants to ""fix"" things but has absolutely no respect for my privacy or space. When I started barging into her room like she does to me she tells me it is unfair and has begun to lock her door, which has an actual key. If I lock my door (the kind that all you need is a pin to unlock it) I get into trouble. My father has actually removed the door from it's hinges when I was embarrassingly old for that to even be considered as a punishment. My mental health is so bad that I cannot leave their house and I have nowhere else to go. It feels like they're trying to keep me in this state just so that I stay at home. Every time I tell them I'm leaving, my mother has some kind of threat for me, like not letting me take my fish with me but getting rid of them herself. I have 8 tanks and care a great deal about my fish so I'm not talking about something I can just sneak out of the house and buy new supplies for.  She also regularly tells me that I'm going to kill her or I'm going to make her and my dad get divorced. It would be good for him, I say. The most concerning of these threats is that she tells me she is going to get a conservatorship over me if I leave. I told her I would kill myself if she did. She still wants to and is fucking rich as hell so will probably be able to and my only chance would be to break down crying and screaming in a courtroom about how I can't stay with these people.

When my mother is angry at me sometimes she trashes my room. When I am gone, she rearranges my room under the pretense that she is helping, but she wants things to be the way she wants them to be and she also wants to snoop on me. Literally every time I leave the house to go on any sort of trip that is good for my well-being, I come home to my entire room rearranged. Every single time she has done this I have a straight up meltdown. It's horrible and I can't control it. She throws fits over it and sometimes ends up not talking to me for days (to my benefit). I should mention that my mother is an experienced aquarium hobbyist so she knows what she is doing with fish but every single time I leave at least 2-4 of my fish are dead when I come back, which is extremely abnormal. I rarely ever have deaths of my fish and they're usually ones I see coming. Going back to her rearranging my room, I have woken up to her doing so multiple times and often only have the capacity to let myself sleep during the day when she is at work, for this reason as well as just her presence causes me major anxiety. Whenever I do something she doesn't like she threatens to quit her job and ""spend all that time with me"" which makes me strongly feel like she knows the kind of anguish she causes me and it fucks me up that a parent would first of all, do things to their kid that causes them to develop PTSD, and second, purposely trigger that PTSD.

Up until things started to get bad with my parents I was a fantastic kid. I worked hard in school, I did my best, I didn't touch drugs, and I mostly did everything they said (if I didn't it was because they refused to let me be diagnosed with ADHD and I got distracted very easily). When the bitch I get yelled at for not referring to as mom decided to snoop and read my journal she found out that I was transgender and did not like that one bit. I was immediately made me go to a Christian therapist. See, they're too smart for me or mostly anyone else to handle, and they realize that actual conversion therapy would have definitively made them the bad guys in other people's eyes. Recently, bitch has told me that the reason she was going through my journal was because she thought I was suicidal and had gone through many journals in the past for years thinking I was suicidal, but never did anything about it. You read that right. Am I wrong to be angry here?

Neither of my parents knock on my door even though I have made a huge deal about it over and over. I've started to lock my door even though it gets me into trouble because I can't stand people just barging in.

My father has always just told me to have patience with my mother, but recently he told me that he would try to work on things with her and try to get her to treat me differently. Things have only gotten worse. I even sent my dad a page in a book on toxic parents that was the embodiment of my mother. He just told me he would try to change things, yet he never acknowledges that she has done anything wrong, only that I have.

I'm so frustrated because she is extremely manipulative and a controller who is described as ""the helper"". I cannot do anything on my own or gain any independence. Things I beg her not to do these things that drive me insane to the point that I have meltdowns when they happen, such as what I said earlier about her rearranging my room. She even ripped down all my posters and covered the walls with crosses :). I went to college for 2 years and have dropped out partially due to depression with my parents being a huge reason for my being depressed. My mother continued to control me from hundreds of miles away. Before I left she has gone through all the things I am taking both years of college and added and taken out whatever she felt like. I had meltdowns because of this too. I begged her and begged her not to do this to me because I was in a tiny room and didn't have the space and both years of college my room has been full of stacks of boxes and crates she insisted on my having that I didn't touch once. Having clutter is a big problem for me and makes me even more depressed. Because she did it multiple times my freshman year of college I begged her not to send me any food or anything this year and she told me she would not. She decided to make me a cake for my birthday and visit me anyway. I felt like I couldn't refuse the cake because she made it. Then she was insistent on a birthday lasagna which I initially refused but eventually gave into. When she got there, there was so much food it filled up my whole fridge and freezer, really pissing off my roommates, who I had been working really hard to get to know. I went in my room and cried for hours. My partner, who is my goddamn savior took some of the food to his apartment. I felt like I couldn't throw it out or do anything with it other that eat it or maybe share it. Now my mother is mad that I've gained 50 lbs, and I'm mad too because I was briefly happy with my weight for the first time in my life. Some of the weight gain is my fault, sure, but it wouldn't have happened, or at least not to that extent if she hadn't forced so much food on me. I have told her many times that it makes me very depressed and usually I just get into trouble for it. I had to go off my ADHD meds for anxiety reasons and I have trouble doing things. Every time I miss a chore or task, I am forced by both parents to stand there and watch them do it, or occasionally made to do it very slowly with a parent standing there and way more explanation than necessary. I don't feel like an adult and I feel so trapped in this house. 

I avoid letting my mother contact my friends because she always finds some way to humiliate me or get them into trouble and make them want to cut contact. My parents kicked me out of the house when I was 18 with no shoes or phone during winter. I walked over a mile to the place where my best friend was working his literal first day of his first job ever and just sat on the curb waiting for him to come out. One of his coworkers asked if I was waiting for someone and he came out wondering what I was doing there because they were closed. I told him what happened and he gave me his coat and turned his car and heat on. We got back to his house and discovered that his mother had had, without saying too much, the kind of medical emergency that often kills people, although she was in stable condition. We stood in his backyard and cried together for a few minutes, the only time we have ever cried in front of each other, and he let me sleep on the couch in his basement. His grandmother was home but she didn't know I was there, as he didn't want to complicate things. A few hours later, some police officers showed up, getting him into trouble, and getting me banned from his house for a few years. The best part? My parents told them I ran away. They must have bribed the cops or something because when I asked if I had to go back, they told me yes. On the way back I explained what was happening and practically begged them not to take me back. I was just told, ""they'll accept you one day"" bullshit. fucking bullshit. I'm a suicide attempt in and they still haven't figured it out. During the hunt to find me, they also knocked on the door of the only friend they really knew of (a person I was sort of dating at the time) and this resulted in them not being allowed to see me anymore because they spouted their shit about me running away. There have been multiple other instances when they have done things to get my friends into trouble, but this was the double whammy, as well as the first.

If I don't respond to the million texts she sends daily, she gets angry. If I respond incorrectly, she gets angry. If she has a bad day at work, she takes her anger out on me. My father rarely intervenes on my behalf, and anytime she tells him I did anything wrong, I get punished for it by my father, no questions asked. 

She seems to do everything she possibly can to upset me and tells everyone about my problems after I've asked her not to. She tells everyone about awful things I say to her and turned them against me, all the while exaggerating and making no mention of the way she treats me. My entire family thinks that I'm an awful person who takes out their anger on their mother, when she is the one who takes out anger on me. She throws fits whenever I don't tell her what's going on and I've been hiding that I may have a serious immune disorder because I do not want her to know, I do not trust her, and I do not like her. She outed me to my entire extended family, the church I am forced to go to, and random coworkers. She spoke to my therapist under the pretense that she was going to try to find some ways to help but didn't seem to actually do that. What she did do, however, was tell my therapist that if she called my by my chosen name, she would pull her insurance out and not allow me to see her anymore. 

My mother is constantly angry at me seemingly for everything I do so I avoid her as much as possible, which makes her more angry. I can't win. I can't even finish the race. I just turned 21 and managed to spend my first actual trip away from my family with my partner over my 21st birthday, as he lives in a different state at the moment. I found out from my cousin that she told all of the relatives on her side of the family not to get me anything for my birthday. They know her, so they understand how angry she would be had they done so. Even so, my aunt brought me lunch and a package of 6 cupcakes that I was really looking forward to, and 2 that I specifically was really excited for. I was leaving the next morning so I put all the cupcakes in the freezer with a note on them that said happy birthday (given name). We'll get back to why this is important later.

I spent my time with my boyfriend and although I wouldn't have called myself happy because I haven't really experienced that in years, I was in the least pain I've been in for a long time and I was really enjoying myself. My mother called a few times and didn't get the hint that I was busy and couldn't be on the phone right now, creating some awkward situations with his family. At one point, when it was almost time to come home she would not stop sending me messages like ""don't forget to bring home \_\_\_\_"" ""don't forget to \_\_\_\_\_\_"" ""get antacids for the bus ride"" and after a bunch of messages like this I said, ""yes. I'm fine. I can take care of myself. Please stop treating me like I can't."" I am a blunt person but usually try to sugarcoat things around my folks. She just wasn't getting it though. She blew up my phone after that with nasty messages and didn't speak to me after I got home for 2 days (thank god but it was terrifying to run into her in the house). Was I too disrespectful? Apparently so.

I got home and one of my cupcakes was missing. I was upset but my dad fessed up when I asked, apologized, and even asked if he could replace it. My dad is by far the better parent. He's more of a normal parent with a few issues but he does try sometimes, even though he tends to be an enabler. My whole family knew what happened though and at this point, even to the golden child, my brother, it was obvious that those were my goddamned cupcakes. Nobody else on my mom's side really gave me much of anything other than Jesus books and I don't get much of anything from my dad's side usually either. This was a few days ago. I just went to go get the one I was saving for myself that I was really looking forward to and it was gone. Had a meltdown. Can't have anything in this goddamn house. Didn't bother playing detective, just started freaking the fuck out and went into my room and locked the door. I cried over a cupcake. They have such an emotional hold over me and it bothers me so much when they take things that I cried and had a full-on meltdown over a cupcake. Jesus Fucking Christ am I tired. I know this sounds like a first world problem if I ever heard one, but my point is that things like this did not used to bother me much at all.

I may be autistic. I probably am but I have yet to get an official diagnosis. It feels so stupid having these meltdowns when I don't know for sure. I feel that it makes me a child, incapable of caring for myself.

Feel free to leave suggestions. I can't leave just yet but the opportunity may arise to move in with my partner soon. I've just been put on antidepressants but they have yet to take effect.

I'm especially worried about my mother trying to get a conservatorship. What evidence can I gather that this would be the absolute worst thing she could do? I plan on getting my psychiatrist and therapist involved if need be but I don't want to put my friends on the spotlight."
89,Marijuana saved my life and ruined it at the same time.,"
I was a straight A student and Valedictorian of my high school class. Became a pothead my 2nd week of university. Switched majors from engineering to philosophy and graduated with 2.xx GPA. Got a job with the government (no piss test) and obtained an ADHD prescription. Took too much addy and synthetic marijuana, had a psychotic break, resulting in tazor and mental hospital visit. Diagnosed Bipolar and given 15+ different pills over the course of 5 years. Felt suicidal because I was in a constant state of confusion. Got laid off after a terrible manic episode that lasted weeks. Got kicked out of my church because my social media postings were all smokeshows and sex tips. My two week bender ended with me in jail for just under a month (felony failure to appear charge for missing a court date because I was being held in a mental hospital). 

In that month the jail had no medication for me (Vraylar is expensive) and so I coped and went through my withdrawals. Decided then and there I never wanted to be in the pocket of a fuckkng psychiatrist ever again. I’ve been on zero medications for almost a year now. To cope, I smoked every day — all the while contributing absolutely nothing to society. 

Today I’m one week completely sober. I’m also terribly manic at the moment but I’m proud that I recognize my false thoughts now and can combat them with willpower and cigarettes. I’m never taking another psych med again. I have an emergency blunt ready to go if I’m ever feeling psychotic. Marijuana is a double edged sword. And I need a job because fuck being a degenerate pot head. I’m better than that. Thanks for reading if you got this far :) 


TL;DR — Bright kid got addicted to weed and addy subsequently became bipolar, was prescribed 15 different pills over 5 years and became suicidal. Flushed all pills and picked up the weed again. Today: 30 years old, semi-pothead, semi-manic, but happily breathing."
90,I feel stupid of my actions.,"This happened last monday in school. My friends and I were having a speaking test and we were having a discussion for evaluation. I spoke against A and A didnt have time to defend her points since the time was up. A got mad at me saying how I ruined her score for the test and how I was going to pay her to retake again. I told A that as long she took a turn in speaking the content is not a big issue. She got offended and proceed to tell everyone in the class. Everyone said that there wasnt a problem but she insisted that she was right. I cried because I feel so guilty thinking it was my fault. I went to counselor and the counselor said none of this was my fault. I cried about this for 3 days, I thought if I apologise to A, I would at least have closure. My sister and other classmates told me to shrug it off and not think about it but I did it because Im ridden with guilt (and also trauma). I wanted to tell it to A personally but she was eating. I asked A to talk to me but I did in front of the  classmates who told me not to do it and I apoplogise to A. A didnt react to it. Thats when I knew I was overeacting. I quickly pack my bags and leave with tears on my face. I felt stupid thinking why did I do it and now I am wallowing in my sadness now. Im feel embarrass because I didnt listen to my classmates and my sister and Im crying here non stop and I cant not go to school because exam is coming but she sits next to me and her constant silence is just a reminder to me of my mistakes."
91,So weak and tired 😭just so so tired mentally and physically. Can't hang on another day,"In my 20's &amp; I can’t breathe another day. I promised myself I’d stay just a little longer and I did. Nothing will ever change. Every single day I feel the same way and it’s been like this for an entire year. Just why, why another day 😭I hate this world so so much

No energy to eat, breathe, talk, think, work hard for anything, no energy to push myself to think about dreams I used to have, goals, no desire to get a better job, or figure out any more of my life.

I just want to die so so bad this entire year. Nothing has changed. I just want it more and more. I'm just scared I won’t be successful now. I’m scared to hurt other people. I should be able to just do it. It's all I want.

I'm so weak in every way, so embarrassed by myself, I'm such a loser, and just so pathetic. I hate my soul and body so much. I hate everything about this world. Just crying, again and again, every night. I can’t do this. I understand that people have it worse. I just don’t want to be here. I see life as something pointless, ugly, and it would make no difference if I died tomorrow. Just can’t do this. I feel so bad for loved ones. I’m so sorry for them. I truly am. I just can’t anymore. I held on for as long as I could."
92,I think my job is making me loose it mentally?,"First things first, I work with mentally disabled individuals. We have a lot of open shifts, hence my workload is big. 

There was a point that I was getting really good at my job, but now I'm struggling with saying the right thing, I'm tired pretty much all the time, working about 60 hours a week. My two days off feature 8 to 9 children ages range from 8 months to 13 years staying at the house from 8am to 5pm(they are also here on the day that I'm working, although I assume they aren't on weekends. I can't get weekends off  because my boss needs those days off (she works more than me, and, lately, better) my boss keeps informing me that I'm wording things wrong, or I can't say certain things to them (I completely agree with her) my boss is used to not having a vacation(she's worked with the company for 12/13 years) I'm used to having a vacation and I haven't had one since January of last year. Or the year before, I'm not sure. My boss was saying something lately about ""can't wait for a vacation"" when she took one late last year. I've been having workers take advantage of me, having me do the work their way, come to find out that they were wrong, or wanting easier work for them. My anger/frustration has been getting to the point of mildly taking it out on the guys. I'll say the wrong thing and when i catch myself, I get mad at myself. I've gotten to the point of breaking, I'll cry it off and then I'll be good again. I've been thinking about going to on call come January, that way I get a break. I love working with the guys, but I can't help them if I can't help myself. Just not sure what to do without stepping back.

Tl:dr: I'm working 60+ hours and need a break from work where everyone seems to take advantage of me in some way. I still want to work there, just not as much as I have been, but we are short staffed. I'm getting confused/frustrated by the confusion of everyone putting in their input and confusing me, plus I've been getting mad/angry and verbally taking it out with the guys."
93,I got my life back together.,"This is gonna be a bit long and not very accurate, as pretty my memory is foggy when it comes to my really bad years.

So back in grade 9 I was more or less just going with the wind, I had almost zero motivation and most days I struggled to get out of bed in the mornings. At this point I was struggling with school. Not because I couldn't grasp it academically, but because I missed a lot of classes. At the time both me and my parents thought it was a health condition, something like an iron deficiency. However I got through the year without failing any classes. I simply moved on and when school rolled back around in September I was doing fine-ish. Grade 10 didn't go to well, I went to school for the first two weeks I think. Every day of those two weeks was awful, my energy level was abysmal, I could barely get out of bed, and I started having suicidal thoughts. Eventually I just stopped going to school. I couldn't force myself out of bed most days, I would only really get out of bed to eat and use the bathroom. After about a month of that my parents got concerned and talked to my school counselor. I ended up in a counselling program at the school, it didn't really help anything and I still wasn't attending school. I'm pretty sure it was around this time that I had talked to my family doctor about getting on antidepressants. IIRC I ended up on escitalopram in mid November and it worked for the most part, but I was still suicidal. I had ended up deciding with my parents and school counselor to go back to school in the second semester with new classes and such. I ended up putting myself on a waiting list for CYMH (Child and youth mental health services) somewhere in the neighborhood of early November. I was lined up to get a counselor with CYMH around July.  Winter break came and went. In early January I got in an argument with my dad at about 7-8:00 pm and I cried under my desk for a while before calling my mom and asking her to take me to the hospital. I went to the hospital and the psychiatric nurse wasn't there that night. They gave me the option to stay the night or go home and come back in the morning, as I was evaluated to not be an immediate threat to myself. I ended up going home. My mom got me chicken nuggets on the way back from the hospital and damn if those weren't the best chicken nuggets I've ever had. I went back to the hospital in the morning and got a proper evaluation. It was decided that I would be okay to go home and so I did. Having gone to the hospital pushed me up the waiting list for CYMH. A couple of weeks later I went back to school and I was okay for a while. In about February I got a counselor with CYMH. I started to fall off of school a bit around this point in march. After spring break I stopped going to school entirely. I ended up coming off the escitalopram and started on sertraline in around April. Nothing really happened until summer when I did a ""summer camp"" with CYMH. It was more or less group therapy via recreation, and I enjoyed it until it was over in august. In late July I came off of the sertraline because of side effects and started on fluoxetine. In late august I wasn't on a high enough dose of fluoxetine to influence my mood, and I was feeling well so I ended up coming off meds entirely. I was lined up to start in an alternate school program in September, which I did. The first couple weeks went okay, but I started having panic attacks. In late September I had a pretty bad cold and I was out of school for about 4 days I tried to come back to it but my motivation was really bad and I had a hard time. In early October I strained my left adductor playing lacrosse and I just gave up on school. At this point I had multiple panic attacks every day. I just kind of floated for a number of months until I decided to get my life back in order. That was when covid hit and I just couldn't really get anything together. I had made plans to start going to the gym with my friend and covid just kind of said ""no."" Time passed and I waited. I talked to my doctor about the panic attacks and after some deliberation I ended up on prazosin in late July. The prazosin made the panic attacks go from multiple a day to maybe once a week, and it made my life so much easier. Anyway in August I signed up for a gym without my friend sadly, I've been going there for a month or so now. I started in a really good school program 2 weeks ago and I feel the best I have in years. For the first time in a long time I feel genuinely happy.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Grade 9 was rough I failed grade 10 twice and now I go to the gym and feel happy."
94,I bottled my emotions to the point I rarely feel anything now,"I feel like I can't even express how I feel properly. I'm tired of being here and wish I could just end it, but I can't. I couldn't put my mom and online friends through that.

I'm so tired of being numb and apathetic to everything and trying my best to not let that show to anyone. I feel bad over how I feel because everyone deserved so much better from me. They deserve someone who genuinely felt emotion over their issues and what they were going through. They deserve someone who trusted them enough to open up to them over what's going on in my life. I feel like I was just a mistake and ruin almost everything. 

I feel like this is my fault too. I hated how sensitive I was as a kid, I never thought being numb would be so much worse.

It's pathetic that I've felt like this since I was like 10 and I'm 24 now. I can't even get to a dr to see if there's anything wrong for varying reasons, I feel like such a failure."

96,My recovery Eating Disorders (ED) journey!,"Hi, I'm Ambra, I’ve said this before but being authentic means a lot to me. I want to walk against the crowd and expose the less glamorous moments as well. So here’s how life was like before and after my Eating Disorder recovery (in a nutshell of course).

**Before my ED recovery**

Not at my lowest weight (because my ED was more severe in the past) but I was still relatively small. *I cannot insert my pic here :(* 

I was still battling with binging, purging, and calorie-restricting behaviours.

I was afraid of food and eating. I had many rules around what I should or should not eat and would commonly categorise foods as “good” or “bad”. Exercising out of self-hate and self-punished

Constantly fatigued because I was undernourished

Shifts in my mood were very common

My hair fell excessively (so embarrassing).

My self-worth and value was dictated by a number on the scale

I hated how I looked and consciously, but also unconsciously, badmouthing my body.

That's so sad but totally true.

After all these symptoms were alarming. 

I told myself: ""Ambria, this is not worth it.  You are much so better than this. Are you seriously going to let society’s unrealistic standards of beauty dictate how you see yourself as a woman, is that really the kind of woman you want to be?""

So I began to rebel against my own toxic body image habits. 

**After recovery**

A healthier relationship with food, my body, and self

Have the mental freedom to enjoy life

Self-confidence and worth not affected by numbers on the scale.

Restored body’s natural weight

Workout because I love myself and I want to celebrate my body

Defined by my own standard of beauty, embrace all my imperfections

***I feel beautiful from the inside out***

Extremely grateful for my life

Have the energy and mental clarity to work towards my dreams and live my true purpose.

My sibling suddenly broke down and wanted to run away so my older sibling and I took him to our relative's house and are currently staying there. He is very angry at our parents and we don't know what to do or how to explain this to our parents since they aren't v understanding. My older sibling and I tried to call our mother and explain to her the situation but I don't know if she can't understand or she doesn't want to understand. I desperately need your help because even though we calmed him down now, we don't know what will be our next actions or how to fix this situation with our parents. He also doesn't want to talk to our parents and would just repeatedly shout in anger that he will harm himself instead so please I need your help and opinion."

100,These things help me the most with my mental wellbeing,"I've been experiencing bouts of depression for the past 4-5 years. Before then, I never thought I'd be the kind of person to be depressed. I was always happy, smiling, and even-keeled. 

It took a while for me to come to terms with it, but I've since found several things that help to get me through and out the other side.

**I wrote about them here:** [https://www.thenow.co/overcoming-depression/](https://www.thenow.co/overcoming-depression/)

I'm sharing them in the hope that they might help someone else who's going through similar stuff.

I'd be interested in hearing from others who have found these things helpful, too."
101,I don't know what to do,"I am a 20 year old male I have very good life I would say but for few years I have lost motivation to do anything I would just do something for the sake of it or only if someone says to do it I study cause I mean I have to and I like it but I would set goals for myself be it studies or going out or self development I would procrastinate or just won't do it and leave it for later I just feel like I don't have any motivation to do anything left. My family things it's because of my over weight that I have became lazy and that maybe the reason but I don't know. 
Any input or opinion is helpful
I am sorry if it's not clear I am not good at explaining my feelings."
102,Tired of these feelings. When will they end?,"I’m so tired of everything, and I don’t even know to what extent. I’m tired of waking up feeling like I’m about to cry and having that feeling all day. I’m tired of feeling like I’m lost in my own head, watching myself go about the day. I’m so tired of feeling like I’m on autopilot, like I can never feel truly happy or sad, or regret or pride for things I do. It’s like I don’t even react to these things. Make the track team again? Should be a great feeling. Nope, nothing. Just static in my head. I don’t even know what is causing it, or how long I’ve been his way. When did I notice? It feels like a blur. It’s like i died and came back to watch the show. My bipolar disorder is practically gone, but I don’t think in a good way. It’s like each side is just watching too, feeling sorry for me. Ups are hardly up, and downs just feel like a slightly worse day. Nothing helps. I hang out with friends, I want to be alone. I’m alone, I want to be with someone. Counseling goes nowhere, talking to people gives me nothing, venting feels like a waste of people’s time. I don’t know what to do, or how much longer I can keep this up. When I was younger, I had a recurring nightmare. I’d wake up tied to a chair, someone in the room. The someone was always someone in my life that I held close but ended up leaving, usually because we drifted apart. They never said a word, only stared blankly at me as I tried to talk to them. The dream would always end with them pointing a gun at me and pulling the trigger. Most of the time, it would wake me up, and others, another person would repeat the process. Those dreams have stopped. I wonder if they’ve stopped because I’ve run out of people to fill the role. Or maybe I’ve stopped caring. But I don’t want to stop caring, I want to care. I want to text and call my friends and have a life with them. But I can’t even figure out why I’m just blank. It’s infuriating, but at the same time, it’s nothing. I can ignore it no problem, but what does that do for me? How can I help myself at this point? Maybe, someone just needs to tell me that I’m broken and fucked up in the head. That this is my new normal. At least that way I could stop wondering what was wrong with me since I’d be normal. 


Sorry for the long read.

Anyone out there on Reddit with the secret words to fix me? It’s ok if they aren’t here. It’ll get better, or it won’t. But I’ll still be here until the day comes when I can’t handle this numbness anymore. 

Please help."

105,Low Self Esteem with no Apparent Source?,"I have pretty bad self esteem, like on the surface I know logically I’m pretty and hardworking and nice etc but in my core there’s still a lack in belief in myself for some reason.  Whenever I do so much as send someone a meme or something I’m afraid they’re going to hate it or find it offensive and yell at me, when I see I have a new text I immediately think it’s bad news or I’m in trouble or one of my friends is going to yell at me, I’m afraid to answer questions in school that I know the answer to because I’m afraid I’ll get laughed at, with every piece of art I publish I think about all the ways it could be interpreted as offensive or made fun of, and I’m almost always hesitant to offer my opinion on anything that affects other people, such as what movie to watch/what we should eat/etc because I think it will be instantly rejected.  I’ve been a pretty easy person to ignore since childhood, but aside from that, I’ve never been bullied, I have supportive, attentive and kind parents, I had good friends as a kid, I’ve never been abused in any way, I’ve always done well in school and work, and no one in my family really has any kind of self esteem problem, in fact they’re all super confident in themselves and their opinions.

I’ve looked online to see what could be the reason I am like this, and it always says either stuff happened to you or it’s genetic.  Even my therapist friend insists it’s something from my childhood but I remember being happy.  Could I just be denying/blocking something out?  Is it possible to just have spontaneous insecurity and distrust in oneself with no reason behind it?"

107,I just had a huge mental breakdown on my way home from work this late night of 2:30Am....My anxiety is causing me and my girlfriend to go at each other’s throats at least every other day over the most pitiful things. It’s like neither of us knows how to shut it down before it’s too late,"I have always known I had self induced mental pain from my past, before we began our relationship. 
Over our time, She has experienced that part of my stunted growth &amp; insecurities.

I have actually put a lot of that on her to deal with unintentionally, and at the beginning of us dating we fought, but things weren’t nearly as stressful. 

We’re fighting really hard together to stay together but from the way I see it, neither of us is as comfortable sharing and expressing our worst feelings with each other. I’ve always had issues with my temper, but as the year has gone by, I can see myself having way shorter burst of angst and bouts of frustration for the most simple things. She has been having a harder time focusing on school and I noticed that every semester since we started dating, she had to drop at least 2 classes, because it was too much work (she claimed her professors suck, prob to save my feelings) and i didn’t make it easy for her.

I love her so much. I once told her it wasn’t enough though....so I don’t even think she trusts me when I tell her I love her so much now. 
How can I stay with someone who tells me that they wish they had a better life? Oh, me and my misfortune of having this brain...

Pertaining to the post—I just had a mental breakdown, screaming and driving stomping on that pedal screaming “JUST KILL ME JUST KILL ME” as the RPM hits 6000..... Still kinda wish i lost it fully. Still kinda wish it could be done for me. 
A Big part of me wishes it just happened on accident. Sorry, I know that’s not appropriate but I hate how i feel like this—especially when there’s nobody there. 

I am becoming. too worrried to talk to anyone about my feelings. I don’t even keep in touch woth my friends or meet with them regularly (despite Co-vid) I don’t even play video games anymore like I used to. I feel so alone and left out from stuff i want to do, and when My girlfriend doesn’t recognize how that affects me, i feel like I should just accept “suffering” although that’s now what it really is....
It’s not that she won’t let me do this stuff, It’s really my anxiety....But i kinda wish i felt more support from her in doing things that I want to do for me....I don’t know how to explain that right to anyone really...

But besides that My girlfriend experiences her own mental pain far too often too and i’ve put so much on her and made her lose trust for me multiple times....How long should you stay with someone you don’t trust/can’t forgive ?"

111,Lack of friendship and no hope.,"I currently hate my life and I'm really stuck. I have no friends not even acquaintances, I do have family but I feel extremely lonely. I'm in highschool and I'm affraid of even looking at people. I get really anxious talking to a teen my age and I cannot take the invitation to start a conversation. Like I literally absolutely cannot just go up to someone and say hi. I dread this so much. I've accepted that I'm an awkward loner that is socially inept. Every day is the same limbo of depressing nothingness. Going to school is what I hate but also what I really desire. I'm containing my desires so much it's so painful.  I've tried listening to everyone. I even have a therapist but nothing is working. I've been like this for well over 2 years and It fucking sucks. My biggest fear is that it'll go on like this forever. I would seriously consider ending my life if I didn't have my family. I'm not sure what to do anymore."
112,I'm no longer suicidal !,The title says it all. It was by no means easy but I'm happier with myself again.
113,Caught my wife texting her friend about our argument. Should I be upset?,"I won't go into the back story too much, but I've had a significant mental health struggle for a while now. Yesterday in the morning I was feeling very anxious and irritable, and we were snarky with each other. I got agitated and said some things that were, well, snarky for lack of a better term.

After I calmed down, I explained that I was feeling horrible and I was sorry for everything. She knows I'm trying new meds and having a really rough time. 

Ok so I'm thinking it's ok and she understands. That evening, I notice she's got har phone lying there, so I just had a look. I wish I hadn't. In a text conversation, she described all the irritating things I did that morning, and expressed her frustration. This alone would have made me a little upset but I understand the need to vent sometimes. The really upsetting thing is that the idiot friend she was complaining to responded with ""oh you really need to leave that guy and get out of there"". There was some more, but that's the gist of it. 

I mean, her friend isn't the brightest person, and her relationship history has been a train wreck. She's got two kids with two different guys (never married or in a long relationship), and she has s pattern of failed relationships. Like seriously, she drives away anybody she dates for more than a few months. Nobody can stand her personality. She's the kind of person who could start a fight in an empty room. 

The most aggravating thing is that she is in absolutely no position to give anybody relationship advice. The most heartbreaking thing is that my wife would tell our personal issues to someone like that. This is the sort of thing you tell a therapist, not your
 dumbass ""friend"" who you barely ever hang out with. 

I'm feeling so hurt and betrayed right now."

Since the ad is quite emotional, I was wondering if any of you could share any experiences that I could put in the video ( you can say anonymously or not)

like (trigger warning), when your parents thought you were joking or lying about your mental heath condition, when your parents or *teachers* didn't believe you, when you couldn't pay for therapy, when your teacher took it as an excuse not a reason, when no one listened to you in school or at home.

Maybe you think that meantal health topics should be much more normalized in school! Tell me why!

Just write your experience or opinion, and if you want to stay anonymous.

Thank you so much!!!!"

120,I'm living cause I want a pet,"I know this is all cliche and whatever, but I really want a pet but my parents don't want me to. I have suicidal and intrusive thoughts and self harm a lot, I don't want to die but I don't feel alive either living in a world I'm not happy in. I was constantly sexually abused from 5 till 17, different guys, different years,same bullshit. I'm 17 and in my third year through the University and I'm really not the brightest, but my parents promised that if I get a good GPA I can get my masters degree in any country of my choice, I really didn't care cause I never wanted to get my masters degree any way. But I really want a pet, some reason to get out of bed in the morning, not drown myself in Minecraft and intrusive thoughts, something that's going to be really happy in my company, something I can love and vice versa and the thought of having one can keep me happy for a longer while than human presence can't. My University doesn't allow pets,I don't have any money to get one, I don't work yet cause my depressed ass won't let me, my parents aren't big fan of pets either so if I am getting one it's definitely not in their home. Then I realized if I picked a country far from home, I'd get my own apartment and definitely get a Golden Retriever, and ever since I got that thought I've been happy as hell, I've been doing research to improve my GPA when I eventually head back to school. In the next two years I'd get my own pet, in my own apartment in a country far away from people I know it gets me excited as hell.

Sometimes I feel like it'd never happen but then again, I really just want anything that'd keep me from ""accidentally"" getting a concussion or slitting my wrists and just the thought of me getting my very own Golden Retriever just makes me all mushy as hell inside and that's a feeling I'm not used to.

Maybe it's all in my head, maybe I'd never get to leave the country, maybe I'd never get my own place. I'm a huge pessimist but this just makes me want to keep my hopes up, no matter how long it takes, I'm going to get my pet."
121,Scamming on my own emotions,"Does anyone else ever feel very legitimate stress or any other negative emotional state in the moment when things are happening and then a few days later when it passes, even tho you know it will happen again because your situation hasn't changed (for example your job) but because you dont feel the immediate stressor anymore you start to feel like your stress response was unwarranted and not real or legit?"
122,"Therapist, no insurance? What options, if any?","

See title. The depressive bouts keep getting longer and longer and after years of tolerating it it’s pretty annoying to work around. I was tempted to write this out on an alt but I really can’t be bothered, the account will ironically probably outlive me and a legacy of shitty unnecessary arguments seems an apt summary of myself. Unfortunately I’m 19 and attending college which means most of my time is spent studying and not working so I don’t catch any insurance from work- on top of that I’m spending most of my paychecks keeping my car, car insurance and housing. I don’t think I could afford a therapist but I’m finding it increasingly more difficult to even focus on my studies. I would’ve checked out by now but I’ve been given the actually important role of taking care of my sister every day, so I can’t because it’d be annoying for her to end up going to my grandparents, it’d make my mother have to take a longer drive in the morning and that’d be a hassle- plus she’d probably associate worse gas mileage with her dead son, so..

Not interested in the phony “you’re loved you matter etc” corny Reddit wholesome 100 charade, please spare me from that *and* the ‘message me if you wanna talk’ routine. I literally just need to find out what options I have so I can start seeing if I can budget one in before I end up Swiss cheese-ing my brain.

I don't know what I want to do with my life and everything feels meaningless. I like a guy and his presence is the only thing that makes me happy right now.

Which is just feeling normal honestly. But I know I probably don't mean much to him. And watching something distracts me, I forget about myself and feel kinda numb? I can't really understand or explain why I feel this way or what I exactly feel. But if anyone felt the same way or knows how to get out of this, please help.

I barely go outside, I applied to University and chickened out at the last minute, I don't take care of myself as I used to and I don't seem to have a purpose, or know how to find one.

Nearly daily I obsess over what my rapist is doing, and how much better he is living without the consequences of the monster he really is.

He has indeed ruined me.

I keep hoping that his father's live music venue go's bankrupt, which is also where I met him (he works as a bartender there and does gigs sometimes) But I know that won't happen, even during covid cause that venue has some really dedicated fans.

Wish it did though, cause if that place would go bankrupt, his father wouldn't be able to pay for the expensive living or the gigs and music he creates. He basically get's everything handed on a silver plate. I live 20mins away from that bar and i f&amp;\*cking hate going past that place.

He also made me seem like I'm crazy to alot of people. I only told a few close friends what happened to me, and it somehow got out that i was ''bragging'' about it. And he made me seem like I'm a liar to so many people in my town, taking his side, which really frustrates me.

I know that he doesn't care what he caused me, and if anything, probably is proud of it. He's a true narcissist, he loves causing people pain to make himself feel better.

Now I have to live with this forever, negativity has really overtook me. I just really want him to pay.

Why do I have to be in pain all the time, it's not fair."
129,Been crying my eyes out for the past 2 hrs...life is so excruciating,Im in shreds. Im not able to get over my mother's words . I  am not able to get over that suicide attempt. I'm just a fucking disappointment. The gash on my left wrist is so painful.  I cannot live nor can i die. -_-
130,How do I deal with my cracked sense of self?,[removed]
131,"Is it my own fault, that i have mental problems?","Some peopel are saying, that I am the purpose for my depression, but I don't belive them. It actually hurts hearing that.
So I just ask this shortly: 
Is it my own fault, that I am depressed and feeling suicidal?"
132,How do i get diagnosed and start getting help,"Hi the first time I tried to get help I landed myself in a psych ward for 3 days and didnt get any help after that. I dont really know how to get diagnosed. I dont even know whats wrong with me? I wouldn’t know what I could be diagnosed with, or what I would tell a professional what I think I have, or what to look for. When you get diagnosed youre supposed to go to a psychiatrist first and not a therapist, right? If you get diagnosed by one person should you go to multiple professionals after to confirm it? What happens after? I really just know nothing about this process in general."
133,Lashing Out Because of Insecurities,"I met this amazing woman about six months ago. The pandemic has hit her hard, and she's had so much to deal with during this time and I've been doing my best to support her until recently. 

It's been six months, and because of various personal issues and her trying to get back on track, she hasn't been able to see me. My insecurities and paranoia started to mount. I connected dots that weren't there, projecting issues from previous relationships onto this and I lashed out, saying some really horrible things to her. 

I'm used to being a throw away, and I figured she someone else that was just using me. 

She was really hurt by what I said.  And it confused me. I was expecting anger, her trying to hurt me and it just being that. But I hurt her. I didn't realize how much of this was just in my head, was just my baggage and I think I've ruined what could have something really amazing. 

She's taking some space, and I'm waiting for her to make a decision. But I've finally realized that I'm the bad guy, and may have been before. She deserves better, and I realize I want to be better. She may or may not take me back, and I wouldn't blame her. But either way, I need to work on myself. 

I don't make enough money to take the chunk out for insurance and can't afford anything consistent, but I think I should talk to someone, a counselor or therapist or something. Get started in the right direction at least.  Where do I start?"
134,What to do if I am my sisters trigger/causing her PTSD,"We recently had a chat and she confirmed something I already suspected, she spends alot of the time avoiding me around the house leaving rooms when I enter. It has made the house very uncomfortable for me to live in but I can't afford to leave. What steps should I take to improve the situation. Thanks"
135,I [M20] finally talked to my GP about my depression and anxiety [NZ] and he prescribed me Fluoxetine (Prozac). What should I do?,"I grew up in a strict, religious but mostly loving family. Both parents were physically, mentally and emotionally abusive sometimes which  strained our relationship growing up. In addition, it was difficult dealing with my father's alcoholism and journey to soberism. This trauma, I believe contributed to my depression and anxiety now. Again, I was raised in a somewhat conservative background and mental health were not something that we often discussed, thus, I was never able to properly address my problems. I am also gay and came out two years ago to my family. My siblings were supportive but my parents were not very happy. As Christians, they did not support homosexuality. It was very heartbreaking in both our ends dealing with my sexuality. Mum and Dad were initially very sad and angry and never spoke about it again. My mum has only recently started opening up about it and getting more comfortable talking about LGBT issues. I also told her I have a boyfriend which she wasn't  happy about but was willing to support if I'm happy. We both agreed not to tell my dad until next year when I graduate in case he flips out or worse, kick me out of the house. I'm really sad that my mum will not stand up for me and that I am still not comfortable talking to them about any of my issues. 

Lately, my depression and anxiety have been getting worse and worse. I recently took on 3 jobs (32 hours) on top of my university to help me pay my bills and rent. It hasn't been easy juggling work commitments with exams &amp; assignments but I'm managing. However, my mental health has suffered severely to the point where I'm losing my apetite, motivation, energy, mood. My relationships and extra-curriculars are also suffering. I don't know what to do anymore so seeked help from my GP. Keep in mind, that I've been going to the same clinic and seeing different GPs complaining about panic-attack symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest constriction, nausea. We ruled out any physical conditions but no one followed up so I saw a different GP again.

On my fourth GP, I finally broke down and told him that I'm mentally struggling and I need help. He was very nice and assured me that everyone struggles, some more than others and will help me get through this. He asked about my life style, family history, and overall mental and emotional health. We discussed treatment options such as medications, therapy and lifestyle changes. He prescribed me Fluoxetine to help me manage my some of mydepression and anxiety. He said I might not feel the initial positive side effects at least until 4 weeks (or more) from first dosage. However, he would be monitoring me for a few weeks to see how I'm tolerating the drug. I'm really nervous as I have never taken anti depressants. My boyfriend is also worried that it will change me and give me bad side effects. I've talked to people online and some of my friends who have done this before and they couldn't give me a definitive answer as they said these type of medication interact differently with different people. My own research has also led me to the same conclusion. I guess, I want to hear what are your experiences with this drug? Is it a good idea for my case? Should I try other options first or both? I'm seeing my GP in a week again and am unsure if I should proceed. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
136,Worried about my mom’s mental health...,"My mom was seeing this guy for about 2/3 months. They broke up and she’s just been off the wall. 

-Her language has changed
-She says nasty remarks about her friends
-Her mood is up and down
-She constantly recites their moments shared together as if it was yesterday when they went on their first date
-She compares him to a lover she had YEARS ago and he unfortunately passed away and she never fully got closure from him. 
-She’s talking about making drastic changes
-The one thing that really concerned me was when we were talking and she said she would pull a knife out on him and “slit his fucking throat.” If he came back around. I was so uncomfortable when she said that...

Background history:
-she is taking medication for depression and her doc told her to double her dosage after the breakup. I forgot the name of it but honestly I don't know if it’s working... sometimes she’s good, but sometimes she’s not.

I know breakups are taxing mentally and emotionally but I’m really worried. The worst part is she’s the type of person who doesn’t believe in mental health issues at all. It was an effort just to even get her to start taking antidepressants last year."
137,Share your love stories?,"Right now I need happy love stories from people wiith mental health issues.

How  have you dealt best with the struggles and kept the relationship  going? 

Dating, how has that been? Can you/can you not date with a mental health prob?"
138,How can I help someone who is struggling?,"I have a friend who is feeling quite depressed and using drugs and alcohol as a release. I don’t know what to do. They don’t want to talk about their problems with me and they don’t like the idea of therapy so I feel terrible when I keep suggesting it.

Any suggestions on how you go about these situations?"
139,is it wrong of me to not want to text someone because i’m scared of being left on open?,"I’m talking to someone i got really close with and i love talking to them everyday, but it hurts sometimes when i’m left on open by them. When they leave me on open, it’s because they don’t know what to say, and i do the same soemtimes..but is it wrong to text them, then not open the message, and take a few hours to respond? since it makes my anxiety worse to text back quick then have the fear of being ignored by them?"
140,what's wrong with me..,[removed]
141,"Years flitting between debilitating depression, communication problems, emotional flatness, and bookended by two 4 month episodes of mania.","Essentially what the title says. I went through some pretty intense, suicidal depression as a teenager, which gradually got better during my first and only  ""relationship"" (of sorts), culminating in a four month period of mania, since which for about half a decade (no thanks, perhaps, to a year and a half of consistent drug use, like MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, and weed) of emotional flatness, occasional months of what I guess you would call ""depression"" (extreme low mood everyday). Right now, I live in the UK mental health system, and have just undergone another four month period of mania after months in the system, in which I spent over a grand on music and wrote literally hundreds of poems and other written things. This past week, I've been waking up feeling Godawful, ridiculously heavy to the point that it hurts to move my arms and eyes, very low mood, and I've been sleeping during the day more often than not despite getting full night's sleeps every night. To me, it seems this period of ""mania"" was just about as long as the last one, so I'm wondering if there's a pattern here.
Having my symptoms described to you like this, do you reckon you could infer some sort of illness from what I've said? I'm still in the ""system"", and my doctor wants to start me on Clozapine, but there is no firm diagnoses yet, except that I had a first episode of psychosis three years ago (hallucinations, visual and audible daily for a period of weeks). 
I'm scared lads lol I don't want another five years of being a useless, uninspired, uncreative, impossible to talk too waste of oxygen. Could anyone help? 
Thanks lads."
142,Is it normal to feel empty once you’ve solved all your major life issues?,"I’ve been on this journey of elevating my mindset and ridding toxic energy from my life. I finally got rid of a toxic friend group that had a hold on me for like 5 years, the guy who played me for a year is pretty much done with me and went back to his ex, which is a good thing.

These are all great things and I feel at peace. I haven’t really felt at peace well... ever. I don’t understand this feeling and I feel like my mind is trying to find some issue to solve but there really aren’t any.

I have a lot of goals to achieve like growing my hair longer, starting my YouTube channel, and growing my mental health platform. So this is all reality good now that I’m typing it out. Has anyone else ever experienced this feeling before?

Like I feel empty but empty in a good way. I might start crying lmao"
143,my dad punched me today,"i'm female, i'm 16 and i'm an only child. i've been experiencing a lot of emotional trauma and abuse as a child. to give context, my dad was (i believe he still is) an alcoholic and on april of last year we found out that he was bipolar. he's been in and out of rehab for 4 years now. anyway, when i was younger, he was always drunk, would forget to feed me or pick me up from school. he was a good father when he wasn't intoxicated but he always emotionally abused my mother and it had such a bad effect on me as i grew up through the years. we would often fight and we weren't exactly the happy family everyone thought we were. so in short, i grew up with a toxic home environment and my only actual outlet was school and my friends because i do well and a lot better there. now that the pandemic happened, i'm stuck at home and i never really get to do what i want or express myself. my dad's psychologists and therapists always told me and my mother to suck it up and accept that he's like that and there's not much we can do but try to help  him. honestly, we did. i still acknowledge him as my dad but tbh i don't want him to live with us anymore. i don't want to feel in danger in my own home. doctors always told us to just understand him. ait really hurts how i'm not able to express how hurt i am because i know my mother needs him. i am still just a student and an only child. i can't do anything to help even if i wanted to. today my dad punched me in the face because i didn't wash the dishes in time. i admit that that's my fault because i didn't do what he wanted me to do immediately but is it really necessary to scream at me and reprimand me that i don't do anything at home? i do my best not to rely on them too much, i tend and take care of myself, i do my chores despite having online school everyday and i'm maintaining my grades. i just wanted to rest for a while you know? talk to the new friends i made and just be a teenager that i'm supposed to be. he didn't have to yell at me. is it bad that i couldn't contain my own anger because i was sick and tired of understanding him all the time? he can scream at me and hurt me with his word but i can't say what i feel? i can't tell him that everything he's saying already hurts? he probably got triggered so much that he punched me and if my mother never intervened, he  might've beaten me into a pulp. he went out of the house and he's not back yet but my mother talked to me and told me it's like i wanted him away. my mother blamed my outburst for the reason why he got triggered. now it's my fault that he left? tbh i just wanna live my life in peace. i just want to be happy. i don't want this kind of life anymore because im tired an exhausted of it. it happens again and again where i have to forgive him for whatever he does because that's what will make my mother happy. my mother got mad at me and told me it's like im purposely ruining the family. i'm tired of that shit man. i'm supposed to be the one they're guiding and taking care of. i'm not supposed to be terrified of my father, i'm not supposed to be blamed for reacting normally because i can't just keep everything inside. i am human, i get angry. honestly, if i had the choice to leave and start somewhere new and better where nothing like this would happen, i would've taken that chance long ago. i'm sick of this cycle where it seems like it's always my fault. i'm so conflicted, i don't know what to think. should i be guilty because i'm the reason he left or should i stand my ground because i'm just prioritizing my mental health? this is driving me crazy because other people say i'm the asshole for expressing myself when i know that he's bipolar. but im human too man. i have feelings and it's difficult to understand him all the time. it's so difficult to grasp all of this while im at this age where i'm supposed to be busy with school and friends and not be going through such emotional trauma. and to think that i've been going through this for years? way back when i was a child? it may seem like i'm overreacting and maybe some of you might come for me and tell me i'm not mature enough to understand but is it so fucking wrong for me to just say what the hell i feel? is it really THAT fucking bad for me to cry and say that i'm hurt? i did my best to understand him, his life, why he's like that and because of that, i've been forgetting my own mental health. i have a life too, my life shouldn't be revolving around my father because i have things to do and dreams for myself to fulfill. i know people might tell me this is nothing compared to what others have been through but we have our own limits. and the fact that he already physically hurt me is beyond the damn line. please tell me what you think, i'm so confused and hurt right now i can't even decide if i did the right thing or not"
144,OCD making things seem voluntary? Is that a real thing?,
145,Neighbors teenage daughter got abused. She's having a total mental breakdown anyway for me to help ?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post it but I think this the only place to get help. 

This girl is 17 and she was riding her bicycle that day and she went off a bit too far and I don't know what exactly happened but I think she was taken by them into a truck she said and then they did things to her I dont want to talk about it she's just 17. The cops say there were 2 men . And they just left her on the road. When she was found she was partially naked and had some blood on her. And after taking to the hospital now she's home it's been over a week.

The problem starts here, she doesn't talk to anyone anymore not even to her parents. She just spoke to the police once and then she's shut. She has stopped eating, she doesn't sleep at night and she just cries alone. She doesn't get out of the bed even to take a bath she just cries. I know she's had a tough time but this isn't helping. Her parents cannot hire a professional therapist. Anything there that I can do to atlest get her to talk eat food and listen."
146,I need a supp6,"Hi all,

Recently, my boyfriend broke up with me and he was my only means for venting my day -- the good and the bad. I have a lot of stress with work, dealing with the break up, and new good opportunities coming faster than anticipated and I have no one to release to.

I have stop talking to my parents (my mom in particular)and sister for an incident that occurred on my birthday this year in which my mother threatened to punch me in my face and my sister and father were on her side. 

I am 26F and I just want someone who will listen and acknowledge my feelings matter. Of course I would be more than happy to do the same for others"
147,Help me put a name on it,"Hi! So I need help putting a name to what’s up with me, if anyone feels the same or know what’s “wrong” with me please tell me about it. 
First of I’m really moody, I get so annoyed when people talk to me, make jokes or try to start a convo, and that goes for anyone, my boyfriend my family my friends or simply strangers. 
I’m also a huge overthinker and I can be nice or happy when people let me be, until I feel like talking to them.  My boyfriend could try to joke with me and I just lash out at him without any reason, I’m also on medication that “stabilize my feelings and sleeping meds. I’m also extremely emotional and I’ve had several childhood traumas... now does anyone what’s wrong with me or if anyone feels the same??"
148,Can OCD make things seem voluntary?,[removed]
149,need to vent a lot,"right now I need somewhere to vent. 

just some background information, I'm currently 18, male, live in Quebec Canada so how schools work is kind of different compared to some places, and I'm in my 3rd semester of college.

for the past year I've felt like I've been in a slow downward spiral. last September i started my college life in a program I knew wasn't for me, hoping to either get into another one, and that's where my problems start, my whole life my mom has always said that im her son and i should be just as smart as hew, in elementary school i was always being told i was lazy and compared to the class average and was told to be like her, so when it came time to choose a highschool i decided to try to get into the high math program in the highschool i chose because i thought that was what i was supposed to do because i was meant to be like my mom and she was in high math and never truly tried. so i tried and failed, 4 years later another opportunity to get in came up and my mom forced me to take it, so i spent a summer in school catching up to be in it, and i barely got in, so then i spent my final year of highschool doing math that i barely understood and barely passing while having to have my mom on my back about being lazy and not taking it seriously. due to all this i thought that i had to get into a business program to be like her, so ii tried and didn't get in but got into a similar program that I'm still in today that i hate plus my mom forced me to retake the calculus course i failed in my first semester because i had to and it would supposedly look good when i try to get into university, all this bring us to today, me being forced into a course and program i dont like while trying to figure out what i actually want to do with my life

and that brings me to my second problem, i think i finally think i found something i want to do in my life, over the course of quarantine i went out on walks and took pictures, and i really liked it, it wasn't like art where your creating something out of nothing, but your taking something that's already there and saving it as a picture, but like all things for me, something had to go wrong, and this came in the form of a horrible teacher. my teacher is the type of teacher who is stuck in his ways, he has said multiple times that he doesn't care what's going on in your life, if its an emergency surgery or a family members death, you have to show up to class or else he will take marks of of your assignment even though it was done and handed in on time, plus to add on top of that he hasn't changed anything about his class compared to before covid, and i know this for sure because we are all doing it at home when he is trying to explain us photoshop or things with a proper camera over a screen, when most of use dont have proper cameras or photoshop, so that's been stressing me out.

lastly for the past 2 years I've been questioning my sexuality and i feel like i cant tell anyone about it because i feel like i need to know things 100% before telling people. plus it doesn't help that my parents say that i can talk to them about this stuff but then my whole life I've either had nothing in common with them, or all they wanted to talk about was school. like my whole life I've felt like an outsider in my own family, like how would you feel growing up where most of the time you would be out with your family and all they would want to talk about is cars, or how your younger brother would always bring up how he's done better then you compared to when you were his age. plus it doesn't help that as a kid your parents would always say to stop crying so know i feel like i cant show emotions around people, like my grandfather just died 3 months ago and the day he died i went to my cousins house to be with them and felt the urge to hide my crying from them and had to go on a walk to let it out.

its like i always feel exhausted, i feel like i dont know who I am and i feel like in the past year everything has been slowly getting worse because know I'm forced to start to decide what i want to do with my future but have no idea what i even want in my life. plus quarantine hasn't helped at all because now I'm stuck at home almost 24/7 and cant even get together with my friends because my grandmother is living with us and most of the structured part of my life that i enjoyed about my first year in college is gone because now its all online. I feel like I'm just spiraling out of control and have no way of regaining it because whatever I can do to regain a bit of control i cant because something is in the way of it."
150,How can I help my wife with her depression and anxiety?,"My wife (37) is struggling with anxiety and depression. It’s not so bad that she can’t get out of bed or is having panic attacks every week, but it is clearly taking a toll and she’s not getting any help.

Most days she gets up, goes to work (mostly work from home), and does an amazing job at home keeping the house running. So, functionally, she’s doing fine. But on bad days, it comes out as a combo of viewing herself as a failure, snap anger at random things, and that just seems to escalate to sobbing herself to sleep.

I try to talk to her about how she feels, but it doesn’t seem to help. We trade off house/parenting duties, but sometimes if I’m taking the kid she feels like a bad parent, and if I do chores and she gets angry at him, she also feels like a bad parent. I do worry that her anxiety-driven anger will lead her to saying or doing something to the kid she would regret (not dangerous, just something she’d feel bad about which would cause a further shame spiral).

As I said, she’s not getting help — no therapist, no drugs. She used to run, but with a 3-year old, and trying to work/parent around the modified COVID schedule, she doesn’t feel like she has the time. We used to travel a lot, but that isn’t happening either.

I would love any advice you can give on how I can help her. I think she would benefit from talking to a professional but she dismisses it as “I don’t have time” and “what are they going to do?” I’ve never been to a therapist, and I don’t know how to convince her, but I keep trying to encourage her to try."
151,Anyone else feel like their Seasonal Depression hits them like a truck every year?,"I always feel like there’s a single day in September every year where suddenly I’m depressed. It’s not gradual, it’s just Day 1 I’m fine, Day 2 I’m gone.

Nothing changed in my lifestyle: I go for walks every day to get sun exposure, I jog outside a couple times a week, I take vitD supplements every day. And where I live September is still super sunny and warm: I can still wear shorts outside in September. But every year there’s always a sharp divide between the day I feel normal and then the day the seasonal depression hits me. 

Is this how it’s supposed to feel? Like is it supposed to be so sudden?

And has anyone had success with light therapy? I worry it will be a waste of money for me because I’m already getting sun exposure and vitD supplements."
152,Not Suicidal Just Numb,"I've been on a generic form of Lexapro for about a year now. I know that with medication the journey comes with it's ups and downs and I'm honestly grateful I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore. But, I do feel pretty numb all the time and I don't really ""want"" to do anything. Having to stay at home during Covid definitely doesn't help and I'm trying to be cognizant of that adding to how I feel overall. Idk, have any of you felt like this, too?"
153,Can figure out what's real?/breakdown,"So one of our alters has problems decerning reality and has been on a slow break down for the past week or two
Yesterday, he was talking to a friend and that ""friend"" attempted (quite successfully?) To convince the alter that the friend was him and that he was just hallucinating and talking to himself (the bullshit was extensive) and he broke down hard
So anyway, when he gets bad he goes to his boyfriend if possible so that he doesn't have to think just cuddle and not care if it's real (which it is) 
I don't know why but the bf went straight for a little big more than comfort cuddles and let's just say the alter has bodily autonomy issues that felt violated as it seemed like the bf was taking advantage
Then the bf changed the subject and asked if he wanted to see an old necklace he found, he of course said yes, the bf is usually sweet and usually would say things like that before giving him gifts
Then comes the picture, it was a picture of the bf with his throat slit open (halloween necklace) which long story short is especially bad due to the nature of his reality issues
He's still freaking out, how do I help? I'm not even sure if I can help with passive influence we're all pretty fucked up and paranoid/I dunno

I do think the bf is just a big idiot who screwed up but that's not the half of it

Thanks if you try to help"
154,I need to change my life,"So I‘m turning 22, I‘m unemployed, i live with my mom and sister &amp; the energy is getting toxic, have no friends, never been in a relationship &amp; I  never go out. I really want to turn my life around. But My mental health is really bad. Also need to stop being on social media. It’s not good for me. I have social anxiety but I can get a retail the job the fastest. Do you think that getting a retail job &amp; than moving out as soon possible, becoming independent can improve my mental health? I don’t want to feel like this forever. Feeling like a failure and not good enough. Can’t believe I didn’t archive anything in life with 22! I’m scared that I will fail my whole life get old and die alone! Can like anyone write something positive just something uplifting. Really need to hear it! :("

156,i think about killing myself everyday. the thought of it goes through my head once a day at least.,[deleted]
157,CANNOT stop thinking about suicide,"I'm in need of a little moral support. Suicide is on my mind literally constantly, I can barely make any progress on my studies because my mind is clouded with suicidal thoughts. I want to constantly crack jokes about it and talk about it with my friends (I don't because I'm not a prick.) Sometimes I feel like I'm actually at risk and won't make it out of this alive and sometimes I think it's annoying.

I'm desperate to talk about it with someone, luckily I'm seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow. I'll have to strike the right balance with my honesty level though because I DON'T want to be hospitalized. Now would be a terrible time for that since I'm in school, plus no visitors because of COVID. Plus I wanna have suicide as an option for me. 

I don't think I'll actually kill myself despite me hoarding pills and visiting a bridge and stuff like that, I've gone through this shit before and never even attempted. I can still picture a future. Regardless, I can't stop imagining killing myself, and I do wish I was dead. I hope this is the time I actually go through with it. 

Wish me good luck on not getting hospitalized🤞"

160,T W ⚠️Does anyone else experience this when they have abusive fathers as a kid?,"When I was little my dad was physically and verbally abusive. I haven’t seen him in six years and he died a few days ago (not the point) it’s left with daddy issues and I don’t really crush on men my age (I’m 15 btw) and recently realised I crush on male teachers who r around 20-30 year old who give me any attention. It’s not sexual in anyway just emotional and kinda romantic, I’m pretty sure it’s been happening for quite a while, but I’ve realised recently because two years ago I had this science teacher he was seen as attractive however he wasn’t rlly “my type” because he was buff and muscular so he kinda looked like a chad lol. I was in year 8 when I first had him and was not attracted to him in anyway however enjoyed his classes and really like biology and was quite good at it. Then one day in year 8 I started crying in the hallway because I accidentally hurt my friend cos someone pushed me into them however she thought I did it on purpose so she stopped talking me. I felt so guilty that when I was walking to my next class I left my other friend and found a corner in the hallway leaned my head against it and cried. The science teacher found me and he comforted me, it was the first time a adult saw me, for all my life I was ignored and I felt so worthless like me existing was a burden and I hated myself so much. Then I got that crush and craved for that attention again, in year 9 my mental health got so so horrible, I was crying a lot at school and my selfharming got rlly addictive. He found me in the hallways crying a lot and was so nice, he made me feel loved, I felt cared for. I ended up opening up about selfharm, I use to go and talk to him a lot about how low I felt. However he ending up leaving to work in a different city far away. The crushes got really obsessive, like every after school id walk the way his classroom was in case I’d bump into him, because seeing him at school everyday made my day better, and whenever he wasn’t in I felt horrible. Near the time he was about to leave I was going to open up to him about my trauma. I still think about him sometimes. A year later a new science teacher he wasn’t buff at all lol, and he looks like a huge nerd tbh, he was very sarcastic and pessimistic however some how I found myself developing a crush on him, so the whole of year 10 was me trying to get his attention however because in year 10 I was numb and didn’t feel anything that year I couldn’t cry so he couldn’t see my pain so he would never ask if I was ok because he doesn’t know that my mind is troubled, I would be the last one to pack up so I’d have a few seconds alone with him in case he’d say something to me, but usually what he would say is “oh did u get the concept of (insert science topic here)” or “come on *my name that I will not expose* hurry up” usually when I speak to him or around him my voice goes quiet, and I get rlly shy like I was as a kid.  This teacher is still at my school however he isn’t my teacher rn I’m in year 11 and COVID retractions makes it really hard to see him so I get really depressed at school because nothing else rlly makes my day other than my friend however sometimes I feel like a burden to them. I feel like if I don’t get to have that teacher back this academic year and I end up losing or end up burdening my friend too much I might just kill myself. I’m not trying to pass my GCSEs because when I care about something I go crazy about it and not caring is so much better, however it’s impossible for me not to care about my friends so I have to stop caring about my academic future or I’ll go crazy. I don’t wanna go back there again however I feel like that might happen so to make the intensity lessen I’ll not put effort in it. Long story short I wanna stop having crushed on my teachers and I wanna be able to stop feeling like a burden."
161,ways to deal with stress,can someone please share their ways of dealing with stress due to school. my hearts been pounding for the past 4 hours and it feels like my chest is caving in. i have so much important work to do with such little time. when i try to do the work i cant get a single thought down because my mind is so foggy. i cant focus or comprehend any of my course material. it feels like im drowning in work and everything just keeps piling up i feel like i cant breathe. its been like this for the past week. i feel like im going crazy :(
162,Dissociating After Being Alone for a While,"I’m an 18 year old male and have come to realize that after not talking to people for a long time, say like a couple days, I start to dissociate from reality and grow completely insecure, lose all confidence, and find it impossible to hold a conversation until I ease myself back into the social fray and come back to normalcy after a little bit. Being in corona times, social activity has kinda went to a stand still, obviously, and these dissociative bouts have been getting progressively more common and difficult to deal with. I’m so confused. Why is this happening to me? It seems like I’m searching for a distraction of my own mind in some way and the only way to do that is to be social, which I’m fine with, just that sometimes I lose energy to talk to people and the cycle ends up restarting because of that."

165,I'm ashamed to say I'm being bullied by kids on my road and it is triggering crippling anxiety. I'm in my bloody mid-thirties.,"TLDR at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really can't express how small and pathetic this makes me feel and how much this issue dominates my existence during the periods where the kids are playing on the road. I'm waking up at 4am in a sweat, I had to talk to my GP today about it and will likely return to therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since moving to this house, my wife and I had some problems with the kids on the road. They basically took over our front garden (sat in it for hours, screaming, playing and being jerks), once I (eventually) put a stop to that by telling them to get lost they started to just hang out in front of our garden but on the street and constantly rang our doorbell. Being non-confrontational has it's drawbacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to the area and came from a home where we basically had total privacy and silence while growing up. My wife is from Asia and we both just did not know how to deal with this. My anxiety shot up each and every summer. As soon as the weather started to improve they would start to hang out on the street and we were apparently public enemy number 1.  Eventually I had to speak to some of the neighbors who stopped their own kids playing in our garden but the real ringleader was from a different road. 

&amp;#x200B;

This little monster was about 13 and would walk right up to me and tell me that she was knocking on my door the other day and what was I going to do about it. FINALLY the kids went too far and almost smashed my neighbor's window with a football. He went out and SCREAMED at them with all kinds of expletives that I would never have dared to use with other people's children. She never came back to the road and things settled down for the rest of that summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was 2 summers ago. Last summer we had a new kid who would constantly knock on our door and having learned my lesson: that standing up was better than trying to ignore it; I went to the mother of the child who shouted at her kid and did genuinely seem apologetic but I had to go down a few more times before it stopped. 

&amp;#x200B;

This summer Covid took over and the streets were almost empty. But in the last week the kids are appearing again for a last hurrah before the end of the daylight. The little kid from last year and an older kid are now doing the same bullshit of knocking on the door. Again having learned my lesson I immediately warned them not to do it again or I'd be down to their parents, so now they have just being hanging out on the street basically intimidating us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a grown man in my mid thirties who is literally being bullied by children and I am so absolutely ashamed of that fact. I have had an anxiety disorder for most of my life and attended therapy a few years ago that was of great assistance but still didn't stop the kids bullying us. I think I will go back in the next few weeks but that still doesn't stop the problem happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Kids are knocking on our door and have been doing it every summer for years. My wife and I are literally being bullied by kids and it is driving my anxiety up the wall. Therapy helped with the anxiety but doesn't stop the cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please help."
166,I went to therapy for the first time today.,"I write this in the hope that it may resonate with someone.

I have always thought I would never go to therapy, mainly because I have always felt that no matter what I say or find out, I would still know the same things I do now and feel the same way about the world, therefore I would never actually be able to get better because these things would surely still depress me. Also I hated the thought of spending money on something that I wasn't 100% sure would help me.

I've been like this for probably 14 years, since I was a teenager and it's slowly but surely gotten worse. Lately I started to reach a kind of boiling point... Or a depressive boiling point - which I'm sure you can imagine what that means - I have had the darkest thoughts I imagine anyone could possibly have, I hate myself and imagined there was no right path for me. My sadness was hurting someone very close to me, the only person that means anything to me. They want me to get better even though I never really thought I wanted to get better myself. So I decided I have no other options and would try it because there was a slight chance in my head that they would feel better.

All I did was look up a therapist on a website that shows  local ones and I read a little about different people on their profiles, then settled on one. I sent them an email to arrange a meeting, it was that easy.

Next thing I know, I'm talking to this person in a room and they're listening, it was hard at first, difficult to express what I wanted to express because I felt like there were so many different areas to talk about. I didn't know how to either, I stuttered, I just said yeah a lot, I lost my train of thought, but I just let stuff out. It's of course very early but I learned a little, I can breathe a little easier, and I want to do it again.

I don't know if this will truly help me or if the month after I stop I will just fall back into a depression, but I do know this is the first thing that's felt remotely close to a path out, a path to a normal life worth seeing through. So I also understand this will take time, and money... But even if I'm just on the path, I think that's enough to get a sense of normality or purpose. A drive even, to live.

I write this because If you are like I was, I recommend booking a session, and talking. Because that's all it is. Talking. And for some reason that I cannot for the life of me explain, it helped.

From someone who thought they would never go to therapy because they didn't think it could possibly help, I was wrong and so happy about it. Good luck."
167,"If Nothings Wrong With Me, Why Can't I Function?","[This turned into a vent as I went along but I also would like support] 

[TW: Suicide and self-hate]

Hi. I've been having a really hard time recently and have been experiencing symptoms of various different things. Essentially, I'm being told that I'm just depressed and anxious, that there's nothing else wrong with me. But everyone has anxiety and depression. Why can other people function despite these? They tell me that I'm creating these symptoms or that they're manifestations of anxiety/depression because I ""want to be seen"". So, I have these symptoms and I don't feel real and I don't feel grounded and I want to die. I tried talking to my mom about it, and now I feel like I'm making everything up. Why am I experiencing certain symptoms?? If I'm really making it all up, why am I in so much pain? Why do I want to isolate and suffer in silence? They say I'm only validated or ""seen"" by people if I'm suffering but that just makes me not want to tell anybody anything because it'll just get written off as an attempt for attention. If I really only have depression and anxiety, why is everyone in my family, friend group, etc. able to function at least at bare minimum? I want to fuck my life up to prove that I'm sick but that just reinforces the idea that I just ant attention. If I want attention, why does it feel so wrong when I'm given it? People ask me what I need and I freeze up. No one can give me what I need, no matter how many times I try to explain myself no one understands. How can I expect to get help when I can't even accurately represent whats going on in my head? Every time I try it always ends worse than when I started. This is how it's always going to be. I want some diagnosis to tell me that I'm sick and that there is something out there that can help me. But I'm just depressed and anxious, so I get treated for being depressed and anxious and it doesn't help. I wanted to get better. I had hope. The further I come the more helpless it seems. What I need is to disappear. What I need is isolation. That way, I can just end it when I want to- everyone can stop trying to save me. I, at least, know I'm a lost cause. If it were up to me, I'd be dead. And yet I can't even kill myself right. I always end up telling someone and the cycle repeats: I want to die, I tell someone, I want to get better, treatment doesn't work, I lose hope, I want to die. Fuck. Fuck. Maybe I'm nothing without my mental ""illness"". Maybe the treatment works and I'm just numb and empty. All I am is a sad sack of beans. Nothing more. Without the sad I'm just a regular sack of beans. I want to be happy, but I don't think that'll ever be attainable."
168,The Broken Girl,"I looked in the mirror and see that broken lonely girl I’ve seen all too many times

her dark circles, saddened eyes, gloomed demeanor is all too familiar 

this side of her brings her back to the lowest places she can fall 

the brokenness consumes her soul 

the sorrow in her eyes tells her story 

the freckles in her eyes no longer glimmer of hope they are now specks of sadness 

she looks back at me and I see the beginning of the crash forming  

I see the fall written all over her body 

if she falls now she won’t get back up 

there is no choice for this broken girl but to hold on 

hold on to what? 

hold on to who? 

but just hold on 

hold on 

keep holding on 

she picks up her computer and emerges herself in her work 

she holds on to the dream 

she holds onto the fire inside that no one can take from her 

they can crush her spirit

they can push her down so far she can’t stand 

they can kick her while she is down there in the pit of despair 

but they can’t take her soul 

her soul speaks volumes 

her soul is driven by the All Mighty 

her soul was designed for more 

her soul was meant for a greater purpose"
169,Has been very hard lately,I really don’t want to be one of those people who self diagnose depression and shit but recently it’s been really hard and I don’t know what to do. I’ve recently moved into my college dorm and I’ve been feeling very depressed I think. I have no motivation. I don’t want to do anything. I’ve made friends here and there and I occasionally hang out with my high school friends but somethings just off. I’m not that nervous about school or anything but I’ve been having trouble sleeping mainly and I just feel lonely. Lonely as in like no body fucking loves me and will never find somebody who’ll love me. This has gone on for a bit but it’s never been this bad. There’s nothing I look forward to in life and I feel like I’m gonna die alone. I just wish I could fall asleep and live in my dream forever. A dream in which I can finally be free from everything.

173,i desperately need advice,"my best friend (let's call her Zen) has been struggling with what can only be described as an overactive imagination since she was seven (she's now a teen)
the most important aspect in this world is what she describes as a force of evil (let's call it XY).
when she first started talking about this i tried to keep it casual and tried to make my best friend feel normal but this persona in her head is more than problematic. i know it may sound crazy but i don't know what to do anymore.i just want her to be safe.

__________________________

to over simplify what i know:

apparently this fantasy world in her head started as simple daydream but evolve into an overarching storyline with characters and worlds. 
she told me things started going really bad when she turned twelve.
XY is apparently the god of evil that choose her as a vessel to (as i understand) either collect energy from through suffering or somehow use as a sacrifice to bring XY into our plane of existence. XY is constantly trying to influence Zen to do things that are bad for her. like not eating, bottling up emotions ect. ect. 
Zen refuses to stop any self destructive behavior even after she acknowledges that it's bad for her.

it has always been bad but recently it's gotten horrible.
Zen has been imagining vivid scenarios in which XY tortures her. this is either to make Zen stronger, teach her discipline or to ""let off steam"".
Zen has been drawing for a while now and is quite good at it but recently she's been drawing gore (mostly people being impaled) something she's never really done before.

today she told me something that i couldn't just let go. she's was extremely stressed yesterday because she had to study for a test. she said she started feeling crazy/lucid and that her eyes were rolling.
she then took her scissors and started cutting at her neck until it bleed. she took off her scarf and i saw the marks clear as day.

(please keep in mind that i only discussed XY but there are other characters and and even eras in her fantasy world... although recently all she told me is about how she's being tortured in explicit detail)

_________________________

i know ever time she told me about XY was a cry for help so ofcourse i've tried to suggest and even push her to get help. but Zen and XY have decided that therapists are trying to ""ruin everything'"" and make Zens life worse. i could've told an adult already considering i've known about this for two years but i know i was the only one she'd ever told about her fantasy world to this extent. 

i wanted to help but in a way that was sensitive towards her feelings so that she wouldn't feel betrayed or worse, get hurt by untactful adults.
(i've witnessed how ignorant adults can be first hand. if they make a rash choice thinking it'd get rid all her problems so they can carry on with their lives, she would never forget and i doubt she would ever seek out help again [and let's make clear that her parents would absolutely do everything wrong])

today i finally convinced her to go to the guidance counselor. a nice woman but she doesn't seem to have ever studied psychology nor been trained to take on thr job of a phsyciatrist. but it's currently the best option and i knew i couldn't afford to wait anymore. Zen told her a bit about the current situation and we made an appointment so they could properly discuss how to help Zen. (we didn't tell her about the selfharm)

it was fine until an hour later when Zen said she wasn't going to meet with the guidance counselor again. she said that she felt weak and that XY was in a lot of control and that she had to keep ot that way.

now i don't know what to do anymore.
i might've messed up my chance to help her without having to go behind her back but what can i even do.
when it comes down to it, i'm just a kid like her.
i don't have the resources or knowledge to help her and i feel so powerless.
i'm so worried i can't think straight.
i'm painfully aware that her problems aren't mine but i love her.
i'm so lost and not even completely mentally stable myself.
please help me... i need guidance but i don't have anyone to turn to.

I have noticed for awhile that I’m always forgetful. I know that forgetting stuff here and there is normal. But it’s to the point where I don’t remember doing stuff, like I’ll clean up and put stuff away, and then later I’m tearing the house apart because I can’t remember where I put something. And I’ll find it, and have no recollection of doing so. I can’t remember what I’m supposed to do most of the day, or I forget what I’m supposed to get. I have to make a list for almost everything or else I feel dumbfounded for not remembering a single thing of what I was supposed to do. 
To also put in, my grandmother recently passed away from pretty bad dementia, she also had mental problems, my mom is showing signs of early on Alzheimer’s from what my family has noticed, and I have a sister with multiple mental illnesses and also is forgetful.

I’ve been waiting to see if things will change for years. Pre-lockdown I can see the past version of myself. I was shy, expected the world to be a kind place if I didn’t do anything. 

The truth is things aren’t so binary; there are beautiful moments in sad days. There can be walks in the rain, moments of unexpected joy. 

 The most you realise though; things change so quickly. I’ve learnt so much. What to look for in myself, the warning signs that’ve actually held me back so much in life. 

I’ve held me back. I’ve told myself I can’t do things. But now I’ve woken up. 

I can smell, taste, breath what I am.

I went to my psychiatrist for my anxiety and got new medicine. We’ve had one visit and he wanted me to come back two weeks later, now it’s been two months and I just keep putting it off. But I went on vacation last weekend and just felt out of control. The entire weekend I was just either on really highs or really lows. I was on a high and got blackout drunk and found myself snorting $100 worth of cocaine in one line. I’ve only done cocaine twice and both times was small and I was nervous. But in this moment I felt invincible and went for it, nothing would happen right?. Next night I had an extreme low to the point I was shaking I was so anxious and depressed. Got drunk again, got an impulsive tattoo at 3am by some artist rolling on molly. None of this is like me. I look back and I’m shocked I didn’t overdose on accident, but then again, like I said I know nothing about drugs so I don’t even know if I could’ve. But I’m 22F and 115 pounds so I think it’s likely. I work in mental health, the worst thing I do in my opinion is smoke weed. But idk what’s going on, I can’t even explain it.

And he’s like my only friend other than my boyfriend right now. Well I just feel like shit and I have a history of self harm. I ended up just finding a rubber band and snapping it on my arm. But idk if this is actually still self harm? I used to do it in fifth grade, so I’m not sure if this is going to help me heal from self harm, like I want to. I’m taking the day to just meditate and think about not using the rubber band anymore because it’s an addicting feeling when I’m upset at myself."
190,I am done with people! (TW: Series topics!!),"I am just done. My younger brother was in the hospital and we thought he was going to fucking die! I had people messaging me that they hoped my brother died because I’m a furry. 

That really hurt me 

And today, I started getting messages that I deserved to be raped because I am a furry! This isn’t ok and I hate it!"
191,What steps should I take to get a professional diagnosis?,"I am 17 years old and i have been struggling with my mental health for years. my condition ebbs and flows, from extreme low depths of existential despair to actually feeling normal and happy, although that doesn’t last long. i have descended back into a low state of mind recently, and i’ve about had it with this struggle. i want nothing more right now than to feel like myself and accomplish things to my greatest ability, because i know i can do a lot if my mental health was better. i’m in my last year of high school right now and this time is more critical than ever for me to do my best in school, but it is getting increasingly difficult to get anything done. 

i confided into my mom yesterday and for the first time she said she understood, and that she’ll make a doctor’s appointment with the family doctor. but i don’t know anything about the process from here, will i be sent to counselling or go to a psychiatrist for a diagnosis? i would really prefer to be diagnosed asap so that my life can go to normal soon, but i’m not sure if my family doctor will have more say in this decision than me. i live in bc, canada btw if that helps with specifying advice"
192,Therapy for ethnic groups (eg Asian Americans),"Hi - Anyone have suggestions on how to find a therapist / counselor for ethnic groups? I'm an asian american and have found that therapists of a different descent have a hard time relating or understanding my challenges. Their takes on the problem are different and interesting but not of understanding. 

Any suggestions on where to go or how you've found your therapist? I've also heard group therapy is helpful - open to that as well. Thank you!"
193,How do I ask for help. I feel if I don’t get help soon I will hurt myself.,I am freaking out right now. I started crying from fear of hurting myself. I couldn’t move for a while because I didn’t want to get up and get something to hurt myself. I want to tell my mom that I am not okay and that I need help but it is too embarrassing and scary. I have never been good at talking to people even my own family. She is amazing and the best mom on earth but I don’t think even she would know how to help me. Please how do I find help as a young teen without having to go somewhere. I was going to call the emergency help line today but I didn’t want my parents to see who I called so I didn’t. Please please please tell me anybody who has been through this how do I get help
194,I feel depressed becuse school any help,I feel depresed at school becuse of getting buylied becuse i like metal and i feel like the techers are allways shouting at me
195,I did it. And I’m proud.,I made it to my 18th. It’s about a week after. And I’m still in disbelief. I’m not dead. I didn’t kill myself. I thought I would I thought something would have happened by now. But I made it safely in one piece. And I wasn’t proud until the day of. I just couldn’t rest until I made it to that day. And then I did. And I felt so loved and understood. And it was overwhelming. But I was at peace and I was comfortable. And I was happy. I was proud. Because to be proud of this is to be proud of a lot more than just “oh look yay I didn’t kill myself” that in itself is impressive to me. But I also have to acknowledge the years of mental suffering I went through when I was younger because even the people who were supposed to help me just outright denied the possibility of my disorder until it couldn’t be ignored. I was alone in dealing with my disability for a long time. And I normalized so many behaviors and patterns that no kid should ever normalize. And I wanted to die at such a young age. I wish I could tell kid me that I’m gonna be alright and that I make it to 18. And my home life is going to get better. And that people do care. And that my family is going to understand the parts that matter. you just have to give them time it’s scary even for them I know you can understand that. You never grow out of loving your favorite shows and video games if anything you play them a lot more now than ever. And you have 3 dogs now I know you always wanted one but you end up with 3 and they love you just as much you love them. I can’t promise it’s a great life. And there’s still so many unknowns and uncertainty. But you hold on to a lot of love and nostalgia that feeds you endlessly. You recognize the beauty you’ve encountered and the beauty you are. You are so many truths coexisting in one body and you can’t even begin to comprehend everything you are because what you are. What you are made of. That shit is limitless. It is concrete but it’s flexible. And as all knowing as it likes to pretend to be all it really knows is to love and to be loved. I love me. I’m still terrified and confused. But I recognize my strength and the capability I have. I made it here without even trying. Now let’s see what I can do in the next ten years to come. Like I said I can’t promise a great life. But to exist at all is a marvelous concept you must never forget that. Love someone today even if that someone is you. It’s needed.
196,Headed towards a mental breakdown with almost no support system and I don’t know what to do.,"I recently quit my job as an assistant manager in a luxury retail position to return to school full time (6 classes) to finish my marketing degree. Which can be done this year or I can go one more semester next fall it depends how I do my classes. 

I took on 2 part time jobs. One is at a barn, I’ve ridden horses my whole life just about, 4 mornings a week (Mon,weds,thurs,Sat) 630-930 AM. I basically just handle feed, turnout, basic cleaning up etc. I also work at a restaurant as a hostess 3 nights a week (thus, fri, sat) 4-10/11 PM. These jobs are completely fucking draining me. I hate being a hostess so much because I’m also basically a bus person, a waiter, take out and just anything anyone needs me to do. I run around like a chicken with my head cut off. 

This restaurant is not managed well as in if you have a reservation for 6, if our servers aren’t ready, the owner won’t let me seat you and you might be waiting til 6:30 or later to be seated. In addition there’s times where people are waiting for their meals for over an hour. Etc. plenty more. I’m beyond fucking stressed out when I’m there and I dread nothing more. I need to be in tonight in an hour and I can’t stop crying. I already worked my ass off this morning and am so exhausted.

I have to get up so early to get to this barn job, I get home and I’m exhausted so I fall back asleep and then I have so much schoolwork to get done and then it’s like time to go to work at night. It sounds like nothing but my sleep schedule is shit, I never eat anything (I have an eating disorder to begin with), and no one understands. I’m “young” (27) so I should be able to handle all of this according to people. That it’s no big deal, that my jobs are so easy there’s nothing to complain about. 

I’ve never been more miserable in my entire life. It’s October 1st, my favorite month and fall in general is my favorite time of the year and I can’t even bring myself to pretend to enjoy it. I’m miserable 24/7, I’m always on the verge of tears if I’m not crying, or just drunk when I can be. I’ve never been more exhausted, overwhelmed, overworked and under supported in my entire life. I just want it all to end. I don’t know what to do. These jobs don’t complement each other well at all and are both psychically demanding. When I work both I’ll do easily 30 K plus steps a day. 

All I want to do is walk into the restaurant tonight and quit, but I can’t as a family friend got me the job and keeps telling me I’m gonna make them look bad if I quit. I don’t know what to do. I work so hard to keep everyone happy and I’m completely drowning with no professional support and next to no friend or family support. I literally don’t know what to do anymore I wish I could curl up and die so badly. 

I don’t know the point of this post but I just wish someone would take me seriously when I say I’m overwhelmed and burnt out instead of just telling me I’m fine and being dramatic. My anxiety has never been so bad, nothing has ever been so bad. I feel so sick over everything. I just wish people in my life would actually listen to me and be supportive instead of telling me how this is no big deal and I should be able to handle it all."
197,Do I have megalomania? Please help,"(Edit: I'm not looking for an official diagnosis. I'd just like to hear the community's thoughts on the matter)

Lots of things trigger my anxiety, but one of the things that make it incinerate me from within is romantic relationships, or relationships with the opposite sex (I'm straight). My anxiety flares when I can't get a girl I'm interested in, I get angry and very very very anxious if I find out they like someone else, hell I even get passively outraged when female friends get boyfriends. I get angry that I couldn't ""win"" the girl I want, it legit torments me, makes me feel like I'm a loser, and am inadequate. It's like I have this huge ego that screeches and wails if not satisfied.

I know how absurd this all sounds, just wish the part of my brain giving rise to my anxiety did too. Is this megalomania? If not, does it point to anything else?

Thanks in advance

Any response will be appreciated"

hi, i think i might be on the spectrum and the symptoms i recognise are getting in the way of life. i need help to tell my parents that i have this trouble. my parents are doctors and they reject any problems i have because they compare me to their “overworried” patients. now i dont really tell them anything and im kind of scared to get another answer like that. please can anyone suggest ways to ask for a diagnosis or tell them, it would be really helpful. thanks

201,I utterly despise being super emotional,"Everyone always tells me that being emotional is a strength and a virtue, and while I am inclined to agree with this notion, I really really really hate it when I get upset over virtually... nothing, or I think about a hypothetical situation of what ""could"" happen and I essentially think myself into anxiety and into a mental breakdown.

I'm not saying I want to be like a robot with no emotions, I just don't want to experience these irrational things in my head anymore.

Thankfully I can recognize when these emotions happen and I can calm myself down when they do occur by meditating on them, and I don't do anything brash or stupid with them. But damn are they painful to deal with."

205,Why Donate To Mental Health?,"Hey there everyone! 

As you all know, in my past posts, I have been talking about different various Mental Health charities. For example, **Mental Health Foundation**. 

Before donating, you may be asking yourself “What am I actually donating to?”. Well, I am here to explain that to you. Hopefully, I’ll be able to answer all of the questions you have!  

When it comes to donating, your money doesn’t instantly change how a person feels or acts, but it’s for the research that goes into Mental Health. For example, your money would **go towards**:

- **Developing straightforward information** and tools that would help people look after their Mental Health everyday 
-  Being able to **influence policymakers and advocates** for change, so lives would be able to transform 
-  Donations would help different Mental Health charities to do further **research** for the vital questions about Mental Health and saving lives
- Helping **develop more guides** and being able to support people to take control of their Mental Health
- Go towards **developing special programmes** to support Mental Health of younger people
- To **prevent Mental Health problems**

The million dollar question is simply... **WHY** should we donate to a Mental Health charities? 

- You’re funding, helping out and giving a lifeline for people who are currently on the edge. Donating your money will show that you care and want people to overcome their darkest moments. 
- Your money will get young people talking about Mental Health. 
- Without any donations, it will take, on average, 15 years for an average forces veteran to seek any kind of help or support.

206,Neighbor tortures her house pets with acid,"What can a neighbor do to help this senior incessantly chatting, religiously Christian woman? She says she’s untreated and untraceable but is diagnosed delusional, bipolar, and paranoid schizophrenic by her own words.’she says she self-mutilates herself and is suicidal and homicidal. She’s a retired school teacher. She says there are stalkers who routinely torture and mutilate her cats and dog. She disabled her phone and laptop, and installed aluminum foil over her electrical outlets and outdoor flood lights to repeal stalkers. No one in our closely-knit neighborhood has seen the stalkers but we’ve all heard about it from her. Often. She says no none believes her or can help her. She says her relatives, ex-husband, neighbors, and local PCP, law enforcement and social services here and in her previous housing can help her. She’s bright, charming, take red, cleaver, and delightful when she’s not in her self-described “evil mode.” Suggestions?"
207,How can I begin to love myself more without going to therapy?,"I’ve always kind of known I was ugly but it didn’t truly affect me until about 2 years ago. I got a lot of attention from guys when I turned 18 and started going out more, and this gave me a massive boost in confidence, I felt like I looked amazing and I really did love myself for a while. But obviously, it was all false and I started to realise that more and more as time went on. I still had some good days where I thought I looked nice but they became increasingly sparse. 

Now, I have zero days where I think I look even remotely decent. I constantly think I look like the ugliest thing on the planet. I can barely pick any clothes to wear because I’m so embarrassed to be seen at all. Everyone could tell me I look great and I won’t believe a word they say. I get suicidal over this quite often and it seems to be getting worse each day. I feel like I’m stuck and I don’t know how to get out. 

I can’t go to therapy as I can’t afford it or get time off work. I’m constantly tired and worn out from all my commitments (this can’t be changed) and I’m starting to feel more and more hopeless. What can I do to improve my life on my own?"
208,How honest should I be when dropping a counsellor?,"We've had three sessions. After the second one I knew she bothered me and I found her analogies to be rather patronising. She admitted I knew what was going on with me but still talks about my issues as though she's explaining feelings to a 4 year old with fables. I also feel that when I explain my flawed thought process she puts a different spin on it. I correct her, ""no, that's not the way I approach that. It's this way and it's not healthy."" and she will look blank faced and then reiterate her point. She will then tell me I'm being defensive and she will ""hold my hand as we cross this bridge together."" I kind of want to puke while listening to her.

I need to drop her. I loathe sending her money for these sessions. How honest should I be when I email her? Should I come up with a vague lie to make it easier on her or should I really tell her what bothers me so she can maybe change her approach to others? Maybe her approach is exactly what some people need though and I don't want to make her feel bad at her job. I also don't want to ""let her off the hook"" because some of the things she said (you shouldn't be taking medicine and the only reason you have physical symptoms is your mind. Your chronic diseases aren't the cause) are unprofessional and narrow minded."
209,"I'm at a dead end, I'm done.","***Trigger Warning (Vent / Need Support)***

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done, I've lost a ton of people I care about and am continuing to do so, my ex best friend I knew for 7 years made fun of me to a girl I really liked behind my back, called my self harm and depression fake, and convinced me into using drugs then blocked me after calling me a liar and selfish. I spent a shit ton of money buying him drugs and alcohol and other shit and he never gave anything in return. I lost my GF because I was a toxic asshole and wanted her to myself and I was fucking mentally abusive without realizing it, I tried to apologize but she didn't even read it. The guilt fucking kills me inside, had another few GFs that I feel really guilty about hurting and I've apologized to all of them but it doesn't feel any better. I doubt anyone will read all of this and I'm sorry it's so long but I don't know what to do, this is a throw away account because I'm utterly ashamed. I'm fucking 16, and I use drugs what the fuck. I promised myself years ago I fucking wouldn't, but look at me.

I'm falling back on school because of anxiety and habit, I'm 1 - 2 years behind on school work and can't fucking cope, I have no friend apart from one amazing friend in real life who I don't go to school with or see very often. A few night ago I took MDMA twice in a row, 1.5 grams, I don't know why but thinking back to it I feel like I tried to kill myself. I know this is just a comedown but I'm fucking broken right now, I'm worried about my brother who has autism and doesn't leave his room, my mum also has parkinsons disease and no doubt my dad is struggling to cope. I just want to fucking kill myself right now, and I have a few friends on snapchat who I trusted and told about this I know it's really petty but I told them about my friend issue and all the other issues and one of them just told me to start over and the rest really didn't seem to care. But one actually seemed to care, she doesn't even live remotely near me.

I have absolutely 0 social skills and I can't even make 1 friend. Even 5 months after breaking up with my EX I still miss her like hell, like seriously, why the fuck do I miss her. We were dating for 6 months and fuck did she mean the world to me, I feel like I'm slowly losing everyone I care about and can't even fucking write this without breaking down. I was supposed to be getting anxiety medication, but due to coronavirus my appointment to see a psychiatrist was delayed. I've tried to fucking do right, I've tried to help all my friends with depression, I'm fucking open minded and I try to make friends online but nobody ever seems to want to talk to me. I really try to be a good person, I participated in a mental health discord server for almost half a year helping people with mental illness to the best extent I could, but even then I feel like a disgusting human. I have so many problems, but even after all the good I've done or at least tried to do I still want to do bad things to people I can resist the feelings / urges but I feel like I'll forever be a bad person.

I've tried everything for anxiety, I've been trying for the past few fucking years and nothing has changed. Anytime I try to look something up such as ""how to gain confidence"" my brain tells me I am a fucking idiot, I know some people wouldn't be better without me but I can't help but think I want to fucking kill myself. Things started getting better at one point and now it's all just gotten fucking worse. Like fuck I've lost so many people I've cared about, I tried to stop a friend from suicide but they done it anyway I know it's not my fault and I didn't know them much but fuck I miss them. I miss my ex best friend and my ex girlfriend/s, I just fucking hate life at the moment and my brain is coming up with any excuse possible to take MDMA. I just want 1 friend in real life who I can hang out with, the friends on snapchat I told all this to didn't offer to hang out even though I know a few in real life. Like they don't even feel like real friends sometimes, I feel petty as fuck saying that though. I really don't want to keep rambling on but I doubt many people will read this, thank you to those who read this, I love y'all and have an amazing day. I try to be good."
210,I'm bad at understanding social situations and expectations.,"I'm not sure if I'm just a jerk or if there's something else going on, but I've recently noticed that all of my life I've been bad at socializing. Even as a small child in kindergarten I was quiet and was too nervous to talk to other children. Most of all I never knew *why* I have to socialize with others. I don't quite like to. I don't like meeting new people, as it's stressful for me and I'm immediately on edge when someone introduces me to someone. I don't even know how to talk to my grandma or sisters very well. It's uncomfortable to make eye contact, to answer questions about my life, especially small talk. I don't understand it and I get frustrated with it. And I don't understand things like birthday cards and similar small celebratory or social things. I never know what to write in a card and I find it useless. I don't like getting them myself. I don't know how to react to gifts, as I don't get outwardly excited for them. Maybe this all is just perhaps my personality. I don't like being touched by anyone except children or my significant other (and occasionally I don't like to be touched at all) as it makes me uncomfortable or feel too stimulated. That's another thing. I get a lot of sensory overload at times. I can't be in large crowded areas for long, and sometimes lights are too bright. I don't like flashing lights, shoelaces, sounds. I tend to startle easily. I've been lightly bullied for things like that. Overall it just feels like I'm much more sensitive to everything than the average person and I don't understand the need to socialize or why it's important to do such things. I don't hate people, but it's uncomfortable being around people."

213,Everything feels nostalgic like a sad memory -- even things I never even saw before.,"Idk what's going on but I've just been so easily emotionally put down. Saw storm clouds rolling in today and I had this sinking feel of nostalgia and nearly cried. I keep getting thoughts about how cigarettes are ruining my family and I'll outlive all of them. Lately, I realized I felt a fear of time. That I can't just slow down. I can't even think of any places without feeling this twisted form of nostalgia. For example, I just imagined a blue cloudy sky and a wheat field. Activated the same feeling of having to cry. A sunset on a beach, eyes are heavy once again. A neighborhood, a mountain, anything. If I see it, it makes me feel disturbed and... I don't even know what to call the feeling.

I know it's not my depression because this hasn't happened before. This feels new. And I no longer suffer from depression anyway. It flairs up every once in a while. Anyway, I feel like everything's just too regular. Everything is the same as another. I feel trapped in my own home for not having a real reason to go outside.

It all feels like a sad memory."
214,Depression is killing my dream,"I've had chronic depression since my teens, plus a slew of other things. I just need a bit of kindness really, my depression has been flaring up again recently. 

I'm a self-taught cartoonist(22F) and aspire to create an animated show but life just isn't allowing me go to art school any time soon to learn animation. I don't have the money or the time with a 1 year old around. It's my dream to create animated shows and comics and get my original show out there. I've worked on characters and a universe since 2007, building on my first original characters and working my way up since then. I'm just now starting to try and get it out there despite the anxiety in the back of my mind telling me ""nobody cares, no one likes this, you'll never be accomplished like other indie animators"", things like that. But i did finally manage to work up the courage to start posting out there, found a small team and built up a small indie studio. To get our names out there and in the world, I've been promoting some of our posts. Some of them have been quite popular, but more recently on my personal account I've had a number of people putting me down badly and it's really making me crash down hard. 

I know i shouldn't let the negativity get to me but with my depression coming around again I'm a lot more sensitive. It really hurts to see the audience we're trying to gain shit all over something i've put my life and soul into for more than the past decade. I understand that not everyone we reach out to are interested, but just the deliberately rude comments are eating me alive. Which sucks because i'm more often than not just thinking about sacking the whole thing now, my entire dream and resigning myself to be an eternal retail worker. Right when I'm starting to try and get it out there. Can anyone suggest good ways to deal with negativity like this? I really don't want to let go of my life work, but i feel like i'm caving in and nearly crying at work right now."
215,How can I have a more open mindset towards life?,"I don’t really know what else to say but that i just want to be more of a happy, spiritual person. Any advice really, Google’s there but I kinda want advice from people with more personal experience? 

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but it’s worth a try."
216,I'm 21 and I feel like my youth has been sucked out of me,"I'm frustrated and in need of a vent, so I'll lay it all out here - thank you if you decide to read at least some of it.

I am a 21 year old woman and I honestly feel like all my youthful energy has been sucked out of me. I feel very old. I was much more careless and had way more fun at 16. I'll explain the context below.

I graduated from university and moved back to my home country this summer. Had 3 intense years of high levels of academic-related stress, at the end of which I developed health problems and depression. This was deeply transformative of course! Yet far from a breeze. I also gained around 15 kilos in this time as a result of emotional binging (haven't lost them and they're affecting my self image). I moved country to study at that uni so I mostly dedicated my time to studying, I did meet some good friends but didn't spend a lot of time partying.

Shortly after moving back home, my dearest person, my grandma passed away. I moved in with my grandfather and I'm sleeping in my grandmother's old room now. I help around with groceries, cleaning up and other random house chores. I feel like I'm mostly surrounded by old people during the day, my grandfather's sisters visit often as well. I'm also working part-time at this organization and so half of my day now is dedicated to that.

I have one or two good friends back home now, I cut off contact with the rest because after my depression period I felt that I had to make changes when it comes to which people are going to be in my life. Although I'm quite an introvert and appreciate alone time, socializing feels quite limited nowadays.

All in all, there has been a lot of change and sadness and transformation these past months. I don't feel like a 21 year old, I just don't. I feel tired and as if so many years have passed me by. I can see how this may seem overly dramatic to someone who is older than me right now, but this is truly how I feel.

My increase in weight, limited social life and number of responsibilities just makes me feel dull. Sometimes I handle it and it's fine, I distract myself. But sometimes it just feels endless! It has been too long. Thanks for reading if you made it till here. Any words of advice on feeling young and cheerful again?

Lots of love"

218,Numbness,"I don’t quite know where to go with this but I believe I have bipolar (don’t have the guts to get it checked out) but I sometimes go through phases, like I am now, of somewhat numb and confusing states. When I mean numb as in everyone feels number. My senses, touching, tasting smelling ect all seem somewhat mute. Time seems to slow or my brain is gong faster than tome so everything feels delayed. I feel as if I don’t have to eat. Finally emotionally, I still feel some emotions like the bad ones ut other than that noting. Theses phases can last from 1-7 days and happen probably once every two months
I’m not to sure what I’m asking but I suppose it’s along the lines of ‘are theses common symptoms of bipolar or are they linked to something else?"
219,Want to be beaten by my husband bcoz my dad used to beat my mom.,Im 25f raised by a drunkard father who used to beat me and my mom very often. I saw my mom getting hit by him nearly everday.

221,Need help understanding separation anxiety,"I'm a 21 year old guy and there's a term I came across a few days ago that I felt described a very prominent issue when it came to relationships with me. 

I have this constant urge to constantly interact with my partner and have all the time with them that I can.   
When they have to call other people like their friends or when they have to do stuff alone I have this sudden jolt of anxiety kick in as if they're gonna get rid of me.  
I feel like a lot of it stems from my trust issues due to bad experiences with past relationships but it doesn't excuse my behaviour.

It's one thing to be cautions within reason but the person I feel this over has proven time and time again that they're absolutely loyal and I feel terrible for making them prove it as it's unfair on them and I won't stand for that.  
I want to be able to be rational in these cases but overthinking kicks in and I can't do anything about it.

I feel like if spend enough time without me, I'll become redundant and left behind as such. I know this isn't the case but I can't  seem to get my head out of this loop. I genuinely don't know what to do."
222,What exactly qualifies as trauma?,"A few months ago something happened to me, and while I certainly wouldn't label it traumatic, it was definitely uncomfortable and made me feel used. I wouldn't say the event changed my life, by any means, but it definitely gave me the icks. Every time I think about it now, I've started physically reacting to the memory...? I blink hard and fast, shake my head really hard as if I'm shaking out the memory, and less frequently, start dissociating. These ""tics"" (I apologize if these aren't exactly tics, I don't know a better word to use.) are getting to the point of discomfort in every day life. I'll be speaking to someone, my mind vaguely drifts off to the event, and I'll violently shake my head/blink mid conversation. It embarrasses me. Was just wondering if anybody's dealt with something similar..?"

225,Anti Depressants?,"Hi, I have suffered from severe depression my entire life, for a span of about 5 years I had it under control really good. I was happy, I was able to feel happiness, and my sadness was very manageable, like what I imagine someone without depression experiences. Anyways, recently my depression has become worse than ever; which is terrifying because I barley survived my teenage years. Since I was about 12 or 13 people have wanted me to try anti depressants, but I am terrified of trying them because of side affects and anecdotal accounts of what being on them is like. I’ve been seeing a new therapist weekly for the last 3 weeks and I know that conversation is bound to come up eventually. I am really scared of trying SSRI’s, I struggle greatly with suicidal ideation and I’m scared of that getting worse, but I don’t have much to loose at this point. I believe it is possible for me to get back to that place of happiness without anti depressants because I did it before, but I know that will be insanely difficult and could take years. Some people talk about anti depressants taking away the high highs with the low lows, and also decrease in sex drive. Sex is my only source of joy so that is a non starter for me. Also, I can’t imagine life without the high highs and I am terrified of the gray lifeless existence some people on anti depressants describe. What is being on anti depressants really like for you? The good, the bad, all of it. Also, if anyone has tried anti depressants and is no longer taking them, have you experienced any side effects? Thank you❤️"

228,Best Affordable Online Therapy,"Hey everyone, I’m currently w/o insurance and was wondering if anyone had suggestions for the best online therapy apps or websites for someone on a budget? Thank you in advance!"
229,I question my reality,"Ok, so I don't know how to describe how I feel. I guess the best way to describe this is like I'm in a simulation, and what I am experiencing now, is daydreaming. This feeling has been with me since I was a child. I know that what surrounds me is real, I know when I am awake or dreaming, but I can't feel right, I feel like something is missing.

I recently told my best friend about this, he told me that I just experience brain fog. But I know is more than that. I daydream a lot. When walking, laying down, when doing microtasks, sometimes even during a boring conversation.

Often I just remind myself that I need to get back in the moment, and suddenly my attention is sharper and the world seems clearer. One last thing that I would like to mention is that I feel numb, more than others(I don't know if this has to do with what I'm experiencing.)

I am not disturbed by this thing that I'm experiencing and don't see it as an ""illness"". I'm used to it. But it would be nice to know what it is, I heard about depersonalization, but not sure if that is what I'm going through. Can you help me identify what this is?"
230,Online Therapy Resources Needed,"Hello everyone...

Any help is greatly appreciated and I believe this to be a time sensitive matter.

231,I'm an attention whore with social anxiety,"For the past year or so, I have become obsessed with seeking the approval and admiration of others. Now, most people craving attention can simply shout, do stupid stuff, and embarrass themselves. I was never in the spotlight ever in my life, my friends treat me like they only simply tolerate me or treat me like a joke, and I have never achieved anything in my life. All I want is for people to just give me the love and attention I need. I know that's wrpng of me to want, but I don't care. I want it.

I have social anxiety and I'm at least half decent of a person. So I just constantly put myself out there only to get shot down every time. I wanted to join the student council. I got in, but I realized all we did was plan homecoming and barely did anything else. I kept doing drama, but ended up getting very small, replacable parts and nobody noticed me.

By January 2020, I became extremely fixated on finally being loved and adored by everyone in my school (I was a senior in high school). I obsessed over who got more applause, who payed attention to me, how I could get the admiration I desired. Luckily because I have anxiety, I was not willing to do any permanent damage or irrational. Turn out thinking obsessively over every scenario possible does have benefits. I got upset over such small things like someone getting complimented instead of me. The only plus side is I kept it all inside and never projected.

I still never got complimented or encouraged by anyone. Everything I did failed. I felt (and still feel) constantly lonely and lost. I just want someone to tell me I did a good job. 

Most of this stems from my Dad, who always has a critique for everything. I also never had the best friends growing up."
232,"Whenever I try to sleep and close my eyes, I see a weird figure.","It's 23:00 pm right now. I've been trying to sleep but I feel a sudden wave of cold on my back whenever I close my eyes. When I open them, I see a weird, small, dark figure rushing through my room. When I hide my arms, half of my face and lay there like a plank, it doesn't get closer. If I however have my arms above the blanket, it gets closer everytime I try to sleep. Am I hallucinating? How do I stop this? I'm scared. Is this something stress related? Or some kind of paranoia?"

234,How to start loving yourself?,"Hey there,

I have been going through a lot of thoughts for a long while now. My family and friends are far due to coronavirus, my love life has been going downhill and I’ve been caught badly in that. I want to be heard and I want to get better, but I am lost on what to do to make myself feel better. It feels like I don’t know anything about myself and I don’t love myself for a while at all. I have no motivation to do anything, I am all suspicious and sad. I can’t go on like this, I don’t want to feel like that. 

How to start loving yourself? I’ve been caught thinking I love all my surrounding people, but how can I love if I don’t love myself... 😔"
235,Is it normal to talk to yourself and laugh out loud?,"For as far as the search for this answer took me, I've heard that it is a sign of higher cognitive function. It is said that talking to yourself on a daily basis is a sign of high intelligence and that there should be nothing to worry about.

# But here's the thing,

# I don't think many people understand the extend to which I talk to myself.

I talk to myself in a loud tone, half the times I change up the pitch and accent to an exaggerated stage, there's no constant stage, there are many types of voices. I do this often as I'm walking around my room in a circle, in bursts of 5-10 minute sequence in the least. The bursts occur after every few minutes again. The whole thing might sometimes take up to 30 mins in total. Often times this occurs in a dark room with the lights turned off at night (because it's night and I'm alone and not for my love of darkness or anything)

I slip into this when my mind wanders (which is almost all the time), specifically when I'm alone. so it isn't an uncontrollable behaviour. I'm sort of semi aware of this happening and snap back into reality every now and then. I find this weird myself, but when it's too tempting I let myself slip back into the state.

The talk themselves are conversations with my friends and acquaintances, that have happened, or more often, what may have happened. It's made up, or fictional most of the time.

Oh and i also make weird expressions while doing these.

Basically, if you catch me doing it, it'll be an awkward moment where you'd have seen me walking around my room in circles talking loudly to myself in the dark. So yeah weird.

Anyone care to explain why this is or if there's something really wrong with me, let me know, I'm open to discussion."
236,depression makes me in some way safe??,"okay so, i want to go to a psychiatrist to finally get a diagnosis (been struggling past 4 years without professional help, sounds great doesn't it) on my mental health, but at the same time something keeps me from doing that. my depressive episodes in some way make me feel safe, it's like i can dive into that big pool called depression and just sink to the bottom and by that i feel like i have someone to just turn to and i just can be freely as sad and depressed as i can get without being anxious about that

i don't know, has anybody experienced anything like that?"
237,Got this when I came home from the hospital,[removed]
238,Does anyone else ever having this feeling like something is VERY off with their life?,"So I have struggled with depression and social anxiety for the past few years. I’ve been on a very rough journey with little support, but I see a bright future ahead of me. I’m in therapy, I’m improving my confidence, and even my social skills. Although I don’t have many friends now, I know I will make them as other aspects of my life also improve. I’m transferring to a university next fall, so I like to think of this time in my life as the “waiting” period before I start really living.

Although I am starting to see changes in my life, I have times where I get this feeling like something is drastically wrong with my existence. It’s an extremely hopeless feeling, like I don’t feel normal in my own skin and I’m almost disgusted with my life. It’s not a normal feeling of depression and hopelessness. It feels as though everything is just wrong, and there are huge chunks in my life that are missing. I don’t know how to explain this feeling to anyone else, but this is the best way I can put it into words. It just feels very... off. Even when things are great, this feeling lingers, and I hate it. Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
239,Today's been a tough day.,"My little sister was murdered about 4 months ago and it still feels like it just happened yesterday. Like just seeing her body yesterday, and what those 2 guys did to her, I can't imagine how someone could be that evil, to torture and shoot 7 people, and even a dog. Some days I just want to shut down and not even get out of bed. My son keeps me going, and all his 2 year old toddler energy makes sure I'm always right behind him, lol. He's my anchor in all this madness for sure though."

242,Questions to any victims of bullying,"I was a victim of bullying as a child. First from my verbally abusive father, and then my “friends” took over. “Friends” means the only people close to my age in the tiny place I grew up. I no longer have anything to do with the people from that time and place, apart from my brother, and it’s been almost two decades since I moved. I’m not hiding the fact that I was bullied to people in the life I’ve made since, or that I have suffered severe mental health issues. But I am careful in who I tell, cause I don’t want it to get back to the bullies. I don’t want them to know that I regard myself as a victim of bullying, not because they will get defensive or retaliate, but because that is something that they would have bullied me for when I was young. “Ooo look at him, he’s a victim of bullying now!” I can just hear them in my head, bullying me for feeling that I’ve been bullied.

In my language we have a word for someone who is a victim of bullying, but I can’t bring myself to use that word on myself. It’s just so ironic that I was bullied to the extent that I don’t feel comfortable using a word about myself that means I was a victim of bullying. That I somehow isn’t worthy of using that word on myself. That using it on myself will somehow make people bully me for it. I don’t know if I’m making any sense here. Is there anyone else who feels this, or am I just very weird?"

245,"I really want to end my life, and don't know what to do anymore.","It's been nearly a year of constant suicide idealations, that within the last 4 months have only gotten worse. To the point of me coming home from work, and spending hours thinking of every different way i could easily just do it right then and there. 
I haven't been able to do anything besides sleep months away, go to work, and then come home and think about whether or not I'm finally going to take my own life. 

I'm all alone. No friends, really no family that would actually help or genuinely care, and officially lost my boyfriend who was abusive and apparently only stuck around because he pitied me. I don't want to meet anyone else, because at this point I'll shut them out anyways.

I don't really want to talk. I've already tried it. I've tried talking to strangers online, I've tried suicide crisis lines (which are almost a joke), I've tried individual therapy 2+ times a week, and intensive group therapy. I've tried meds, I've been talking to my doctor constantly. It may sound stupid that I'm trying to get help when i feel helpless and am ready to just end it, but regardless i know it's not right. I've been hoping somehow i can be fixed. 

But I've been losing hope. Nothing has helped one bit. And it continues to get worse. I don't know what to do anymore or what else to try. I don't want to submit myself to inpatient because i need to keep working full time to keep my apartment and cats.

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to see if they say anything else. But seriously i need some sort of help"
246,I'm currently having a mental breakdown. I'm going to kill myself,"This is the worst mental breakdown I've had in my entire fucking life. My hands are shaking. I feel like my childhood fucked me up. No I wasn't abused. My adoptive mom told my sister she was being mean and just to stop it when she had autism and showed signs of it knowing she had autism. She cut her hair short whenever she misbehaved. She called my sister fat and told me she wished she never adopted any kids. Yeah I don't know how I over looked all the fucked up shit she did. I always thought ""oh she means well but she made mistakes"" now I just don't know. I've been having nightmares about her. There's good times about her though like she would be nice and shit and I don't think she's a terrible person but yeah. I think I'm a terrible person sometimes. Im going to kill myself tomorrow. I don't give a fuck anymore. I ask God for forgiveness everyday and I don't wanna go to hell I don't even know if I believe in god who really knows if he exists? How am I supposed to know? I've never seen him. I got bullied for being masculine I got called a dyke in middle school and now I can't stand that word. My mom ignored when I told her I was depressed. She found a noose while cleaning out my room and she didn't ask me about it. She had to have found it. It was right on my bed clear as day. My dad has found razors on my room and just took them. The only way I can see myself being happy is dead. I don't know what to fucking do anymore."
247,Mom choked me when I was little and I resent her for that.,"I was about 5 years old when she got on top of me ,put her hands over my mouth causing me have a really hard time breathing. She was overweight too so this did really hurt me physically when she did this. My mom hasn’t come near to hurting me after that happened which is good but sometimes I just can’t help but to keep constant guard whenever I’m near her. I don’t know maybe I am overreacting . Whenever I bring up about what she did to me she denies it and my dad just doesn’t seem to care. My moms kind to me now though and I really do feel bad when I turn cold to her , and maybe I should stop because she changed . I don’t know am I right for still hating her till this day for this? I’m really sorry for my terrible English by the way."
248,What are some alternatives to therapy for someone who can't afford it?,"Im not realy in a bad place, i can maintain my mental health pretty fine i just want someone to give me constructive criticism and help me with tips on how to improve.

250,Losing my therapist Bc of money. Help me decide,"We’ve been together for at least 1.5 years. My insurance is regience. Kaiser and I’m gonna have to pay $150 for therapy when I used to not have to pay at all Bc I was on my parents plan. I know I’m worth it and I should just pay it but I don’t have a whole lot of money. And I don’t want to have to get to know a new person all over again and tell my “life story”. It’s pathetic saying life story but i try to go in great detail as to why I am the way I am. Or I can just not show up to this appointment, save the $150 and send her flowers instead and send a letter thanking her for her help getting me through my hardships. 

I’m just at loss of what to do. I still easily cry at triggering subjects when I’m talking about myself, even right now. It doesn’t help that I have a period that hardly stops (maybe I get 3-4 days off or goes on for months). Does easily crying make me mentally unstable? I don’t know what to do.

Spend $300 a month each month (2x a month) for a therapist or ditch the therapy sessions altogether and figure it out on my own?"

252,Today I relapsed after almost 6 years (:,"I hadn’t self harmed for 6 years or really even thought about doing it again until tonight. The worst part is I’d forgotten how much better it made me feel! I’m 24 with no job, friends or qualifications all because of my fucking mental health and I don’t see it ever getting better. I still live at home with my mum but she has a new boyfriend now who she’s thinking of moving in with so idk what I’ll do. He won’t want me living with them and I don’t really think my mum wants me there either. How the fuck am I 24 and this is my life?? I wish I could end it but my dads heart would break. Plus I’m too pussy to do it anyway! Americans are so lucky having access to guns. If I did I’d probably have ended it long ago. On the bright side my doctor might finally be giving me meds but I honestly don’t think they’ll work. I think I’ll be stuck feeling like shit forever. I can’t even leave the house alone these days. And I’ve been going to therapists since I was 13 and they’ve never helped. Even cbt didn’t and I really thought it would. Most of the time I block everything out and pretend I’m fine and happy and my life is fine but in reality it’s far fucking from it! Everyone thinks I’m just a lazy piece of shit but how can I get a job when driving to the shop alone gives me panic attacks??? The reason I self harmed tonight is because I have an important phone call in the morning. That’s all. But my stupid fucking brain can’t even handle that!! I’m so pathetic. I’m considering waking up and getting wasted in the morning just so I can have this stupid phone call. If anyone replies to this thank you. I won’t reply cos I’m a pathetic idiot and replying to strangers on the internet makes me too nervous hahahha but I will read it and appreciate it"
253,"The happier, healthier, getting my shit together app 😝♥️","I need your help. For my final project in grad school I have to create an app and I want it geared towards mental health. I have struggled all my life with my mental health and it is something I really want to work towards improving in life. Not just for myself but others as well. I have personally tried so many different apps to help me get through the hard times, but I have never actually stuck with any of them. Whether it be habit tracking, moods, sleep, meditation...the list goes on and on. I want to know what you have absolutely loved in apps and what you really wish was an option. I want to create something that would truly be beneficial and help everyone to grow into the amazing people I know we all are. 

One idea I had was an anonymous chat room that allows you to vent and receive advice from others going through the same things. So that maybe we can have a place to feel less alone if we needed it.

There could be an mbti personality tab, where you can go to find others that are similar to you. It’s truly awesome interacting with someone that has the exact same personality as you! (btw, INFP here 😊)

I am working to become a pharmacist and know how beneficial medication intervention can be as well as behavioral. So maybe have a place that allows you to talk to professionals about your options and what you can do to take that first or next step. I know as a future pharmacist I would love to help in this way.

One thing I have learned in my mental health journey is that we are all amazing, unique, and should love who we are. I want to create something that helps bring everyone together and learn to not be afraid of who you are. One year ago I almost committed suicide because of how much I hated who I was. I was SO convinced there was something wrong with me simply because I was introverted and enjoyed things like reading rather than going out and partying. I tried to force myself to be someone I wasn’t and it broke me. Now here I am, somewhere I never in a million years imagined I could be. We all have the power and strength to change our lives and build the future we want even if it may not seem that way to you now. I want this app to do that. And maybe, just maybe, this amazingly unique app can actually be created. 

No more rambling from me, send me any and all ideas! And remember that NOTHING is a bad idea, if you think something would benefit you tell more about it. Feel free to share your journey with mental health and how you got to where you are now, I would love to hear your story ♥️

Stay safe everyone 🖤"

I mean I've had therapists in the past but never got very far. The fact that all but the last one were friends with my parents or otherwise involved in my school didn't help much with trust issues and the fear of being outed.

It's truly overwhelming me. So many intense emotions. I feel afraid about the consequences of the treatment in the career I was about to start on and which is being taken from me. I'm almost getting my PPL (private pilot license), and while I don't pose any danger like being suicidal or anything like that, the meds will make me drowsy and unable to pilot any aircraft, or pass the yearly renewal of my medical certificate for that matter.

I also feel tremendously sad because this is making me look back. I've never accomplished anything in my life. 12 years at university and counting, no closer to finishing it than when I started, no real job (I work for my Dad who technically doesn't pay me), living with my parents at 29, you name it. I check all the loser boxes.

Then there's pride for finally accomplishing the *monumental* task of scheduling an interview with a psychiatrist earlier this week, *going through with it*, and even undergoing the exams she asked me. I followed up, downloaded the results which could very well be stage where I'd otherwise have dropped the ball, and I forwarded them to her. She got back to me today with digitally-signed prescriptions, and knowing myself *that* could have also been another insurmountable wall but I did it: I went ahead and placed an order. It feels like I'm trying to translate some alien language here because I feel like the level of difficulty that I'm trying to describe should make absolutely no sense. I feel weirdly accomplished.

Which brings me back to square one and sadness for being so fragile and whiny and lazy that such a trivial errand becomes so brobdingnagian to me. You know those cute pet videos where a tiny pup looks up at the stairs and can't even climb the first step? That's where I am. I feel like I've given everything I had in me this week. I'm *exhausted*. I want to go to bed and wake up in two or three years.

But no. The last overwhelming feeling I'm feeling right now is perseverance. Momentum. Sheer energy. I know it wouldn't last on its own but now I have help. It doesn't feel like I'm a person walking through an open door right now; I'm instead somebody's hands violently SLAMMING against a set of closed doors and opening them as they walk in, unstoppable and unopposed. Nothing can slow me down now. I'm just waiting for the drugstore to analyze my order and notify me that my meds, MY ANTIDEPRESSANTS GODDAMMIT, are ready for pick-up.

Oh god I'm crying so much. wtf

Thanks everybody for the lovely comments on the other post btw."

264,"Why do I want to harm myself, and hate myself even though I have a great life, and I am very young?","I have been very down, and today was the first day I have ever wanted to harm myself. I punched my doors hard just to hurt my hands. I have calmed down now. I grew up and still live a great life. I am 13 and I know it is young, and puberty hormones exist. I don’t think I would feel this sad for a year because hormones. It has been getting worse, and I was going to cut my wrists today. Why do I feel like this for no reason. I have never been abused, bullied badly, and I have some decent friends. Why do I feel this way? Please comment for help."
265,Need to know if I’m silently going absolutely mad or if I just have a mental disorder?,"This has bothered me for the majority of my life but these past couple years the thoughts have intensified.

First of all, I feel like I’m just watching myself live from the outside in. I feel like an outside spectator. But at the same time I feel trapped inside my own head. 
We all know that with being human we feel emotions and produce thoughts, but I’m scared that the feelings/emotions/thoughts that I feel aren’t my own. I’m not at all trying to suggest that they might be someone else’s, I just don’t know if I’m ACTUALLY feeling them. I kind of feel like a computer that uses an algorithm to choose the correct emotional response to certain situations; I feel things not because I truly feel them but because I just have to. IDK. Does that make sense? 
I don’t feel like my own person. I just go through the motions of living but I lack a self. I feel like I’m just a shell—not an empty one, but a shell filled with all my attempts of trying to be a good person to others but deep down I feel like I’m a bad person just faking it all, even though I haven’t really done anything to purposely hurt anyone ever. Everyone who knows me describes me as sweet and funny and very smart and thoughtful and kind but I’m scared that that’s not actually ME.

It’s hard to live life like this. Sometimes I can appreciate life’s beauty, but mostly I just feel dread. How can life be beautiful if it’s not real.

Some sensations have to remind me that I’m alive (i.e. feeling hot water in the shower, hearing my heart beat, watching myself bleed) and I’m horrified it might escalate to self harm, which I’ve already quit.

Another thing (the biggest thing that makes me sound absolutely crazy) is that I’m scared that my existence is slowly deteriorating and that someone else is just going to replace me in the universe without anyone noticing. No, I don’t think I’m gonna die; I feel like I’m going to disappear. I don’t know guys! I know it’s crazy but I don’t know.

I feel numb and automatic all the time but at the same time I can feel a strong burning emotion in my throat that i can’t explain.

I don’t want to be crazy, but I’ve been keeping all this in and I need someone to hear me. If it helps, I have a history of MDD, PTSD, and GAD.

I’m just confused - i need some insight please."
266,Is this normal? Trauma after being detained,"Hi guys so I have a backstory. A few days ago my boyfriend wanted to check out an abandoned theater in our town since he does photography of such things, and initially we weren’t going to go inside but he seemed eager, and I agreed to explore. I was scared but my nerves started to lift after a while. 

We left and then decided to go back after grabbing some stuff from the car, and a few minutes later while he was busy checking something out I heard a police radio, and saw an officer outside. I told him we should go and I went out first, and an officer pointed a gun at me immediately. Now me, I’m very terrified of guns and this sent me into a meltdown. Being a tiny girl I’m especially scared. I thought he was going to shoot me. 

I scraped my knees and my cheek on the ground and the handcuffs were so tight they left bruises, and the officer bruised my upper arm when he grabbed me to pull me up. I cried and snotted everywhere, I had ants crawling on me and my hair was stuck to the tears on my face. My boyfriend was so calm but I was having a panic attack and scared I was going to jail. 

The cops called the property owner and he said people break in all the time, and let us go. My boyfriend wasn’t phased but he apologized profusely for getting us in trouble, and I told him it was a mutual decision to go in.

Now I keep having intrusive flashbacks to when it happened and I can’t stop thinking about the gun in my face and the feel of being forced on the ground. Is this normal or am I experiencing some sort of trauma?"
267,telemedicine issues,"I know how ignorant this sounds but I really don’t like telemedicine. As someone with horrible anxiety, just the thought of having therapy via zoom or over the phone makes me shake. And I understand that telemedicine is the safer option now and makes these services more accessible for those who are disabled and telemedicine definitely should have been as prevalent pre-COVID as it is now. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to sound like an asshole right now. It’s just that trying to find a psychiatrist to help treat my anxiety is really hard when the only way to reach them is via a means that triggers my anxiety."
268,Its okay to not be okay,"it's okay to not feel okay sometimes but u dont have to suffer alone, dont be afraid or ashamed to seek help, if u cant talk about it to ur close ones then talk to someone you trust. YOU MATTER and ur mental health is important. 

iv been going through a lot of shit recently and being open about it and seeking help was the best thing iv done. it dosnt matter how small, please seek help if you need it. 

if you dont have anyone to talk to, drop me a dm. il try my best to get back to anyone who needs a chat 

stay safe folks 👍🏻"

273,Moved houses and have been extremely suicidal due to the move,"I'm a 22 year old on the spectrum and have OCD.

After living in my home for 15 years with mom, we moved houses to a completely new area. We threw most of our older goods such as computers out, so i bought a new one, it is not set up yet. This premise has no internet and they plan on coming here next week, so until than i need to use my phone internet. 

Since moving here i have felt no desire to do anything, i have been crying a downpour of tears, i have felt insecure, uncomfortable, depressed, like life is not worth living, like nothing matters anymore and the only solution is to kms. I have never felt so insecure, terrorized and anxious like this ever. I am in the midst of a Mjaor depressive episode. Not having my routine is destroying me, not having the internet and ability to play call of duty, or living in the neighbourhood i was in for 15 years is causing me anguish. How can i stop feeling this massive wave of emotion and depression? a few days before this i ws fine"
274,I'm getting help,"So I went to see my universities counselor today. Saw a nurse practitioner instead but that's fine. 

She was really lovely and took a bunch of notes about how I've been lately (i.e. not good - barely sleeping, memory issues, anxiety attacks every other say, thoughts around self harm). She was really kind about it, and has scheduled another appointment for me next week with her as well as with a student counselor, and I've got some meds to help me over the weekend. 

What's scaring me is she got me to do a mood questionnaire, and I accidentally saw the result - ""possible cause major depressive disorder"". I already have anxiety and social phobia, I don't want to add depression on top of that. 

Now that I've seen it I've started comparing my experience over the last few months to what my mum's described of her depression when she was unmedicated, and I'm finding similarities. Idk I want to say it's just all in my head and I'm making it up but some of it feels exactly like what she said and I don't know anymore.

But, keeping things positive I'm getting the help I clearly need (more so than I thought) and hopefully I can go back to some form of normal soon!"
275,Confused about something,"
When I was a kid I was playing with a lamp inside the house. My dad and grandma were in the other room. I don’t remember what I was doing but I cut my finger and my nail came off. I’m pretty sure there was blood but I can’t remember but I was scared to tell my dad. I loved my dad, he wasn’t verbally or physically abusive, he was cool but I was scared to tell him. I know that it might be a stupid question and I may be blind but I don’t understand why I would be scared to tell him. Any ideas or thoughts?"
276,Dad doesn’t want me to be confident?,"Dad doesn’t want me to be confident?

So, I’m just looking for opinions as to why this may be. I’m constantly getting told by others I’m not confident enough, despite all these positive attributes people say I have. I was bullied as a child but I managed to get past that and went to a good university, then went on to get a masters too. I’m very ambitious and always strive to achieve things. Despite this, I struggle to project confidence. 

I’ve noticed that whenever I try to say something positive about myself, my dad would say ‘no’ under his breath, or make a funny face or use some other way to show his dismissal of my statement. I find this very confusing, as sometimes he’ll say he’s proud of me and that he’s never achieved what I have. 

Any idea why he may not want me to be confident? I am trying hard to better myself and feel that I don’t want anyone to try and bring me down, especially from someone who knows I’ve suffered various things in my life. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
277,How do you not be like someone you’re around constantly and have no way to distance yourself from?,I’m always around my mom and we have very opposite personalities. I have no way to distance myself and I have to talk or hear her talk all the time. I’m becoming more like her. I’m 13 and I’ll have to be with her like this until I’m at least 17. I really couldn’t stand if I’m even the slightest bit like her which I already am. I have almost no outside influence.
278,How do I trust?,"I struggle a lot with what I belive is abandonment issues and trust issues. I'm not 100% but it's most what it sounds like. I'm a 16 year old boy in his sophomore year and it's hard to trust anyone. my parents feel like strangers. my friends feel like theyre only putting up with me. I'm shown time and time again I should worry. for example one of the girls in my group opened up about how her life had been and her family's problems and logically if she didnt like me she wouldnt have told me if we weren't close she wouldnt have told me, emotionally I feel like shes playing a mind game to preserve my feelings and slowly walk away from me rather then just stop talking to me. this is the same for all of my friends but different worrys and scenarios. What do I do? I came to reddit because I dont trust anyone to talk to but this is slowly killing me I feel so lonly no matter how many people love me. every day I feel worse and worse and I'm just stuck I've felt worse physically and mentally before but this have torn me up the past 2 years.

Anyway if you can offer any advice or anything please tell me and in sorry if this dosnt make to much sense it was typed in about 5 minutes so I'll be willing to clarify anything for you."
279,I have had a legitimately terrible life. How am I not supposed to be depressed?,"I’m 19, all my teenage years I’ve had crippling anxiety that sucked all the enjoyment out of anything I wanted to do. Therapy and meds do nothing, any progress has been through sheer exposure forcing myself to do things and slowly, painfully retraining my brain. As a kid I was always alone and never did much outside the box, which I’m sure led to the anxiety issues. And naturally all this is going to lead to depression. And when I get depressed I get VERY depressed very quickly. I struggled not to cut myself yesterday and I get suicidal ideations. I haven’t liked myself or my life in forever. To be honest my only real lifeline of sanity is music. I don’t even know what to do at this point"
280,just checking in — are you okay? pt 2,"i posted here about 3 weeks ago because i wanted to give people the opportunity to honestly share how they’ve been doing. my inspiration behind this was that most of us get asked how we’re doing all the time, but people doing genuinely want to know the answer. they simply expect us to say we’re good and then we both move on with our days. well, my original post ended up getting flooded with people honestly sharing how they’ve been feeling so i thought i’d make a 2nd edition and, once again, give people the chance to honestly share how things are going 

and, just like i mentioned in my first post, i think this subreddit does an incredible job of showing us that we aren’t really alone. there are people there to support us, even if sometimes those people are just other reddit users who we’ve never met. this subreddit is an incredible community filled with supportive people who are there to offer advice to others. it’s truly refreshing and heartwarming :)"
281,I try so hard but I can't seem to make anything work. I just always seem to get pushed back down and back.,I keep trying so hard. I got a job for the first time in a long time. Well sort of a job. It's just delivering. I got scammed and got everything I'd made today stolen. I'll be fine and luckily it wasn't much only $40. I've also been trying to make friends again and just have people to talk to. I've used reddit for that mostly. I still have a hard time with people though. One of the people really played me and won't leave me alone no matter how much I try to get them to. Blocking them does no good they just use different emails or phone numbers to contact me. It's like they just enjoy hurting me. It feels like the world just enjoys hurting me and telling me I can't be a part of it. idk. I'm just really not doing well with all of this. I feel like I've been pushed back so far. It gets so fucking hard to get back up when I seem to always just get things like this. I don't know why I even try.

283,I Really Need Help and I Don’t Know How to Get it,"Hey guys I really need some help. I have been dealing with depression and eating disorders ever since I was about 12 years old. I like in a very Christian and conservative household and I have never been able to even request access to help on a professional level. My parents think that my mental illness isn’t real even thought I have had suicide attempts. Instead of getting me help for my bulimia my mom just calls me “throw up girl” now and ostracizes me on the daily. Well I’m 19 now and turning 20 in December. I’m currently at home due to Covid but in the spring I will be on my college campus out of state in Ohio. Finally, I will be free and would like to seek getting some real mental help. However, I don’t know how to go about it. Can I be subscribed medication through a campus counselor? How do I go about getting those things on my own? Do I even have to have insurance to get a subscription? Please let me know. Thanks~"
284,I felt at home in the psych ward... what?,"So last week I had my first stay in an inpatient psych ward. I had a bipolar 1 episode which I was pushed over the edge by my abusive mother and an argument I had with her and overdosed on my anti-depressant. After the emergency room I ended up at the Sunrise mental health facility. 
It was a big adjustment but by the end of the week I felt... at home? I didn't have to hide my struggles. I didn't have to put on my im fine face. Everyone there had issues and I wasn't alone in my struggles. 
Now that I'm home in a way I miss the ward... I feel so conflicted and confused about that..."
285,How to grow up?,"Title pretty much sums it up, I’m tired of being a 23 year old man child. I didn’t have good role models. I want a better life, but I’m afraid. How can I start?"
286,No reason to have mental health issues,"So just a background 
I am 28 got a degree in marketing and communications, went into the Union and am now an HVAC Tech. I have been with the company for 4 years now. Overall considering I am successful to a degree 
I am dependant on medical marijuana and the company I work for drug tests 
When I do not smoke my mind goes to dark places. I did not go to college for what I wanted to do. I have always been into computers and realizing a degree in IT or Programming would have been better for me 
I have locked myself into 6 years of a trade that makes good money but doesn't make me happy. I frequently only see myself as a failure and whenever it is brought up the only response I get is that all I want to do is play video games and smoke pot and to stop blaming my problems on them. I do not blame any problems on them and only on myself. Recently I stopped smoking because I came out and told them I am a medical user and need it to function. They told me I am not allowed. 
Every day I am anxious , have a stressful job where everyone is angry at you because the AC or Heat is out, parents who don't understand a fucked up mind, and me who always sees myself as a fuck up. How do I get out of this? I feel trapped. 
Thank god I have a supportive girl in my life or else I would be scared for what would happen."
287,surge of affection,"aaAAAAA i'm in a mood where i just love everything wayyyy more than normal

this is so much better than my normal numb or sad mood. i feel warmth in my heart rather than heaviness.

i hope everyone has a wonderful rest of their day."
288,I told my mom about my depression, I had a panic attack today and decided I should open up to her. I have tried to open up before but this time she took it very well. She said if talking to my school counselor doesn't work out then I can go to therapy. I know some people hate therapy but I think it could be really beneficial for me. Anyways thats all &lt;3
289,Panic Attack or something Else?,"I'm a 22 F with PTSD, ADD, depression, anxiety, and some OCD tendencies. I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was 13 so at this point I would think that I have everything in order, but what happened to me yesterday got me scared. 
This year I have been dealing with dissociation, which I haven't had as severely before now. 
Yesterday I dissociated and had a panic attack during it.
At least I think it was a panic attack.

During this time I was having very troubling thoughts such as wanting to tear the skin off my arms, laughing maniacally, hitting my head on the wall and floor, and slamming my hands onto the floor, and having thoughts of destroying the furniture as I ran through the house, and hitting myself in the head...

The only times that I have thoughts and actions like this are when I'm sleeping and having a nightmare. But it's like my sleep person took control of my awake self. And if I didn't have my husband and mom around to take care of me I know I would have hurt myself really badly...

Do you think this was a panic attack? How does dissociation affect attacks? Am I dealing with a completely different mental illness all together?"
290,Words hurt,I was doing so well. I was ready to get a grip on my eating disorder. I even saw a dietician and got my basal metabolic rate and found a good diet for me. Then my mom has to say how trash my rate is and stuff. Fell right back into old habits. Guess I can’t get a grip around her. So reminder to stfu if you can’t say anything nice.
291,I told my mom about maybe being Bipolar,I have told my mom about me maybe being Bipolar and she said she would schedule me into a appointment to see if I actually do have it. It's been a month and nothing and I don't know what to do about it. Anyone have any advice?
292,Memory problems?,"Do you have problems with your memory? I've read that many mental health issues like depression can have severe impact on memory.



Is there a way to get my memories back? Or improve my ability to remember things? I can't remember almost anything at all... I have to go through my history with a new therapist soon and idk what to tell him bc I don't remember."
293,Made up scenarios,Okay so I’m not sure if this is part of a mental illness or what but i was constantly make up scenarios in my head for examples ( me talking to someone or interacting with them in some way) then i would make up another scenarios right after about me talking to someone about the scenarios i just made up and try to explain it to them for example ( me talking with a doctor explaining the scenarios that i just had ) if that makes sense it’s so constant i find myself at work getting lost in these scenarios then snapping out of them when someone walks into the room I’m in and it’s like i become so unaware of everything around me and get stuck in my head does anyone know what this could be it’s definitely not normal at least i don’t think so
294,"I always wanted to leave the state because of my dad, now that hes gone I still want to leave and I dont know what to do.","Living in a house with my dad took a huge hit on my mental heath throughout the years and it was at a point where I wanted to go to a college as far away as possible just so I can get away from him. I'm still living at home because of covid and other unrelated college things but I still want to leave. My whole state has felt so suffocating and I want to go somewhere else but it seems like if I even bring the idea up my mom develops the ""my house my rules"" attitude and says that when I move out I can do whatever I want without hearing her input. My brother lives in another state and I want to visit him in January maybe but even that she had a problem with because I'd be traveling alone. She says its because of human trafficking going on right now but at this point I'm almost ready to take the ""its easier to ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" approach and just leave for a few days to visit him. And she wouldn't be able to drive there and drop me off as its a 17 hour drive and she ""doesnt know how to get there"". I don't know how much more I can take living in my room because everywhere else drains my energy."
295,How to help a friend with anxiety and depression,"Earlier today one of my friends friends had an anxiety attack, and they told me about their anxiety and depression. I’m worried that they might be self harming. I would really appreciate any advice on what to do."
296,"Been living on my moms couch for almost two months, first night back at my apartment and I’m not feeling okay.","I’ve (23F) been living in my own place for years, but ever since the panic attack 2 months ago which caused 24/7 anxiety, depression, dissociation, and god knows what else I’ve been a mess. 
So, I’ve been staying at my moms place with my little brother every day and night besides going to the store for almost two months and now I’m back at my apartment, because I know I’m starting to annoy my family with my invisible illness, and also because I know I’m an adult who can’t be not working and paying rent for a place I’m not even at. 

But now I’m here. At home. It’s not the being alone part that gets me (I think) because I have someone here, but I just don’t feel right being here. My apartment doesn’t look or feel the way it did before the panic attack, I didn’t even have the panic attack at my apartment so it’s not like I link it together. ANYWAYS, I’m just scared of living like this forever and not feeling okay in my own home. I hope I end up getting better and don’t do something stupid out of being miserable. I just want this hell to end."

Most recently I've started taking a turn for the worse and am now unhealthily obsessed with a Chinese romance Netflix show/book. Like, I can't focus on work or anything else, I don't feel okay unless I'm watching it or reading the novel or thinking or talking about it. I'm so stupidly invested in this world and these characters that aren't real.

She just fucking ghosted me, it is LITERALLY her job to answer those emails and nothing. Radio silence on her end.

I wrote her an initial email saying I need some help, etc. She asked if I was just looking for coping skills or general questions. I then responded with my thoughts and experiences I have. Constant anxiety, anxiety attacks, the whole nine yards. AND THEN SHE JUST NEVER RESPONDED!!?!??! IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY THAT SHE DOESNT EVEN DO WHAT SHES PAID TO DO! fucking cunt piece of shit bitch, i ask for help one time, just some help coping with ultra anxiety and most likely some form of depression.

THAT FUCKING CUNT CALLED MY PARENTS AFTER I SENT HER THE EMAIL AND THOUGHT I WAS GONNA KILL MYSELF!

303,"This is a very weird and specific post, but I’m alone ATM and really need to talk about this somehow (story is a bit gross)","I’ve been living with my parents since just about the start of the pandemic. They are both asleep now. About half an hour ago I stepped outside onto my parents porch for a quick smoke. As I start walking down the steps onto the lawn, sort of half paying attention to what I’m doing, I hear a loud, awful CRUNCH underneath my sandal. WAY louder than when stepping on a leaf.

I look down and see to my horror that I just stepped on a toad. It’s in...rough shape, but still alive. So, and this is awful but I didn’t know what else to do, I grabbed a shovel, used it to pick the poor guy up, took it into the woods, and killed it to put it out of its misery.

Today’s been a not great day for a bunch of reasons, and this really was the icing on the cake. I’m grossed out, but more than that just sickened, disgusted, not due to grossout but horror at what I just had to do. I was planning on heating up some leftovers after my cigarette, but now not only have I lost my appetite, I almost feel as though I’m going to throw up. My only silver lining I guess is that at least I wasn’t barefoot.

I’ve always loved animals, I’m a vegetarian, and seeing them in pain can sometimes arouse more sympathy from me than humans. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach. I know I’ll get over it, I’m not traumatized by this or anything, but I just kind of had to get it out there, rather than just silently hold onto it."
304,A girl I know cut her wrists and I helped her stop the blood and I’m still shocked after seeing it.,Hi everyone there I’m Aidan (14 male) there was a girl I same age as me let’s call her(Sofia.) I know Sofia had attempted before and she posted on a private Snapchat story that she needed help at about 10:30 Tuesday. I slid up and asked what she needed help with and she said “I cut myself there’s blood and it won’t stop bleeding.” I immediately went into my Boy Scout helpful way and looked up how to stop bleeding from the wrist. I told her to try to apply pressure to it and to tell me how deep the cuts were. She sent me photos of the cuts and I can’t get them out my head. They were cuts all up her wrist and there was a decent amount of blood. I started to freak out I asked her if she needed an ambulance or something and she said no. I respected her decision which I think I should have called which was my fault. I snapped her to tell her to keep applying pressure to it and she didn’t respond for 10 minutes during that time I had a panic attack and started to freak out thinking she had died and I didn’t help her in time. She’s fine now she was able to stop the bleeding and she talked about why she did it. I went online and found a number for her to text so she would have someone to talk to. I just feel like I could have done more in that situation to help I think I failed her and myself I try to help anyone but I felt like I didn’t do enough this time. TL;DR A girl I know cut her arms and I helped her stop the bleeding and all that but I’m kind of shocked still about seeing her arms with all the cuts and blood and can’t stop thinking about if I didn’t slide up and she died or if I couldn’t help her enough and she just cut herself more.

309,Is emotion in a nightmare real subconscious emotion or is it just from stress and imagination?,"Had a nightmare that I brought up something stupid with my parents that I was stressed financially and wasn’t sure if I’d be able to pay bills for this month. My parents then started laughing and I started getting angry. I got in a fight with my parents emotionally and I was beating up my dad physically &amp; kept saying “how could you”. 

I was so so angry and then I woke up with so much anger. The sadness in real life that I felt the night before felt better and I felt the most anger I have ever felt waking up. I wondered if this was the true emotion that has been bothering me for weeks. I have never felt so much anger before in a dream or real life. Real life memories started popping up first when I woke up but I’m confused again if it’s what caused these dreams. 

I would never beat anyone up physically in real life but in the dream I really was going at it. 

I’m just confused if I really felt emotion that I’ve been blocking out or if I was just stressed before I went to sleep. It was such anger, gosh was it a lot of anger that I was so physical in my dream which I’d never do in real life. 

It was just a dream and stress, right?"
310,Why do people instantly dislike me before getting to know me?,"It’s like once a person sees me, their expression completely changes and would stare at me blankly. Or even better, I become invisible to them. Ever since I started high school, I noticed people treating me more colder and rude. Especially in public and it’s still happening. It’s been making me feel awful and lonely. What the fuck is wrong with me? Has anyone else deal or have dealt with this?"
311,Would it be bad if I increase my med dose on my own?,"I'm on lamotrigine for a year. It worked magic at the beginning (unless it was just placebo), but since months it doesn't do anything at all.

I take the minimum effective dosage for an adult, which is 100 mg, and I'd want to increase it to 150

312,Could really use a little bit of help right now,"I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, but I'm having the worst migraine, and just stress, if anyone could spare literally just $1.50 through cash app or PayPal, so I can go buy a little tylenol pack from the store next to me. I had asked the worker if I could pay him back for it when I could, but he said no. I will provide receipt proof if wanted. I'm honestly just trying to get some relief from this headache."

314,PHP OR IOP in Florida,"All the reviews for mental health facilities online are horrible.

Need a recommendation to a good facility from an actual patient. For intensive therapy.

I'm 37, life long depression, first time feeling suicidal last week. Spent 3 days at a hospital but it was full of drug addicts and we were only offered 45 min of group therapy every other day.

I live in Sarasota. I was referred to SMH, but I'm hesitant to check into another hospital.

Where are other options? Like 3-5 stars. 

I don't have a substance abuse problem and most of the facilities only cater to that.

Also open to spiritual or religious retreat/ healing centers that focus on healing trauma. Have a background in yoga and shamanism.

Research is hard.

What have you found in FL. Willing to travel"
315,Loved one in hospital (how to cope),"I’m off at college right now and my mom called me the other day to talk. My dad apparently collapsed in the shower from an aneurysm. They were able to 
cauterize the one and found another while doing so and did the same to that one. They’re keeping him in hospital for a few weeks now to keep watch on him and help him recover. 

I’m gutted that I can’t be there for him to hug him and let him know I love him to his face. I want to be there but I can’t. I know in my heart he will be fine but my negative thoughts keep me worrying about it...  I’m scared. It was so sudden and terrifying and I couldn’t be there for him. It makes me so upset. I think about him and I cry... it’s hindering my workflow with school at this point. I can’t work, I can’t focus because of the worry. I’d feel like I’m making up excuses if I asked for any extensions on my work... I know that’s irrational but I’d feel like a failure that I couldn’t work through the hard times...

I feel like all I’m doing is crying and when I’m not I’m in a state of shock and panic...  I can hardly focus on anything

How do I work through this? Am I weak if I ask for more time on my work?"

318,My mother is mentally abusive and i hate my brother an absolutely IRRATIONAL amount.,"So for the past like 8 years maybe i have hated my brother an irrational amount, like every time i see him i want him out of my life and i wish i never knew him and when he does something that would just normally make someone a bit angry makes me want to actually murder him. 

Anyway, recently it has gotten a bit worse, now every time im around him i want to make him feel pain(thats the best way i can describe it) and my mom is not enjoying it. She told me that my behavior towards him is unacceptable and that i need to stop and I totally agree with her. So, i said that i want to go to therapy to see if there might be something wrong with me because it is very irrational to hate someone this much to the point of wanting to hurt them when theyre around, even if theyre not talking or anything. 

However, instead of agreeing with me that there might be something wrong here she said that i have to stop acting like that or else shes gonna take away the internet for a week because, and i quote, “You watching so much jacksepticeye its making you violent. Hes a bad influence.” (If you dont know, jacksepticeye is a gaming youtuber but i dont watch any shooter games that he plays and he doesnt say anything thats violent so it can’t possibly be making me violent.) So, i responded with, “It has nothing to do with him, im not violent to everyone, just Colin(my brother) so you cant just label me violent.” To which she responded, “*yelling*Watch it, you are on thin ice! Now be obedient or i will take away the internet for a whole MONTH!” 

Allow me to explain why the internet is such a big deal for me and why it would ruin my life if she takes it away. There are two people in my life that bring me joy, my cousin aka my only friend and jacksepticeye and i can only enjoy them through the internet because obviously youtube is on the internet and i cant talk to my cousin in real life because she lives in another state. So by taking away the internet, my mother is basically threatening to take away my only source of joy. 

Anyway, my questions are: What are some possible reasons why i hate my brother so much and how to stop hating him? How to create a relationship with my mother? Im gonna go off on a little bit of a tangent here, the relationship we have right now is toxic and mentally abusive on my end, shes killing my mental abilities. I was almost diagnosed with early onset dementia when i was 12 because my memory is so bad but the doctor said thats not possible because the area of my brain that deals with memory is functioning fine. I think that the reason i have such a bad memory is because when i was young i trained my brain to block out all of the bad memories and heavy mental abuse from my mother, which my brain took too far and started blocking out all memories. I dont know if thats possible but thats what i think is happening. I also want to know how to make her understand how bad shes hurting me? Is there a way i can avoid my whole family because my mom is abusive to me, my dad is verbally abusive to my mom, my sister has gone off the rails with the teenaged rebelling, and my brother makes me want to kill?

TL;DR- My mom is mentally abusive and i want a better relationship with her since im gonna have to live here for the next 4 years at absolute least. Also, i hate my brother an irrational amount to the point where i want to hurt him the second i see him. How do i stop that and is there something possibly wrong with me causing me to feel that way toward him?"
319,"Unbearable Paranoia + Drugs, My History","Uh well hello, this is my first post on reddit and i’m here because i don’t really know who to ask about this. So background here, i’m currently a senior at my local highschool, and i have a slight history of mental health issues. Basically, when i was 12 i was cutting myself and pretty suicidal, same deal at 13, parents didn’t help, when they found out about it they screamed at me about it (don’t really want to go into detail there), and once a little more time had passed they constantly tried to get me alone to talk about it, so i was pretty wary of being alone with them, like literally we’d be in a car and they’d pull off into a parking garage and start asking me about stuff, which of course, i didn’t want to talk about, highly uncomfortable, verge of tears the whole time blah blah blah. So, concurrently with all of this, i had gotten into creepy pasta, like super into it. Which was, not great for a 12 year old. I was, constantly paranoid to say the least, i could not be on my own for at all, for even a minute, literally, even if there were other people in the building. i thought that everywhere i looked there would be some horrible monster waiting to kill me, i was scared to close my eyes when i washed my hair in the shower, for the fear that when i opened them there would be something horrible in front of me, i wouldn’t even look in mirrors because i was afraid of seeing something standing behind me. day and night, just, debilitatingly scared, of everything. i thought doors would lock, i thought rooms would fill with water. I would see things out of the corner of my eye, like borderline hallucinate. I genuinely thought i was about to be killed every almost waking moment of every day for about a year or two. i don’t know if that’s normal, i’d be very curious to know everyone’s experiences with that. Anyways, then in highschool, at 15, i started using drugs, i smoked weed, i drank, i snorted or swallowed pills, i dropped acid, and i took mushrooms. I did all of those things several times, but none of them became a habit except the weed (which i’ve been sober from for a little over two months). never got help from parents quitting when they found out, i got yelled at, and physically abused a bit, which was probably warranted. I also got fucked with kind of a lot. Starting in eighth grade i got random phone calls and texts, people trying to make me think that girls liked me and shit like that. it got worse in high school, some girl spread rumors about me (i don’t know exactly what she said, but from what i understand she made it sound like i sexually harassed/ assaulted her, which i absolutely did not) that she later apologized for, but by then the damage was done, lots of people hated me (and still hate me) because of the things she said, which made me paranoid of people, i couldn’t tell what they had heard about me, I felt like people looked at me differently but i couldn’t be sure, and i obviously couldn’t ask them. Then I did something that i’m not proud of, I cheated on a “girlfriend” of mine, once, and she blocked me a month or two later (i guess she had found out), when i confronted her face to face, she said her parents checked her phone and got her in trouble, which i believed, but she called a friend and laughed about it saying she couldn’t believe how dumb i was for believing her, i confronted her a second time, same thing, lies, then she called her friend and made fun of me. since all of this, i’ve gotten calls in the middle of the night from people i don’t know, talking shit to me or trying to make me believe that they’re people i know they’re not, people messaging me on instagram and trying to get me to talk shit about the girl i cheated on (people who i know are close to her), voice messages from people calling me a rapist, her and her friends contact girls i try to date and tell them all sorts of horrible things about me. they’ve ruined relationships and friendships. which has made me (surprise) even more paranoid of people, i have a hard time trusting people because i don’t know what they’ve heard about me. I have maybe two friends, who, don’t make time to hang out with me, constantly blow me off, and don’t like spending time with me. I have a girlfriend who knows most of these things (not the drug use) and seems to accept me for it, but because of the situation surrounding us getting together i’m incredibly stressed about not knowing if i’m happy with her. and i have a million things to do for school and college applications. I’ve started seeing things again, very faint, things moving in the corner of my eye, ill swear i vividly see a man in the corner of my eye and turn and he’s not there, i know there’s no one there, and i know what i see isn’t real. I’m not really sure what to do."
320,I need help,"I don’t know how to ask for help. It feels suffocating. I feel like I’m drowning in myself. I can’t live with my mind, it hates me and now I hate myself. I don’t think I’ll ever be okay I’ve struggled with this for years. Corona has made me trapped in my mind. I don’t think this will get better. I think it’s too late for me to get help I’m too far gone. I feel like even writing this is too much. I don’t want to put my problems out there it feels too real. 

I have someone in my life that always down plays what I say. I tell them that my mind set is bad and they just tell that’s what it’s like to be a teen. I don’t try to argue with them and tell them  how belittling that is to here. When they say that to me it makes me feel like I’m being extra and lying to myself for attention. I’m not like this for attention I just need help. 

They have made me be scared of opening up because other people will tell me I’m making it worse then it is. 

If someone talks to you about there problems please don’t blame it on their youth it makes them feel like they’re being talked down to. It makes them spiral even farther into their head."
321,I am overly attached to my mom at the age of 17. Is anyone else like this? Is this normal?,I’m generally a very anxious person and this is amplified when I’m not around my mom. I fear growing up and going to college because the thought of being away from her is terrible. I always get worried when she goes out to run errands alone because I don’t want anything bad to happen to her. I cry at the thought of her getting hurt or dying and I honestly don’t think I could handle her death. I’m doing online school right now because of quarantine and I’m honestly praying for it to last all year so I can spend way more time with her. Is anyone else like this or is this a deeper issue?
322,How to help a depressed and suicidal friend,So my closest friends been going through another depressive episode and he’s telling me that it’s never been this bad. I’m really worried about him because he’s also very suicidal. I try try text or call him as much as I can because I’ve never been this scared to lose him. I also have depression so it’s been difficult to accept that I might actually lose my closest friend. I don’t know if i should give him some space or be there for him 24/7. Any advice? I really can’t lose him
323,I wonder what my life would be like if I could just wake up quiet for once (mentions of drugs),"I don't mean verbally quiet, I'm already quiet enough as it is. I mean if my head was quiet, if it was ""normal"". I don't even know what it would be like, do ""normal"" people just wake up and go? Is it that easy? Is doing things easy? Do you not forget everything every few minutes sometimes? 

I wish I could just have some peace. Some silence. But outside silence is deafening and uncomfortable most times, it allows my mind to run and run and run and my head seems to have endless gas. I just want to be quiet inside, to be level, to be calm. Or something like that. The closest I've come is when I tried pot once and while I was high off my ass laughing at dried paint, that was the most peaceful I can remember feeling in what feels like forever. 

I've been offered to take drugs to help but I've seen what they do to my friend with similar voices in his head and my anxiety takes that thread and spins a horror story. I wish I could just wake up quiet."

325,"FUCK YOU, MENTAL ILLNESS!","I used to have so much potential. I was sharp witted funny, and talented.I had supportive friends and family.  I used to look forward to my future, but now everything seems so bleak and hopeless. 

Mental illness has stolen so much from me. It took away my future and my youth. I've spent years worrying, and waiting for better days to arrive, but they never do.

I'm so tired of existing, but I'm too afraid to die. I cling on to the smallest morsel of hope that maybe one day, I'll wake up and feel okay again. But as the years go by, I've realised that it's probably an unattainable dream. I hate looking at the person I used to be and the person I could have been. It physically hurts to know that I am the epitome of wasted potential. I'm so fucking useless."
326,"The ""Good"" Fight","    I've become numb to everything but my own mind. I'm constantly fighting the thoughts in my head, and I'm losing every single time.
   
    My mind dredges up the worst memories imaginable, the ones that it knows I want to forget. I end up feeling an immense sadness,  which manifests itself as a physical feeling of emptiness. It's a feeling that I wouldn't wish on anyone. It's a feeling that makes me want to break down right then and there. 
    
    Even so, I keep it all contained because I realize that I'm in line at a Taco Bell, and crying on the floor wouldn't be appropriate. I'd rather cry at home, bottle in hand, with my bed nearby. My bed is the only place that I ever want to be, and that's where I'm writing this post from.

336,Exhausted and need help,So I’m not typically good at sharing my feelings etc. However I’m very close to my breaking point. so starting a few months ago maybe sooner i have no idea. I’ve honestly just felt exhausted and so tired. No matter how much sleep i get or anything just tired. caffeine etc helps but not much. Today I woke up went to my workout class and tried to be productive ended up sleeping for five hours only to goto dinner then sleep some more. Now i’m up cramming in homework because i feel i’ve been “lazy” all day. For starters i’m 19 y/o female (almost 20) I’m a bartender but have bartender for almost two years. I used to have two jobs and work doubles then work at night and have no problem. I thought maybe it was my mattress so i got a new one two days ago with no luck. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me and I can’t figure it out. I could literally sleep for days and not have the slightest rest. I have an appt for the psychiatrist to test for ADD and Anxiety and i am going to bring this up. I can’t focus on any school for the life of me.

337,Always think people are mad at me.,I’m always super afraid that people (especially my closest friend) are mad at me.

How do I help keep these thoughts back? I’m being driven mad. I need them gone.
338,What could this be?,"I have been feeling sad and down about myself for years. But then I have episodes of normal mood. This has been lasting for 6 years. I have a lot of paranoid thoughts. This has been lasting for 3 years. 

Sometimes I feel like a very spiritual person and that I have gifts. I can feel different times and places. I sometimes feel like I have a purpose given to me by god. These are great feelings. I dont think they are a problem. Then they go away and I feel low.

Recently I have been feeling like a  toxic person and like I have committed sins. I feel like I cant manage my life because of this. I feel guilt. 

I am currently on 10 mg of abilify a day. It helps."

&amp;#x200B;

This is true for so many Indian parents. My friends and I often discuss how our parents completely shut themselves emotionally and find anger/rage as outlets. I hope the newer generation of parents will understand their children better."
340,Why do I now enjoy pain and dead things?,"I have had a rough few days, and recently started watching videos of people hurting themselves for entertainment. Pictures of dead animals and things don’t gross me out anymore but fascinate me. Please tell me why this is happening"
341,My father.,"I remember being young and always being scared at home. Hell of a feeling... constant fear. Especially as a child. My father was 1 of 11 kids. He grew up in poverty met my mother when they were young and they dated long distance before agreeing to marry. 

My mother didn’t know him fully. She thought he was the man of her dreams because a long distance relationship left room for only her imagination. In her imagination, all was well. Until well, it wasn’t. 

I was only a little girl, upset about something silly as kids often are. I had begged my mother to make me my favorite lasaña for a few days. She worked hard on it just for me and happily placed it in front of me. And me being upset about whatever it was, was whimpering a bit at the dinner table. My father upset at me for crying. Threw my dinner plate in my face, picked up his cup of orange juice and also threw it in my face. I got up, silent as I could, dirty and drenched in orange juice and walked to the bathroom to clean up. I don’t remember eating lasaña that night. 

I remember running around the house once, as kids do. I was chasing my older brother (I have 2). We were being kids and playing. My father was taking a nap in the living room and we accidentally woke him up. The next thing I knew I had a metal picture frame flying at my face. I had a black eye for a little bit after that. I remember my mother coming into my room after the incident and with tears in her eyes putting ointment on my swollen half-open eye. Apologizing over and over. 

In the 3rd grade one of my classmates and friends invited me to her birthday party. I wanted to go so so bad. I picked out my favorite doll and I proudly showed it to my mom saying I had a gift for the birthday girl and I was ready to go. My father didn’t think I should go. I was really upset and I was crying sitting on my parents tall king size bed. Again, my father upset at my for crying, shoved me off of the bed and I fell hitting my head on the wall. My mother ended up convincing my father to let me go and I showed up late to the party. I missed the happy birthday song and the cake cutting of the cake. But I entered the park proud and with puffy eyes handed my favorite doll over to the birthday girl. She was happy. 

In the 5th grade, my parents bought me a cheap little purple bike from Walmart. I was so excited. I remember riding it around the neighborhood with a grin on my face. One day, I was riding it to my cousins house down the block and I lost control and flipped over a rock and fell on the road. I remember excruciating pain coming from my arm. A nice neighborhood man who saw me fall helped me up, put my scratched up bike on the back of his trunk and drove me one block down to my house. My mother thanked him and off he went. I walked into the house holding my left arm up in pain and crying. My father saw me crying and holding my arm and chased me into my room. I remember hiding in the corner of the bottom bunk bed trying to get away from him as he swung full force over and over again hitting me as hard as he could, wherever he could. Including what we later found out was a broken wrist. My older brother stepped in front of me as I was getting beat, taking half of the punches and that’s how he eventually stopped. 

As a child I innocently thought that all dads were mean. I thought everyone’s dad was mean and had a short temper. I remember knocking on my friends door to see if she could come play and her father opening up the front door. I would freeze every time, afraid to ask him if she was home. 

Needless to say, it was heartbreaking to get older and realize that many people had amazing, loving father figures in their lives. I was so jealous and even now as an adult get very jealous (in the best way) at anyone who has a good relationship with their dad. 

I feel I am incomplete. There’s a huge part of me that’s broken. And I can’t change it. My father made me feel weak, broken and turned me into an anxious person. I try my best. I do what I can to be a happy person and I try to be a good person to everyone around me. There’s damage there and sometimes I feel like it’ll forever be who I am...

If you have a good father, love him double as hard for me."
342,Tired of this life,"Nothing feels fulfilling. I don't have substantial hobbies. I am in a long term relationship that I am happy in, 4 pups and I have a handful of close friends. I have a ft job. But I just feel withdrawn and not right? I don't know how to explain it? I've been rereading fantasy and sci-fi novels and I always feel disconnected from real like after, like I get so involved in the reading I truly wish I were there. I stopped reading them bc it's made real life dull but I still have this unsatisfactory feeling deep in my heart and mind, like I really don't belong here. I don't have suicidal tendencies though I have few and far between suicidal thoughts. Jfc I sound so dumb. Can anyone relate? How do you cope?"
343,My father.,"I remember being young and always being scared at home. Hell of a feeling... constant fear. Especially as a child. My father was 1 of 11 kids. He grew up in poverty met my mother when they were young and they dated long distance before agreeing to marry. 

My mother didn’t know him fully. She thought he was the man of her dreams because a long distance relationship left room for only her imagination. In her imagination, all was well. Until well, it wasn’t. 

I was only a little girl, upset about something silly as kids often are. I had begged my mother to make me my favorite lasaña for a few days. She worked hard on it just for me and happily placed it in front of me. And me being upset about whatever it was, was whimpering a bit at the dinner table. My father upset at me for crying. Threw my dinner plate in my face, picked up his cup of orange juice and also threw it in my face. I got up, silent as I could, dirty and drenched in orange juice and walked to the bathroom to clean up. I don’t remember eating lasaña that night. 

I remember running around the house once, as kids do. I was chasing my older brother (I have 2). We were being kids and playing. My father was taking a nap in the living room and we accidentally woke him up. The next thing I knew I had a metal picture frame flying at my face. I had a black eye for a little bit after that. I remember my mother coming into my room after the incident and with tears in her eyes putting ointment on my swollen half-open eye. Apologizing over and over. 

In the 3rd grade one of my classmates and friends invited me to her birthday party. I wanted to go so so bad. I picked out my favorite doll and I proudly showed it to my mom saying I had a gift for the birthday girl and I was ready to go. My father didn’t think I should go. I was really upset and I was crying sitting on my parents tall king size bed. Again, my father upset at my for crying, shoved me off of the bed and I fell hitting my head on the wall. My mother ended up convincing my father to let me go and I showed up late to the party. I missed the happy birthday song and the cake cutting of the cake. But I entered the park proud and with puffy eyes handed my favorite doll over to the birthday girl. She was happy. 

In the 5th grade, my parents bought me a cheap little purple bike from Walmart. I was so excited. I remember riding it around the neighborhood with a grin on my face. One day, I was riding it to my cousins house down the block and I lost control and flipped over a rock and fell on the road. I remember excruciating pain coming from my arm. A nice neighborhood man who saw me fall helped me up, put my scratched up bike on the back of his trunk and drove me one block down to my house. My mother thanked him and off he went. I walked into the house holding my left arm up in pain and crying. My father saw me crying and holding my arm and chased me into my room. I remember hiding in the corner of the bottom bunk bed trying to get away from him as he swung full force over and over again hitting me as hard as he could, wherever he could.

344,Something to think about,Have you ever just felt like punching a hole in a wall. Taking candy from a baby. Just ruining something. Screaming. Yelling. Like the weight of all your burdens is too much. I feel like this a lot but one thing to think about.... breathe.
345,How do i stop crying when I'm aruging with someone?,I find it annoying that I cry whenever I argue loudly because I bottle up my emotions and thoughts and I just want to release them without crying
346,I don’t know whats wrong with me,"I was talking to my mom and she kept saying that I have a hard time making friendships which I know is true but it hurts. Part if it is me being stubborn as a bull to certain people if to me they don’t “fit my criteria” and idk why I do that. part if it is out of protection for myself so I don’t get hurt and the other part well. i really don’t know because I’ve been like this aince I was a toddler, I was mean to other kids and had a superiority complex which I might still have and really do t wanna have. I wanna be normal. I wanna be feee but I feel so restricted with what i do to myself."
347,I Can't Make it Stop,"I have pretty severe PTSD and general anxiety, largely stemming from a violent assault and traumatic brain injury I suffered 5 years ago, so panic attacks are absolutely nothing new to me; I generally have them 4-5 times a week, usually at night. In the past, I've had numerous panic attacks that were severe enough to trigger loss of consciousness, usually due to hyperventilation. 

But something has been different lately. The severity and veracity of my panic attacks has sharply, radically increased, as has my general sense of dread. Idk if it's related to the current global crises or the political tensions or whatever, or if it's something more personal, but it's been *bad.* 

I've had to call 911 twice this week. I had never called 911 for a panic attack before. The first time, I was driving alone on the freeway when a massive panic attack just suddenly hit me for no apparent reason and I very nearly passed out, had to swerve onto the shoulder and called an ambulance because I didn't know wtf was happening (and because I was also hit with a sudden bolt of pain in my head, and have that TBI, I wanted to make sure that there was nothing neurological going on). At the ER, everything was pretty much normal and they just chalked it up to a panic attack. But I didn't know how to explain that it's never been quite like *that* before. And it happened again this morning -- I had a panic attack at home with my mom and it rolled out of control so abruptly that she called 911. But once again, I was medically cleared.

I *have* had panic attacks while driving in the past, and I've also lost control of my breathing to the point of syncope before; I once had a panic attack in a public restroom and hyperventilated so severely that I just huddled into the corner of a stall and collapsed, regaining consciousness almost 20 minutes later to find the campus police yelling at me (they assumed I was drunk). So it's been bad before. But bad enough to warrant calling 911? So bad that I legitimately believe I'm about to have a fucking seizure? Definitely not. 

And idk how to make it stop. My typical anxiety meds (gabapentin, Klonopin, duloxetine) have been rendered useless. My typical breathing, grounding, and stress exercises have abruptly stopped working. I feel like I'm dying all the time. I'm terrified of everything. I get so scared at night because I feel like I'm being hunted again and something awful is going to happen and I can't sleep because no matter how many locks I put on the door, no matter how many weapons I have, no matter how *realistically* secure I am I still just don't feel safe. Getting through those awful hours between sunset and sunrise has become increasingly painful. I feel like I'm just bearing down against the clock and anxiously waiting for morning to come. My general resting BP has risen from 100 to nearly 140. I can't get myself to settle down.

I don't know why this has suddenly gotten so much worse and I don't know what to do about it. I saw my doctor yesterday but all she did was increase my antidepressant. The only thing I can think to do is to just lean into the fear rather than fighting against it, remind myself that I am physically, medically fine, and be comforted by the knowledge that if I do lose consciousness, that might actually be a blessing -- at least then I can relax and get some sleep. And that's helped. But it doesn't help enough to fix the problem.

Please help me. I don't know how. I don't know why. But I'm so scared and I just can't make it stop."
348,Comfort Zone Advice -Needed,"Is it okay to go back into the comfort zone after taking some risks. I recently got out of my comfort zone by joining a club I was interested in just to see how it was, but after the first meeting, I realized the club wasn’t for me, and that I wasn’t interested at all. The thing is, during the club we already assigned teams so I had to join a team, instead of it just being a club where they welcome new members and dont start anything until they cut the club down to the people serious about being in the club. The reason I already don’t like it is because the club is something where you’re spending so much time for it. The club’s priorities doesn’t match up with mine and I thought it was going to be something where they teach you how to do stuff but instead they’re making you dive right into the topic of the club. I don’t connect with my team as well, as I do feel incompetent at times. In my team for the club, when they talk about the topics of the club, I am not interested and I just feel like I’m there. I’m glad I got out of my comfort zone and getting out of your comfort zone is cool sometimes, but this has kind of taken a toll on my mental health. I can’t stop thinking about it, and have considered quitting the club because I would feel much happier. The thing that’s holding me back is that I don’t want to let my team members down and I don’t know if my parents will allow me to quit. I was honestly thinking about sticking it out for a few more weeks and if it’s still taking a toll, then just tell my parents how I feel about quitting the club. Any advice for someone like me in high school?"
349,I am losing my sanity and I can't stop thinking that I don't belong in this world anymore,I literally just can't anymore with everything. I tried my best but that was never enough and every single thing I did always turned to failure. No matter how hard I try I can never seem to do anything right. I feel so worthless and just want to end all the pain and suffering from my life. It's funny to me now that I ever thought I would accomplish anything substantial or meaningful. All my life has been constant failure and being yelled and cursed at for being useless and I can't take it anymore. My mother never loved me and my father left when I was 4. My mother and brother used to beat me when I was younger and my sisters only watched without helping in any way. I never had a place I could truly call home but I think that would have helped ease everything. I always dreamed of having a place where I could relax and be happy but it was after all only a dream that never came true. I've never heard anyone tell me they love me and that is something I don't think I'll ever hear no matter what happens. I am a broken man just barely managing to retain whatever sanity I still have left. I don't want to have to live like a husk of a person who has been broken by a lifetime of abuse. I just want to quite everything but I'm scared. I'm scared of losing myself and whatever I still managed to obtain dispite all this. I'm scared of what lies beyond death. I'm scared of never being loved by anyone. I'm scared of being forgoten as a meaningless thing that never existed.
350,Anyone else experience this at all?,"Ok before I start, am completely normal and suffer no illness or mental illness at all. 22/M 

To start off, has anyone ever had a lack of urgency, like in situations were person may be shouting for help, screaming or in pain etc etc, but you just don't feel the need to investigate or help, but you feel sorta forced, and its obviously the right thing to do and such. Like I've had that with friends and family, and they have mentioned it, but it's not like I mean it or anything??, can anyone help me explain this?"

3. What steps are you taking to cope with, or to move through, those feelings?"
354,My brother angrily interrupted me because his rent money or whatever glitched and I thought the entire situation was pathetic.,"Funny how I told him to leave me alone. Then he threatened to break my partition walls (long story, basically my room) and claimed because he knew the guy who gave them to me... he gave them to him or some BS and I know that doesn’t actually mean anything.

WTF. I’ve been avoiding him for obvious reasons. What should I say if he threatens me or does any BS again?"
355,I enjoy hurting others and I need help,"Today, my mind went into a very dark place, mindset i haven't been in for a minute. and i realized my way of thinking when i'm upset isn't fucking ok. I think of all the people that left me. all the people that i hurt. i regret it so much. i ruined their lives. hurt them emotionally to the point to where they're scared of me. they don't even use social media anymore. and i enjoyed every second of it. I liked it more when i convinced them it was their fault i acted the way i did. when i'm upset, i'm basically a sociopath.

 I don't know why i'm writing this. i guess i just feel super guilty. i need to confess, i want really want this horrible side of me to be gone forever. i'm delusional to think my answer to someone leaving me is to hurt myself, hurt others emotionally and be a fucking vindictive piece of shit. I really want to apologize for the things and ways i've hurt people but i have a really hard time dealing with the fact i'm wrong, and they probably won't forgive me anyway. i just want help. bc i feel like i'm going to place of no return. i don't know where to find it. i'm really afraid of admitting this. bc i'm a fucking monster"
356,"For the past 3 days, I've done all my homework to my best ability, and this makes me feel great!","For some time I was struggling to do anything with my day. However, for the last 3 days I have been taking care of myself, I cleaned my room, washed my clothes, and did all my homework! I know this seems small and most likely it probably is, but it still makes me happy and proud! I don't know how long this motivation will continue, but while I have it I will continue to take steps to improve my life!"
357,I’m scared of fully losing my mind.,"The more I deal with these intrusive thoughts, the more I feel like I’m just getting closer to letting this intrusive delusional side fully taking over. The best way to explain it is I feel like there’s multiple brains or people in my head but I’m struggling to hold onto my original self. I don’t hear voices or black out or anything. But when I often think back on different memories, especially ones where I’m having a manic episode...I don’t feel like that person is me. Everytime that happens and I realized what I said or did I feel so full of guilt, shame, embarrassment, and anger. The cycle just goes on and on. These drs are just having me go from medication to medication. I don’t want to lose this fight. I just want to know what I need to get rid of these ugly thoughts and the overwhelming emotions that come with them."
358,I'm scared and getting suicidal - I feel separated from everything - depressed and anxious - don't see the point in this life. Need some hope.,"I feel like I've lost my personality - I used to be known for being intelligent and funny and now I'm anxious I feel like my brain is fogged and I don't remember the last time I had a real laugh.  


Disturbingly when I talk to people I feel overly conscious of every single detail of the person I speak to - I feel really disconnected and anxious and I find myself almost unable to listen because I feel so aware and conscious. I feel really uncomfortable in myself and I don't really know what to do about it.  


I have the odd moments where I feel present and like I'm part of the play of life but mostly I feel disturbingly separate and it makes me wanna cry n honestly I keep getting thoughts of ending it (I won't cause of family) but I feel like I'm broken.   


I hate how self centred it's making me too. I don't enjoy spending time with people because of where I'm at but I'm scarily lonely too. Anyone been in a similar place and got out?  


I feel like I've thought myself into a corner and this is my life now. :("
359,Im lonely and sad,"I (18F) have been stuck at home with my religious parents for almost a year now. I was preparing for my exams at home for five months before the pandemic began. I dont have any siblings at home with me (they're all married). I don't have any friends so they dont even let me go out unless I have work to do. My dad drops me even if I do go out. 
I frequently feel sad and hopeless. I don't have the freedom to go out, meet people and make new friends. My parents' social life sucks.... All they do is pray at home and stuff. I left Islam a month or two ago and am now a closeted exMuslim. They make me pray and read the Quran in front of them. Im sick and tired of all this. They're too traditional and think that Im just a complaining brat so I stopped talking about my mental health, insecurities and lack of friends in front of them. 
I gave all my uni entrance exams in September (after a lot of delay) and thought that Id be able to relax after that. But now Im just depressed. 
I just wanna go out, enjoy, learn how to drive and stuff but I can't (and its not even because of the pandemic)"
360,“Zoning out”?,"Over the last 6-8 months I’ve been having these sort of episodes. The best way I can describe it is like “zoning out” but on a whole different level. It feels somewhat like I’m in a brand new place but experiencing deja vu, even when I’m somewhere very familiar like my own home. Visually, lines are kind of blurred but colors are very vibrant. I can see the things around me, but they don’t feel like the things I know them to be if that makes any sense. Physically, I feel slightly floaty. Mentally and emotionally, well, not much in that department during these episodes. They vary in length from a couple minutes to around an hour, but I’m not really aware of how long it’s been going on while it’s happening. For context purposes, I’ve noticed a spike in depression, stress, and anxiety/panic attacks that seems to coincide with the spike in these episodes. Any info on what this might be or if I should be concerned would be greatly appreciated."

I have watched alot of informative videos about the disorder itself so I say im well informed on the topic. I just never actually went to go get diagnosed, mainly because of my mother. But now as an adult I probably could go but im reluctant. So to any one who suffers with a mental illness, is it worth it? Is it worth it for me to bother at all? My boyfriend helps me though most of my episodes so I don't know if there's anything really to be done."

365,"Every time my mum does something wrong, she makes me feel guilty for being upset by talking about all the good things she does","Every single time my mum hurts me or does something wrong that upsets me, she makes me feel guilty when I get upset and bring it up with her. She will always, without fail, bring up all the good things she's done for me in an attempt to make me feel bad for calling her out on the bad stuff she's done. I can hear her crying right now and saying to my dad that I 'expect her to be the perfect mother' and that she 'does everything' for me. It drives me crazy because it makes it impossible for my mum to ever admit fault because in her eyes the good stuff she does for me counteracts any bad thing she does. I just don't know what to do but it's killing me because it makes me feel like I'm going crazy - it makes me doubt myself entirely. 'Did she really hurt me bad?', 'wow, she does do so much stuff. I'm horrible for being upset', etc. This is a vent but I just need some support and advice or reassurance or something. Thanks so much."
366,"true story- bipolar1, bank robbery attempt and hope!","I have bipolar type 1 and it comes with severe manic episodes and monthly SSDI checks. All jokes aside, it's inspiring, creative and extremely debilitating. I have been in and out of jails and hospitals and have dodged 2 mandatory prison sentences because of my psychotic behavior and treatment records. Last May, I caught a attempted bank robbery felony charge that I am now on probation for in the lovely state of Colorado. I walked in to a bank (drove to it) and slid a note that said ""listen to my new song! or give me the money"" .. this sounds like a prank? no, far from it. problem is I didn't perceive a consequence because I was in such a delusional/psychosis state. The days leading up to it I had been working 2 jobs (first red flag) one over night driving mail trucks and one in the day delivering pizza. For me, bipolar1 is great! (most of the time at least). like when I am stable I still have all my energy, drive and ambition without delusional thinking or lack of logical thinking. I can sleep a bit less and just be super productive every day. I found that sticking to a routine of very productive things daily helps me dramatically. on a daily basis, I stick to my iMac calendar which has reminders written, examples- dispute things on credit report with creditkarma, record that song u wrote last night, buy more coffee for home, shower! lol u get the point. finding a reason to get up and moving and staying organized have helped me the past year. I am on probation for a 2nd degree burglary and not the bank incident. ahhhhh this a long story so i made a youtube video, comment if u wanna know more! thx for reading this far."
367,Do I have signs dissociative identity disorder?,"In my life I know I have had traumatic experiences such as childhood sexualization, rape by my first friend when I was a kid, and so on. Possibly other things too because I have several scars on my face and I don't recall where I got them from.

However there were several times growing up where I would all of a sudden not feel like I was there. Like I was somewhere in the back of my head while someone else was talking for me. The first time I even considered I might have it is when I watched a documentary on it and it was the only thing that made sense. To top it off, my 9th grade teacher who minored in psychology did this thing where she put her hand on my shoulder and said my name and I would immediately come back from a dissociative state of mind. She used me as an example in front of 14 year olds to show what actual PTSD and trauma looks like.

But even then I didn't want to believe it. When I was a teenager I would often talk and switch the way I was speaking because I liked the dramatic edginess yet a lot of students thought I had DID because of the documentary we watched in school. Still not believing it, there were a lot of times that I did actually feel like I was in the back of my head and I would look down and rapidly argue with myself or several people or something in my head. Like an inhuman level rapidity that I can't even do normally unless specific stressors happen. When those times happened my memory always went very vague like someone was stuffing me in the back to keep me from believing something.

I've heard people talk about me when they think I can't hear them as well. It's always been the same paranoid uneducated talk about ""he's a psychopath, no he's schizophrenic, no he has Dissociative Identities."" I say uneducated because of the infinite misconceptions about mental health in the US is horrible.

Now the weirdest things that have happened in regards to dissociating and arguing with whatever I was arguing with in my head are these two examples. I was sitting at a table by myself and then two latino students sat down and were like ""leave, the Mexicans are taking over."" I didn't leave because I'm stubborn. So eventually it turned into me testing one of them to see if they are racist against whites. I really don't know how or why it went down that path but it was almost like I kept switching between different personalities when they triggered certain emotions. I pulled the racism out of one of my latino peers who said ""see, all whites need to die."" And in that moment it was like I switched into someone else and I was looking at him like ""really, bro? I knew it, the rumors ARE true."" Then they were speaking to each other in Spanish and I could understand them and I was getting freaked out. Then they were getting freaked out because I actually did understand what they were speaking in Spanish. Then I remember a voice coming out saying something really racist, then me trying to silence that voice because I had no idea where it came from. Then I tried telling them that I didn't say that. One of the other students said ""why did you say it then?"" And as soon as he said that, this angry, hateful voice took over and full on yelled at him saying ""IT WASN'T HIM IT WAS ME!"" Then a few moments later they were gone from the table and I came back down after a voice told me I have to come down or people will think I'm crazy. But I knew what happened, happened because they were talking about it later.

The second time was in Spanish class where my teacher, whom was from England, was talking to the latino students about the Mexican populated city next to ours. She basically thought she could go anywhere because in Europe that's how it is. But not in Pasco where if you're white and you go down the wrong street you'll get beat to shit and at worst, you'll ""disappear."" She had no concept of the deep seeded racism that has scarred a lot of Mexican populations in the country from trusting whites. So she said something really ignorant about how the Spanish and the Portuguese didn't rape or pillage anyone when they landed in the Americas. She legit thought it was all happy dandy everyone got along. In that moment it was like I switched over into someone else, stood up, interrupted all of them and assertively said ""rape is a biproduct of war and conquest, that if you really want to know there is an English major right down that hall that can tell you about the raping and pillaging written throughout white history."" Then I proceeded to explain how narcissistic abuse is the same concept as dehumanization between the ""favorite"" or the ""light skin"" people and how the darker skinned people got more screwed over in society back then, and even today. Then I heard one of the students say ""whoa, he's woke as fuck"" and immediately again it was like I switched into someone else who was more of a joker and I almost called him the N word and right as I said ""Ni"" it was like I was coming back and I started arguing rapidly with myself like I mentioned earlier. But I told this voice to ""fuck off, get back in your corner, you are NOT saying that to him."" But in that moment I recall hearing some students around me saying ""oh my God he actually does.""

Later on in my adult life a couple years ago, I woke up one morning with 18-24 cuts all over my left forearm and my phone in my right hand with a picture of my arm cut up and bleeding. But it was like the documentary we watched in 9th grade where this woman would wake up with cuts on her arms because she has an alter that hates her and wants her dead.

Aside from those moments, I feel like I talk to myself in ways that most people don't. To me I hear people in my head like they are different parts of me that are fragmented into other people. I've talked to them, and sometimes they talk to each other but it's normal to me. It sounds crazy and hallucinogenic to other people but it is what it is to me.

I've had a therapist that suggested I might have dissociative identities because every time I came in to see her it was like I was a different person with different ways of thinking. She said she even saw me switch a few times. But she couldn't diagnose me because she didn't have the legal qualifications to diagnose, but only to be a therapist. Actually a bunch of people have said they've seen me switch between different people and voices. The creepiest one is one person at my previous job told me I asked him in a childish voice if I was gay and after he realized I was being serious I changed into a different voice that grew deep and said ""you're weak."" 

I only think about all of this recently and can say I might have dissociative identities with more confidence because I was watching a YouTube video from SBSK. The woman he was interviewing described her experiences with dissociative identities and I couldn't help but resonate with her. The devil on my shoulder, the internal conversations, the ""putting someone in their corner,"" the struggle to keep myself from letting other people take over, the hand on shoulder wake up from being in a dissociative state of mind, etc. It all makes too much sense to be anything else.

So what are your thoughts?"
368,I don’t know how/what to feel,"Idk if it’s a common thing, but I grew up best friends with the children of my parents friend group. I grew particularly close with one friend, I’ll call him Dave, and his parents became second set of mine and vice versa. They’ve helped raise me for the past 19 years of my life. Today the doctor’s told us that my second mother has cancer. Dave was staying at my place when he got the call and didn’t take it too well at first as one would expect. But what I feel uneasy about is that I didn’t react, I didn’t feel sad or shook. I didn’t feel at all. It’s been hours and I still don’t feel any differently. She’s like my mother I don’t know why I don’t have a reaction. It’s not like she’s dead so I have no real reason to grieve, but at the same time I don’t think it’s healthy to not respond at all. It’s not necessary a lack of emotion, but indifference to the situation.  What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to react? And why aren’t I feeling any of those things?"
369,Mental health &amp; My Why,[removed]
370,How to be happy,"Something that I have been thinking a lot about is what factors lead a person to be happy. While laying in bed tonight I feel like I may have found the answer. It really comes down to 2 things. 

The first and probably most obvious is that you need to feel that you are apart of a community. It doesn’t matter if it is your friends, coworkers, or your family, what matters is that you enjoy spending time around these people and feel comfortable being yourself. 

The second part is that you need to be working toward something that you are passionate about. That may sound simple but you need to be very careful about what it is that you are working toward. The mistake people make is that they spend their time doing something that they don’t enjoy. They are miserable but push through the pain because they imagine their future self so much happier due to the sacrifices you are making now. What people don’t understand is that there is no future moment when you reach success. Life is not a novel where you ride off into the sunset happily ever after. After these novels end the character’s life just continues on and new problems arise. You don’t just live in eternal bliss once you reach all your goals. Because of this, all that really matters is that you enjoy working hard on whatever it is that you choose to spend your time doing.

This isn’t a topic that I openly talk about so if you read this far please let me know if this makes sense or if I’m crazy. I’m curious. Lmao"
371,Parents keep fighting...,[removed]
372,I've started resenting my depressed friend,"This is mostly just a post to vent, and to hear other opinions.

I have a friend I made in uni who is chronically depressed, and has been going off and on the illness since she was 13 (I believe). She was doing better in March, but then quarantine came and she broke up with her (very controlling) boyfriend and spent all summer in her village, where she doesn't have any friends and did nothing. We both knew this would be bad for her and that she would probably fall into depression again. I tried to tell her to try and do anything, whatever, but she just insisted there was nothing to do or said that she didn't feel like doing anything. Her village is next to a city mostly habited by students to leave during summer, so she had some hope that when uni started her social life would lighten up. Rn she only has two friends, me and another common girl in our class.  

But, being so insecure and negative, as soon as she tried to meet people and it didn't work out she lost all hope. Now she doesn't have any energy or motivation to do literally anything. She can't do things that would distract her or make her have a good time like watching a movie or chilling with friends because all she can think about is how bad her situation is.

Objectively speaking, her situation is bad, specially when you compare it to the situation of most uni students. She can't pay to rent a house to live independently the city, so she has to live with their parents: both exhausted workers that expend most of their free time watching TV, complaining about life, and taking pills to deal with it. My friend is scared she is seeing her future self in them. She can't pay to go to therapy, and public therapy just sucks (she has tried it and detests the therapist in her area, who would only see her once every three months). I try to tell her that maybe she should try find a part time job to pay for that, and she says she doesn't want to work. It is true that it is more difficult for her than for me or other classmates, who could just pay for it without having to a work. But as much as I hate this system, things work that way and she needs to adapt. 

She told me that it is hard enough for her to study for uni so she doesn't want to also have to work. I told her that then maybe she should stop uni and focus on working and improving her mental health. She doesn't want to, she says that she doesn't even know why is she studying our career when she doesn't want to be a teacher and she doesn't want to work at all in the future. She will go to a psychiatrist who will give her some pills that will dumb her and make her gain weight and feel worst about herself (in her words). 

That's her situation. On my part, I am starting to feel uncomfortable when I am with her. When we go out in group with other people she interrupts me, answers questions that are addressed at me, and make comments and jokes on my ideas that make me feel disregarded. We have a common social circle, we see each other at uni two days a week (and eat there together with other people) and we frequently go out, but I am starting to feel annoyed by her presence. Her behaviour makes it feel like we are in a competition, and I don't like feeling like this with a friend. I know it is an expression of her insecurities, but I shouldn't stand that behaviour no matter its root.

I can't tell her anything about my life, because she will always compare to it. If I tell her about x friend, she will just say that she doesn't have any other friends. If I tell her I feel a bit awkward about turning down some old bud who want's to meet with me, she says ""this happens to you because you are good and people want to see you, not like in my case"". She just turns everything about herself. She is always talking about how I have some many friends, and I am intelligent and appreciated. But it is not admiration, it's envy. She thinks I have everything she doesn't have. I understand, I have felt that way towards friends. But she makes it so obvious, so present. I can tell every time we speak. How can I be friends with someone who is resenting me for what I have and what I am, who is comparing herself to me every time I share anything about my life?

She has been behaving like this for months, and I am becoming more and more resentful of her. Yesterday I was going to the house of a girl from uni that I am getting to know, and my friend told me she wanted to go out because she didn't stand being in her house another day. At the end my bud cancelled so I met with my friend. When I told her that I was going to meet this girl, she looked at me and I knew what she was thinking. The worst part is that even before talking to my friend I felt bad about meeting with this other girl and not inviting her. But I don't think I should feel bad about meeting whoever if I feel like it.

She thinks that all my friends and good attributes came from the sky because I am good, no matter how much I explain to her that I have been in a similar situation, with almost no friends, feeling like shit about myself, and doing nothing because of my insecurities. But I never put it up on my friends who I admired. It took me a lot of time to slowly make the good friends I have now, to reach the good social situation I am finally experimenting, to feel confident about myself because of how much I have studied and invested in the things I care about (and to accept my shortcomings), etc. It has taken me so many years and deceptions and tries to get to this point. It took me to be honest with myself, to analyze the vicious circle of insecurities and self victimization that I was trapped in, and to slowly take action to get out of there. It was a slow and hard process.

My best friend when I was 13-15 had mental health problems. My best friend when I was 17 had whatever personality disorder and used me, until I realized it. My exboyfriend that I dated a year ago has them. One of my best friends during the last 4 years, that I cut off, had them. And I am tired of this pattern. I am tired of always being there for people who don't treat me well enough, who absorb my time and energies, who have deepen my insecurities that I work so hard against, just because they have a mental illness. I know it has been my responsibility for not putting boundaries. I am done of just being there and taking shit from them because I am the one who is in a better place.

I want to be supportive. I want to invite her out so she doesn't feel alone, I want to listen to her when she is not feeling well. But it is becoming really hard, because her attitude makes me despise her. Because I am feeling bad about enjoying the things I have always wanted to enjoy (like meeting new friends) and not including her, but including her makes me not enjoy them most times, and that makes me resent her even more. I am confused as to where is the line between me being selfish and not understanding of her mental health issues and me being protective of my well being."
373,Med side effects,"So when I was 14 i started taking meds(antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzos, sleeping pills, and some others) I'm almost 18 now and i feel way better taking them. When I was on them I felt more depressed, more anxious, I had worse mood swings, and was psychotic. But now that I'm off them and I don't feel nearly as bad. Plus may meds made it harder to like talk and think. When I was on them I couldn't even have a conversation. And then I started mixing them with drugs and thy both made each other way stronger. So I kinda just wasted a year not talking to anyone and now it just feels weird to like talk to people. I don't know if I should go back on meds but I don't really know what to do"
374,Is it normal that I still feel depressed over something my boyfriend did years ago?,"Back when I was 16yrs old my boyfriend,also 16,pressured me to have sex with him even though I begged him not to do it.I remember crying and having anxiety attacks because I didn't want to lose my virginity til I was at least 18.He ended up pressuring me,telling me that it will make our relationship better,that it will make his anxiety go away wich he struggled with immensely at the time.I felt like my world was crashing down and after days of saying no to him, under all that pressure I agreed to do it .After a few weeks of me denying all the regret I broke down mentally.I told him that I regretted everything and he broke down and expressed that he is sorry and that it was a mistake after all.For a long while after that I have struggled with anger outbursts, anxiety, suicidal thoughts.It went so far that I ended up in a mental health hospital for that but for other things in my life at the time.I still feel horrible,not as bad as before but I have periods when it hurts just as bad.And the worst thing is that since then I can't help but get so angry at him over stupid meaningless things,I yell at him,make him feel horrible and I just lash out at him for no reason sometimes.I feel so frustrated sometimes and say things I don't mean just to hurt him.I feel like the abuser and it just makes all this that much harder.We managed to pull trough and stay together for years now but what happened is constantly on my mind and it makes the whole relationship so hard even though we love each other dearly.We had many conversations about it and he tried desperately to make up for it ever since but nothing seems to help.All this feels like it was rape,but I did give him consent even if it was forced.It confuses me so much because I don't know what to call this or if I have the right to feel hurt like this years later.It makes me feel like a bad person thinking that he is bad for doing this when he was just 16 and mentally ill at the time.He is more mature now,we both are but I can't seem to stop hurting."
375,Any tips on maintaining a routine of positive activities while depressed?,"I mean like things that are proven to help, like going into nature, exercising, meditating. I feel like if I do these things some of my symptoms will be relieved and might even essentially cure my depression.  So any help on how to get yourself to do these things consistently? Some days I cant even get myself to do anything, I dont even want to consume media i just sit there doing nothing."

Or are mental health services really this difficult to access?"

379,Breaking up with my girlfriend..,"I thought I could bear her suffering on my back, but over the months I began feeling more and more numb. She has schizophrenia among many other issues with self esteem and trauma. I basically ""saved her life"" (her words) when we fell in love.. She looks up to me so much and it just sucks that I can't feel empathy for her anymore because I'm fucking drained beyond belief.  I can't even take care of myself anymore, had a massive self harm episode last week because of it... (60+ cuts) I had kind of the same feeling at the end of my ex's relationship with me (it was really toxic). The worst part about it all is that she just entered depression again and here I am, making everything 100x worse... I told her that I won't abandon her, that I'll still help her get better... Is it the right choice?"
380,I need help,"

! DISCLAIMER: mentions suicide !


I’ll try to keep this short. So the past few years I’ve struggled. My home situation was never that good. Yes, I had a roof over my head and a both my parents but their demeanor towards me was never good. 

My issues mainly started when I was 8. I was a big kid and losing weight was what I obsessed over at the time. During this time I was a fairly smart kid so getting a bad grade was what pushed my parents over the edge. They started keeping me from school to study. This my first time thinking about suicide. Just the circumstances I couldn’t take it. 

Later on I was bullied for being stick skinny and also bullied by my principal. My experiences with that particular principal still gets me emotional til this day. I was sent to therapy but I feel they did more damage than good. At 12, I became suicidal again. This time I thought it was the end. I was almost about to end it but something stopped me. 

Fast forward home life was not getting any better. I got a boyfriend my second year of HighSchool and everything was going well. I saw him as the light. Everything could be wrong but at least I had someone.  Then during my junior year in crashed. Failed my Honor Anatomy and Physiology class. This made my parents furious. I wasn’t able to see my boyfriend or go outside at all. I found myself going back to my old ways. At that point I really thought it was the end. But I realized I had so much to live for. I keep saying “this is it” but I got through it. I imagine all the people I wouldn’t of met or the experiences I wouldn’t have had. 

Now I’m 18, still having family problems but nothing I can’t handle. I aspire to become a Child Life Psychologist or a Medical Lawyer. Even til this day I get flashbacks (idk if you would call it PTSD) oh those times when I was 8, 12, and 17. I’m in the process of healing and I just want to accept myself. In order to fully heal I think I need professional help. Last time I mentioned getting help, my mom threatened to put me in a mental institution. 






QUESTION: As a minor (17f), How can I seek help for my mental health with no fees, or parents involved? I understand nothing is “free” but is there anyone I can talk to or contact. (btw I am from the US)"

384,Is it normal to not care if a family member/s die?,"My uncle and my aunt died of corona just few days ago but i don't know why but i just don't care, I also go to a therapist about stuff going on my life. I am also mildy autistic. I actually got excited when i heard they died, i was shocked but also happy. Rn i feel weird that i feel this way because most of my family memebers cried. Should I be worried? I am also very shy have social problems."
385,I need help,I’m so messed up in the head at the moment. There’s so much going on in my head I can’t type it all down but I really need help my thoughts are just getting worse and worse and are soon going to ruin my life. I really need professional help or something because I can’t do this on my own and talking to friends isn’t good enough. I can’t ask to go see someone because I’m still so young and my parents are VERY strict they’ll just think I’m overreacting but I am so close to doing bad things to myself I don’t know what to do I just really want help. Please help me someone.
386,Past Relationships have caused me to have extreme trust issues,"tl;dr my past relationships have resulted me in not fully trusting future partners

I’ve had the misfortune of having gone through four breakups with the breakups resulting in a lack of communication from my significant other, and partially my own.. I’m not that hurt from the breakups itself but more from how my significant others had always kept to themselves about how they truly felt which made me feel like I had been living a lie whenever they said they loved me.. And now recently I’ve been talking to a girl that I felt really clicked with what I wanted, but what do you know next thing she’s out posting a story about her new man while she kept telling me she wasn’t ready for a relationship yet.. God like can I ever catch a break and find someone that’s just honest with me. Now I feel like I can’t trust any girl at this rate, they all seem so dishonest.. I hate to think like this so I was wondering if there’s any tips out there you guys could give.."
387,I’m scared to try to sleep again,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub. Delete this post if I’m wrong mods. I didn’t know where else to say this or who to at this time of night my very few friends are asleep. 

TW: drugs, sleep paralysis (I think???) anxiety, sexual assault. idk I just don’t want to make anyone unhappy

Im in a hotel with my dad right now. I’m going to rehab tomorrow morning. No idea what time. They’re just gonna call after 9am. Last minute thing.

I’ve done Intensive Outpatient (IOP) twice this year and been to this same inpatient facility for a weekend cause fuck insurance. If I’m not constantly having seizures or overdosing or literally dying I’m not enough of an addict to get help I guess. Different insurance now. I’m scared. Between now and last time it’s gotten so much worse with frequency, quantity, and escalation of types of drugs (weed to alcohol to Xanax to meth now j think I’m addicted to coke too)

I just tried to go to sleep. Had the most real dream. I put on some mac miller before I went to sleep cause that’s the mood rn. Slept through about 6 songs. Starting with Come Back to Earth if anyone’s interested. The dream was the kind where you can physically feel things. My [youngest sibling] year old sister was here. I just lived with her for the last 2 months and my mom and my [older than sister] younger brother. I’ve lived with my dad mostly my whole life. I dont care if this gives away my throwaway account I’ll delete it or something. I just needed this out of my head before I try sleeping again. When I left the house earlier irl I told her I was going on a trip and have her a hug and told her I loved her. Same with my brother. He’s autistic and he usually doesn’t like being touched and stuff but I asked and he gave me a hug. And said he loved me too. I told him I’ve loved every moment of the last two months I’ve gotten to spend with him. God I love him. He’s such a jerk sometimes it’s hilarious. It breaks my heart I spent so much time doing drugs and not seeing my siblings. I’m a shitty older brother. But they love me they were always asking my mom about me. Sorry this post is gonna be all over the place I’m freaked. In the dream my sister took me into the bathroom of the hotel room for some reason. I don’t remember what she said but she was happy and smiling. I was scared cause she shouldn’t be here and see me feeling like this and going through withdrawals and sneaking into the bathroom at 3am just to silently cover my finger in coke and shove it up my nose and rub it around before bed. And hide the bag. I know that sounds gross but I think other addicts might understand. That part was real life before bed. Then the bathroom with my sister was dream. Then the bathroom light in the dream suddenly turned off. She stopped talking but j knew she was there. I slowly ran my fingers across the wall for the light switch. Found it. Walked back to bed. Got in bed. Now it’s real life again. I think. Probably not. Inbetween.  I’m scared. I can’t move my body. Except my fingers. My whole body feels paralyzed. I can’t open my eyes. I can just barely barely barely mutter out “Dad...” he’s asleep I’m unable to talk loud enough. But I feel a hand grab my fingers. Dream/hallucination I guess. I try again to call for him but I can’t get any words out of my mouth. I can’t move. I need to sleep. I’m gonna try again. I’m scared. And no it wasn’t the tiny tiny amount of coke I did prior. If you’re unfamiliar with cocaine the amount was like taking a few sips of beer. I’m going to try to sleep again. I want to cry. This is the last chance I get. This is he last time anyone’s gonna help me get clean. This is the last time the girl I want to marry will watch me do this. If I fuck this up my entire life is over. The weight of my entire future is on my shoulders and it’s entirely my own evil doing.

Sorry for the wall of text. I don’t know where to break things. If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. If you didn’t, I appreciate  you tooSocial media means nothing snd no one is obliged to care about what I say hahha.

I know I wrote about drugs the whole time but I’ve had mental health problems for a long time depression and anxiety and having to learn how to manage ADHD. Drugs made everything worse and yet I couldnt stop.

Goodnight. I hope I don’t dream like that again. But my dreams are always outrageously scary and realistic when I start getting clean. I genuinely hope anyone who comes across post is having a good safe night. Thank you for giving me a safe space."
388,[Mental health] Space; A spoken encouragement,"Whereas I am not entirely sure this is allowed, and I sure hope it is, I have made a brief video on the concept of space, and this moment. It isn't much, or anything huge, but I hope to be able to make people's days a little bit brighter through it. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_hzF7nnZXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_hzF7nnZXo) 

The idea that is spoken about is the lack of things around you, and how there is often a lot more nothing than there is something, and how anyone can just slip into that space between things, and have space to be. Again, simple concept, but I hope it helps someone, somewhere."
389,Sixth form,"I’m 17, from the uk and in sixth form, in the uk year 12 is the first year of sixth and college after completing GCSE’s in year 11. However the rest of my friends are in year 13, this is because I chose to restart 12 instead of carry on. I chose that because I’ve missed about 7 months of school because my laptop broke about 3 weeks into lockdown, I also chose it because before lockdown I did 0 revision I put little effort into homework and didn’t pay much attention in lessons, I had the ‘everything will work out for me’ mindset and my goal was to get into the University of Nottingham to study something along the lines of biomedical sciences. However I fear that I’m making the same mistakes all over again, I’m not revising and I’m putting minimal effort in, I know I’m doing this but yet I can’t bring myself to revise."

391,Using death positively,"I used to often find myself having existential crisis, worrying about death, saddened about the fact that we’ll all die, another thing I struggled with is confidence, not so much to the point of social anxiety or to a debilitating level, I’ve just always been socially awkward and it’s probably down to the worry of what people think of me, however, recently I’ve learnt to use death as a way of being okay with these social issues, I don’t overthink what other people’s opinions of me are as much because at the end of the day, we’re all gonna die, so it won’t matter at all what anyone thinks because they’ll be dead and I’ll be dead, it sounds really depressing but it’s slowly helping me realise nobodies opinion of me actually matters because everyone is equal under the basis that we’re gonna die, I’m not sure what happens after death or if anything happens after death but idk, maybe this is a useful mentality to keep in uncomfortable situations, just wanna know what other people think of this or if anyone uses this logic, it’s interesting to me"

396,What does a scat fetish indicate?,"Hello,
I have a pretty strong scat fetish. If you don’t know what that is, it involves human feces. I am interested in normal sex but I masturbate mainly to porn watching a man or a woman defecate in underwear or diapers or on another man or woman. Naturally when I tell folks about my fetish, most think it’s bizarre.
IRL i’m well adjusted aside from ADHD and depression. I was bullied pretty bad when I was younger and don’t have alot of close friends. 
I’m in college, have held down some jobs and served in my state’s National Guard for awhile, never went overseas.
Is there anything pointing to my fetish as a sign of instability?
Thanks!"

398,Yeh it's me again. Birthday is nearly here and honestly. I don't want to celebrate my birthday anymore.,"Me and my mum (bless her kind loving soul) shared the same birthday. It was always something very special about us, it always made me feel so much closer to my mum than anything else. I hated leaving home to go to uni, it wasn't so much leaving behind everything, it was not having my mum with Mr to enjoy everything with like I always had done. Now with no gf, half my family gone from last year. I've just got nothing left in the tank. I thought my breakup was hard to deal with as it was. But this. No. This is worse. These next 3 months are going to be hell. And this is normally the time of year I love the most. It's cold, I get to turn the fire on, enjoy being extra warm while everything gets colder. And obviously Christmas. Now I really just don't want to celebrate anything. I'm not in the mood to. I put on a happy face and try my best but it's just that, a happy face. 

I really just don't know how to feel anymore. I keep trying to do the things that used to make me feel good, and the start of this week I felt good, I'd helped people and it was helping me heal again, I'd thought I'd got through my ex and now I was starting to look forward. Now I've had nothing but just pure empty inside me. I don't know whether to ask you all for help, to just try make these next two weeks great so I can feel better for now or just find something to busy my mind."
399,so whenever i find something i like i tend to obsess over it way too much,"you might think that wouldnt be much of a problem but take among us for example. its actually been harder for me to enjoy things that arent among us related recently because theres not much room for enjoyment of other things, and it seems to wear me out. most of the time, i realize after maybe a week or so that i dont actually like the thing i was obsessing over nearly as much as i thought i would, but ive already dedicated a lot of time to that thing. anyways, is this a thing or am i just weird?"
400,Can it be mental illness?,"First of all, i don't want to dignose myself. Im not a doctor nor a psychologist. Thats why im here. Im afraid that i may be struggling with some form of mental illness (for example dwpression).

I think i should begin with saying that i am trans. Last few months were really rough for me, as i was discovering my identity. Lately im tired and/or stressed all the time. I have problems with doing nearly everything. I became much more sensitve to everything. I relapsed after over a year of staying self-harm free and sometimes have suicidal-kinda thoughts. I also experience something similar to panic attacks (i have no idea if these are real panic attacks, im shaking, its harder to breathe, my hands are sweating, if feel like its very hot or cold).Also i lost weight, i just don't want to eat.

My very close friend told me that i should seek professional help, tho im afraid of coming out to my parents.

Is it really something that serious? Do i have to clarify something? Can it really be depression-kinda thing?

I dont know if its the right place to ask, tell me if there is a better one"
401,idk what to do,i feel so worthless. i have so many problems i can’t put them all down. every time i speak out i just get ignored. i need real help but i can’t get it. i am scared of the future every day that goes by i just get more and more scared. i’ve been bottling so much up for so long and i’ve never been able to get it out. i feel like i’m wasting my life in my room everyday on my phone. i don’t know what to do. my head is full of negative thoughts and energy it’s slowly taking over my life. i just want to cut everyone out my life and end it all everything just seems so fucking pointless. i can’t think of any reason to live except my friends will be sad if i’m gone. i really need help.
402,I'm afraid of losing a person that I consider special to me,[removed]
403,Currently waiting for my online psych eval to start.,"Very very nervous. I’m sitting and just waiting staring at this screen. Idk what to expect. I’m
Scared bc it’s a Christian mental health service that is p well known for involuntarily committing people and i rly don’t want that, but it’s a zoom call. I should be fine, right?"
404,I might be an asshole but I’m tired. M26,"I am tired of having to deal with my family members mental health issues, while simultaneously dealing with my own. My mum is depressed and has tried to kill herself a number of times, luckily she’s doing okay now but about the time she got better my younger brother started having episodes and now he is chronically depressed and is constantly making it my problem, he refuses to change his lifestyle to better manage his conditions, he still drinks, does drugs, and barely sleeps, I understand his mental health can cause some of these behaviours and I want to be there for him, I want to help but at the same time I’m drained, I’m tired of having to worry about whether or not I’m going to come home and find my brother dead, I’m tired of driving around at 2am trying to find him, then finding him drunk in a park, I’m tired of him living in my house in squalor and when I ask him to clean up he just starts crying and giving himself an asthma attack which I then have to take him to the hospital for. I am tired and I’m anxious and I can’t keep doing this."
405,"Did I just go through a narcissistic abuse in my relationship? I've highlighted my mistake as well, but did I deserve to be treated as trash?","Okay so this might be long and could take a while but for
 those of you who reach the end, thanks a ton.
I kind of had a crush on this guy(let's call him A) I met in college(same batch, same class). We're about the same age at that time (19years). He apparently was having a tough time getting over his ex girlfriend and I was having the same kind of trouble. I won't say that we instantly clicked because he sort of thought himself to be superior to almost everyone around him. He was very selective with the people he spoke to. His roommate and I became very good friends and later he and I became friends too. Turns out, he always knew that I had a crush on him but never addressed it. So I let it be. 
One day, his roommate (my good friend) advises me that I should confess. So even if his answer was a no I'd be able to get on with my life. I agreed. When I told him, he said that I should have taken more time and he dealt with me and my emotions really well. I made it clear that even if we didn't work out, I was more than happy to be just friends. 
Then when our semester got over, the both of us decided to explore the city. We booked a hotel but we were so tired we just decided to spend sometime alone. We ordered alcohol, got drunk and then things happened. We promised to keep it a secret and not take it any further from there. 
When we went back home, we used to text and video call almost everyday. In the meantime, I met my ex boyfriend (now this ex was a very dear friend. I knew him for a long time and I met him to clear things out. We had almost grown up together and by that time our friendship had turned absolutely platonic). Later that day when I got a call from A, I told him that I had met the ex. He flipped completely and without even giving an explanation, our conversations kept getting shorter and shorter.
When it was time to go back, I was very excited thinking that this might be it. I'll get to meet A again and maybe things will not be as complicated it seems. Turns out, he was already speaking to 2 other girls. And he refused to address any conversation that might include what had happened in the hotel. He kept calling the other girls and talking about them. It seemed like he was not interested at all. Being baffled, I didn't know what to do and I impulsively decided to date someone else(let's call him C). Obviously, since it was a rebound it didn't work out but C turned out to be a horrible person too. He'd go around telling everyone about what we did and how we kissed. A heard. 
I was guilty and one day when A and I got the chance to speak he asked me what went wrong and I accepted that I had messed up. I even told him that from the same moment onwards if he decided to never speak to me again, I'll agree and never try to talk to him too. But things took an even uglier turn. A few weeks later, he decided to ask me out. I was elated. Finally things seemed to go my way. I had very strong feelings for A and I wanted to show him that I was going to do everything to make him stay.
Sadly, I had to give up everything I ever loved. My anchoring, my friends, my sports just so that I could spend time with him. At that point, I thought that these sacrifices don't matter as long as I had him in my life. He would see me smile with a friend and not talk to me or tell me that it affected him so much that i stopped acknowledging my other friends to make him feel at ease. I had a fairly large social circle and he ruthlessly cut through it isolating me from my friends. My self confidence slowly shattered as all the things that added to it, were stopped. Once when I was sick, a friend once offered to carry a heavy bag for me and when I told A about how nice the gesture was he completely flipped and screamed at me for letting someone else to my bidding. I started stepping on egg shells, not knowing what will cause him to burst and lash out. He went as far as telling me that I had a bad upbringing, kept criticising my parents and my culture. I kept quiet. I literally had no one to talk to about what I was going through. My self esteem plummeted to such a low that I could not trust anything I could do. He kept gaslighting and making me feel even worse about dating C. Any little fight we had, he'd never miss the opportunity to guilt trip. 
Finally, when we were sent back home because of the lockdown after about 2 weeks or so, he said that he was breaking up. All the efforts i put him for him, after everything i did, he just said ""start seeing other men"". I had no one and i was not sure if my friends would take me back after i tell them why i cut them off from my life. Even after the break up, he decided that we should remain friends and i saw this as a chance to redeem myself again. Maybe this time if i tried harder things would be different. And so i did. I wrote his assignments, i lent him money and he extracted all the favours he could from me. When I couldn't take it anymore (the uncertainty), I told him that I couldn't be friends anymore. He didn't even protest. It broke me but then what was left anyway to break.
A few weeks ago, I got hold of this conversation with his friends where he kept demeaning where I came from(my culture) and refused to acknowledge that I had once been his girlfriend. 
All of this just added so much of a mental burden I decided to take help. I'm under therapy now and I still suffer from extremely low self esteem. I realise that dating C wasn't the smartest thing to do but did I deserve what I was put through?

Tl;DR For 8 months straight, I had to endure things that very slowly and firmly reduced my self esteem to a very low level. I was made to feel insufficient about the efforts i put in to save my relationship and if i made a mistake i would be continuously guilt tripped into believing that I was a terrible person."
406,Am I the only one?,
407,Quick question about bottling,"What’s the uh, issues about bottling? I myself am a bottler and have been my whole life. I can definitely tell that it’s a bad thing (but I can’t pinpoint quite why) and know I should stop it but it’s difficult. I guess it’s a two in one question actually. What’s so bad about bottling and how to stop it?"
408,Help?,"Maybe because of my childhood but I really can’t fuck with anyone. I mean like I feel like all the friendships I make are fake. I’m not depressed anymore, or maybe I am but I’m just trying to hide it but there is no reward. Like I feel worse than before through my self-improvement path. I though I was just a loner being unable to talk to girls. But lowkey I can’t even talk to my guy friends. Even my close family feel fake. I always suspect that my mum is pissed at me for some reason too. There’s no happiness but it’s more like existential dread than typical sadness. Help?"
409,What do I do when people are tired of hearing about my mental health issues?,"I don’t talk about it with my friends anymore because I think whenever I talked about my problems, it’d drag them down. Also, its always the same issues over and over again and it gets repetitive for them. As for my mom, she’s taken to entirely pretending that I never said it. She’ll say “don’t about things like that” or “you know I don’t like it when you talk about that.” But I think a part of me is tired of talking/explaining."
410,Intrusive thoughts,"I started getting them maybe a couple months ago and at that yime didn't know they were but then google helped me, but now a couple weeks or so ive had a different run of intrusive thoughts and its really getting to me, im ashamed and scared of myself and who i am, i dont know what ti do"
411,"To the ladies out there, does your mental health take a deep dive before/during your period?","I've noticed this alot that on the week before my period, my mental health would always spiral down. This has been going on for so many years, but until now I haven't been able to control it. My anxiety gets amplified 100x, and it almost always leads to me emotionally bursting on the people closest to me. 

Am I the only one experiencing this? If you experience this too, what are your ways to manage it?"
412,How do I learn to love my body as it is?,"I know most of us are struggling with the same thing (or maybe it's just me?). I've been trying to learn to love my body, but I still unconsciously compare myself to others. I've been trying, *really hard*, for years now, but I feel like I haven't made any progress. It just feels like my brain is very stubborn to think that my body is disgusting and I should always be losing more weight.

I've unfollowed people on social media that make me feel uncomfortable in my own body (people that are on a diet all the time, have gone through plastic surgery, edit their photos to look skinnier etc.), I've done a lot trying to change the way I think and how I handle my toxic thoughts. I've been reminding myself how healthy I am and that looks aren't important, how I can run, draw and do many other amazing things with my body. But it only helps for a while. I used to have an eating disorder when I was a teenager.

My best friend is really beautiful, she is petite with a great ass, big lips and a flat stomach. I'm the exact opposite, and with her, I just feel like an elephant. I feel clumsy and big, like a sumo wrestler, and I can just feel my confidence shrink to nothing. And the thing that makes it so unfair is that she doesn't spend any time at the gym, she just has great genes. She has the same eating habits as I do, we both eat relatively healthy.

It just feels so bad when all the guys adore her. I'm just the sidekick. Of course, I'm happy for her and I always support her, but I can't deny that this hasn't affected my confidence. I wish I could be confident, because I know that would make me more attractive. But I'm not.

I'm on Tinder, and another thing that bothers me is that I'm too shy to post realistic photos of me. Pictures of my tummy rolls, my big thighs, just me being me. I only post pictures where my stomach is inventively hidden (lol). I just worry about what people think of me, and that's another thing I want to get rid of. I'd love to post pictures of my body on social media, like Instagram, but I'm too anxious to share pics of my insecurities.

What can I do? Or will I always compare myself to others and feel like this? Do you have any advice?"
413,I'm super bad at telling when I don't like things or at stopping when I'm not enjoying something,"I, by luck, have been having some actual fun recently and it has made me realize that I don't often realize when I'm actually not enjoying something. Now, this isn't bad at all when it's something like a chore or a job that I need to do. I mean, it can still increase discomfort because I'm probably ignoring minor issues. But no, I'm mostly talking about downtime. Hobbies, to be exact.

It's hard to me to stop watching a movie or playing a game even if there's nothing fun about it because I'm often relying on outside opinions and objective criteria to push forward rather than my own experiences. I'm not even sure I like playing games anymore or if I ever did. Most of the game I played ranged from utterly frustrating to thanks god for mods to a bloody chore with awesome cutscenes and good characters. 

Then there's books. Lately, I started reading again after not picking up a book in years and finally found stuff that's actually entertaining. Holly fuck! Did I ever enjoy reading before? Why was I reading all those books? Why did I feel so much anxiety and shame if I didn't finish them even if they were so tedious? Why did I feel so compelled to pick anything via Must Read articles or because it was a classic?

Same with every other hobby I've tried. Why haven't I stopped it when I realized it wasn't for me and how could I not realize sooner?"
414,How do I make my mom realize she has a problem?,"&amp;#x200B;

My background: I am 18 and just graduated Highschool. I am taking course to prepare for my college entrance exam next year. Since February, I have been battling depression and anxiety. I have seen a psychologist, but is still in a slow recovery process, especially with Covid.

My mom(49) has OCD and is very short tempered. She is a bit narrow minded and wants things to go her way. Lately, she’s been getting a lot of stress which has affected her drastically. Her stresses are from:

1. Worrying for her employees and herself who’ve been getting pay cuts 
2. Arguing with her higher-ups about the pay cuts and possible office shutdown
3. Seeing me and my dad relaxing and not being productive, which triggers her OCD (note that these occur after working out and finishing our daily errands)
4. Worrying about me because I’m seen relaxing and not occupied with preparing for college. (I am currently focusing on dealing with my anxiety and depression first)
5. Feeling jealous of my dad because he has less work (but more salary) and gets to spend more time with me.

When all these stresses are added, she dumps them on the whole household (that includes me, my dad, my grandma \[her mother\], and the maid). She goes crazy in situations such as:

1. The maid forgetting to prep something when she wants to cook.
2. My grandma having trouble with her new sim card, which she ends up berating my grandma for asking how things work.
3. My dad laying on the sofa when he finishes work, which she sees as being lazy and unproductive.
4. And me forgetting to join an online webinar.

Obviously, the household is sick of this treatment and now our relationship with my mom is strained, especially between her and my dad and me. 

She once asked my dad why people are distancing themselves from her. Dad replies by saying that we don’t like it when she boss us like her employees and berate us for simple things. He tells her that things will most likely not go her way and yelling at people doesn’t solve the problem (similar to Karen behavior). She says that those things are justified given that that people were at fault and that people are dumb because they have different perspectives to her. Even after my dad pointed out her wrongdoings, she insists that others are at fault and not as a result of her actions as to why people are distancing themselves from her. It seems that as days go by, her reactions become wilder and wilder. How do I tell her that she has a problem and she needs to seek help?"
415,Crippling fear of failure,"My whole life has been dictated by the mantra of ""can't fail if you don't try"". Even when I escape to games any bit of failure is comically devastating.  
Any pointers? My psych is dealing with serious family issues so I'm a bit dried up and Google is helping even less than usual."
416,Voices while falling asleep,I've been struggling with anxiety for awhile now. Lately I've been hearing voices/sounds before falling asleep. Sometimes I get fragmented thoughts at the same time. This doesn't happen while awake. This symptom has me concerned. I mentioned this during a mental health assessment too. I've been told it can be caused by stress or it's hypnagogic hallucinations. Does anyone else experience or know anything  about this?
417,Cleaning my room made me ashamed to remember how much miniarure stuff I've hoarded for the last 2+ years,"There has always been part of me who really loves handcrafting and painting and painting and about 3 years ago I got into buying model kits. But as anxiety and depression have slowly and surely taking toll on me for the past few years I've been out of energy for artsy hobbies I used to love, but I've kept buying new stuff whenever I've ran into good deals or seen new exciting stuff.

Now I have well over 20 miniature tanks and dozens of Warhammer 40K sets waiting in storage, with no new energy in sight to actually get workspace and eaupment to build and paint all the things I have. I know I still want to, as the pure excitement still fills me when I find new stuff and feel the passion and ambition that is still in me, but over time I go back into anxious and depressive episodes.

I am getting help now to get my life back on track, which is why I began cleaning, but seeing the huge bunch of unassembled plastic almost staring at me. They're not going anywhere, which both fills my chest wirh warmer feeling that I can just wait to feel actively better to hace bunch of things to do, but also with shane of letting myself to hoard this much stuff I need to take care of someday."
418,This has been the worst year of my life. I feel like my chest is clenching and weighed down and I'm hollow inside because I can't find the will to care about anything anymore,"This has been the worst year of my life.

Not just because of the obvious pandemic but an endless stream of personal issues which just can't seem to stop. It's exhausting and I've tried so hard to just get it over with but it's like I'm bolted to a treadmill and I'm at the point of finally collapsing. Recent family issues have arisen again and ever since I've had this awful heaviness in my heart that makes just existing feel like a burden. I'm confused and frustrated and it seems like nothing is working out for me. 

It's gotten to the point where everytime another form of bad news comes up its not a surprise to me anymore. I'm expecting things to keep on coming up because that's how it's been going for the past 12 months. I don't know what else to do other than just tolerate it because I feel like I don't want to exist but I also don't think I want to die. For the entire day today I felt like I wasn't really there I can say with certainty that I did NOTHING. I don't enjoy things anymore, I couldn't think of anything to do that would make me feel anything. 

There was a point at which this year I felt I would be freed of majority of my stress. This would be after my final exams to graduate high school. But all I know is that it will only get to breaking point as that time approaches in the next 2 weeks. I don't know if I will be able to handle it when it comes but meanwhile I feel like I'm not living, all I'm doing is waiting for time to pass. I don't know what to do and if anyone has anything to say at all...It's welcome. Thanks to anyone who read this far. I just needed to express it somewhere"

I mean, people only see what I want them to see, seeing that my mask is always perpetually much blank. But sometimes, I wish things were different. I sound silly right? I mean, there is no way to really change the path you set on. Guess I should’ve known earlier that people are two faced. Ironic huh? Seeing that I’m also masked.

Suicide is a shadow, it is a child playing hide and seek behind your friend’s smile(Patrick Roche), and you can’t really recollect thoughts, for recollecting them is always a torrent of insults and self degrotary terms my grandmother uses on me.

423,Hair falling out in handfuls around my fingers when I run my hand through it 🥺,"I've been in a bad place for a about a week now with severe disassociation, anxiety, depression, self harm, and little sleep  and just not taking care of myself.  I'm just feel trapped and scared about my routine life (as frankly as I can put it). Ive called into work pretty much all week and im trying to get back into therapy. I almost wish I had some damn meds to take still and I don't.  I used to have something for bad episodes about 2 years ago but I think my mom threw them away. Ik drugs should be a last resort but I feel like im literally going insane. The disassociation is the first time I've had it happen and it panics me more being prone to memory loss due to my hypothyroidism anyways.  I just feel like how I did in high-school when I had suicidal thoughts (but not intentions), but like 10x worse. Sorry I just need to put this all down on ""paper"" ig"
424,"I was always a well put together person despite the anxiety, but I can’t tell anymore","I’ve posted about this before, but I have thoughts about things happening to me. They are like scenarios in my head that I keep reliving, I don’t know if they’ll actually end up happening. Sometimes they seem more realistic which is when I’m full on panic mode, sometimes less realistic. Right now they either seem less realistic, or they seem realistic but I started accepting the outcome. And that scares me so much. I don’t want any of these things to happen to me, it gives me SO much anxiety, I can’t. Sometimes I feel like thinking about it will help make them happen, but I can’t stop. I feel like thinking about them gets me more prepared or something. I just wanna tell what’s irrational and what’s not."

426,"Not sure what is exactly wrong with me, is this a personality trait/trauma?","I have always felt like a follower, never a leader. Not even of my own life. I have always been shaped and told what to do. Obedient, because that got me the most praise and it was the only way I knew how to stand out. I also feel trapped by this and with no way of understanding who I actually am. I know i people please, to keep the peace, to stay unnoticed, god forbid I am ever in the lime light I have no idea what to do with public attention. Obviously I find friends that take me a long time to become comfortable around and then I can joke and speak my thoughts. But all in all if someone new joins the group I'm intimidated and immediately go back into my shell. I feel like there are so many anxiety filled traumatic moments in my life that sadly were the ones that took over my head and created this awkward persona. I feel like I have been controlled by everyone, family, friends, partners, employers, even strangers get a say in what I do more than me. I then try to find happiness or something I want or need in life and I struggle. Almost like I could just die and it wouldn't make a difference. If I was to try and make my own decisions I feel like I would be abandoned, so I look for answers in others on what to do. This has cascaded into all parts of my life, making me feel incapable of pretty much anything new. Social ques are hard for me to read, and I get offended way to easily, but I put on a good front that makes me come off as a bitch to others, or as I was told once that I have an ""attitude problem"". Problem solving is a struggle and same with working in a team I am usually the one trying the hardest to keep up like I'm in a parallel universe. I can't pin point what is wrong with me exactly so I feel like I can't fix it and it's just been too much of my life spent like this to even begin trying to unravel the tangled mess that is my brain. Can anyone relate? Might someone know what I have so I can treat it. 

TLDR - Anxiety filled situations and not feeling in control of my life have moulded me, and I don't know who I am. Making me feel out of place, and that my brain is constantly being challenged by things that everyone else seems to get straight away. Is there a name for this?"
427,why is my mom always mad at me,"i feel like every time i try to tell me mom something that's bothering me, she finds some reason to get mad at me. i had a break after my online spanish class and i was telling my mom how i was frustrated with getting called on randomly by the teacher. she had an angry tone and said ""well how else are you supposed to learn a language?"" she's right of course, but it made me feel bad. even after my therapy sessions when i'm telling her what we talked about she usually gets mad at something

i've tried to talk to her about doing things like this before. she apologizes sometimes but it doesn't really make me feel better because she keeps doing it

i know she has pretty bad anxiety and works a lot, but i try *so hard* to never make things more stressful for her. this has been happening for years and i even once tried to vent to my friends about it but they told me i was being ungrateful.

she makes me feel like shit all the time and sometimes she doesn't understand why what she does is hurtful to me. i don't know what to do.

i have bad anxiety too and one of these times can ruin my day because often my mom acts as if nothing happened. she's supposed to be there to listen to me but she's so bad at it."
428,"After beating my mental health issues, I trained as a therapist to help others!","Hey there, just wanted to share my story a little bit, hope that's alrighty! ☺️

After years of suppressing my issues stemming from a shitty childhood, they finally got the better of me last year.  I quit my job, ended my relationship, and took time away from uni.  

After deciding to see a psychologist and take antidepressants, not much was changing.  That was until I came across NLP, and it changed my life.  Within weeks, the issues I'd been talking to my psychologist with for months were completely gone.  To this day I can't believe it! 

Once I got my life back together I decided to train up as therapist over lockdown and help as many people as I could. 

I started my own company (airitoutminds.com) and I now work for myself as a therapist doing NLP, hypnotherapy and life coaching, helping people out of the holes that they find themselves in.

No matter where you are right now, it gets better! It always does!"
429,My life has turned into a mess and I need help sorting it out before it gets any worse,"About four months ago, my mental health spiraled out of control and not a single day passed where I did not cry uncontrollably for hours. This was during exam season, so I had to keep myself together and finish the first semester. I passed most of my exams and then I had a 5 day vacation before the second semester was due to start.

In those 5 days, I spoke to my parents and my therapist about seeing my psychiatrist again and I was met with support. So two months ago, I went to go see my psychiatrist again and I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, again. This would be the third time I get this diagnosis.

I was terrified because I feel like I need to be in control of everything in my life, which obviously isn't possible. So, I let go of control completely and now I'm lost.

I started drinking anti-depressants again, I've been on them for almost six weeks now. I've stopped crying, but I'm emotionally constipated. I feel like I want to cry, but it's just not happening. I usually drink my anti-depressants in the morning around 7am, but for the last 3 weeks, I have been unable to stay awake after drinking them, which forced me to sleep in until around 2pm. For the last 3 weeks, I've been sleeping for 12 hours pretty much every day. My plan to solve this, is to start drinking my anti-depressants at night.

I also need to seriously consider a sober lifestyle. Alcohol has played a big part in my life being out of control lately.

We are 8 weeks into the semester and I've barely worked at all for the last 2 months. I just don't have any motivation at all. I'm not that far behind, but I do feel scared by the amount of work I need to catch up. I'm usually a very hard working student and I usually get good grades, but this year is much different.

I don't know what to do anymore. Some part of me wants to talk to my parents about being committed to a psychiatric clinic for a while, just so I can get my bearings on life back.

I can't stop procrastinating and things are getting worse by the day. How can I regain control and sort out my life?"
430,I really need support right now,"So the last 3 months have been pretty bad for me with my mental health all around. I started having panic attacks a few times a week, which eventually lead to panic attacks daily and constant worrying about my health and other things. Which eventually lead to me going through a “breakdown” as I call it. Where I couldn’t be alone. Couldn’t get out of bed. I felt awful 24/7. Well I felt like I was finally starting to come out of it a few weeks ago. I started staying home by myself more, panicking less, started resuming to my normal activities and life. I didn’t feel like my normal self but I felt close enough to be content with that. Only thing that hasn’t changed is my sleep. I’m still having terrible insomnia every night for the last 2-3 months. Yesterday morning I woke up feeling pretty bad again. Spaced out and exhausted. Almost like a zombie. I also started having this feeling that I couldn’t trust my brain. Like I was going to go crazy and lose control of my mind and not be aware of what I’m doing. The feeling has been very overwhelming yesterday and today. I feel like crying. I feel hopeless again because I felt like I was finally starting to feel better and now I feel bad again. I feel like my husband doesn’t understand (understandable), but still. I feel embarrassed to tell him how I feel and I know it affects him. I can tell his mood changes when I tell him how I feel. I just want to cry. I started therapy last week. I really don’t wanna go on meds guys. I’ve tried so many and the side effects are awful for me and always make me feel so much worse.. the worst thing I did yesterday was start worrying I could be bipolar. Even though I’ve had mental health issues since I was 10 and I’m 24. And have had many doctors and Psychiatrists and psychologists look at me and talk to me. I googled it and now I’m paranoid I’m bipolar and that I *will lose control due to that. What made me really worry is how I felt like I was getting better and now I feel kinda bad again and super anxious. I just feel like crying. I just want to feel good. I felt like I was getting there. Why am I feeling bad again. Is it the sleep? I feel like I cannot keep living this way. I’m so spaced out today. I want my husband to be proud of me and happy with me. I want to laugh and be happy. 
Has anyone else ever had these fears and feelings?? I feel like I have nobody."
431,"How do I know whether I’m depressed, burned out, or just tired?","25F
I’ve known for a while that direct contact with people for extended time exhaust me out, but nowadays even the thought of social interaction makes me feel... unhinged, i guess.
My work as online customer center doesn’t help too, since I have to be in contact with bunch of different people every day, but kinda I need the salary and the visa since I’m living abroad. Can’t risk getting deported during pandemic by quitting and having no permanent job.

I’m just..... tired of everything, and tired of being tired. Sometimes I did have suicidal thoughts, but I just have too many loose ends to proceed.

Yeah, that’s that. Sorry if my post doesn’t make sense."
432,How do I help my friends without hurting myself?,"TW// talk of self harm



So I’ll write this as briefly as I can. Most, if not all, of my friends have mental issues. 

Over the years we’ve been friends I’ve become the group mom. I’ve also become a point of contact when they aren’t having a good time. 

It sounds arrogant, but they do come to me when they need help. If I can’t stop them from doing something (like hurting themselves) then I’ll help them calm down afterwards and make sure the injures are clean and covered. 

I don’t mind, it makes me happy knowing they have someone to talk to that can help.

Recently, however I’ve noticed a shift in my own mental state. The best way to describe it would be self worth issues. I feel like I have no right to complain about things and when my parents spend money on me I think they should use it for something more useful. 

It’s not that bad, I can ignore it easy enough.

Today wasn’t a good day for two of my friends, I was the only one there consistently to help them. 

One friend, K, was acting withdrawn. Which, based on things that happened on Monday, means he could have a panic attack. I tired to keep him out his head and by the end of the school day he hadn’t had one. 

My other friend D is more worrying. She said she’s been seeing things, disturbing things. At first she was joking about it but at lunch she gave me a note asking for help, that her brain wouldn’t stop. 

D has a history of unhealthy habits, her parents know and so do the school. She’s going to have an online meeting with someone about the habits but I don’t think it will help much. 

I don’t know how to help them, or my other friends. I’m not good at comforting them, most times I just send funny pictures and hope for the best. 

I know I should say something to them about my own issues but I feel like if I do then they won’t come to me for help. If they go to someone else that’s fine but what if they don’t? I don’t want to be the reason they get hurt even more. 

Once, D mentioned relapsing In hurting herself. I saw the message but I ignored it because I didn’t want to deal with it, I though someone else would see it and sort it out. 

They didn’t and she relapsed. 

She then came to the group chat and said she was going to pass out from blood loss. She didn’t, luckily. 

I just felt so bad, I could have stopped it before it happened but I ignored it. 

I shouldn’t blame myself, I know. And mostly I don’t but I remember about it when my friends show sighs that they aren’t ok. 

It’s worse when I try to help sometimes, I don’t have any confidence. I say that I’ll help them but I don’t because I chicken out. 

I’ve been feeling the pressure lately I guess.

I know putting said pressure on myself, while in the middle of figuring out my own problems, isn’t good to do but I can’t see another way. 

What they go through is much worse then what I do. The worst I get is maybe crying but they actively hurt themselves, I can push aside my problems because they aren’t as bad. 

The irony there is I told one of my friends not to do that. 

So, any ideas?"

434,i’m struggling but don’t want to tell my family. what do i do??,i fucking hate my family so much. whenever i’m in a bad mood no one EVER asks me if i’m okay i just get yelled at for being a bitch when really every day is a battle i don’t want to get out of bed i don’t want to live like this anymore. and if i did tell them i wasn’t okay and why they would never believe me and just think i want attention and am lying plus i don’t feel comfortable telling any of them what do i do
435,Idk I'm just tired,"Please don't comment anything helpful or condescending on this.

I just feel tired of living. I don't deserve to live. I should be dead. I just feel that I need to die. I want to stop existing. But I'm to afraid to pull the straw. I'm so worthless. I now that I'm just troubling the people around me. People that care. They are being burdened by me and my tantrums. I should die. I don't know what to do."
436,I want to write a nonfiction book about people's experiences with Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective disorder. Would anyone be interested in helping me?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi my name is Magnolia Silcox and as a Schizophrenic person I want other people's stories like mine to get told. That's why I want to put together a book about other's experiences with Schizophrenia and all the stigma and hardships you have gone through with having Schizophrenia. The book I plan on writing will be called ""Define Crazy"". It will include short memoirs from people that have, Schizophrenia, Pre-formed Schizophrenia, Schizo-effective, and has any sort of Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. I would like to have at least 200 pages. Each entry should be labeled "" 's Story"" It should include your name or pen name you go by.

If anyone is interested please dm me."
437,Reminder – Take things easy!,"What helped me was intentionally looking out for myself – making an effort to sleep enough and stay hydrated, and focus on basic needs. Often we know we need a break from our normal lives but there lies the temptation of binge watching youtube or scrolling social media, rather than truly resting. Other times we might feel like we're missing out to peers when we work less. For those in a depressive spiral, the helplessness in trying to get out of the depressive loop might simply feel overwhelming. If life feels like a struggle, perhaps it might help to live from day to day, or even hour to hour. To be in more control of my life, i tried doing things that i dont usually do (for me it was something artistic like doodling), and in addition i set aside time to enjoy a comfort space for myself where id listen to some lofi music. 

To all those who need to hear this: keep on keeping on"
438,I’m so fucking angry sometimes I want to explode.,I cant talk about why because people would probably just think I’m being up tight or something but I’m genuinely just so sick of everything.
439,sometimes I feel blank or really strong emotions,"For the past 2 years I’ve felt either blank or really intense emotions. I’ve realised this during my past relationships. I feel empty and non empathetic. Like if I do something shitty to someone I wouldn’t notice or even care if it’s brought up. Sometimes I’m a complete dickhead but I just pretend to be sorry bc I don’t know what to say. My family and ex has been frustrated with me with how empty minded I can be. Then there are times that I abruptly get really clingy or need assurance that I’m loved. when I’m really emotional about things they get worried and scared. Bc I can get really violent and do crazy things. I can’t control my emotions well. Suddenly I’ll be really happy and excited about something but not too long after i get depressed and low.

I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. Like I can either express myself well which rarely occurs, or struggle to find the words to say anything. I’ve been to doctors before and they diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and ocd. I just wanna be normal and okay."

441,Beyond hope,"I am diagnosed with OCD, GAD and eating problems (ARFID I suppose)

• I feel like I have to do everything a certain way, but not sure what that way is; just feels like I have to do things in a way that feels right, until it feels okay to stop

• I often feel like I have to do things a certain number of times (usually multiples of 8, especially 16 and 64), but I find it really hard to count so end up doing it until it feels okay to stop

• I constantly feel really foggy and disorientated, like it's hard to think, and I seem to lose time, like I space out and can't concentrate on anything

• I always feel uncomfortable in some way, like my stomach or head's aching and often feel like I can't catch my breath

• Eating and drinking is always a big deal, I'm always worrying about if I'm having too much, too quickly, whether the food/drink/cutlery/cup/plate/etc. is okay

• I'm always wary of my hands and arms and whether they're clean, and my mouth, which I rub on my left arm to clean

• I often end up spending a long time in the bathroom because I worry about whether or not I'm 'finished' going to the toilet (because I'm less intelligent than a bloody toddler)

• I feel really flat and emotionless all the time

• I don't enjoy anything; sometimes I might laugh or smile at something, but it's like a physical reaction to emotions I'm not feeling

• I haven't cried in 5 years, despite feeling like I might need to

• I dread everything; life, especially adult life, just seems like pain and stress and difficulty, and unenjoyable

• I constantly frustrate and annoy my family (and probably others) with my stupidity

• I screw up everything I do

• Every time I speak, I wish I hadn't

• I feel like everyone and everything would be better off if I'd never existed or if I'd died years ago

Treatment I've had:

• CBT (not on medication) 2014-2015

• Adolescent inpatient treatment (not sure what treatment I had, can't remember) 2015

• Counselling at college

• TherapyForYou (England)

• Group therapy for OCD

• EMDR (through a charity)

Now waiting for a phone consultation with NHS Psychotherapy and Complex Needs Services, been waiting for about 3 months

Medications I'm on:

Sertraline (Zoloft) 200mg I think

Propranolol 80mg maybe

Quetiapine 100mg maybe (the psychiatrist started me on Quetiapine a few months ago but hasn't checked in since)

I just don't know what else to do. It seems we've tried so much stuff and nothing's really worked, or it has for a bit and then stopped working. The OCD stuff seemed to recede a bit after inpatient but then suddenly came back. It seems that I'm just supposed to be a mess. I mean, I know I'm scum but I don't want to ruin my family's lives anymore. I don't care what happens to me, I think I should get better for them but I don't want myself to get better because I deserve to suffer. I don't get what the point is anymore, it seems this is just how life is, struggle. 

Sorry for the long moaning post, I just can't seem to make myself better by myself. My family say I don't try but it honestly feels like I do, I just fail constantly. I just can't seem to hack this human thing."

443,Why do I startle so easily? Is there anything I can do?,"Ever since I remember, I have been easily startled. It is pretty much constant, but it gets a bit worse with stress and surprisingly sort of improves if I'm really anxious. To give you an idea:  


1. My partner of 5 years who I trust fully was changing the pillowcase. I closed my eyes for a moment and the pillow brushed against me. I jumped.
2. I was talking with my partner facing the other way while cooking. I knew he was close, but I still jumped when he gently touched my shoulder.
3. I was talking with my partner facing the other way while cooking. He made a step closer without me knowing. I turned to get some stuff and saw him there and jumped.
4. I was going back from the bathroom at my grandparent's house. My grandfather emerged from behind the corner. I jumped.
5. We've been talking about re-arranging the furniture for some time. He wanted to surprise me, but when I entered the room and there was a wardrobe right in front of me where I wasn't expecting it, again I jumped.
6. I was in a store. I saw the mannequin and knew I am walking past it. But when it got into my peripheral vision, my brain processed her as a sudden human appearing and bam! (this one is embarrassingly common. I avoid mannequins in stores and give shop windows some distance).
7. I walk into a store. The clerk emerges from the racks by my side.
8. I turn a corner. There's a beggar sitting there. I jump.
9. A friend was getting ready to fire a potato - gun musket. I heard it before and always screamed involuntarily at the sound. I saw him load it. I saw him aim it. I saw him fire it. I still jumped and screamed at the sound.
10. I was talking with my friend facing the other way. Unbeknownst to me, she moved from the chair to the sofa. I thought I'm going to have a heart attack when I looked behind me.

People say it's really excessive. They usually get startled my me getting startled and it's not a good situation all around. Why am I like this? How do I fix it? I really don't feel stressed or tense or anything like that."
444,struggling to do the little things,"my mental health is kinda shitty right now. i have so much i need to do, i have loads of washing and homework and my room needs cleaning. i always get lectured by my parents and i feel shit for not doing it because i know i need to. i just cannot physically convince myself to do it. i have around 6 hours worth of homework to do and i can’t bring myself to even sit at my desk or pull the chair forward. it’s so tiring and i feel so incompetent when the people around me are doing so well and seem so happy and i can’t even get my washing in the machine or make the bed in the morning. it’s so draining."
445,Feeling numb,Hello ive been dealing with this issue for almost 3 years now and its really keeping me from making new friends. i feel emotionally numb. i just don’t feel happiness when i achieve something and i dont feel sadness or anger. i have been diagnosed with ADHD and i used to be very spontanious and happy. can someone please help me out here i really don’t know how to be normal again.
446,DAE get chest pains from anxiety?,"Been feeling quite overwhelmed and my anxiety and intrusive thoughts are spiking lately. i’m also very easily irritated which spikes to me getting really angry and just wanting to break things or something idk it’s just a really quick rush of anger and it takes a lot of energy to remain calm and not act out by getting mad at others around me

(ex. if a friend annoys me i’ll get really mad and petty towards them, and i can’t calm down unless i get reassurance from someone or an apology)

it starts to interfere w my life. when i feel like this i just want to give up and lay in bed and not do anything with my day anymore. it’s like everything gets ruined and nothing even fucking matters. this all leads to mild but bothersome chest pains and i can’t control them"

IF MY MOM WOULDN'T HAVE FORGOTTEN HER PHONE THAT NIGHT I WOULD'VE DIED FROM BLOOD LOSS!!!!!! I WOULD'VE DISAPPEARED!!!!!WHY DID SHE FORGET HER PHONE. SHE HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING.

450,Anger issues,I am so angry all the time. Everything sets me off. Its affecting my relationship with my wife and I'm afraid it will affect my kids. I have always been angry. Never known a time when I haven't been. But its getting too much. I have no clue why and I don't have any idea on how to fix it. I need to be fixed. Now.
451,How do I loosen my attachment to people?,"I just want to do this healthily without hurting myself emotionally, I need to shift my expectations because I’m finding that I’m getting hurt frequently. I don’t feel as if I’m heard at all or if they’re putting any effort into listening. I want to talk to them often but get upset when they aren’t able to reciprocate the same effort and it makes me want to pull back so maybe they realise why I’m upset but when I bring it up it gets treated like it’s petty. Maybe I’m too attached. Maybe I need to find a hobby or something else, it’s been quarantine for a long time so maybe that’s why im so clingy and needy. How do I pre occupy myself? I have a complex attachment style due to relationships in early childhood. I don’t know what to do except numb myself emotionally."
452,Tried to cut myself the second I found out I would not be able to write my $250 IELTS exam,"I want to start off by saying, I am very sorry for sounding privileged. I fully recognize that a lot of people right now are struggling much more and maybe I sound like a spoiled brat who can't do anything right.

Basically, I graduated from uni this year and don't have a job yet so I'm sitting at home. I was hoping to work for a year and then pursue a Masters degree, because I wanted to pay at least a part of the tuition myself. I come from an economically decent family, and I am privileged to never have struggled for anything. My parents are very kind a supportive and the fact that I have everything makes me even more ashamed that I can't pull myself together.

Today I found out that my dad submitted my passport to the government agency for some procedure, but I needed it for my IELTS paper. So basically I couldn't sit for the test and $250 went down the drain. I feel so guilty. I didn't get into the undergrad university my parents wanted because I wasn't smart enough and didn't work hard enough. I struggled so much, and spent so much to get my drivers license and I'm still too scared to drive. I'm just always afraid of everything and never do anything. I've just gotten by in life because I'm one of those 'smart kids who become dumb as adults' lmao. I've never really struggled and shown initiative to accomplish anything. I am a failure and I feel so useless. I have such low self esteem, I can't write my SoP for grad school because I don't have a single good thing to say about myself.

Should I go to therapy or is this a bad couple of weeks I need to get over?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Low self esteem, can't get over my past failure of not getting into my dream uni and is constantly guilty for draining my parents money on my inabilities."

My aunt is moving out of our house ans we're all helping. I want to help,i dont want to let my family down and,well, i can't really anyway. Today,end of week,helping all evening till maybe midnight,then saturday too. I'll probably only have sunday for freetime,yet i have much work for school. I dont know what to do. Should i just manage my time carefully and hope for the best ?"
455,CAMHS isn’t helping at all,i don’t understand how doing the stuff they tell me will help. she first wants me to fill in a diary of my week and now the only thing they are saying is go outside more. i know from personal experience that that won’t help it just makes me feel worse and even more drained
456,I finally broke.,"I moved across the country to live with my boyfriend 2 years ago. I knew no one other than him. 
I met his neighboor who kind of became my best friend/older sister. We got super close. This year she decided to finally start the process of divorcing her abusive husband. I was there for every court hearing, lawyer meeting, and everytime she needed support.
For 3 months straight I let myself be triggered. Being there for her meant letting myself be reminded of my abusive ex. I felt like I was seeing him walking down the street, I started dreaming of him, I started thinking of that time of my life more. 
She didn't follow through with the divorce. She stopped talking to me as much. I brought it to her attention that I felt like she was only reaching out to me when she needed something or when he own mental health was suffering. She assured me that she didn't mean to and she was just super busy with life. 
I could see she was busy - busy posting on snapchat with other people, busy going out and enjoying life.
I was busy trying to pick back up the pieces from my pwn trauma after I left myself take care of someone else instead of taking care of myself.
Now I feel lonely. I feel depressed. I want a friend who will drop everything for me like I do for them. Because at the end of the day, I would still do it all over again, and I would still suffer alone for someone else's benefit."
457,"Sorry to be crass but are there ""nice"" inpatient facilities for those able to pay?","It's something I've thought about from time to time--I'm just kind of at the end of my rope trying to manage my life and mental health and the like (no thoughts of harm to self or others).  Amazingly the ""social"" part of my self is still thriving and I'm actually happy and pleasant to be around with other people, and I keep up with my hobbies, job, volunteer work, etc., but I'm just kind of dead inside.  It just feels like the bottom is about to crash out.  The idea of just giving up a week of my life, showing up to some building, and putting it into someone else's hands is increasingly appealing.

But I just hear so many horror stories of what it's like to present oneself to a ""mental health emergency room.""  The idea of being confined in a hospital setting with fluorescent lighting and cold medical professionals sounds like it'd almost be self-defeating.  But there has to be a way to ""pay your way out of the problem,"" right?

I actually described what I'm envisioning in another post on this sub that for whatever reason never got any replies.  I'm picturing like a big Victorian house upstate where you eat oatmeal for breakfast and go to group therapy and say the Serenity Prayer before retiring to a bunkbed for the night.  Ideally even somewhere that I'd still be allowed to exercise and go for bike rides (given my current state of mental health with daily two hour bike rides and other exercise hobbies, I simply can't imagine how bad it'd get without that).  I suppose I'm envisioning something similar to how halfway houses are portrayed on film and TV, except for mental health instead of ex-cons.

459,i'm stressed constantly and i dont know what to do,"this year has been such a shitshow and im really suffering mentally to the point where ive stopped caring about anything. whats the point in doing anything when in the grand scheme of things nothing matters? like playing videogames, i would usually enjoy but now its just like what does it matter? your just doing things that dont matter in a world that doesnt exist. cleaning my room and taking a shower ahd shit? why do that if you/its just gonna get dirty again. getting good grades? why do that, theyre just letters that tell you if your smart or dumb that dont even reflect a persons actual intelligence most of the time. on top of all this theres corona making people like me who cant learn in school without someone telling you stuff, the constant stream of homework that takes on average about 5 -6 hours total to complete, the expectation to get all As and B+s no exeptions, and not really time to actually relax at home.

469,Trying to help my brother.,"So my brother is 24 and I am 28, we grew up with a mom who didn’t really care much for us so our childhood wasn’t the greatest. I’ve grown to accept that life happens you can’t change the past but that is my own personal experience and growth. My brother on the other hand has his own personal demons.

He broke up with his long time girlfriend who he’s been seeing since middle school a year ago and in may of this year she metoo him and exposed some very graphic things such as him threatening to kill her and her family. It was pretty damning and he lost a lot of friends. It was a surprise to us family too because he was always cheerful, bubbly, funny and always wanted to help us so we had no clue it was an ongoing issue between him and his ex. There was a point when he was in high school where they did break up and he threaten to kill himself. His ex then informed me that he was threatening to kill himself and I intervene and told him it was not funny and that he shouldn’t do that. We had a family intervention with him and ever since then it seem like everything was fine. He and his ex got back together and there was no more suicide talk. We assume it was just a bad breakup. 

But ever since his ex metoo him he has been telling me he’s been having suicidal thoughts and tendency. He currently is helping my older sister at her farm down south and after discussing with her about it we agree that he should come back up and stay with me and I will get him into therapy.

The thing is is that when I talked to him he refused the help, says I can’t help him and even mention how long it took for someone to help him. I am really new to this and would like some help on how I can help him. I found some good places that help with this for people with no income. He has no job and no insurance and as soon as he gets up here we’re going to get him insurance. I have reassure him that he doesn’t have to do anything at my house just go to therapy. In the past years he has bounce from houses to houses with family members and I am pretty sure he feels like we are passing him around. I just really want to figure out how I can help him or reach to him better. Should I do family therapy with him as well? Should I ask about his therapies when he goes? What if he refuses help? What should I do?

477,I'm starting to think I had a toxic friend and was mentally abused.,"I'm currently 13. Really young, I know, but I really need to talk about this. I'm feeling kinda ridiculous on even writing this post to begin with, as probably my case is irrelevant because of my age, or i'm just being overdramatic. 

English is not my native language so there will be typos.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon when I was 6, there was this boy, I'll name him Dave for now (but that's not really his name). He was funny, had other friends and I wanted to join that friendship circle.

I need to clarify that Dave was... well, not the best person ever. I didn't notice that at the time. He lied about lots of stuff, and I believed most of them. There was a time he literally made me skip school for 2 days because of a lie. I was dumb. But I was around 6-10 at the time, so yea.

Things started to get complicated I *think* when I was 9-10 years old. I had a discussion with Dave and we were mad at each other. He started to make fun of me on that day, and literally said ""it's fun to laugh at you"". I felt like trash. We ended friendship, but as most kids do, we unfortunately 'became friends' again.

I've always been a crybaby, I can't remember, but I think I cried that day. And he probably also laughed at me because of it.

Later on, when I was like 11, one of Dave's friends, I'll name him Jon, cutted ties. Dave made me believe that Jon was wrong and was just a bad friend. I never talked to Jon to know the actual reason, I just believed what Dave told me. I'm not sure if that's manipulation, because it's natural for kids to believe people they trust, even if they're lying.

Before 2016, Dave told me one of his stupid lies, he said that ""after 2016 the world's going to end"", and I believed. Ridiculous, I know. Well, in 2018 I had to move out to another house and, therefore, another school. But before leaving I said to him ""Hey, you told me that after 2016 the world was going to end. We're in 2018 now."" and his answer? ""Yea, you believed it?"" He literally knew what he was doing. He made fun of me again and I didn't notice it...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the new school it was difficult to socialize with anyone. I was pretty much the weird quiet kid. Dave's behavior made me think everyone was like that. I thought that having friends was useless, 'because people are bad.' I discovered i'm an introvert, but that doesn't change a thing. Even as introvert I can talk to people. But I didn't know how to do that. Didn't wanted to. My parents even paid a therapist but she didn't help with anything in the end...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I've always been a crybaby, I can't remember, but I think I cried that day. And he probably also laughed at me because of it.

This year I discovered - Well, kind of, I hate self diagnosis, but there's lots of evidences - that I bottle up my emotions. If you don't know what that is, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7l5UQSKHRU) is really useful. Also, that video talks about 6 signs this problem creates, and I related to **all of them.** I also apparently lack self love.

My parents and siblings never liked highly emotional people or crying. This and people making fun of me for crying probably were the reason why I started bottling up my emotions so much. I wanted to hide them from others.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have lots of online friends and not a single ""real life"" one.  I find it easier to talk in text than phisically. When my parents are mad at me for something, I can't do anything but cry. Cry in a way that I almost can't breathe correctly. That only happens when I'm talking to them irl. I vent to my online friends a lot and don't feel a thing, and I find it easier to think.

I don't know how to talk to new people. Don't know what to say. They normally are the ones who come to befriend me, not the opposite. And even with that, I don't know if I really should call them 'friends.' I'm scared of the possibility that they may be exactly how Dave was.

&amp;#x200B;

I've watched videos about toxic people, toxic friends, emotional abuse... And even relating to some of them, I'm not sure.

I'm not sure if this was a case of manipulation/mental abuse/toxic friend.

I want to know. And I want to know what can I do to get rid of this fear..."

481,"Childhood trauma ruined my relationship, need advice on how to deal with it","When I (22M) was younger, my father had intense anger problems. He was no alcoholic or anything, he was just somebody who lost control whenever he was angry. We also live in a SEA country where it is socially acceptable to beat your children, and getting a B or lower usually resulted in being caned till I was black and blue. I remembered for an English exam I got a 79(1 mark lower than an A) and my mother slammed my head into a wall. The worst experience however, was when my mom and dad were arguing in their room at night. To this day, I still have no idea what they were arguing about, but what happened was that my father stormed into our room, dragged me and my brother into their bedroom and threatened to kill us in front of our mother. The next morning he apologized and admitted that he had a problem and to this day he has never lost his temper or touched us again. The only time I've ever seen him angry after that day was when my sisters husband beat her.

Naturally, I developed a sort of phobia with people getting mad at me. As a child, the only thing I could do was absolutely nothing and hope they calm down, and this behaviour carried on all the way to the present. This year I just had my first serious relationship, and it had its up and downs. However, it just ended and part of it has to do with how my trauma shaped my behaviour. Whenever my girlfriend got mad at me or annoyed, I would basically shut down. I wouldn't answer calls or respond to texts, honestly speaking I kinda just sat there and just stare at the walls. When she got mad during our calls, I would say nothing and not do anything for literally almost an hour, and she would get even more angry about me not saying anything. I know rationally I should try to comfort her or try to clear up the misundestandings that lead to the argument, but I just couldn't. I felt literally paralyzed and not able to do anything. When people are mad at me, I do nothing and hope they calm down soon. Obviously, this is going to pose a problem for whatever relationships I have next, so I need to learn to force myself to change. I dont want my past to dictate my future anymore and I dont want another relationship to end due to my shitty childhood. I have no idea how to start doing it though, the obvious answer would be to just force myself to act, but I would like to ask if anybody had any mental tips and tricks they use to move past trauma?"

485,Removing the Sunglasses of Transference,"I got Lasik surgery when I was in my mid 20’s and it was a game changer. Although the operation itself was pretty scary, I’m glad I did it. Life was a lot easier without waking up blind every morning. It’s also nice to not stress about losing my vision randomly when I’m working out.

But one of my favorite things life without glasses is that I’m finally able to wear sunglasses. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do because I think it’s cool. Plus it helps to avoid the glare from other cars when I’m driving.

One day while I was getting out of my car, I got a text and looked down at my iPhone. I thought my phone was broken because the screen was really dark and I could barely see anything. It looked the same even when I adjusted the screen’s brightness in the phone settings. I was getting pretty upset because the phone was fairly new but then I took my sunglasses off and slapped myself in the forehead.

The screen looked dark because I was wearing polarized sunglasses!

In other words, my phone wasn’t broken. It just looked that because of my sunglasses.

Something similar can happen when we listen to others. Last week, we talked about the [different principles to listening well](https://heem.substack.com/p/dont-fix-peoples-problems-listen). Today, we’re going to cover how our bias, our world view, and our [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and) can be like our sunglasses. They can distort what we’re looking at and trick us into thinking something is wrong.

# Transference as Our Sunglasses

Transference is a term I learned when I was pursuing an M.A. in Counseling at Cal State Fullerton. It describes what happens when a client “transfers” emotions from a previous experience or relationship onto the therapist. For example, let’s say a female teenage client who has had a history of abusive relationships with older men goes into therapy. Now because her therapist is a male and in his 60’s, she has a hard time trusting him. In fact, sometimes she yells at him in the middle of the session as if he was one of her past abusers.

Now the same thing can happen from the therapist’s perspective but is called counter transference. This is when a therapist “transfers” emotions from their own past onto the client. This can be quite damaging because the therapist may be responding to or attempting to assist the client in an area that they aren’t even struggling with.

When we listen to others, we must be careful not to do the same thing. We must take care not to transfer any emotions or past experience onto the person sharing. If we do, then we’re not really listening. Instead, the sunglasses of transference are distorting our view of reality and could potentially make us think something is wrong when everything is fine.

This is why it’s so important for us to pay down our [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and). It’s also why we should avoid fixing comments. When someone shares a painful experience, it’s a sign of trust. They’re being vulnerable and so you have a certain amount of power to speak into their lives. This is a big responsibility.

What if you give advice and they take it and their life gets worse? Does that make you responsible? What if your advice isn’t even addressing the underlying issue because your vision was distorted by counter transference? We must first hear and see the person as they are before we can even begin to think about helping them.

# Transference in Relationships

Transference doesn’t just occur in the context of therapy or listening. It can impact our relationships in our everyday lives as well.

In my freshman year of college, I met a group of friends through a Christian fellowship. I met a lot of great people there but unfortunately, there was one person I didn’t get along with.

Now for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why. I never said or did anything to offend them. I barely even communicated with them! But from the very beginning of that relationship, I noticed that we were getting into very combative relationship patterns.

A couple years later, we had a heart-to-heart. Eventually that person told me that they didn’t like me “just because they knew we wouldn’t get along.” In other words based on past experiences, I looked like a person that they felt like they wouldn’t like. That’s why the starting point of our relationships was conflict.

# Remove Transference By Dealing With Emotional Debt

Now transference isn’t always bad. For example, clients can have profound experiences with their therapists as they rebalance and restore past wounds using it. But transference also has a tendency to “leak” into relationships by interpreting innocent actions as malicious and creating unintended conflicts.

Once we [pay down Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-pay-down-emotional-debt), it becomes a lot easier to have healthier relationships. Why? Because we fight less and see things more clearly.

So the next time you feel “triggered” by what someone does, take a moment and check in with yourself. Did the person really mean to hurt you? Or are you simply “transferring” an emotion from a past experience? If it’s the later, take off your sunglasses, let it go, and explore the [Emotion Iceberg](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg) when you can.

# Discussion Questions

1. When was the last time you misinterpreted someone’s actions? What happened? Was it simply a misunderstanding or was it an example of transference?
2. Think back to the last few conflicts you had with others. Do you notice a theme? If so, what could be causing the same conflict to occur over and over again? Spend some time exploring the Emotion Iceberg to narrow down what could be going on."
486,Can abandonment issues and commitment issues be dealt with together?,"Basically the title. Also, sorry because idk if this is the right place for this question. 

So, I know that I have abandonment issues. I know that I have commitment issues. As soon as my bf of 6 months brings up the future, I freak out. Everytime he asks me if I’m not happy and if I’m not sure about our relationship, I freak out. It’s like- I don’t want to plan the whole future together, but I don’t want to be confronted about it either. I know for a fact that we won’t last(we’re very different, but I love him) but I don’t want to break up with him right now (had a panic attack the time he brought it up, cuz he thought I wasn’t happy) but I don’t want to be tied down either,(idk if that makes sense). 
I mean, I don’t want to cheat on him and I don’t want to be with any other guy; but the first time my bf said I love you, I had an anxiety attack. And every time he brings up any talk about the future, I’m just like- bro, chill. 

Basically, I don’t know how to sort my feelings out. I can’t understand what to feel and how to approach my issues. I don’t want him to leave me, I don’t wanna leave him, and I don’t wanna plan the future with him either. Idk what to do!

What’s wrong with me? Any and all advice is appreciated."
487,I feel lost,"Hi!

To give a little backstory: I'm a recently turned 18 year old student, I live in the UK, originally from Portugal. I moved to the UK in february.

Obviously, with all that's going on, most of the time I've spent here I was in quarantine and I didn't even meet anyone because, firstly, my sole purpose was to retake some GCSE(s) \[was in the class of 2003\], because I was doing A-Levels in Portugal and was not enjoying it at all, needed slightly higher grades to enter a good sixth form here in london and although I achieved my grades, I've opted to do a BTEC instead (I am enjoying it way more than A-Levels). I've met a couple people, but I still don't have any sort of connection like I do back home in Portugal. Back home I used to be very sociable and get along very quickly..., but here in the UK i'm not managing to do so here and I imagine i'm not the only one. I would really like to meet some new people here and establish some friendships because I feel pretty down, but I don't know how to or how to go on about doing so anymore, usually I'd get introduced and then it would be a continuous chain.

Secondly, I feel like I'm behind? I know everyone goes through life at their own pace but in my head knowing that my friends back home are all graduating and going to university next year is really hitting my head. Especially when the risk I took leaving home to do something and achieve it and scrap everything you've done to do another course when you could have done the course last year and be on track anyways. Also makes me question if coming to the UK was a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you &amp; sorry if this post doesn't make sense. hopefully someone can relate or even help :D"
488,Its all collapsing,"Ive made a few posts here on my main reddit account u/samueldoesnotexist, but they dont tell the full 

story. Some dumbass in my family who knows my reddit account found those posts and told my 

parents. They didnt read the posts and they dont know how to go onto my reddit account and see 

what Im doing. They decided to take me to a therapist. I dont feel comftrable around people, let alone 

talking to them. Sometimes hearing a person speak makes me feel uneasy.  The only reason I feel 

comftrable online is because Im anonymous and Im not talking to actual people. Summer was ok, I 

have a weird nostalgia feeling everytime I think about my life a few months ago up to a few years ago. 

My life felt better before. I still remember being 6 years old, and those memories make me feel like 

crying. I havent felt genuinely happy for a few months and I havent slept normally for 4 months. 

It started out ok, I stayed awake until 7AM and then passed out for a few hours. I sept that way until 

school started. I started sleeping less when school started. One night I slept only 2 hours, and now I 

sleep even worse. Along with that, my grades are getting worse, Memories of when I was actually in 

school are coming back, and they are not good ones. I feel worse in general, and now Ive had urges to 

hurt myself, and in one case, kill myself. Ive lost interest in things I used to like, Like Minecraft and 

games in general. I feel like someone is forcing me to do everything I do. Im also starting to feel 

physical pain. My back is starting to hurt and im getting more headaches. Along with that, Walking is 

getting difficult. If I sit down or lay down for any amount of time, Its hard for me to keep my balance 

when I get up. Sometimes my vision become blurry along with me feeling weak. Sometimes 

my head feels too heavy for my body. Im not sure if this is a sign of something, but one time I just 

went to the corner of the empty room my grandma has in her apartment ( It used to be my great 

grandma's but then she died, then people rented the room but now theyre not there ) And I just stood 

there for a few minutes. My life feels like its flying by, I still remember being 6 like it was yesterday. 

Now Im a different person, one whos life is collapsing at just 13. I already feel like Ive been through 

hell ( 5th and 6th grade were terrible ) but I know the worst is still ahead of me. My life feels like its 

flying fast, Next thing I know Ill be a lonely person in high school and the bullying will be a lot worse. 

and then Ill be 18. I dont have any hope for myself in the future. Also, I dont trust anyone irl. School 

thought me that you cant trust anyone, not even your parents. Another thing I do Is watch old stuff I 

remember watching when I was younger. Most of it is stuff about thomas the tank engine. Just 

thinking about it makes me want to cry. Nostalgia is a burden too me, I cant seem to let go of the past, 

even If I really want to. Time confuses me.  I try to think of good memories, but the bad ones always 

take over my thoughts. The only reason Im posting this on my second account is so that my parents 

dont find out. My biggest fear is that my classmates find out about my reddit account.  they will mock 

me relentlessly for this. I just want the stress to go away, but It always comes back worse, I think there 

is no escape from this hell."

Keto is so great to counteract weight gain from meds as meds effect H1 and HT2c receptor which increase appetite and carb/sugar cravings. But my anxiety gets super bad at day 3 and doesnt get better through this so called ""keto flu"" because Ive made to 2+ weeks.

girls really like me.

Even when I desperately want it, even when the other person does too. They never text or call me after going out with me once. And I cannot bring myself to text them first because I fear coming off as clingy.  I am always so scared of initiating conversations, eye contact, meetings, chats. I'm so scared of showing any interest like it makes me look like a monster.

I spend a lot of time with only 2 close friends. It's always so easy. No need to worry about how am I  behaving, what kind of jokes I'm making, stuttering. I wish it was so easy with everyone. There are so many wonderful people around me and I cannot even ask them for their name. 

The worst part is probably the realization that it's all my fault. I chose to be a quiet kid, silent, passive. 

I chose to not care. But I do care. So deeply it crushes me inside. It seems like a prison I can never escape. Seeing myself fucking up my own life constantly. I have no idea what to do with myself because I've lost all hope - that's why I'm here. Thanks for reading."
493,I don't know anymore (15NB),"School just stresses me out and I feel so low and I want cry all the time and today before school started my friend told me that I'm less likely to not go to other friends house for Halloween (to make it worse weve been planning on what to do for halloween for weeks now and one friend said theyll buy us sweets)because he's only allowed 4 people over and ""I'll kill the party"". This year I've actually managed to make friends and hang out with people since most of last year I spent lunch and break in my guidance teacher's classroom and being told this just makes me feel worse since I don't do well socially and tend to rant on about I really like like horror or the band Ice Nine Kills who do songs on horror movies. The friend told me before that it just goes in one ear and out the other and I just feel ignored and that the only way to talk to people is by showing them memes. Even my best friend who feels like a younger sibling to me(we were born like 6 months apart) agreed with friend and he's told me he doesn't care about horror movies and he constantly talks about anime and gay hentai (I really don't know and I'm not into anime ). If I'm quiet they ask if I'm ok and if I talk I feel ignored. After school today I told my guidance teacher and he said that they probably didn't think about what they said to me And he'll will talk to friend on monday and now it's going to be 2 days of paranoia cause I don't want to lose my friends. It doesn't help that I'm in my first year of being a senior and we have to do alot of tests incase the exams don't go on and I feel pressured alot of the time from everyone. I feel like I just want to kill some one and cry at the same time"

496,What type of therapy/therapist should I seek?,"Without further ado, I'll just list my 'crazies' and I'd like to know if there's a specific therapy which best deals with these. (No medication.) I've never been to a therapist and I'd like to get some pointers from people who have experience with the same issues. Thank you. :)  


Pure O / Obsessive, involuntary, negative thinking  
Depression  
Social anxiety  
Possibly face dysmorphia.  


Also general insecurity, PMDD (this is more of a hormone based issue, but basically it flares the other things in the list even more, during PMS). I just want all this crap to stop, really. :/"
497,I think I relapsed (on accident),"(22F) i used to self harm, last time i did i was 18. today in the shower i was shaving my legs and i accidentally cut myself really bad. i don’t know why but the second i felt the blade cut through my skin i started crying and panicking. i think i had a panic attack (which i don’t usually experience) it was scary. i’m still shaking even though it’s been a couple of hours. i’m not sure how to process this or move on. i feel sad and scared. i’m scared of being consumed within this, i don’t want to be a victim of my past demons."
498,Personal persistence 💪😍🤘🏻,"Live with persistence, for no time nor distance can determine how far you can go, an intense pleasure to storm through every form or  sense of weather, lifting the universe up, you’re the wind, and life is a feather."
499,You have a great body - why not spend some time in it?,"Take some time to breathe, notice what's going on in your body and bring yourself back to the present moment.

A great way to reduce stress is to focus your awareness on what you can physically feel - from tingling in your toes to tension in your brow. Scanning internally returns your consciousness to the present moment, letting go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past. Feeling gratitude for the functions that different parts of our body provide also helps to improve our wellbeing - evidence shows that gratitude is a key trait of happy people.

500,I’m tired,"I’m so tired of the bull shit, the gas lighting, the lies. 
I’m tired of being told I’m not enough, I’m tired of being treated as lesser than, and I’m tired of being told I have a big ego for advocating for myself. fuck that. 

I am growing and that means I am enough. 

if they can’t meet you where you are, let them go. protect your mental health at all costs."
501,"When a friend is feeling down, what can I do or say? No honestly, what do I do when I literally have no encouraging words to say?","Frankly, I don't have any words to say. Because words won't help and I don't know what to do. My friend is having a friendship crisis and I don't know how to help and it's really causing her so much grief. There's nothing I can say to make it better, so what do I do? How do I help? Does anyone have personal experience?"
502,SSRI Taper and Stimulants?,"Hey all, looking for advice on this situation plaguing my existence the last 2 years. I acknowledge most of you are not MDs, but any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Saw a psych in 2015, got thrown on Klonopin and Zoloft, then 2016 thrown on stimulants. 2018 that psych bails and I get a new one when depressive/anxiety/cognitve issues arise. She questioned whether I actually had adhd, and forced me to get off Klonopin and Dexedrine too quick resulting in a nasty 6 month hermit-like existence in withdrawal. I haven't fully recovered tbh...low key ptsd. After somewhat getting better post-klonopin withdrawal I decided I'd like to divorce my wellbeing from psychiatry and make my way off the zoloft too. At that point I was already at 200mg in April 2019 so I began a slow taper. In July 2019 I got tired of the ADHD symptoms I was still struggling with and got a script from my GP for ER Dexedrine, then later switched to IR.

I've been tapering off Zoloft for about a year and a half now. From 200-&gt;175-&gt;150-&gt;125-&gt;100mg from April to September 2019 was actually pretty easy. From 100-&gt;75-&gt;50 was awful during the fall, then from 50-&gt;37.5-&gt;25mg was just as awful through the winter. I seemed to 'stabilize' and the mood swings would lessen after a few weeks and I'd get used to it. 

However the last 6 months I've held steady at 25mg as I've been nervous about going further. Ugly mood swings, executive dysfunction, memory issues, worsening depression (as expected) haven't ""stabilized"" this time, and I've been dealing with it since corona began (Feb-March). I have many not so bad days, but then when it gets bad it's like my brain can't function. 

I've concurrently been dosing dexedrine 3-4 times a week and about 70% of the time it works fantastically. Often with a day or two in between doses to keep the tolerance low, at 5mg two to three times through the day. Keeps my mood stable on dosing days, and has helped me keep a (albeit low paying) IT-related job without getting too depressed. However I do still have those intense low days, and they haven't gotten any easier. When I stop dexedrine (I took a 2 month break in the winter of 2019-2020) I go into a long period of dysphoric mood swings that I seem less in control of. Granted as I type this maybe that was the SSRI withdrawal really kicking in...

Anyway I'm curious to hear if you all think the dexedrine may actually be causing the executive dysfunction issues, the memory issues, or the intensified mood swings. Is it okay for me to continue on it while I finish the zoloft taper (going to liquid taper from 25-0 over a few months). Could the slight serotonergic interaction screw with my taper?"
503,"26 years old man, with autism, can't leave the house alone and I can't take it anymore","I've been house bound due to my mental health since I was 22. I physically can't leave the house, even just to walk to the end of the drive. 

I've gained over 100lbs in this time. Which not makes my anxiety and depression worse. 

I took to binge drinking. Drinking an average of 8 ponts of ale a night. 
I haven't drank alcohol in about 3 weeks. 

But I see no options anymore. Everything that gets suggested to me requires me to leave the house and I can't do it. It's getting to much"
504,"Anxiety and adhd are messing me up. (This is long, i’m sorry)","today i was at school and i got anxious for no reason and i started shaking badly and the teacher commented on my pen shaking (i was holding it at the time) and i was like trying not to like..cry infront of everyone. 

I am constantly worrying about everything basically. I shouldn’t really say this but my dad. He was abusive and he is out of my life now and has been for the better part of 4 years. He made this anxiety. It’s breaking me. I didn’t speak out and i tried to hide it. I am known for being a “people pleaser” meaning basically i go with whatever someone else wants and not what i want and i literally cannot be assertive because i’m scared of yes or no being a wrong answer. 

I have moderate to severe adhd also and it kinda like adds on top of anxiety and makes it worse because like in school and stuff i get completely side tracked / distracted and the teacher says “2 minutes left” or something i get super anxious and don’t know what to do. 

I come home and cry alot / cry quite a bit in general but it’s because i try and hide it. One of my biggest fears is being judged or laughed at or being towered upon. If someone makes a joke at school say about me? I take it in and it effects me and it can take upto weeks for me to forget and just drags me down. 

I’m scared of telling people if i can talk to them like in person and stuff and i’m scared of saying all of this to people i know. I have almost broke down many times in school but forced myself not to because i’m just scared of everything. 

I have been crying alot tonight because of school and stuff. Like i just get moments where i think of something that i messes up on and it just completely messes me up. Even if it’s small. 

If someone tells me to calm down, i physically cannot thanks to adhd, or if they tell me to breath, i try to but it’s just all too much at once. My mind is constantly racing and i just can’t take it and i just break down. 

One of my friends said “oh it doesn’t even exist, it’s not real” (reffering to anxiety) and it literally made me just fkn cry. Like when i got home i just burst into tears because i started having thoughts if it’s really not real and if i just am *fucking up at life. 

I cannot take this anymore. 


I’m really sorry if this was like too long or something i just really needed to get this off my chest so i can stop crying for the moment."
505,Upcoming Winter Movement Idea,"Hi, I had an idea and wanted to see if folkx knew of something like it or had any thoughts on it.

Social stigma around mental health and mental illness is obviously a problem.  In an effort to normalize low mental health (since its often invisible) or being open about seeking therapy.  What if this Winter on social media platforms like Facebook there was a “sticker” or filter one could choose to add to mark that they too use counseling or deal with mental health issues?

Similar to pre-existing FB profile picture filters, like “I stand with X group”.  The “It’s Dangerous to Go it Alone” organization’s logo could even just a subtle symbol in the corner or a border.

What are people’s thoughts on this?

Some other ideas too could be an extra marker if your SafeTalk trained (or some other certification of a MH firstaid responder)."
506,I don’t know if I’m depressed or just dramatic,"For the past four years I’ve been sad. Not just sad, but a constant reminder everyday in my head that I’m worthless and not good enough. There’s a voice in my head constantly telling me that I should just die, it wouldn’t matter, no one cares anyways.

I’ve taken multiple depression screenings online, not some buzfeed nonsense but a sort of test to see if you should see a mental health professional. Every time I take the quiz I get between Moderate to Severe Depression. But really, just because they list a bunch of peoples name with doctor in front of it doesn’t mean I should trust it, so I don’t think this counts.

I’ve cut myself but I don’t think that counts either because its not with a blade or anything, just my shaver that I run across my arm  a couple times. I don’t do it to die I just feel like I deserve it sometimes.

Recently I’ve gone back to school and my parents forced me, against my cries that it would be bad for me, to do school fully online. My school offered the option of going hybrid or fully online. Now, I can’t barely sleep, I think I might have almost passed out from hunger, and I barely eat anymore. (Hence why I think I almost passed out; I got a headache and everytime I moved my head or took a step I’d feel I was about to pass out.) 

The thoughts about just dying have become more frequent, yet something about this doesn’t feel like depression. I think I might be exaggerating how I feel or something, but depression doesn’t seem to likely for me, but I do have to wonder.

Sorry for the bad formatting I’m on mobile. Ignore the weird grammar and sentence formatting, I’m done trying."

508,"Everyone, things get better.","I've battled depression and bipolar disorder my whole life.  Recently (3 weeks ago) my girlfriend took off from our apartment without notice and just left me.  I was devastated and sure enough, our old friend depression started creeping back in to my life.  I tried to commit suicide a couple years ago and after that I committed to bettering my mental health.  The things I learned about myself then and the things I learned about how to deal with depression are proving to be invaluable right now.  I'm not going to lie, I'm obviously sad about the whole situation.  But to be honest, I am okay.  A few years ago there was no way I would have been mentally strong enough to handle this.  I used to want to commit suicide over everything.  But now I can actually feel my growth.  Things dont change unless you work really hard for them to.  I just want anyone that's struggling right now and wants to give up or feels like they arent getting anywhere to know that things will get better.  Now they don't magically get better but if you are putting in work now (like therapy or practicing good mental health habits) I promise one day it will pay off.  Just keep fighting y'all."

510,"Why is money so important to me, I just want to get on and live my life.","Ever since I was young, I always looked up to wealthy and 'successful' people. I am extremely competitive by nature. I always got top grades at school, but always doubted myself. I'm now 25, and a master's student in computer science. However, in the UK, software engineers aren't rich, and I cannot stop thinking about other people my age who are already earning and climbing the ladder. I see nice cars around town, and just stare at them. I hear of friends starting on crazy salaries in law. I actually was in medical school once because I knew I'd make decent money, but I dropped out because I hated it. I decided to follow my passion of computer science, and hope that I would find money in the future. This money is not guaranteed, and (based on average salaries) is unlikely to come to me through basic salary alone. But... I am sick to death of constantly thinking about money. My family are not poor, and I've always had whatever I wanted, but I seek more. I just want to be happy with making enough to get by, and focus on actually living my life. I seem to base my self-worth on how much money I (will) have. I clearly care too much about what others think about me, I always have done and I am aware of it. It's weird because I feel inferior to people with more money than I do. But I also don't look down on other people. Some of my friends don't have much money at all, but seem to be happy and content...I want to be content with what I have too. How can I get out of this mindset?"
511,Not meant to be alive,"It’s one of the few things i feel pretty confident about. I’m not meant to be alive. At least not like this. I just don’t care enough. I make stupid mistakes cause i don’t care to be careful and i have no motivations to live a decent life or a long one nonetheless.  I don’t even wanna fall in love. 

I just moved into my dorm for my freshman year and I’m not doing too good. I’m hardly eating maybe &lt;1000 calories a day yesterday i had like 650-700 calories maybe. I’ve lost some weight which you can tell on my face even though I’m pretty in shape (or was). I used to work out everyday not j sit at my desk all day doing work or at least trying to. I’ve been getting &lt;5 hours of sleep a day and i have no friends. 

Everything just feels like it’s bringing me down and I’m just tired. I don’t really wanna do this i don’t care enough. I’m not gonna off myself cause I’m aware enough to know it’s dumb but i just don’t wanna do this."
512,I feel so alone,"I'm 24 m and recently I've just been feeling so alone. I don't really have anyone I can talk to, my fronds never want to meet up and my family is crazy religious and will just tell me to pray or something.

I just feel like I have no one I can talk to and it's been causing me to think of suicidal thoughts.

514,"Bad meeting with a therapist, regretting getting ""help""","I've been wondering if I'm bipolar 2 for about a year or so. I've had strong depressive episodes and other episodes that feel like hypomania to me, but I'm not trying to self-diagnose. I've been wanting to  go to a psychiatrist for months, but my anxiety has kept me from it. 

So I finally got the courage, and today I had my first appointment, and it was a disaster. First of all, it wasn't even with a psychiatrist, but with a therapist, something I didn't find out until about 30 minutes in. The therapist was not at all what I was looking for. I specifically wanted to talk to a psychiatrist because they are medical doctors, and this guy kept saying stuff like ""this seems to work, I don't know why"" and ""well I'm not a doctor, so I really have to idea"". It was a disaster. He said that depression and anxiety only exist because of repressed emotions, and that the only reason humans evolved to feel anger is to fight off rapists, and because men don't face a lot of rape they should never be angry. I sat in there in total shock and disappointment. He talked on and on about how I needed to find what emotion I'm hiding that's causing my depression, and basically to ignore my ""hypomanic"" episodes because bipolar is a physical ailment, and it would just go away. He told me I needed to exercise and socialize more because that would help (I don't know how, but it seems to help! he says to me). 

I finally blew up at him and told him that even if that did help, that if he had the magic cure for me, that when I get depressed I don't care about myself enough to actually do anything to help. I told him I did all that, I ate healthy and exercised and meditated and yoga, and it would last a few days to weeks before I got depressed again and couldn't function.  He finally admitted that he thought I needed medication and that my depression and anxiety sounded bad, and that he couldn't diagnose me but he thought my hypomanic episodes, while not lasting long, were detrimental enough to be bipolar. He said he thought I should talk to a psychiatrist and I was like YEAH, NO SHIT! THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO. And then he tried to get me to schedule another session with him. I told him I'd be in touch, but I will never talk to this quack again. All this for $200. I feel legit robbed. 

I know this is a lot, but the basic question is this: This was such a disaster, from trying to schedule a meeting with a psychiatrist and getting a therapist, to the whole hour with this guy, that I really regret ever signing up to see someone. The whole week my anxiety was off the charts, I don't want to go through with this again. Is it worth it? Seeing a doctor and being actually diagnosed? Has your life improved afterwards? I've been so worried about an official diagnoses, and now I think I'd rather live in limbo instead... Advice? Helpful words of encouragement? 

I feel so disappointed and cheated. I was so worried about getting help, faced such anxiety all week leading up to it, and now I regret ever calling in."

School is so much stress and I can’t handle the amount of work I’ve been given. To make school worse I keep getting misgendered and deadnamed by my friends even after I correct them and ask them to use my preferred pronouns and name, it’s making me feel worse about myself and I feel guilty for constantly correcting them or ranting to my friends about shit they don’t care about. My mother is more concerned about my sister and her university life while making me feel bad for letting my mental health take over. Even listening to music is draining and I can’t concentrate on homework.

522,My husband has been hospitalized after a psychotic break,"Just hoping for some reassurance and/or advice. His sister and I took him to the ER on Monday, he was put on a 72-hour hold and transported to an evaluation and treatment facility on Tuesday night. I haven’t heard much since then because he hasn’t signed the release of information - not too surprising since In the hospital he was terrified of all tests, meds, even the water - he would only agree to drink the pre-packaged apple juice. I wouldn’t be surprised if he is scared to sign anything. 

Someone called me to ask some background questions yesterday, in preparation for a hearing to determine whether he needs to be held another 14 days. I was able to find out that he’s still confused, experiencing disorganized speech and constant free-associating. This may be drug-induced, but he also has a diagnosis dissociative identity disorder from a therapist he’s been seeing for a while. Every time I reach out to the facility where he’s staying, I get someone new on the phone, and they are all in such a rush that I have no idea how to advocate for him or whether they’re taking down any information.

I’m shocked and scared by how long this is lasting. If anyone can offer any comforting words or anecdotes that would be greatly appreciated. I know eventually someone will contact me, but I’m really overwhelmed with anxiety."

I called the police for help and they said they couldn’t and that I could better contact a mental health coach or therapist, someone who can help him control his emotions.

527,A Reminder: Don’t Suffer Alone,"Hello everyone. 

You’re struggling. You’re suffering. You’re on the edge. You need someone. 

**WE** are here for you, no matter what. 

Don’t suffer alone. That’s when small problems become big problems. That’s when overthinking turns into tragedy. 

We are only a message away. Look out for someone who is offering some support, including myself. Have a chat, get everything off your chest and make a brand new friend out of it. 

You are not alone. There is a shoulder here for you to cry on.

528,"Can someone help me please? I’m 23F, agoraphobic since 16, AVPD and have no support or ways to improve my life","I wanted to self harm again (I did for the first time properly 2 months ago and burnt myself so badly it is still healing). 

All my psychiatrist said weeks ago when I said outloud that I wanted to was “call a helpline or go to the hospital if you do”, said I can’t go to therapy for 8 months (I’m on NHS and too poor and scared for private treatment). Which hardly matters as I have tried therapy multiple times and it hasn’t helped me. I tried texting a helpline and the person said to try to use an app and that’s all they could do.

My life for 7 years has been near daily verbal attacks from my mother which has broken me down so much. I have a few friends online and a ‘relationship’ (where he lies nonstop and hurts me) but struggle to even talk to them most of the time because I am so scared and insecure. I never mention my issues as I feel draining and selfish.

I cannot go to university or get a job. I cannot mentally handle even walking down the street. I have nothing in my life and no ways to get better. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have so much despair I cry for hours and hours everyday and cannot even bare to have my mother look at me as I feel so ugly and worthless which is the main reason why I find it so hard to go outside. 

If anyone has any kind of advice of what I could do to help please give it to me because I feel like I am at my breaking point. I know I will never have any type of love or care from anybody and never have had it irl. I will never be able to have a job. I feel like I don’t have options outside of self harming to try and stop the pain or ending this already."

530,anxiety hangover like never before. i don’t feel in control of my actions or words.,"last night i had an attack after seeing my ex in public. we had a toxic relationship and stuff. may be some unresolved trauma or something but i don’t know. but seeing him gave me a breakdown. i got home and everything looked familiar to my home, but it looked like i wasn’t in the right place. dizzy and nauseous. i went to sleep. i woke up. i feel like a zombie rn. like i can’t control my body and that somebody else is controlling it for me. the words i say don’t feel like my words. i’m so scared and i’m even having trouble reading and writing. feels like every muscle in my body is rotting away and causing me immense pain. what am i going through? what is happening to me?"
531,Finally made the call,"I finally called to get support from my university. I made my first appointment for a mental health screening for possible psychiatric care. I've been wanting to make this call for a little over a year, and now I've finally done it. I feel excited, but more nervous and scared. I don't know what to expect and what I'm gonna find out. I've just been feeling so tired lately, lots have been going on, and I feel excited knowing I will be speaking to a professional soon. My appointment isn't for another 2 ish weeks, I hope I don't bail by then. I'm still scared and I feel stupid for being scared."
532,Idk what to do,"Idk what I’m hoping to gain from posting this but I’m having mixed episodes and when I’m down I’m really down. I don’t care about anything. I can barely move or talk. I’m scared. I’m angry. If I wasn’t alone at home with my son I would for sure be making an attempt. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not being a good mother, friend, sister, employee. I don’t have anyone I can call. I don’t have anywhere to go and since I’ve been working from home my house feels like a prison. I’m going to lose my job soon but in the meantime I’m being bullied and humiliated on a daily basis. I just want it to end. 

I spoke to a psychiatrist yesterday and she prescribed me lamictal and seroquel and I haven’t picked it up yet. I’m afraid I’ll end up taking them all and I’ll either die and my son will find me or I’ll survive and have to live with the fact that I failed again and I still have to do life. 

Why does every moment of my life have to feel like a battle? Why couldn’t I be like everyone else? 

Im tired of struggling through everything. I’m tired of being alone. I’m tired of being tired. My son deserves better. I deserve better."
533,Venting tw: cussing,"I’m a freshman in HS and also I live in the USA (Texas )for background info. 


This is all over the place but: 
I’ve always have gotten bored easily. Now it’s been 6 almost 7 (holy shit) months of not being able to focus. I feel like my attention span is gone. I’m failing band. I also want to get the work done but I don’t want to get criticized for it and then I start to cry (has happened a lot before). Once I got frustrated and my private lessons teacher pointed it out and I started to cry. I have always rushed through things. Like ***always***. I have remembered rushing on things in the past. My room is a shitshow and has been that way forever. Sometimes I can’t keep it clean. I forget a lot of things. Also when I end up having to do chores I always get distracted and looking at something else. The methods I used to use don’t work anymore. I used to listen to music. I’m now getting bored of music too. The music has stopped making me focus. I always start hw way too late and then I turn it in late. My mom thinks I’m lazy and that’s why I have lower grades than normal when really I truly can’t focus. Like subconsciously I end up on something else. It has to be something really interesting for me to pay attention and even then I remember bits and pieces of it."
534,Anger/hatred in me,"I’ve come to realize that I have a lot of anger/hatred in me. I can actually feel the toxicity inside of me. I know I’ve always carried some sort or resentment and hatred in me but this is just way beyond of what I used to have. I feel that this started after ending a two year relationship. It’s really tiring me now that I’m in midterms, working an overnight job, dealing with children in college, family issues, being a minority in a almost all white institution, and being extremely behind in classes. Everything is just building up that I just want to cry and yell at everyone and push a wall or something. Sometimes I’m angry at myself and I absolutely just ask myself why do I put myself in situations like this. If I keep feeling like this, I feel that it’ll just lead to worse situations. I don’t want to feel like this anymore... I’m scared for my close ones... I’m scared for me"
535,How do I stop idolizing perfect physical fitness and start loving my own body for what it is?,"For my entire life I've never been happy with my body. Don't get me wrong, I love parts of it - my eyes, my hair; but when it came to other parts (especially weight), I've always put myself down and seen them as inherently bad or undesirable, even if I know logically that those ideas were unfounded or exaggerated or just plain false. I'm young, fairly healthy and in decent shape, eat well and exercise when I can, but for some reason I always just compare my body to Oblivion and feel like shit for it. I think it's part of why I've had terrible mental health issues for so long. How do I stop this? How do I learn to love myself?"
536,My love/hate relationship with solitude,"I’m a 21 year old that’s just graduated university. I work in a bar (Wetherspoons for those of you from the UK) and it’s something that for most people, would be more or less fine. I’m physically healthy, although not perfect, but good nonetheless. Due to the nature of my work and personality, I’m grown to become a naturally helpful and genuinely curious person. 

However, since I was younger, I’d been used to spending time on my own. My social skills are admittedly sub-par to say the least so that hasn’t helped. I’ve learned to find solace in my solitude, but it’s reached a point where I feel like I’m suffering as a result.

My mental health has also worsened in recent months, in part because of the pandemic, in part because I’ve finished university and therefore the best part of 18ish years of education. But I feel like the biggest part of it is my fear of being alone and the social skills (or lack thereof in my case) that comes with it.

Don’t get me wrong, I understand that there are times and places where I’d need to be on my own for my own betterment. But I now struggle to form and maintain friendships and relationships, whether with my work colleagues, friends from childhood and everything in between)):

If anyone has any advice, general tips, (or just wants to make a new friend!), I’d greatly appreciate it."

540,What would you do?,"I’m 18 and I feel like I’ve been sad my entire life regarding 2 years of my HS. Besides that I feel like I’m being held back or not reaching my happiness

541,I can feel my anxiety coming back,"(Sorry about this length)

I (19F) used to have crippling anxiety to the point where I couldn't even complete a sentence- I'd begin to speak and lose confidence halfway through. My sentences would go something like this: 

*speaking with my manager* 
Manager: ""Hey how are things going over here?"" 
Me: ""Oh! Things, thinggs are go-good! It's juUst a littl-"" and I'd fade out and pretty much cut myself off losing my confidence halfway through speaking a sentence. 

This was a severe issue about a year ago and intrusive negative thoughts toward myself would also invade my mind. It was horrible, especially with the knowledge of who I used to be- an excellent public speaker and debater.

I, however, had a change at my job that put me into a position of higher responsibility. I became confident in my work and in myself because I was a professional at what I was doing. Sadly, the company I was working for took a turn for the worst and I ended up having to quit for my own sanity the second I could find another job. 

At my new job I'm about two months in. This job is something completely new for me and I'm still learning, but every time I mess up I start panicking on the inside. I only work with two people: my store manager and my assistant store manager (started as my coworker). The store manager trash talks the assistant to me behind his back every time the assistant makes a mistake, and I know they're doing the same to me- I can sense it whenever I leave the salesfloor for a few minutes and return.

This makes me panic every time they observe me when I'm helping customers because I'm living in fear that I'm going to do something wrong and upset the two guys I work with.

Now because of all this panicking, my bad speech is coming back. I stutter and have to restart my sentences constantly. I'll sometimes even have a pause in s sentence for a bit and then finish it. They don't know about my anxiety, so I just appear to them as an idiot... and they smile about it. 

Idk what to do to calm myself down, but I feel myself losing myself again and I'm scared."
542,Im done just waiting on the date,[removed]
543,Do you guys think if you are depressed you shouldn't date?,"You already have a low self esteem and are barely getting through the day.
The convos are really a drag with people for me because I have isolated myself all this time and have  zero friends that I chat with everyday or openly talk about.
I've turned into a recluse with no social media nothing.
I'm so tired of myself"
544,I dont think I can do this alone.,"Im starting to question my mental health. My mom passed away in March and I dont think I've been dealing with it properly. Im depressed, stressed and I haven't got proper sleep in months. My dad isn't much help and he says that he plans on getting me therapy but that was months ago. I just wish I had someone to talk too. Someone with a little bit of experience with grief and being lonely. I miss my mother she could help me, but that's kind of the reason. Im not really suicidal but just thinking about it scares me. Just wish I had some good advice."
545,My is weird,"School(ofc). The only problem is, when I'm facing the problem I feel like I'm going to die and start thinking of everything I want to do but the moment the problem got 'postponed' my body don't have motivation to solve it even if my brain is in 'freaking-out' mode. This means I'm physically calm, but sometimes my brain is too calm as well. Is this good? If not, how to fix it? Exam is near and I can't study enough."
546,Does anyone else not shower because going in there gets you out crying?,I don't know but being left with my thoughts and no distractions I feel terrible and end up crying about it all wanting to kill myself.
547,Any online therapist?,"I want a therapist that I can just text, would be nice if they my insurance too, and I just paid my normAl copay. Anything like this? I try one before but it was 60 bucks."
548,"When I am alone I am sad, then I am with friends or family and I am okay and happy again...why?","Lately I have been feeling very sad when I am on my own. To the point I don't want to see my friends or family. I don't want to go down to have dinner, I'd rather have dinner alone, I don't want to get out the house, I don't want to meet anyone, I just want to isolate myself in my room.

Then (99% of the time) as soon as I am with people my mood goes away and I am cheery and happy.

WHY. from 0 to 100 really really quickly.
To the point I really have to drag myself to do stuff.

Does this happen to anyone else? Why does it happen?"

554,ranting *TW// assault &amp; s*lf h*rm,"i’m so tired all the time and when i’m not tired i still feel like shit. i’m a sophomore in hs and it’s literally just TOO MUCH. i always end up doing assignments last minute, and not because i procrastinate. i’m managing now but i really doubt i’ll be able to keep living like this. my mental health has been declining for so long but i can’t do anything about it. i can’t talk about it with my parents cause they always try to minimize my problems. every time i open up to them they gaslight me and act as if i have no reason to be sad. and honestly i’m starting to believe it. i’m grateful to have clothes, food, a bed to sleep on, and a roof over my head. but aside from those bare minimums i have nothing going for me. like i mentioned before my school life isn’t going well. i have maybe 3 friends but i feel uncomfortable talking to them abt my problems bc i feel like a burden and i don’t want to make it weird. my mental health issues shouldn’t be their burdens too. i don’t remember the last time i had a genuine conversation with anyone, not even my parents about how i feel. and i want to SO BADLY. to make it worse, i’m gay and everyone in my family is extremely homophobic. i wish i could tell them that i constantly feel like the world hates me for something i can’t control and  speak to them abt my boy problems and that i liked this guy in school that talked so much shit abt me and it absolutely ruined my self esteem and confidence. i wish i could tell them that a couple years ago i was on a school bus and two guys much larger than me pinned me down on a bus seat and touched me without them telling me that i’m weak or that i’m making it up for attention or making it my fault. i wish i could tell them seeing them in the halls terrified me and how they played it off as a joke and i had to play along so i wouldn’t start something but i can’t because none of my parents would believe me and i want to tell them that it hurts so fucking much every time my brother calls me the f slur and that i’ll never get used to it but i KNOW they don’t care. i wish i could tell them that they’re not going to have grandkids every time they mention me having children or marrying a pretty girl but it’s just add to the list of disappointments that grows longer and LONGER. i wish i could tell them when i was sad or felt like shit. i wish i could act like myself without censoring myself and trying to “act straight”. i can’t act the way i want, dress how i like, i can’t even change my facebook pfp without them making a big deal out of it. i want to support myself and get a job and move out but i don’t have any experience and i can’t do anything on my own. i feel like i need to go to therapy but i don’t know how i’d bring up that conversation. i’ve recently stsrted cutting but i always feel ashamed right after. now that i look back at it it’s kind of embarrassing but after i cut i would wear a short sleeved short in hope that my parents would see it and either they didn’t see it or they did not care idk. i also hate my body. i’m rlly underweight and all of my relatives bring it up during family gatherings and it’s honestly so annoying like what is the point of bringing it up? not to mention i go through an identity crisis every other day and all the fat in my body literally goes to my stomach and every time i look in the mirror i want to tear it out and sometimes it isn’t as noticeable and then other times it looks like a literal pouch on my stomach. i don’t really expect any response i’m just ranting but if any of y’all have advice or anything i’m happy to listen"

557,Why am I like this?,"I need help. I don’t know what is wrong with me mentally anymore. Back in High school, I was doing great and didn’t have a care in the world. I had the friends, girlfriend and everything I could’ve wanted. But now that I’ve begun college my mental health seems to be getting worse. I feel like that I have nothing going for me anymore. My girlfriend and I broke up because of college, most of my friends went to a different school, and on top of that I got no bids to join a fraternity and that was the only thing that kept me going. Now I’m left with mediocre grades, and I often keep thinking that there’s something wrong with me and Idk how to fix it. I feel depressed at times cause it seems like life is only getting worse. It’s so hard to make friends now cause of Covid and I miss my ex ,who was also my best friend, so  much but I know it’s for the better. I don’t know what to do anymore."
558,I think my poor mental health is making me obsessed with my ex boyfriend.,"Just like the title says I find myself constantly thinking about my ex even though we have been broken up for a year and a half now. I have schizoaffective disorder and I hear his voice and see him sometimes which is really disturbing and heartbreaking because I still love him. I've told him how I feel but right now he says that he doesn't want to be in a relationship. I respect his boundaries and try to back off but I can't help but think of him all the time. Some days I think of him right when i wake up to the moment I go to bed. I always want to know what he is doing or who he's with, even though I know its wrong to think like that. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? How did you get past it? 

I honestly don't think anyone but a professional can help me but I just wanted to put this out there just in case someone can or maybe there is someone who can relate to this."
559,Bored and hopeless,"Bored and hopeless

Is anyone else extremely bored/worried of the world and feeling pretty hopeless about everything. There is no jobs or money and I wonder if we’ll ever see the end of it. 

Population is increasing, jobs and money are running out, and of course viruses are raising mainly due to climate and rapid endangerment of animals.

560,Combat Veteran seeking help,"Long story short, I'm a combat veteran. My girlfriend told me today she wants a break. I had some severe flashbacks last weekend from Afghanistan, and this just adds to to mental and emotional pain. I have to go to her place in the morning to get the rest of my stuff, and I don't know how I'm going to do it. I took anti depressants for a little 2 years after I got out for depression/PTSD. I stopped taking them cold turkey. Every day I wake up wishing I was back in Afghanistan, and sometimes I wonder if everyone would be better off if I died over there. Sometimes I think that would have been better for everyone. I have no friends where I live, and I lost contact with all my army buddies. Please, Reddit, give me some advice. I'm at a very low point right now and I don't know how to hold on."
561,The letter that I'll never send,"Why do you mean so much to me. I think everything that hurts me about all this, everything that eats away at my soul, it's all connected to this central point: I love you, way more than I should. You're my best friend, but we both know I love you more than just that. It shows in the way I'm always checking in to make sure you're ok, in the way I always text you goodnight, just to make sure you know I'm still here for you. It's obvious in all the ways I moved heaven and earth to make sure you were ok when your life came crashing down.

Do you remember those days? I do. I remember how hard you tried to downplay everything, to pretend like you were ok, but the pain was there in your eyes. I remember your breakdown on your birthday, when I held you and listened as you vented about everything, and after you had let it all out and we had talked about it as much as you wanted to, I didn't leave your side until that light had come back in your eyes and you were laughing again. I remember the night you texted me about how the basement you were living in was flooding, and now you were going to have to find a new place to live. I had that place drained and all your belongings safe before lunch. We were both laughing and more at ease then we had been for a long time that day, because even though things were crazy, we knew we could count on each other.

When you told me about the new guy you had been seeing I had this pain inside, because we both know I wish I could be him, but I know you don't see me that way, and I would be perfectly content staying your best friend, as long as you were still in my life. I helped you work through your thoughts and fears, you had been burned once before and you were weary of being burned again. In many ways he is better than I, and I really believe he will hold your heart close to his. 

When you moved in with him I was relieved, I knew how worried you had been about having a stable place to live, my home isn't big enough to keep you here for the long term. I knew it meant we'd see each other less, but I knew we'd always be there for each other so I wasn't worried, and you were happy, which was all that mattered to me.  In my attempt to not stay hooked on you, I went into a relationship with a friend, and for a while I was happy, too. I truly loved her, and while I knew I'd probably always have feelings for you, I saw a future with her that would be full of love for her and I.

But we didn't quite make it, did we? That dream came crashing down, and with my spectacular misfortune the rest of my world burned soon after. I lost my job, my car, my health. I was in a deeper and darker despair then I had ever even thought I could experience. I had suicidal thoughts daily. I tried to kill myself once, but you don't know that yet, I never told you. Because you weren't there. That happy life you built from the wreckage we salvaged filled all your time. You stopped coming over, you stopped checking in. I would text you daily, and get a single sentence reply every other day if I was lucky.

You know I don't expect you to do the extreme things I did for you. I understand that I give more than anyone should be expected to. All I needed was for you to be there. The night I tried to kill myself and wrecked my car, I ended up in the hospital. You were the first person I texted. You were the only person I needed then. You asked if I needed a ride home, but someone had already offered and it was passed midnight, so I told you to sleep, we could talk more in the morning. I didn't see you until a month after that. You came over to pick up a present I got you for your birthday, but you had just been in a big fight with your father and we're crying. I helped you work through it, because no matter how much I was hurting you will always come first. Once you were feeling better you smiled, gave me a hug, and disappeared again. It was over a month until I saw you again.

You never texted me anymore, I always had to text if I wanted any chance of a conversation. I began to become paranoid: maybe you were tired of me, but you didn't want to hurt me by saying so. Maybe your boyfriend felt threatened by me and asked you to cut your ties with me. Maybe my situation was putting too much pressure on you. Eventually I apologized for texting so much, and said I'd wait to text you only after you texted me. It's been weeks. You still send a snapchat streak daily. You still see my story. But you aren't here.

At times I feel so isolated, it's like I'm not even in this world. I can't feel the air touching me, or the fan. I'm just a brain, screaming at itself and falling apart. I recently got a new job, but you don't know that yet. I got a new car, too. I'm putting the pieces back together, but I'm still empty. I still wake up wondering if it's all worth it, all the effort to make my shell of a life run smoother. You don't know this, and the darkness in the back of my head has started whispering that you don't want to know. My fears are telling me that you finally ran out of use for me, and that you're finally discarding me for good. I know that isn't true, but my arguments for why it isn't true are becoming weaker and weaker as the days go by.

Do you want to know what the worst part is? If you texted me right now, saying you needed me to come help you, after leaving me while I fell apart, I'd be there in a heartbeat. Because, for better or worse, I love you, way more than I should. Why do you mean so much to me?"
562,I dont know anymore,I dint feel like myself. I dont feel real I feel as if I'm a child dont know what to do anymore I feel hopeless I dont know why. I need help someone else I I dont know why I feel this way
563,I’ve decided to end my life.,"I’ve slowly begun letting go of everything, and today’s the day I pull that final straw. Not to worry though, while the end of my past life is now here, the beginning of my new life is approaching. I’m almost there. So, to all the past things, I say goodbye. I am grateful for all the lessons I learned, and look forward to all that is coming.

Peace-ing out,

564,I'm sick of being alone,"14m: Hi, I jus t felt like I needed to ask what I should do in my life right now. I know I may be in Middle school, but please listen:

So I live in a small town where the biggest classroom (outside the pandemic) is 18 people, and a total school, p-12 is 350 people. I moved here in 2012, and since then, I've never had a true friend, it feels like. I was always set to last, kind of seen, but not really. which is frustrating, knowing I've proved it several times by just standing up and leaving a class without anyone noticing. well, fast forward about 4 years, It's still been like this, and It started becoming normal, I was a listener, not a speaker. but in the past year I realized I don't have much longer until I won't see any of these ""friends"" again, so I would call, call, call, talk, talk through friends, and call some more, in spacious time. my family has seen me cry over the same thing over and over, I text a friend, they don't answer at all, my sister's friend is up, and I see that he spends most of his time talking on the same message system I tried to talk with him on. I let go of a lot of people this past year, including my grandmother, one of the only people I could talk to, whom is now in an old folks home for the rest of her life; an old friend of mine, who I found out committed suicide while I was out of town; and a family member who relapsed. My family told me to forget about the people who outright try to avoid me, the people who I thought were true friends, but it's not that easy. I care too much, and today, I made one last attempt to get a hold of a friend. here's how it went:

\* ring\* \*ring\*

Him: Hello?

Me: hey man. how's it going?

Him: oh, Hey \*name\*,

Me: so I was wondering, cause I know that your moving to alaska in two weeks, and I haven't seen you in like 5 months, I was wondering If I could hang out some time soon?

&amp;#x200B;

Him: yeah, Probably not, I haven't had much people over.

now at this point I know he's lying, because he has been caught with a kid who I'll address as ""Richard"" in town, walking around.

&amp;#x200B;

Him: and everything's busy and \*in the back there's distant talk from a few feet away""

Me: who is that?

Him: oh, that's just Richard.\[him admitting to his own lie.\]

Me: oh, well, okay then. I was just saying, maybe ask your mom, I'm open every Friday, after school-

Richard: I'll just fix that. \*click\*

phone call ends.

so at this point, I don't know what to do, I'm confused, depressed, and most of all, Lonely. What do I do?"
565,highschool is ruining my mental health,i can't explain how highschool has completely destroyed my health mentally and physically. everyday stress gets built up especially during quarantine. i had a pseudo seizure and was taken to the hospital during school because of the amount of stress i was in. now i can barely eat cause im constantly working. i don't know what to do.

I had to give up my job to become the sole caregiver for my dad and I do not have support from my siblings. I’m overwhelmed. But I also don’t have health insurance so I can get the mental help I need. Are there any options for someone like me?"

My sophomore year of high school I had two experiences where I saw things I’m not sure were real. The first was a man on the side of the road when I was walking home from work. He appeared to be moving as though he was walking, but stayed in one place. When I finally reached where he was, he was gone. I wrote this off as being tired, and not realizing he’d moved. It was midnight and I was doing a two mile walk home after a long day of work. Not long after, I had an experience where I thought a car was trying to run over me, even thinking it had gone onto the sidewalk where I was walking. About a year before this, I’d convinced myself the ringing of wind chimes were spirits trying to communicate with me. Even when I was very young, I would hear people calling my name, and waking me up from sleep, but my parents said this was common. During quarantine, I’ve been experiencing what I think may be HPPD. I see tracers on objects, and sometimes convince myself I’ve unknowingly taken a drug. I stay away from anything psychoactive, even caffeine, because I find it heightens this. 

Today, my dad jokingly called me a schizophrenic for wearing layers of clothing when I leave the house, even though we live in Texas and the weather is still warm. I’d never even noticed myself doing it, but I think I view it as a shield between me and others, like they’re analyzing the way I look. Being in quarantine has made me very apprehensive about social encounters, even though I’ve always been extroverted. I wouldn’t say this is symptomatic of actually being schizophrenic, but it’s got me paranoid now.

Additionally, and this is the last thing... often when I’m talking about something, people ask me to clarify many times, even though I think I’m being very explicit in meaning. I get very frustrated when I don’t think people are taking the time to understand my abstractions. It’s starting to make me anxious that other people think I’m weird or “crazy”, but won’t tell me.

Should I be worried or am I over analyzing?"
569,Went back to work for the first time since March.,"I got laid off in March due to the spread of covid in my city. At the time I didn’t think I would go back to work. I have a long list of diagnosis and medication, I thought I physically wouldn’t be able to make it. Well I landed a job as a seasonal florist in a warehouse last February before the virus active worldwide. It was so peaceful but kept my mind busy, I loved everybody I worked with (even thought I couldn’t remember half their names because they’re from the Philippines and I couldn’t pronounce anything right lol) my supervisor is extremely nice for the most part lmao. I got called back in a couple days ago, 2 days before I started again. I was having severe anxiety attacks, throwing up due to anxiety, I’ve fainted twice, blah blah blah you probably know it all. I didn’t reply to my supervisor for about 2 hours even though she could see that I read her message, and told her I’d see her on the 1st. The first night I couldn’t fall asleep, all I was thinking about was getting sick there and getting others sick. I managed to get maybe 3 hours in until my coffee maker started making my coffee (program setting) so when I heard it I just got up and got ready for my day. I was shaking all morning. I get up at 4 AM. I made my lunch, took my pills, made my coffee, smoked my weed lmao and got my dab pen ready for work. It’s about an hour drive from where I live, my boyfriend was dropping me off. The entire way there I was crying, shaking, gagging every time I would smoke which was every like 5 minutes, getting clogged cause well I was crying lmao. My boyfriend managed to calm me down and I went inside for 6AM. I remembered what I was supposed to do but of course with covid there’s new rules so I asked about those first. There isn’t much distancing but we do have to wear our masks and we have to work alone at our own station, the ladies there aren’t great at distancing or sanitation which makes me scared because I’m a close contact with my family but I picked the table in the back and kept it there for myself (you reserve a table for a week), and set myself home there. I swear it was an hour in and I was already on my lunch break. I guess with anxiety and forcing yourself to focus gets shit moving faster without even realizing it. I got on my lunch, I went outside to eat my lunch because I didn’t want to sit inside. I instantly started crying. I was scared, frustrated, the pay cheque wasn’t worth risking my life, I was already yelled at for something that wasn’t my fault which set me off really bad. Then I found out my ex roommate is coming in for a couple shifts which made it worse. I sat outside for about an hour and a half, just crying and texting my grandpa. I got done with my day, packed up and went home and went to bed, I didn’t even make supper. I went back the next day and I’m going back on Monday. This was such a pointless rant and idk where it was going but HEY I WENT BACK TO WORK I LOVE YOU ALL PLEASE NEVER GIVE UP PLEASE STAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU ARE NEEDED."
570,Hypochondria and OCD is ruining my life,"Don’t even know if this is the right place to post this but here it goes. I’m 23 years old currently in a nursing program and still living at home with my family (parents and 2 siblings). 

Long story short, I always think something is wrong with me. This isn’t a typical case of hypochondria, as I don’t always feel I’m “sick” instead I constantly feel like I get hurt and I always fear The worst. 

This has been a relatively recent development when a couple years ago I got random chest pains. I used to be someone who would brush it off like it was nothing but the pain wouldn’t go away, and it made me a nervous wreck. Multiple tests later it turned out to be nothing and all was well, then I injured my eye. I won’t go into specifics, but I don’t even think I injured it looking back, I just convinced myself I did and pain was there for months as well. There have been little things here and there, like a knee injury that wasn’t serious but I thought it was or a back injury where it was more of the same. 

Fast forward to about a year ago and I hurt my shoulder. At the time I was about 3 months “injury” free and I was feeling pretty positive I had kicked this whole hypochondria/OCD thing. Pain was intense the next day though and after PT only helped it minimally an MRI says I tore my labrum. I was devastated but I tried to fight it as he said it was a minor tear and I didn’t need to have surgery. Slowly started to lose mobility so I ended up getting surgery. In the meantime, I’m pretty sure I tore my other labrum bc I used it so much when the other one was hurt. Now I fear I tore my bicep even though it looks fine and there’s no bruising. My Physical therapist stretched it in a weird way and it hasn’t felt the same since. I know I’m overreacting, but I really can’t stop stressing about it. I don’t even know what I’m asking for, but hypochondria and my OCD surrounding it is driving me insane. 

I need to study for a big anatomy test I have coming up, but I can’t focus on anything right now except my bicep. What are the best ways to become stronger mentally? When I was younger I never got hurt, and when I did I never overreacted to it like I do now. My pain tolerance used to be high, but now anytime there’s a little discomfort I can’t get my mind off that specific area that’s painful. A lot of times I feel my injury is all in my mind. :("
571,I need help (17M),[removed]
572,Feeling like a mess?,"So I just found out my grandaunt (maternal grandmother's sister) who I'm super close to has approx 6 months to live as she was recently diagnosed with cancer (for the 3rd time). I lost my grandmother to cancer 10 years ago and honestly it feels like a repeat of the situation. But this time im in a city across the country without any of my family members around as I recently got married. I'm trying to be strong cause I have faith it'll be okay and whatever is meant to happen will, but I also can't bear the thought of losing probably one of my most loved and favourite people on earth. My chest feels heavy, it feels like I have something strangling me. My heartbeat has quickened and my head is tightening around my brain (well it feels like it is). I can't help but clench and well to sum it up it's just a full out panic attack I know will be going on for the set of months. I have to carry out my life as a wife and daughter in law but also manage the emotions linked to the situation back home. Im terrible with my words and feel like I can barely be there for my aunt my cousins my own mother and sister. I was known for hugs haha and I can't even give those. I obviously can't be speaking to anyone about this on the daily here not that I would but it's just a personal matter now vs a family matter? If that makes sense... Just different with the inlaws right? Not sure how I'm going to handle myself honestly as I already felt like I was struggling alot prior to the knowledge of the situation. Not even sure what to ask for just needed to let my thoughts out I guess. Thanks for your time if you've read this far 😔❤️"
573,"How do you support someone while having healthy boundaries? When is enough, enough?","I’m going to try to keep what could be a book brief. My sister has undiagnosed mental illness. Maybe BPD, maybe bipolar. She says and believes things to be true, that simply are not. In many cases they are completely imagined or fabricated from a SLIVER of truth. This has been ongoing for the past 15 years of her adult life. She has a consistent pattern of making trouble and misery for whoever happens to be in her life every 12 months or so. It’s almost always WILD but SERIOUS accusations against employers, partners, friends, family, repair people, service workers - anyone. She also has a child. Now here is where I’m at: For many years my parents bailed her out. After her son was born they continued to help her “for our grandchild”. All this through constant verbal abuse and attacks on my mother, and refusing to speak to my father for YEARS. Most recently she horribly, truly heinous, libeled another family member she hasn’t spoken to in many years. She then began lashing out at me. I was truly afraid I was next on her list. My mother continues to babysit (overnight) on weekends, so my sister can work, and sometimes just because she asks. I love my mother dearly, but I am terribly torn. I want my own children to also spend time w her on the weekend, but there is almost always some kind of drama (my sister makes it for us even when she isn’t present). For example, you got him a small shake instead of a large shake like he asked? Then 100 messages about how terrible of a person you are. Or more serious, why did the baby change have her diaper in the living room? Is she being sexually abused? Like I said this has been a consistent pattern of behavior over years. I’m just at a point where I feel it is no way to live for ANY parties involved. What are healthy boundaries here? How do I support my mom?"
574,"They say: ""Reach out, tell someone"", but when you do no one believes you.","I have sought help from so many people and none of them believe I'm the victim in this story. They just lecture me, telling me that I shouldn't hold resentment against my parents, that I'm just young and don't know what life is about. Always blaming me for my problems. I don't know what to do, I wish I could get out of here, but with the pandemic things are more difficult."
575,Can antipsychotics make you more psychotic?,Cause when I was on them I still felt psychotic and then I stopped taking them and I was more psychotic for a little while but now I feel barely psychotic at all.
576,Im done with life just waiting on the date,[removed]
577,I think my mom raped me when I was a child,"Recently I've been 'unlocking' many memories from when I was a kid, all of them negative. And I'm just.... Remembering shit my mother did to me. I don't wanna say what but even now she stares at my crotch. I hate it. But the thing is I have OCD and according to my family, a lot of false memories about my childhood. I'm not sure if it actually happened or not and I'm worried if I say something and it turns out it was a false memory, I'll regret it forever. But they could also be gaslighting me. I have a therapist (new, just finished 2 sessions) but I don't want to say anything because he's probably legally bound to tell the cops. I don't KNOW what to do I'm just doubting myself at every step and I feel so fucking wrong."
578,Im done with life just waiting on the date,[removed]
579,Emotionally Slipping,"I made a post last night about how I was worried I didn’t have a reaction to hearing a loved one was diagnosed with cancer, but now I think I’m starting to feel it.  I’m a biomedical major in college and had some rough exams lately. Today was particularly hard to find motivation to continue with school work, to attend lectures, even to feel purpose in the work. We work so hard in life just die. It’s depressing, but true. I could feel myself slipping both emotionally and mentally a little before the news of my loved one, but today it was worse, magnified even. It’s getting worse as the night goes on and I don’t like where this slope is trending. I want to be strong for those around me, but if I describe how I’m feeling to them I don’t know how they’ll react. Last time they thought I was suicidal (and I might have been a little but there was no intent) so I don’t want to worry them. I’ve put my life and its plans into this degree, if I lose motivation for it then I’ll have lost motivation for life goals."
580,im starting to think theres something actually wrong with me.,"my thoughts are a mess. i can never think straight. my mind thinks things that make no sense. sometimes i spend entire days in bed, not even on my phone or anything just letting my mind go round and round in circles all day. i dont feel comfortable in my own skin. it feels like puppet strings. sometimes i overeat because i feel a constant hunger, but other times i go multiple days without eating and never get hungry. i never sleep for more than 1 or 2 hours at a time because of the nightmares. some nights i dont sleep at all. days just bleed one into the other and its hard for me to keep track of them. i always imagine terrible things, mutilated corpses and figures that dont make sense and its worse when i close my eyes. 

my mind is a mess. i dont know what to think. what is wrong with me?"
581,I don't have many early childhood memories and I don't know if that's normal or not,"I had a lot of trauma as a kid. I didn't grow up in the best environment. I was being sexually abused by a relative, my mother had severe mental illness, my father was emotionally absent until the day he left completely, etc. I'm happy to say that these days, I'm actually doing pretty great. I've had a lot of therapy (and EMDR is life-changing) and I've processed a lot of this to the point where it doesn't actually hurt me too much to think about it. I've created a pretty stable and good life for myself. 

But I don't remember a lot of my childhood and I'm starting to wonder if that's normal or an effect of the trauma or an effect of being on psychiatric medication since I was 6 years old. I have *very* few scattered memories prior to the age of 11 or so. At least, real memories. I know things about my childhood, because others have shared those stories, but I can't put myself back there or visualize how it happened. 

Of the real early memories I have, I can count them all: 

I have a memory of sitting in kindergarten and listening to my teacher play guitar. I have a memory of an early childhood nightmare where I fell off the slide and then woke up crying. I have a memory of not wanting to go to school and pretending to be asleep/unable to be woken up as my parents sprinkled water on my face and my mom said ""what if she's in a coma??"". Another memory of the school principal grabbing my arm as I cried and tried to run out of the school building (I have no idea why or any context to that moment, but I remember it vividly). A memory of waking up on the floor of my parents' room and being handed pills. Then a big gap. I was apparently homeschooled for 1st and 2nd grade due to my behaviors and severe anxiety about school but I remember none of it. Then a memory of going back to school in 3rd grade and a girl on the playground told me she liked my shoes and it made me feel good. A memory of having my first real birthday party with friends and my dad gave me a bag of hay as a present and when I was confused, he told me it was for the rabbit that I was going to get. Then nothing until about 5th grade, where I remember being in my 5th grade classroom filling out a map of the US (no idea why that one stuck haha) and I also remember sex ed in 5th grade where my friend thought it would be funny to tell the whole class that I had already gotten my period. 

That's it. Everything else is blank up until about middle school, and then there starts to be a ton of memories, but I can't place a lot of them on a timeline.

I also cannot put any of my trauma on a timeline. I know that by middle school, I was being sexually abused, but I could not tell you when it started. I can remember a lot about the abuse but have no context of when many of those incidents happened. I also have a memory of my mom having a mental break and screaming at me that all of her children were going to hell, but I have no idea how old I was when that happened. I could have been 6 or 14 or who knows. I have a memory of myself having an almost suicide attempt, but again, not a clue how old I was. 

I just wonder if this is normal or an effect of the trauma or the medication (I was on Zoloft and something else that I don't know what it was). Do other people have more expansive early childhood memories or is it normal to have huge gaps and just a few scattered true memories? Is it normal to not be able to put significant memories on a timeline?"
582,"My (22f) boyfriend (22m admitted himself into a psychiatric facility voluntarily, but they're not allowing him to sign himself out?","So without getting too into everything, my boyfriend was going through a hard time mentally, trying to get sober. He admitted himself into rehab on his own accord. He was being discharged from his rehab, but decided instead to leave to voluntarily sign himself in to a psychiatric facility in New Jersey instead, (his idea entirely) because he wanted to lean towards working on other aspects of his mental health.  The place he is in isn't what he thought it would be, and not one of the better wards he'd been to. It's making him feel worse, I've been in some not so great places so I fully understand. He wants to either go back to rehab to finish his treatment or come home, but they're not allowing him to sign himself out?
When I had voluntarily admitted myself to a place in New York state at 18 for literally being suicidal, I was allowed to sign myself out with a 72 hour notice.
I tried to look up if New Jersey had different guide lines than NYS, but I couldn't find anything on it.
I'm wondering if there's anything I can do for him, possibly petition to get him out some how if it comes down to it. Are they allowed to keep him when he's not a danger to himself or others and had signed himself in?
When he asked to sign himself out or be discharged, and asked about a 72 hour notice they said that the more he pushes it the worse it will be for him, and they will end up writing him up as involuntary and he won't be able to leave.
I just don't understand this exactly, if he can't leave while he is voluntary, how much worse could it be if he wasn't? Will they be able to just keep him there for as long as they feel like?

****Also,  I tried to call him tonight at 8:45 pm, phones are off at 10pm. A female staff member answers and seems extremely nervous when I ask for my boyfriend. She says ""uhhh... hang on one moment.."" and comes back a couple minutes later and in a really upset/nervous kindof voice said ""would you be able to call back tomorrow? Because it's late right now.."" 
I'm assuming she didn't realize that I knew he tried to ask to sign himself out and that he was probably very unhappy with the result.
I ignored what she said and asked ""is he okay??""
And she said ""I... Honestly don't know... I'm sorry..."" And I said okay. And she said I'm sorry a couple more times and said goodbye, and all I could sm
Her apologies seemed genuine and also very emotional? 
But her telling me she doesn't know if my boyfriend is okay??? I'm worried and I'm shaking typing this.

I just want to know if there's anything I can do to petition to get him out so he can get treatment somewhere actually suitable for him if he still wants to do that. Or come home.
I think it's disturbing that he can't sign himself out as a voluntary patient and that they're essentially threatening to make it so he's stuck there. Advice please?"
583,Feeling Isolated,"I (24M) had three zoom calls today. One was my first time meeting with a professional mentor, and the other two were social events with classmates in my grad program.

I'm finding that after every virtual meeting, I become preoccupied with whether or not I said something wrong, if I came off as an arrogant asshole, or why I feel like there is an impenetrable glass wall between me and everyone else. I've spent so much of my life focusing on achievement to the detriment of personal relationships. And now, I can't get out of the habit of thinking of social interaction as a high-stakes performance, where the stakes are my worth as a person, and I pretty much always fail according to my own (probably myopic) rubric.

Two months before the pandemic, I started going to therapy again to address my anxiety and difficulty making and maintaining social connections. The lockdown has made everything so much more difficult - I'm terrible at keeping in touch with people if I'm not physically interacting with them, and I feel that for various reasons I didn't put sufficient effort into making close connections with people before the pandemic hit. I have a partner and some friends and family who I know care about me, but I still feel like my life is rather empty, and that it's completely my fault. That I've become a boring person, and that at this point I will never recover the energy to become interesting and engaging and to make the real friendships with people that I desire.

And the shittiest thing is that this is the millionth time I have had these thoughts. I am still seeing a therapist, and I know that that is a privilege and we are making progress slowly working through some things, but I fear that I will be a fucked up shell of a person for the rest of my life and that it's too late. I really fear that too much damage has been done already, either self-inflicted or from toxic relationships. 

All I want in life (besides basic needs like food and shelter) is a sense of community, and COVID has made that ten times harder to achieve. And tonight, despite spending several hours distantly socializing, I am feeling sad and lonely. So thanks for listening if you got this far."
584,How do I stop missing someone?,"I’ve tried so many things, I’m tired of this tearing me apart and crying myself to sleep every night. I’m usually not like this but this time I just miss this person so much and I don’t know why it’s hurting me so badly. I can’t think about anything else and I just want to go back in time and make things different."
585,Can suicide be something I'm truly genuinely ok with and there isn't anything wrong with me?,"(20M) I recently got dumped by my girlfriend after 15 months of dating her. We loved each other to bits but things weren't working out because we just became long distance, she isn't physically attracted to me anymore, we developed a codependency from only being around each other, and other issues that went wrong on my side. I recently got back in the gym and started devoting lots of time and energy into looking and feeling physically better to look more attractive. I know she was attracted to me at one point but physically I let myself go because I got comfortable. We became codependent because we were each others only friends in the area. However, our communication, acceptance for each other, and treatment of each other was the best either one of us had ever had from anyone else before, relationship or anyone else we knew, point-blank period. 

We both still love each other and the breakup was rough. We had a very emotional talk for over two hours and she still wants me in her life because I'm her best friend and she's mine as well. I agreed. We also said to take some time to improve on ourselves as individuals and come back to talk as friends in a week or two. I agreed.I talked about a 'friendcation' in a few months from now when we have some time to ourselves and are ok with being in each others space again while acknowledging that if romantic feelings happen naturally between each other, it's ok to pursue them as long as it isn't awkward and uncomfortable. She agreed. All of these things I'm very grateful for, however there is a downside...

I acknowledged that I don't have a desire to live if it isn't with her as a partner. I still get crazy heart palpitations when she calls, smile whenever I hear her laugh, and think about her all the time. She told me I'm one of her soulmates but she doesn't know if I'm a romantic one. **The downside is I've accepted that if she's not my lover and I see her with someone else, or that there are no feelings of romance after our 'friendcation', I won't have a desire to live anymore.** I'm not even sad about it. It's something that I have accepted and I don't feel bad about it. I just don't want to live if it isn't going to be spent building with her...

My question to the community: Am I wrong for feeling this way? 

I have no feelings of sadness or despair, not like I'm a burden or depressed, I'm genuinely content with this decision because I believe my life is meaningless without her as my life partner. Hopefully in four months we're working on our relationship again and we can make things work, but if not, I'm fine with not being around anymore either."
586,Partial or biased empathy?,"I guess I kind of have multiple questions. 

I think I've been misusing the word apathy. That's where you feel no emotions at all. What is it called when yoy feel the normal negative emotions, sadness, anger, fear, hurt, etc. but none of the good emotions like happiness, excitement, etc? Is that just, like, partial apathy or is there a word for it?

Whatever the word is for that, would it also effect my empathetic response? Like, if someone is hurting or upset or angry, I take on that feeling and treat the issue like it's my own, but if someone is happy or excited about something, my own negative emotions block me from being empathetic... 

Would that be a separate issue or would my own emotional shortcomings translate to my empathy shortcomings?

Sorry if this is worded confusingly, doesn't really make sense to me either"
587,I feel like I'm spiraling,"Tw: suicide
I (17f) have had a lot going on lately. First there was COVID and everything terrible that came with that, then my sister was hospitalized twice for her worsening borderline personality disorder, and my best friend had a cancerous lump removed. While just that all feels like enough, an event related to my PTSD from childhood also occurred again. I feel lost and like all of this is too much for me to unload onto a loved one.

Since quarantine, I've been getting panic attacks and having suicidal intrusive thoughts. My mind keeps telling me it would relieve me of all the pain, but I don't want to do it. I can't stop picturing different ways I could do it. I don't want to do it but I can't get the thought of my head that it would be easy and make everything go away. This line of thinking always leads to a panic attack. I don't know what to do and I need help."
588,My plan towards good mental health,"I've been in a depressive state since mid-June, due to our current circumstances. I consulted a therapist and had a couple meetings, and I didn't see much improvement afterwards, but I have been off self-harm for around two months, so that's one good thing that came out of that. My therapist told me I was ""having a depressive reaction"" to quarantine and isolation. (I should mention I live with my family, as I am a minor.) I don't leave the house or exercise, and I don't eat unless my parents make me. I have been attending online school but I rarely pay attention, spending hours on my phone during and between classes. (This is an issue, I am an MYP/IB student and this program requires very vigorous attention.) I am exhausted all the time even though I do nothing all day, don't leave the house for weeks on end and go to bed at 10-11 and wake up at 8. I find little joy in things that used to make me happy. Starting next week I am beginning a new plan that will hopefully improve my mental health and wellbeing.

1. I will exercise for 15+ minutes daily. (start small)
2. I will spend at least 1 hour outside enjoying nature not exercising
3. I will drink at least 6 glasses of water a day.
4. I will brush my teeth twice a day, shower daily, and do my skincare/makeup routine nightly/every morning.
5. I will get dressed everyday
6. I will limit my screentime to 2 hours a day and I will read when I feel the need to scroll through social media
7. I will spend as much time with friends as I can
8. I will leave my room at least 5 times a day
9. I will eat all three meals, and try to make them healthier, I will not eat dessert everyday, and eat fruit instead
10. I will not eat dessert everyday, and eat fruit instead
11. I will go to bed early, (9-10 pm) and wake up early

I will update this post daily each day."
589,I had a mental breakdown at work and I’m worried I’ll be fired,"Ok, so like, today was fucking terrible. But it started off really good. So basically, I felt super hated and neglected by everyone at work.

It was straining on me so bad that I got a plastic knife and was forcing it to my skin, I didn’t cut myself but I was tempted in doing it.

I poured a drink on the thing where normally the  food sits, randomly. 

I kept messing with the box cutters very tempted to cut my arm

No one was talking to me so I asked my manager if I could clock out early. He said no of course. But then later he said “if you feel uncomfortable I can drop you off early”. At that point it was 2 hours left on shift. So I said no.
After that he still clocked me out and said “go home” me and him talked about how it’s really hard for me to feel hated and neglected by people. I asked him if I was in trouble and he said no. But I’m still worried I fucked up big time. I’m scared bc this has never happened at work before. I am a pretty good worker and one of the best people who close the restaurant on time. 

I don’t wanna lose my job. I’m scared what do you think will happen? Bc I don’t know, what’s gonna happen tomorrow."

591,I always feel lonely and I don’t know how to fix it?,How do you deal/over come this because I find myself throwing myself at men for attention as well as abusing alcohol and drugs. Seeing a professional isn’t helping and the only thing that seems to calm my being is knowing that there is someone that I can spend time with romantically.
592,How do I bring up possible ADHD?,"Okay, so I’ve always had mental health issues and I got diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression. I’m on meds for those. I feel like with my symptoms that would be related to ADHD I’ve realized I might have majorly downplayed their severity to my doctor because other problems were in the forefront. Now that I’m doing better with my anxiety and depression I’ve realized that there are things still lingering and making life hard that I thought was just depression... But now I’m thinking it might be ADHD

It’s often very hard for me to focus, and once I get into something distracting me it is nearly impossible for me to get back in track

Often when I can’t focus I can’t even focus enough to read and comprehend things very well... to the point that I’m reading something 15 maybe twenty times and still not get it 

The more I struggle the more frustrated and upset I get. I’ve always been like that and I’d get stuck on something and work myself up to the point I’m pulling hair and sobbing (and this was me even in elementary school) 

There are times I get hyper focused on one thing and end up staying up really late trying to finish something because I’m so entranced.

Then there are times I can’t focus on anything and it feels quite like when I’m having a down day with depression... it feels like nothing and I trail off and stare into nothingness 

ADHD is super common in my family and basically no one in my family is neurotypical 

How would I bring this stuff up to my doctor? How would I tell her that I think I have ADHD?"
593,Someone to talk to,Is there any websites or idk places I can talk to someone who doesn’t know me what so ever and doesn’t live near me. I just feel like it would really help to tell someone everything and not have to worry about them telling anyone. I just want someone to listen and hear what happened and be there for me.
594,what could this be?,"for as long as i can remember i've always felt like i was lying about things i truly have no memory of. for instance, as a child i had a klepto streak that got me into trouble. i still have no memory to this day of ever stealing, but i always found myself with objects i had to have stolen. not to mention i was caught with the stolen objects. when asked about it i always was honest and said i didn't know. thing is theres always been voices or feelings that told me that i did do it, and i always felt like they were berating me for lying even though i genuinely don't know how i stole these things or why i stole them. i physically have NO memory of doing these things but my brain always seems convinced im lying. this happens with other things too, and happend still to this day. it even got me arrested more than once as a kid.

what sort of thing could cause this? ive never done drugs, smoked, or drank alcohol."
595,"Things are going to get better supposedly, how do I try to actively reach my goals?","I need help trying to reach my goals. I was hospitalized last night briefly, but at this point after all the hospitalizations I need to try harder to improve my life. I dont even know where to start. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, hi local police reading my posts, thank you for your help last night. (Long story)"
596,I’m worried I have a mental disorder,"I’m 18 F, this is the first relationship I ever been in. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost four months. 
I’m just gonna say I’m definitely a introvert just so you understand who I am.

My mind is constantly changing on weather or not I want to be with him or not. I love him. I told him to give me a break, now I’m missing him and I need him. I told him I can’t commit to a long term thing, now I want to go back and take back everything I said. Sometimes I doubt our love and I think I have to break up with him, but then most of the time I love him and need him. Sometimes I worry and think he doesn’t care about me and sometimes I am completely overwhelmed by his care. Sometimes I feel worthless and unworthy of him, sometimes I feel too worthy for him. 

We never argue. He is sooo nice to me. I believe arguing also never needs to happen. I love him so much I never want to hurt him. Hurting him would absolutely break my heart. He is so in love with me he really wants me. I am in love with him, but I don’t always want him. 

We never had any problems. 

This is the first time I ever had a close relationship with someone. I’m confusing him but even more I’m confusing myself. Help."
597,"I dunno what I want to do in life, and it HURTS.",I was an amazing student in school but now I have no motivation to do anything. And thats all. I dont even have any energy to vent. Thanks.

600,Idk what's happening to me... But I'm scared...,"I've been dealing with something and it's been scaring me these past few days. Ever since quarantine I've felt off.... More than usual.. I forget stuff, find it hard to concentrate, and at night I start to just break down and feel as if I wanna cry.. I just don't know what's wrong with me... I deadass feel like crying and I just want it to stop... I try to laugh, to find happiness and relieve it but it's gotten so bad... Even when I eat it feels off... I'll be eating fine and just get a feeling and want to spit it out... But then a few secs later I'm fine and eat again.... Someone pls help me.... I don't want to do something stupid or cause any harm to myself or anyone..."
601,Am I just being dramatic?,[removed]
602,How do you stop thinking about things that are upsetting?,"I have this problem where if I read/hear/see something upsetting, I can’t get it out of my mind, usually for at least a day.

Normally it’s something someone I know has done/said, such as hateful opinions spread online or in person, or - more personally - rumors being spread that are damaging to my character. A recent example is I’ve been on holiday with my dad for a couple of weeks, and every day I walk past him at least once, watching some Daily Mail hate video or reading an article about how it’s poor people’s fault that the country is in decline etc. I can’t talk to him about it, he is completely unreasonable in any kind of debate, he sits and posts mild hate online but I see it getting worse. I can’t get it out of my head, my only reprieve is sleep. 

Hopefully this makes sense. I’m not sure if it’s some form of anxiety or something, I just can’t keep my mind focused on anything else when a negative thing has happened the same day/few days/longer"
603,everything’s going to be okay :),"one day you’ll heal in such a way that you’ll be glad you decided to stay. the light from the sun won’t be too bright for your once too tired eyes.
every morning will bring a nice summer feeling, even on those winter days. you’ll appreciate the little things in life like dancing to your favorite music. that song won’t remind you of bad times anymore, because of all the good new memories you made with it. you’ll laugh at the past and be proud of you now. it’s okay to not be okay, the storm will pass, and the rainbow will show itself. Things will get better, I promise."
604,I mentally broke when I was needed the most. How do I prevent it from happening again?,[removed]
605,I wish that i could stop behing human,"All my problem in life were cause by the fact that i have human emotion. If i had no emotion, i wouldn't had to drop school. If i had no emotion, i would'nt had stop to play music. If i had no emotion, i would'nt have a depression. If i had no emotion, i would'nt care about the fact that i am lonely. I just would'nt be lonely because loneliness (not solitude) is a feeling and not a status. If i had no emotion, i would be able to focus on the thing i am actualy good at and not on the thing i suck.

So if i stop behing human, i stop having those fking human emotion and all my problem will go away. The only new problem i would have are relations but since i don't have any, it would be a big loss."
606,Does anyone know what this is?,"There’s this thing that happens to me when certain things happen, sometimes it’s when people yell at me or I hear footsteps or something, and sometimes I don’t even know what it is at all, but my brain just like completely shuts down.
 
Like I can’t move or talk and I get completely disconnected from everything around me. Everything’s feels slowed down and blurry and I feel like I’m floating. 
Sometimes I try to move or talk or whatever but I can’t, like I’m completely trapped inside my head. And I can hear people talking to me but it’s all drowned out and distant and doesn’t feel real. 

It used to be a lot worse but it still happens and I can’t find anything about it online. It usually only lasts at most a few minutes. 
I know I have some dissociative stuff but depersonalization/derealization lasts a lot longer and I can still move and stuff. I can’t seem to find any thing that sounds like what I just described. 

It’s really fucking embarrassing too because sometimes I’ll be with my friends and something will happen that just sends me into this whole thing. I just freeze and stare the whole time apparently and I look like I’m fucking crazy. 

I don’t know, I was just wondering if anyone has heard about anything like this or experienced something similar, it would just make me feel like less of a weirdo."
607,"I've made my first appointment with a therapist, but I might explode if I don't start talking now.","It's taken me nearly 34 years to accept that I need help. My parent had mental health issues that they refused to acknowledge until they were in their mid 50's, and it badly impacted my childhood development. I don't want to self-diagnose, but I probably have adhd, I've been depressed for years upon years, and more and more frequently I am flirting with the edge. When I was a teen I cut the word 'hollow' into my leg, because that's how I felt.  It's how I still feel most of the time. From an outside perspective, I have what most people want: stability, security, family, etc. But I am constantly overwhelmed, I am failing in every direction, and I have nothing left. I am just...empty. I can go through the motions, work, cook, clean, deal with the family, shower, even do the 'fun' stuff,"
608,Does anyone ever feel like they’re just not alive? What do I do?,"I’m pretty sure I suffer from some form of anxiety, depression, and PTSD but there’s a reoccurring symptom I cannot explain to most. I almost feel dead, like I’m in purgatory or some sort of fever dream. Convinced I died or am no longer alive, almost like a walking corpse.. Does anyone know how to fix this or what it could be?"
609,FUCK ME! Fuck my life!," These past few years, life has just gone downhill. You try to stay positive and tell yourself that it is going to get better but it gets worse. With every passing second the stress, angst and depression increases exponentially. Before you know it you are a part of the huge machinery that is humanity. You are not even a working component, just a spare part and millions just like you to replace you after you’re gone. You don’t matter, you’re views don’t matter, your **life** doesn’t matter. We do the same things that everyone else does, we try to be like everyone else and forget about being ourselves. Nothing and no one is unique anymore, there are millions of people who have the same job and lifestyle. Most of the people die without making an impact on the people around them, let alone the world. You think that after I achieve this it will be enough, it will get better after this but nothing is enough. When you’re a child you imagine being famous and rich and loved by everyone. But as you get older you realize that all that is still not enough. So many people in this world, but most are still lonely. People are prepared to pay their therapists to listen to them but they can’t talk to the people around them or they don’t have anyone to talk to. Money and fame are just illusions that we can’t seem to stop chasing. Happiness is the real deal and no one is talking about it."

I had a bad experience with BetterHelp about a year ago that's left a major bad taste in my mouth, but I also know with COVID, more therapist are offering this now. 

I am diagnosed Bi-Polar + ADD, but would also like to start the process of reevaluation since this was diagnosed when I was a child. (I'm honestly unsure if its more akin to BPD than Bi-Polar)  I am also poly, so I need an LGBT/Kink friendly therapist as well.

Girlfriend broke up with me on my birthday a few months back (we would have been 3 years in a few days). I dont know what the hell im doing anymore. There are nights like tonight where i just keep telling myself that i dont matter and that literally no one benifits from me being alive. Im not suicidal cuz i would never have the guts to do it, but some days i do wish something bad would happen to me, like i got in an accident and i was the only one injured, just so i could feel justified to be miserable. I have a good life and have a lot to be thankful for, but here i am, spilling my soul out to people who wont read or care. I often have these fantasies about where i wish i could be down the road, a successful writer or film creator (not what i went to college for btw) able to create works that touch people's hearts.

624,My mom doesn’t believe me.,"About two years ago I was in my normal doctor checkup and after basic questions they moved on to mental health questions. I answered honestly and they thought it was concerning at the time and asked if they could tell my mom about it. I said yes as I felt so hopeless and cold in those times. After they said they would tell her, I heard nothing about it again. Six months later and I was talking to my school counselor about me possibly having a mental illness and she said that she would recommend to my mom that I see some sort of professional. Once again, I heard nothing even months later. These two instances aren’t even the first. Years ago I told my mom that I thought that I might have anxiety. This was after my cousins diagnosis so I was feeling brave, and then she told me that I was telling her that just so I could get drugs from a psychiatrist. After that I never discussed any mental health topics with my family. I only talk about it with really close friends but they can’t really get me any kind of professional help. I can’t go to a doctor without my mom for transport, and for insurance. I don’t know where my insurance card is and I know my mom wouldn’t give it to me if I asked. Even if I’ve made my mom seem bad, I still love her so much and I don’t wanna hurt her financially or get her in trouble. I just want to know if there’s a way to get help on my own. I like doing things on my own but this just seems like one of those things were it’s not possible. I’m 15 (close to 16) and live in the U.S so if there is way to get help without my mom, I would be really grateful if someone could share it."
625,Suicide leaves a void in every single life that the deceased had touched,"I had a college friend who killed himself more than 60 days ago. Admittedly, we grew apart after graduation (2017). We both went to law school, albeit in different cities. We didn’t really keep in touch, but we remained friends of Facebook.

More than 2 months ago, I was surprised to hear the news about his passing. I thought he contracted COVID-19. But I found out he took his own life. Worse, he actually tried to kill himself before. Prior to this, he was clinically diagnosed with major depression.

As expected, I felt grief. But I didn’t expect the grief to last this long. Somehow, I thought I would easily be numb since we’re not close anymore when he died. I was wrong. Every time I see/hear reminders of him (like a post on Instagram or a song I knew he liked), my heart breaks - I feel a physical pain in my chest, as intense as the first time I heard about the news. 

I don’t know what to do about my feelings. As someone who also thought of ending my life, it was like looking at an alternate future. I respect his reasons for doing what he did. But I also can’t help but reflect on the damage for the living that comes with suicide. 

That cynical saying that goes, “the world will keep spinning after you kill yourself” is true. But it leaves out another important component, “you will be leaving behind a long-lasting pain in the hearts of the people who love and care about you.” I know this is cliché, but it’s true.

I think he knew he was loved by many. He was so kind and gentle. He had a passion for human rights and social justice (I sometimes see his posts on Facebook regarding his talks and volunteer work). He would have been a great lawyer.

I just wish he loved himself enough to allow himself to live.

Depression is such a dangerous, yet relatively unexplored illness. It paints an obscure picture of oneself and one’s world. I see so many of his closer friends saying they wish they could have done more or they wish they could have seen the signs. 

Me, I wish we lived in the world where mental illness is taken more seriously. 

This is just a story I wanted to share to help me cope."
626,My aunt has cancer and my mum had depression,"My aunt, my mums closest sister has been battling for cancer at least for a year but I don’t remember for how long. It’s been too long. 

Recently her condition has gotten extremely worse. Critical. Mum has told me she is close to her death. 

She has had depression in the past and refused to treat it after having a bad experience with a specific doctor and therapist, even after years when I told her my experience once I became an adult. She refuses to take meds because one specific type of meds made her sleepy and gain extreme weight so she thinks all of them are bogus. 

But her depression gets worse when shit like this happens. And it’s impossible for her to go to a therapist. I honestly don’t wanna force her to do anything she doesn’t wanna do at this point. I just wanna help as much as I can. So she can give me some of the heavy stuff she is carrying on her shoulders. 

She is a very hard to read person and she tends to be very double sided (emotional and sensitive but not a sensitive communicator. Emotional but not in touch with her emotions in many ways). 

What are some of your opinion r/mentalhealth?

It is very sad and depressing that one of my closest family members is passing away, but at this point I have accepted the fact she will eventually die, from the cancer or not. I have let it go. I realised I can’t just linger around, and be sad of what I can’t even control. I am also scared to process the emotions I guess because I am going through so much myself right now in terms of mental health and life in general, uni and getting a job. 

I thought about asking her what she would like me to do, but she is the type of person who wouldn’t answer that and say to focus on myself. She is a very warm and loving person, but someone who has not yet learned too much about handling emotions.

It kills me seeing her each day just dissociating and depressed, struggling and on the edge. It is important for her to cry which I encourage when needed but I wanna do a bit more. To help."
627,My ritual,"When I was 3, my parents and I had to hide in the darkness from a potentially dangerous situation. I don't remember it, but when I asked my mom where my fear from the darkness comes, she mentioned that situation and it makes sense.

So, I'm afraid of the dark. No big deal, a lot of people are. I basically get the feeling someone is with me in the room. It's okay when I'm not home alone, but when I am it can be hell for me.

I have to check every door and window to see if they are closed/locked, and every corner to check no one is hiding there. I have a system in which order to check everything so nobody can sneak behind my back (Insane, I know). I repeat this at least 2 times before going to bed. I can't help it even though I know I'm safe, I have the urge to check and check. I check if the stove is off (also a few times) even though I know I didn't turn it on that day. I turn the table mirror to the wall in case I wake up and see something (myself?) in the mirror and get scared. Knives in the kitchen can not lay on the counter because they are ""ready to be used"" that way. They go either in the sink or in the knife holder, like they can't be take easily from there too (obviously logic has no place here).

I used to be scared of looking out the window at night but since I have a cat who looks through the window at all time, I can look out at night even though I still watch if there's someone creeping from outside.

And the wirdest part is (as if all before this was totally normal) I used to hide everything with my name on it before going to bed. In my mind that made it harder for anyone to identify me, you know in case someone is looking for me in my parents' house. Well, at least I don't do that one anymore.

Nobody knows I'm doing this, except my bf but not even he knows how much this time I spend on this and how much I repeat my ritual until my anxiety is satisfied and I can finally go to bed and stay there without getting up to check everything over and over again."
628,“I’ll always be there”,People always say that but when I tell them they leave and I become a burden. People only care about themselves and how they look and I don’t think I want to live in a world like that.
629,i know i can be a bitch but it's the best defence i have,"so i'm naturally kind of bitchy already but i'm so much more of a bitch when i get hurt, well if i'm not having a panic attack and if i am i just go silent and will occasionally breath out a bit loudly because my brain knows that in public rapid breathing and collapsing to the floor isn't an option, ok so anyway i'm bitch when i'm hurt but i developed that because when i was about 6-7 i was the main target in my school for anything from insults to physical violence, but i realised that being bitchy made people stay away from me because idk 7 yr olds r stupid, but then when i moved i realised i didn't need that anymore but i still have that defence but when your 14 nobody stays away from you if your a bitch, their just bitchy too and it's really annoying because i can tell if someone's emotions have changed even if it's just over text but i can't take jokes or any type of insult because i'll think about it for days until my conclusion ends up as something that i'll just have a mental breakdown over, so that being said i don't think jokes are my thing, and the annoying thing about me is i can never talk about shit to anyone because i don't like making my shit someone else's problem

630,A Very Sad Journal Entry,[removed]
631,Throwing a bottle into the ocean,"&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post on reddit and I don't even know if anyone's going to read this.

I'm not really sure what to do or how to say this... so here goes nothing.

(also warning: this is going to be quite lengthy) 

I used to have two really close friends. One was a classmate (let's call her X), one was what you'd call an ""online friend"" (let's call her Y).

I've known Y for two years and X for one. Y and I are having issues for over a year now. I keep getting jealous every time she makes a new close friend, and I keep feeling like I'm going to get replaced or abandoned. I tend to interpret her behavior in the worst possible ways, but my paranoia always feels justified when I'm hurt. I often get into fights with her, usually starting with me getting passive-aggressive and sarcastic because of something she did. I recently found out that I'm showing symptoms of BPD but my parents won't take me to a psychologist, so I've got to deal with it by myself. I'm very sensitive to trivial things, and usually Y doesn't even know she's upset me until I start sounding passive-aggressive. I've been trying to stop this destructive behavior of mine, but it feels like I have zero control over the anger when I get into a triggered mood. But Y and I are still amazing friends and super close and we talk every day.

Now, about X... our friendship started with late-night texting and bunking school twice. We got pretty close in a short period of time, and she has helped me a lot in character development. She helped me overcome my acrophobia, and always somehow managed to lift my spirits when I was down. She gave me the push I needed to start speaking up in class and getting out of my introvert-box, and we've always been there for each other throughout the year. I think I might've even caught feelings for her, but that's not very relevant here. 

Around May this year, I got into a really bad fight with Y. It's our worst fight of all time. She told me she didn't love me anymore, and I felt like the friendship's over. She was just saying that in the heat of the moment, but I took it to heart. And naturally... I got suicidal. I started googling for suicide methods and stuff like that. Anyways so I texted X a short goodbye message, and she freaked out and contacted me and I didn't do anything stupid that night. The next day, Y and I made up and things were okay once again. 

But ever since then, X completely changed. I was still feeling horrible, and I really needed her emotional support. But she kept distancing herself from me. Told me that ""I don't care if you live or die. Suicide is for the weak and if you want to do it, do it."" I didn't take her words to heart. She started coming online less often. I kept asking her to try to make some more time for me, but she said she was busy with studies, She and I used to watch shows together, and now she started watching another show by herself. She would tell me she didn't have the time to talk to me, but that didn't stop her from binging on tv shows and fangirling about the actor?? I was very hurt, and I felt like she didn't care about me. She reassured me and said that everything's fine, she's just busy, and ""every time you hit a snag you think everything's over"" and that calmed me down.

Things only went downhill after that. X would be active on group-chats, but barely in our DMs. My usual random messages about how my day's going would be met with 2-word replies. I started to get so bothered about this friction between me and X, I stopped getting triggered with Y like I used to. X was the only person on my mind. 

As things kept going downhill, X started hinting on us being apart. She'd vaguely talk about how ""sometimes you have to leave something behind to move forward"". Then one day she said that ""you are you and I am me and we are apart."" That hurt a ton. I couldn't figure out what went wrong, how she just changed overnight like this. If there was a problem, surely she'd try to talk things through and try to fix it instead of fucking ending the relationship, right? 

And then she blocked me one day, and we didn't talk for a month. It was one awful month. I was scared shitless, but I didn't think it was final. Given how close we were and how great things were between us and how we had plans for the future, surely she wouldn't be leaving me forever? I held on to that hope, but boy I've never been more wrong. 

When our exam results came out, we talked. She asked me to show her my marksheet. No ""how're you?"" or anything of that sort. Her exams were over and she was supposed to be free now. But she still was as distant as ever, keeping me on read every now and then. She used to NEVER keep me on read before. She wasn't interested in talking to me at all. She didn't care about me. 

We classmates met up soon after that, because our high school's over and we'll all be moving to different countries. As a parting present, I made her a booklet. The first few pages contained a written message to her. The next pages were taped shut, and she was instructed to open them the next year. And the next pages on the year after that, and so on. I had left messages to her for the next 7 years. It had lots of our inside-joke references, funny doodles, everything. The paper was yellow, the same paper we used before to give each other our doodles. I had a bunch of additional gifts, everything a symbolic reminiscence of our beautiful memories. 

She and I were supposed to meet an hour before the official meeting time so that we two could spend some time alone in person. I remember standing there, leaning on the railing, staring at the entrance of the mall, wondering when she'd show up. She didn't, at least not until it was the official time of the hangout. She had stood me up. What I felt more than anything, more than the hurt and sadness, was embarrassment. Here I was, ready with a lovely gift and my heart on a platter, and there she was, making it abundantly clear that she wanted to have to do nothing with me. 

Later that day, after she opened the gifts at home, she texted me. Apparently, the gifts had got her sentimental. She was talking to me normally, how we always used to talk. She felt like the girl I loved, not the distant version of her. She said she'd try to spend more time and talk normally and give us a shot. 

2 days later she officially ended the friendship. ""Frenemyship"" was the term we preferred, because we constantly used to tease each other. ""The frenemyship is history now"" is what she said. 

I couldn't control my facial expressions that day, and mom saw me crying. I told her all about what happened, something I never do. Parents were supportive on the first day. The next day, they saw me crying and got mad at me. They yelled at me and said it's all my fault and that X must've been a lover, or else I wouldn't be crying so much over a broken friendship. Parents made me feel a thousand times worse. This was September 1st.

The next two weeks, I was numb. The numbness was a protective wall around me, a dam that kept me safe from the flood of emotions. Every time there was a crack in the walls, I did everything I could to fix it. I spent my days trying to distract myself every moment of the day. Watching shows, studying, exercising, etc. I still was physically affected- I'd wake up with a strange heaviness in my chest every day, I got nauseous at the mere thought of food, and I threw up my breakfast every morning. I'd get headaches, sudden intense chest pain (often concentrated in the left side) and dizziness. 

I started distancing myself from all friends, I left Instagram (where X and I mainly talked). I stopped listening to songs because they make me feel bad. Sometimes everything around me felt like a dream. The lights, the walls, my parents, none of it felt real. This happened every time I tried to think about the finality of my friendship with X. I couldn't wrap my head around it. 

How could you go from being such close friends to strangers? How could someone change so drastically overnight? It doesn't feel possible.  

It's 3rd October today. And I'm still every bit of the mess I was a month ago. I've lost my numbness now. I'm an emotional wreck. I cry for hours every day, and I can't function. I can't concentrate on my studies. I keep feeling like it's somehow my fault that X lost interest in me. I've started cutting myself. I feel like a piece of trash. My self-esteem has never been this low. When my friends try to tell me that it's X's fault and not mine, I don't believe it. 

Surely I must've been lacking in something, or else she wouldn't have left me and stayed friends with everyone else, right? I see her talking on group-chats, she's doing perfectly fine. She sounds normal, she's watching shows with other friends and enjoying life. She doesn't care about me, at all. And I'm still in fucking denial, waiting for her to come back. 

I can't get over her. Correction: I don't *want* to get over her. I'd rather stay heartbroken and miserable than to get over her and become indifferent to our memories together. I don't know what to do, I just want my friend back. 

And I can't vent it to anyone. I used to talk to Y about it, but she just sounds annoyed with it now. I don't know what to do, and I feel unbearably lonely and sad. Life feels awful from all directions. We're not doing well financially. Parents specialize in making me feel terrible. All my friends are going to cool countries for university. I've got 4 A\*s in my IAL and yet I can't go to a good university in an english-speaking country because they're overly expensive for international students. I'll have to go back to my home country and the syllabus there is very different, and I'm having to study 2 years of studies in a few months now. My mental health is at its worst, and I won't be getting any professional help anytime soon. I was excited to go to university and finally be free, but I'll have to keep on living with my parents. 

I feel completely hopeless and lost and abandoned and worthless. I don't know how to deal with everything."
632,loud sounds / noises give me anxiety,idk if this is the right place to say this but im so exhausted :( i hate it when the house is silent n i hear my dad’s room’s door open/close. i hate hearing the sound of his footsteps through the house. i can’t sleep n i always get super aware of wherever he is n it’s so tiring. my mom’s asleep downstairs alone n my mind is making up so many horrible scenarios abt what he could be doing to her n i feel sick. i just want to sleep but i won’t be able to unless i feel like she’s actually safe. i don’t feel normal n i feel like this takes up so much of my energy i wake up w the worst headache every day :( im just scared n tired n this nightmare won’t end
633,I don't know if I can go on,I lost the love of my life and she said  I don't make her happy I failed her as her caregiver her boyfriend her husband and she was the only woman who I cared about and loved more than anything in the entire universe and galaxy and who kept me together and gave me the strength to push on my heart is gone and broken and I already was having a hard time keeping my self together because of physical problems and detirating mental health and my happiness is just gone and I feel like I have a massive whole in my heart 💔💔💔 and if there is someone or somebody to talk to just please reach out to me I don't want to worry my family or friends

635,"My happiness is tied to finding love and it’s making me anxious, panicky and depressed","I have so much to be grateful for. Every day that I wake up, I recognize that I have a decent life (or at least, decent as it be can be for someone who has worked very hard to be where they are). But unfortunately, I can’t help feeling lonely and empty because I don’t have the one and only thing I’ve wanted my whole life - romantic love.

From my post history, you’ll notice that I recently posted abt how this is taking a toll on my physical health. I sm not hungry, I can’t sleep. The very second I wake up, I instantly feel lonely and empty and then start to feel anxious, panicky, snd fearful that I may never find love. I’m not getting any you get and for each day that goes by, I feel like that’s one day less of me living my dream.

I’ve been very fortunate to have people respond to my posts to help. One reoccurring response I noticed was “focus on yourself. Love yourself and take care of yourself, and everything else will follow”

My question for you is, how? How do I love myself? We’re in the middle of a pandemic, so it’s not as easy as joining some sort of sports club, etc. Also, I work two jobs, so naturally that’s not something I’d be able to do anyways. I don’t have much time in a day, so what are some small things I can do to feel better about myself? To love myself, and be happy for everything I do have, and being happy for others?

Right now, I’m building resentment towards everyone around me because every single person around me is in a relationship, engaged, married, having kids. Whether it’s at work or while hanging out with a group of friends. Heck, even at the grocery store or the park, I see couples everywhere and it hurts me so much! My mind has completely been taken over by the fact that I’m single. Even at work, when I have some inbetween time or break (basically when I’m not actively engaged in doing a particular task), my mind goes into that deep hole of why I’m not happy. When I’m driving home after work, I think about my loneliness. Even when I eat, or brush my teeth or shower, literally every second of the day, my thoughts are consumed abt feeling so sad and hurt.

Please help ! I hate feeling this way :( I want to be happy."

1. the move back home goes smoothly
2. mental health continue to improve in it own way
3. lastly wish for a good job opportunity in the near future

Now my therapy for the day. For some reason, my mind been dangling my childhood insecurity in my face. Had a wtf moment then wave it out of the air. Its about my family dismissing and waving me off. Like they want my son and my husband company but not me. almost my being there is a nuisance.

Which I told myself first off I know my husband ( or at least I hope) will defend me and secondly its not going to be hard goin no contact if needed and I have told my husband before and he said something similar.

Thats all I can think of, thank you guys for reading :)"
639,Why do people say I turned into a jerk when I've always been a jerk I'm just tired of pretending now?,"Like, huh?"
640,Why can’t people peacefully choose to pass away?,"I’m at the point to where I’ve accepted that this is what I want. Basically, I turned 20 last weekend and I am just not where I want to be and see no way of getting there. I’ve been chronically depressed for over a decade now, exhausting therapy and medication routes as well as less traditional methods. My brain doesn’t work the way a brain is supposed to. That’s how it is. I can’t change this. I’m in a constant battle with myself, and for what? To wake up tomorrow and do it again? I realize I’m luckier than most, I have a wonderful partner who puts the sun in the sky and has been my everything for the last three and a half years, but he’s not enough anymore. I still love him very much but I want so much more for him. He’s the best person I’ve ever met and for the better part of a year now I’ve convinced myself that he will eventually leave me for someone who reciprocates the joy he brings to life, unlike me. (Despite the fact that he has assured me that would never happen.) If given the choice, I’d do it right. Tell the people that I love how much they mean to me and thank them for the time they gave me, and leave peacefully. 

When things don’t work right, we try to fix them, when they’re not fixable, we don’t use it anymore. I’m not useful, I can’t be fixed, and this is the way it is."

643,Not sure wether I should seek outside help,"Let me just start by saying; this might not be the right thread and I apologize. 

I’m 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 21. We’ve been dating for a little over 2 years and I seem to always have problems with insecurities and jealousy to a very bad extent to the point where I don’t know what to do anymore. Even right when we started dating, I’d always have this same issue. Let me explain. I don’t have many friends and I’m more of a introverted guy. My girlfriend is extroverted and lots of people love to talk to her. Since were always spending time together and at work(we work together) she’s always usually talking to someone, coworker, friend, and I feel somewhat left out. She’s always laughing and cracking jokes with friends and i feel like I’m just there in a shadow. I know that this is wrong and I shouldn’t even be feeling this way. She’s being herself and she enjoys others company. Why should I feel jealous of this. This is my first girlfriend and to be together for 2 years already to me feels like I did something right, but with my behavior, insecurities and jealousy, I feel like it’s starting to take a toll on her health and even mine. 

Let me give you guys more examples, when she’s talking to a friend, or anyone, she usually likes to be very engaged into conversations and will not ignore me, but won’t talk to me for a while. This is totally normal for anyone, but to me, I get super anxious and jealous and feel like she doesn’t care about me or I can super insecure and think she enjoys talking and spending time with others. What she’s doing is not wrong at all. I understand that what she’s doing isn’t wrong, yet I still get extremely insecure and jealous and it tends to reflect in my behavior and attitude and she sees it all the time. 

In any normal relationship, A girl would’ve broken up with me, and I’m 100% positive about that. She stuck with me for 2 years already though my bullshit. She really is the one. How do I not fuck this up. We’ve had so many conversations about our future together, but when i seem to feel insecure and jealous, it actually makes me physically feel different and I tend to overlook every conversation we’ve had and think about a lot of bad things, like “what if I just ended it” which would be the most terrible decision of my life. I say I love her and I really feel like I do, but with the way I act, do I really? This is been going on for so long and I really feel like I need some kind of mental help. 

I know many of you that will read this will say to just man the fuck up, but I genuinely do want advice and how I can change myself. I don’t want to mess up something that could be amazing for me. Please. 

Thanks for reading.

644,Suicide shouldn’t be a taboo and let’s be real honest that most of the time people only really give a shit after the fact when they can make it about themselves.,"“What did **I** miss?”

“I know we haven’t spoken in years but me me me.”

Here’s a thought, they were suffering and now they’re not.  Likely suffering immensely for a long time with constant pain you possibly couldn’t imagine.  The despair, disappointments, anger, arguments, loneliness, anxiety, physical problems, fatigues...  and that’s the short list of things they’ve felt like for years and looking to feel for the remainder of their lives.

And no, there’s not much you can do.  And by experience most people just makes you feel like shit eventually.  You want to save the suicidal?  Be a friend to someone who is majorly depressed.  It’s not too hard, you’ll likely rarely see them.  If you want, you could go hard mode in being a friend by dealing with the “toxic” nature of their disease until they’re remembered more for that than the “I didn’t see it coming” type of memory.

Suicide is a choice and the only thing you really can control about life.  Stop making people feel guilty about ending their pain or turn it around about yourself."
645,Anxiety with first year of undergrad,"I just started my (F,20yrs) undergrad (pharmaceutical/ chemical engineering) and I have been feeling overwhelmed by the amount of coursework I have. I get so frustrated when I can’t understand a concept or if I got the questions for my homework wrong. i started breaking down internally and kept thinking why can’t I understand it when it seems like everyone else can? Because I keep getting things wrong I started feeling unmotivated cause I feel like no matter what, I wont get it and I start wondering why I am even in this programme. 

Even before joining this programme I wondered if I am even capable of getting job in this field since I never felt qualified enough to do well in it (I have this mentally for all sorts of things, not just University matters)

Moreover, Ive been completely alone in University. I already have social anxiety to begin with but with the covid pandemic, most of my classes, are online. Everyone else in my classes have cliques cause they enrolled with their friends but all my friends went to really prestigious schools (This is something else that made me feel kinda unmotivated and sad) so whenever I have to go to campus, I would be sitting all alone or be the last person to form a group. I ended up skipping some of my my onsite classes cause I wanted to avoid my issues although I know that’s just making things worse. 

Lately I’ve just been internally breaking down due to anxiety with trying to cope with my coursework and anxiety with having to go to campus, knowing that I will be alone. It started to affect my health cause when I’m anxious I can’t eat or I’ll puke it out and the lack of eating has made me faint a couple times and given me a chronic headache.

Strangely enough, even though I have been breaking down, I can’t seem to cry? I would look stoic or be on a verge of tears and I want to let loose but I can’t. Is there a term for that? 

TL;DR

Sorry for the long text you guys but thanks for reading. Feel free to give me advice if you have any"
646,i dont know,"(bad english)

i felt very alone. yes i still have my parents and my friends and my teachers but they feel like an empty figures to me. i dont speak or talk about my problems and worries to them bcs often time they will feel really really weird about it bcs, well, im one of those happy go lucky people on the outside. tbh im really not. i did a great job at hiding my feelings. which is not a good thing but again, i just couldnt talk out my feelings to other without being bothersome and a burden. it slowly killing me. i just really wish i have someone that i could talk for as long as i want. 

as an introvert, it make sense to other people for me being silence all day a few time bcs thats what an introvert do. but on the inside im rotting away. and thats also why all people around doesnt really care about whats happening with me. no one checks on me everyday. no one ask me how am i( i started to cry here). and yeah i cried a lot now like random time throughout the day. and it feel sucks. 

i also feel like im not enough. u know, i am considered as one of the top students at school ( like number 4 out of all students) but my parents doesnt show a lot of interest at it. they just went ""oh good, nice"" and thats all. i dont know what i can do anymore to make them feel proud of me. 17 years of living and not a single moment they show that they proud of something that their son achieved. just because, they didnt see me struggling studying for all that. they see me as naturally smart or capable or whatever. my friends are also kinda like them. just because i showed big energy, made jokes that everyone laughs and overall just gave positive vibes doesnt mean i dont have any struggle at all especially with my mental health. no one, cares for me. on top of that, im having my big an important exam starting tmr but i havent done any single revision because i really lacks motivation. parents dont care about me so why should i care about myself. even if i aced on it, its useless to me. i dont care about my future. 

i felt suicidal nowadays. i almost give up on life. no one loves me. im just a burden and dont deserve to live. i am a useless person that only bring problems by just existing. maybe there are still hope but the tunnel is still dark to me."
647,Seeing groups of friends hang out on social media makes me spiral,"When I was in high school I got ostracized pretty roughly by a group of friends, I was ignored, not invited to parties, most social situations I feel like I'm ignored.  I have trouble making friends. I only have one good friend and I hardly hang out with her. We mostly just communicate via our phones. 

Ever since then I have never had a group of friends or experienced that. I have friends that are individuals sure but never a solid group. I think as someone who can't accept themselves I have always wanted to be accepted by a group of people who are my age (18-24). Not only that, I can also acknowledge that I can be more open and talkative as a person but sometimes my anxiety and depression just simply doesn't let me. 

So in effort to keep myself from feeling like I am worthless I deleted basically all of my social media apps, besides this one...but I digress. I haven't been on Instagram in literally years but my old account is still up and I logged in to search for something but immediately I was flooded with people from high school and ""influencers"" who are all around my age hang out with friends. Some people going on date nights, some people hanging out together at Halloween mazes. Some people sleeping over at each other's houses. I immediately deleted the app. 

It's like a slap in the face, not only because of everything going on this year but the fact that I have to sit alone in my room all bitter and jealous. I just WISH I could get out of this situation, it's like I'm screaming at myself on the inside. And yes I understand this is a pandemic for sure...and excuse my selfish self but that doesn't make me feel any less lonely or depressed. 

And then I start spiraling and feeling this deep hatred and anger towards myself for not being able to make friends, be lively and fun, and be experiencing all of these things that others are doing. Then I start criticizing every little detail I hate about my personality, my behavior, my appearance to the point where I don't even feel like a person anymore. 

I haven't gotten hours from my job in literally a month and my car has been getting fixed for the past month (thank god it will be back soon, and that I got a new job though). 

Usually I have a last point to this but I don't...I literally hate my brain but I'm going to start trying to force myself into social situations (doesn't have to be in person and yes I can be safe). It's the only way I can feel ""less worse"" ya know?"
648,I can’t see the positives,"I’ve had ongoing mental health issues and lived with anxiety and depression for a long time. I have a loving partner, a beautiful puppy, a home and my dream car but I’m completely empty.

I hate my puppy for not behaving properly and never praise her, I ignore my partners help and feel empty and don’t give the attention she deserves and the car is a mess. I can’t remember the last time I washed it or had the energy. It recently got scratched and I’m mortified and only focus on it and get angry at myself, needing to break this cycle and see the positives but do t know where to start."
649,As soon as I think i’m getting better everything just goes downhill,I recently went through a breakup. And although it was a very toxic relationship she was my rock and I could tell her nearly everything. Now I don’t have that. Today I had a really anxious day and I feel like I talk to my friends too much about shit and I really don’t know what to do other then cry in my bed until my brain shuts off. Meds help but they don’t always help and it just sucks because I really believed they would help me live a normal life. I’m really just sad and i’m over it.

652,Coping mechanism? (Possible tw-alcoholism),"I feel that I deal with trauma by pretending that it didn’t happen, forgiving the other person and moving on but when it happens again, I’m just as hurt as I was the first time but I just let it go. For example, my dad is an alcoholic and when he gets angry and starts yelling and cursing and saying super hurtful things, it’s painful to experience that but I just accept it and pretend that it’s not real but I’m never surprised when it happens again. There’s never an apology either. He seems to think that paying for something for me is an apology. Does anyone else do this? Is this normal?"
653,"I hate myself, I wish I was dead","I've finally reached the point that I've realised I'm not okay but I'm scared to talk to the people I know as I'm worried about what will happen if I do.

I've been struggling with my mental health for years. I've always struggled with anxiety, feeling like I'm not good enough, I have no self confidence, I feel like I'm a failure, I hate speaking to new people or being in new situations or going to new places. Everytime I have to speak to people I try and plan it out in my head, I stress about what to say and I always worry I'm going to say the wrong thing and embarass myself. I remember all the stupid things I've ever said and I think about them all the time and I worry what people must think of me. I hate to be alone and would happily spend all my free time with friends or doing things but I would never have the confidence to ever ask someone if they wanted to do something, I fear rejection or that people don't actually like me and won't want to spend time with me, I feel like people only put up with me becuase they feel they have to, I don't want to be a burden to them. I'm heavily overweight which means I struggle to do things physically and I'm really insecure about it, I always think that thats all people see when they see me. I'm used to all this, I've felt this way for years but this year everything just seems to have got worse with lockdown etc.
At the beginning of the year my Gran passed away unexpectedly, I was really close to her and it completely broke me. For the first few months I just cried all the time, I've got a lot better now and I probably only cry about it once a week but maybe thats just becuase im busy crying about other things now.
Also, my gran was essentially the main carer for my Grandpa, so since she died my family has had to step up and care for him. We were hoping to get carers in to at least do some of it but then coronavirius hit and we were put into lockdown and my auntie felt that it would be safer for him that we continue to care for him during the pandemic. My auntie also seems against the idea of carers in general, I understand her reservations and that it is her Dad and he doesn't want strangers in his house etc. I love my Grandpa very much and would of course still go round at least once a week for a couple of hours to see him and spend time with but as a 25 year old I don't want to have to spend most of my free time caring for him. I am not a carer it's just not the sort of person I am and it is not something I want to do at all. It is also embarrassing for him having his granddaughters put him to bed and change him if he's had an accident etc etc. Also the way that the caring works is my auntie does a rota and there are 2 shifts per day, one in the day time and one in the evening, they are at set times so that people can do his meals and medicine etc but due to the hours I work it means I can only do my shifts on my days off from work.
I live with my parents at the moment whilst I'm trying to save up for a house. My parents love me very much and I am very fortunate for everything they do for me but I don't get on with my mum very well. Moving home from university was hard for all of us, I lost all my independence and privacy. My mum is always asking me where am I going, when will I be home etc etc. I don't want to have to lie to her but I also don't want her to know everything I'm doing or everyone I'm meeting, sometimes I may be going on a first date and I don't want that pressure of everyone knowing etc. I know she means well but I definitely need a bit of privacy and freedom. My mum is hard work, she constantly has a go at everyone for anything they do. She always thinks that people are out to get her and that anything you say is a personal attack at her. She is manipulating and makes me feel like I don't do enough and that I'm not good enough. It's got to the point where it's just easier to hide in my room when I'm at home as otherwise I just get yelled at.
It has now been 6 months of doing nothing but going to work and caring for my Grandpa, I do nothing else and I feel like I'm at breaking point. I can't remember the last time I had fun or enjoyed myself or was happy. Everything I was looking forward to has been cancelled and I can't see that changing anytime soon. So now all I do with my life when not working or caring for my Grandpa is sit in bed and cry.
I attended university and I have got a degree and a masters in engineering however I have been unable to get a job since leaving university and have ended up working an admin job. I know I am very fortunate to have a job at all and I'm very grateful as I have met some great people working there and someone who I consider to be my best friend (whether she feels the same I highly doubt). I've been trying to look for better jobs but due to covid there is not much available and I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't think I will ever get an engineering job, my grades aren't good enough, I have no experience and I now have a year out doing completely unrelated work. I worry about money a lot as if I carry on working where I currently work my wage will likely never go over about £20,000 and I will struggle to get a mortgage on that wage alone. I really want to move out of my parents and I think my mum and I will get on a lot more if I do but I get depressed thinking about the future and if I will ever be able to afford to.
I don't really have many friends and I understand why no-one would want to be friends with me, I'm depressing and just a hassle to everyone. 

The point of this is I genuinely believe that it would be easier for everyone if I was dead. I think about dying a lot, I don't think about killing myself I'm too scared and too much of a wuss to ever do that, but I wish I was just in an accident or something. It truly would be best for everyone if I was no longer around."

655,My mom is kicking me out because I got a septum piercing.,"Mom wants to kick me out because I got a septum piercing

I’m 18F and I live at my mom’s (I am already moving out in a month). Yesterday I got a septum piercing without my mom knowing and she reacted extreme. She told me I either pull the piercing out or leave home by tomorrow (which is today). I told her I am gonna leave. I don’t want her to think she has power over me. 

Me and my mom already have a bad history. When I was struggling with depression she emotionally neglected me and told me many times I should kill myself and leave her house. She has screamed at my on the top of her lungs many times before. I have arranged every small thing in my life myself and she cannot stand my independence. 

I do see a psychologist but because it’s the weekend, I can’t get in contact. 

I already arranged that I could stay at a friend’s house until I move out to the place I am going to in a month. 

My mom doesn’t give me much freedom at all. I of course understand that I live under her roof and that I have to follow her rules (for example get home before it gets dark). But what I do with my body she can’t control it since I am already 18. 

My brother sided with her (BTW he has 5 tattoos himself) and told me I am not his sister anymore and when I move out to the place (he didn’t know I was moving out in a month but my mom told him yesterday after she discovered I got my septum piercing even though I had told her many times before not to tell him) I am dead to him. He said I cannot move out and that I am staying here. My mom was against the idea too. My psychologist and youth coach told me they are holding me back from my development and that moving out would help me a lot but my brother and mom don’t understand that. 

They are both really controlling and it stops me from doing what makes me happy. 

They are both currently still sleeping and I am scared what kind of drama is gonna start happening when they are awake. I am a first year university student and I want to focus on my school work and I am scared I won’t be able to do that because of their aggression. 

But my question is, did I really do something wrong from another POV?"
656,I don't know what to think?,"Well, I don't know what to think and I scared myself a little bit, I just suddenly grabbed a knife that was next to me and had some suicidal thoughts like some scary thoughts and I don't know hat to make of them. It's not like I was sad a the moment or depressed just doing some homework and the grabbed it and started thinking about how I should kill myself and how easily I could do it. I don't know if this is serious or a one-time thing can someone give some advice?"
657,Not sure if this is the right place,"People have mentioned that at times i have the urge to say random stuff in an attempt to make people laugh.
An example of this is in a room with my friends i may say something like ‘Would you ever have sex with a midget’ or something really random.
Now i’m not sure if this is because i have ASD and it’s something connected to that but i can never figure out why i do it"

662,Does anyone have any tips for managing overstimulation?,"Hello!! 

It’s been a rough few weeks and I know I’m burning out. Unfortunately I’m in no position to quit working so I’m trying to lean on my therapist, friends, family. The one thing no one seems to understand is the overstimulation and anxiety. 

For example, I went into the grocery store last night and with kids screaming, music, people talking, lights flickering, weird smells... my brain literally just shut down. I thought I was going to start screaming and I had to wear noise cancelling headphones (which then made me totally unaware of the people around me and I’m not a fan of that). 

Anyways my therapist cancelled 5 minutes before our last appointment and I can’t see her for another month. So I just don’t know how to manage the overstimulation and I’m worried I’ll pass out in a store. Anyone have any tips?"

Im sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to go to, I dont even know how to google this so this was the only place I could think of.. I struggle with these persistent specifc fears related to specific actions/activities. Here are the most prominent ones, I'm scared to enter bathrooms, mainly public ones, because I always think ill see someone hanging in the room/stall. I'm scared to get close to windows because I always think a person will pop out and try to break in. Lastly I get scared to go near my parents room because I always think I'll see either one of my parents with their brains blown out.. I think theres more but those are my best examples and I dont know what to do.. these thoughts scare me, are these normal or is there a name for thoughts like these?

665,Need advice,"Soooo over the corona virus period, my anxiety levels increased, it affected my work, my focus and although it’s has *slightly* improved after school opening, and the fact that I’m attending Counselling, I still feel like I need a solution to help these problems of anxiety related thoughts coz they are re-occurring, like it’s great having someone to vent to and help with mindfulness, but I definitely know there’s a difference between a CBT therapist and a counselor? 
If anyone can help me should I go for CBT therapy?"
666,Feeling ehh,"I am struggling with a stable mood &amp; motivation etc. 

I don’t feel awful right now, but I’m not happy, I just don’t feel like doing anything and I hate myself for it. It makes me feel so unstable and inconsistent. The way I am really right now is that nothing is really worth doing &amp; life is just so boring &amp; that makes me feel I’m doing something wrong. 

The worst part is that I have times when I feel the complete opposite &amp; then intense mood changes are so exhausting. Going back and forth from wanting to do so many things &amp; not do anything is draining. 

I don’t know if anyone can relate, any advice on how i can manage this is appreciated."
667,Found out my mom was schizophrenic this entire time,"My brother and I have told me dad and I something is seriously wrong with my mom for years. She showed signs of bipolar disorder (extreme mood swings, anger management issues, manipulative behavior) growing up. As she’s become elderly, she has lost all sense of time. She will stay up until 5am and sleep until 1pm, extreme depression issues, social isolation all on top of the issues listed above. 

My father was recently diagnosed with serious cancer, and he finally told me yesterday after 42 years that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago. I’m assuming he left out the bipolar disorder because, as Hs always been the case, he decided to look the other way or ignore the symptoms and act like everything is fine.

I’m worried about my own mental health. I’m ADHD which they also decided not to help me medicate growing up, and I manage it. I do feel socially isolated bc of Covid, but don’t believe I have showed signs of failing to maintain relationships. I am also angry with my father for never taking the time to deal with this. Being the oldest, I was the whipping boy for years and my dad had plenty of chances to get my brother and I away from her, but in my opinion he just didn’t want to alone and didn’t want to be bothered with my moms issues.

Someone tell me why I’m wrong, and thanks for listening. This isn’t exactly easy to talk to my friends about, and my brother is like my dad he doesn’t want to take the time to reflect or discuss."
668,"Struggle with laziness, morality, and organization? chemical imbalance?","First off, months ago my mom told me a story about my learning issues growing up, or more so, my lack of motivation for doing basic things. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was three/four, I knew how to speak. I just didn't want to because...why speak when you can get everything you want by simply pointing, right?  My mom took me to this doctor and apparently I was written off as lazy and I needed to be encouraged to speak more, which worked but I was still never a talkative child. If anything, I enjoyed making random noises. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then when I did speak, maybe around 5 and on up, I needed reward systems to do the simplest things. Like cleaning my room, or making a good grade, or simply to enjoy something that I never wanted to do in the first place. Like, to continuously sleep in my own bed/clean my room, I promised that a new tv in my room would solve it. Of course that didn't work but I got a tv and didn't have to wait until Christmas to get it.  This sort of thing happened continuously and it was the easiest route to get what I wanted and simply motivated me. 

I never truly enjoyed much. I was happy but nothing ever truly connected where my happiness was at a constant. I'd get something and throw it away afterwards because the enjoyment of having it wore off and I seeked a new high. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, anxiety, depression and the inability to focus had completely came in. Lack of organizational skills. Everything I touched just became a mess, literally. I was on meds and nothing seemed to have worked. I found hobbies only to realize that I wasn't good at them only after trying once, and just stopped doing them all together.  I felt numb about a lot of things and was hard to manipulate situations, if I'm being honest. I couldn't move things the way that I wanted and felt pushed into a corner. It was not a happy time for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In college. I  never fully had the idea panned out until one morning, after graduating High school, my mom woke me up to apply to my nearest CC. I picked the closest thing I was good at within the 10 minute time span. During the Bio courses, I realized that  I had an idealization of dreaming about what I could be and how I would do it yet, the motivation never settled in. I got bored easily. Couldn't focus. The classes demanded a lot  and I wasn't given anything in return, and it was a lot easier to cheat or have someone else do the work for me. I'm going on age 22 and I'm still in college for some reason. Today I have assignments due and realized that I don't want to do them at all! I would drop them if the money I spent wasn't looming over my head. I don't care, much about anything. I just like taking an easier  route just as I do for everything else. 

My father and his side is just like this but my mothers side of the family is completely different. A lot of my fathers family are criminals because they like easy, fast, bunches of money, they're very emotionally aloof, take easiest routes of everything and just cold people in general.  I did something at a place I won't reveal that was a federal offense and luckily, I was just let go. It involved money and I was tired of putting in stress, and spending hours I felt like being alone, to do something I never really wanted to do, and being paid low wage for it... if you know what I did then, you get the drift. 

I have no idea why I'm like this, but I am.  I've tried to do things the right way, go through the processes, but I cannot operate that way at all! I hate processes. If there's an easier way to do things, I will do them. If there's a shortcut, I'll take it, even if it means deceiving others."
669,Do I Need Help?,"I've had these awful thoughts at night for the last two years and they'd be varied. Happen maybe once or twice a month but lately they're happening almost every night.

&amp;#x200B;

I make up these thoughts and issues that paralyse me with fear. The other day, I made up that I might not have referenced something properly last year in uni and that my degree will get revoked years after I graduate. That then spiralled into a other awful thoughts which got worse and worse, all relating to the original thought. I couldn't distract myself with my phone anymore because the thoughts were overwhelming so I had to force myself to sleep. I contacted my tutors to ask for help and they assured me that I'm seriously overthinking things and that I'm perfectly fine. That's a common theme here, I've been told I overthink a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thought I had multiple times was when I'd think 'what if I hit someone's car and didn't realise it and then go to prison for a hit and run'. It's just these random irrational and disruptive thoughts that hit me sometimes and terrify me. I would have to check my dashcam everytime I finished a journey to check that I didn't hit anything, I have to check places in my room to make sure stuff is still there, I'm so sick and tired of these thoughts and problems that are ruining my life. Everything just seems so awful these days like there's no hope for me, I don't see futures where I'm happy and content, I just see unnecessary worry which will destroy me.

672,Extremely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember and wish I was dead. Thoughts?,"This might be super long (I’m just gonna start writing and see where it takes me) but please bare with me. Here goes. I have been extremely unhappy the past few years and I am currently a sophomore in college. I have always struggled with severe depression and anxiety, and for a while I thought I was managing it pretty well. The first two years of high school I basically only had one friend who I would hang out with a lot. He was very popular and had a super pretty girlfriend, but we had been friends since kindergarten and he’s a great person so he stuck by my side despite my social awkwardness with others. I suppose I should mention that during the summer before freshman year of high school I had a stroke that required emergency brain surgery and 2 weeks of hospitalization. They don’t know for sure what caused it, but they are almost certain it was something that cannot possibly be recurring. Freshman year of high school I was extremely depressed and generally pretty out of it. I looked weird because my head was still shaved from surgery and I had a lot trouble in school and socially starting out. Even though my grades started out awful, I ended up fixing them later in the semester and received A’s in most of my classes. I was very proud of this and decided to make school my main focus (I just assumed the social stuff would come later). Even though freshman year was pretty awful and I was racked with anxiety and depression for all of it, I envy the person I used to be. I don’t remember who I was in middle school due to my injury, but freshman year of high school I remember being comfortable with the person I was. While I wasn’t satisfied with my situation, I had no issues being myself when I talked to others, and even though my social anxiety prevented me from trying to befriend these people I still remember having conversations with people where I connected with them. I also remember that social setbacks would make me sad, but they wouldn’t make me try to be a different person. Additionally, I would talk to my parents about everything, as that was my main coping mechanism.
Sophomore year was a blur, it was basically just freshman year but I was fully recovered from my injury and I begab working out so girls started noticing me. I was too nervous to do anything about it though. It was, however, still a source of pride for me, much like my grades. Additionally, lifting weights in my basement was very therapeutic and I always felt good afterwards. My best friend and I started smoking weed that summer and made some friends who did that as well, and this gave me confidence because I felt like I finally had a friend group. When I started smoking weed I immediately started doing it every night, sometimes with these people and sometimes by myself. It was a good way to fall asleep and gave me something to look forward to every day. This might be when I started losing the person I was, but the timeline in unclear. I did, however, stop talking to my parents about my problems and stop working out. I didn’t need those things anymore now that I had weed. 
Senior year is when my life started to really spiral, but I thought it was getting better. I started smoking weed all day, including at school. It did not really affect my grades so I figured it was fine. I also became sexually active and began drinking regularly. There was a girl who I hooked up with that year who I really liked, but I convinced myself I didn’t want to date her or anyone. My best friend told me I should do it because she was really attractive and I needed some emotional support but I didn’t listen and thought I could just keep hooking up because “relationships are gay”. She ended up losing interest at about the time I realized I wanted a relationship and that screwed me up. Later on in the year there was a party I went to hosted by my best friend and I felt super out of place. I felt like I was trying to be myself but none of the people (especially the girls) liked me. I went home and texted my friend that I’m hopelessly awkward and hated myself. Right now, I tell myself that I hate myself every day, but I don’t know if that mantra Started at that party or if it started before or whatever. However, I think I lost a piece of myself that night. I became much less inclined to to out because I felt like people wouldn’t like me. I started thinking about everything I said before I said it (or maybe it was before this that I started doing that, or after? The timeline like I said is unclear). Either way, at some point senior year I stopped believing in myself. I know it wasn’t Junior year because I worked at the beach as a lifeguard the previous summer and remember loving it and not constantly analyzing myself, but when I worked there the next summer I was always worried that someone didn’t like me which made me super shy. 
When I started college, I felt like everything was going to turn around. I hooked up with three girls the first week and felt like this could be the norm if I kept putting myself out there. Somewhere along the way I realized I hadn’t actually made any real friends, I had just been going out to bars and getting wasted. I felt like I could turn this around if I joined a fraternity, so this is what I spent the rest of the term doing. I knew someone in one of the fraternities and went over there quite frequently, but for some reason I wasn’t quite clicking with any of the guys. I felt like I was, but I think they could sense how fake and insecure I was. I no longer really had any interests or personality. For instance, I was super into philosophy in high school because I did debate and I genuinely loved reading and writing it. That was a huge hobby of mine, and for some reason I no longer could find any joy in learning about philosophy anymore. I didn’t know who I was anymore so how could a fraternity get to know me? I was also super preoccupied with not going to a low tier fraternity and was basically only rushing here because it was respectable and another one I was going to where I genuinely liked the guys wasn’t. I think they could sense that. Needless to say I didn’t get a bid from this fraternity but I got one from the lower tier one and declined it for fear of being judged. I was now just smoking weed all the time and experimenting with other drugs too because I was extremely depressed and just wanted to feel better. I don’t know exactly when I started having suicidal thoughts, but I definitely did when I was rejected from that fraternity. It was probably the worst I’ve felt in my life. I decided I wanted to transfer schools and then covid hit. 
I was sent home in march and had nothing to do besides do drugs and smoke weed. I only had a few friends back home I felt like I could talk to, and many others I felt I couldn’t connect with because I couldn’t be myself around them and I felt like they were constantly judging me. I think I fully lost who I was around that time. I was extremely depressed and weed didn’t even feel that good anymore. Everyone in my life was worried and even thought I had gotten into a school for transfer I still had the whole summer left and I didn’t know if I could make it. I just hated myself so much. I decided to go on a hiking trip with a camping organization to get away because I thought it would help me grow as a person and give me some time away from drugs and weed. I ended up hating it because I felt like all anyone on the trip did was make fun of me. This has been a fear of mine my whole life, that people only keep me around to make fun of me, and I felt awful that whole trip.
I started school a few months ago and it has been awful. There wasn’t even a honeymoon period where I was going out and meeting people and hooking up with girls like there was at my previous school. I was a little bit optimistic I could find myself here but I have basically no friends right now, and it is not because I’m not meeting people. Practically nobody here is actually observing covid distancing during social gatherings, and it seems like everyone I have met can see right through me. I basically just don’t even have a personality anymore. I thought that online rush would be an easy opportunity to just secure a spot in a house and then I could make friends there but nobody in fraternities here like me at all. Bid night is tomorrow and I have literally no houses that actually invite me to events. I also have no other friends who ask my to do things or who I feel comfortable reaching out to. It honestly feels like this was my last chance to be myself and college and make friends but I blew it. I’m honestly kicking myself because I feel like I should’ve just taken a gap year and gone to rehab but I feel like even if I do that next semester or next year it won’t matter because this isn’t a big school and I’ve met so many people already (many of whom are in greeklife), all who have already formed opinions about me. College seems like a burned bridge at this point and I just want to die. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to figure out who I am again, even if I’m not smoking weed (I didn’t for 50 days over the summer on that trip and performed awful socially). All I do right now is smoke weed and fantasize about killing myself. If I had some ketamine or xanax (my two drugs of choice) I would be abusing those too. My parents want to send me to rehab soon for drug addiction (mostly weed) but I don’t even know if that will work at this point. I think I’m too far gone. Either way, I don’t want to come back to this school where I feel like nobody likes me, but it would be super weird to transfer again. I think I’ve realized greek life just isn’t for me but it’s too late as I have joined another school where it is all anyone talks about. I honestly just wish that there wasn’t anybody in this world who cared about me so I could justify killing myself and hurt nobody else in the process. I guess rehab could be my last chance but I feel like it will be a bust just like everything else has been and I just don’t know what to do. Any advice welcome, I honestly feel like my life is over socially and I have nothing left to live for besides the people who care about me like my best friend and my family. And while I do appreciate them for their caring, I also resent them for it. I just want to to die and wish it wasn’t this complicated and I didn’t have to live just for other people. Fuck me."
673,i feel stressed with my school environment,"my school, teachers, classmates are stressing me out. i feel so pressured and anxious i literally just want to fail my classes and drop out. a year ago i also felt like this and what i did was i didn't attend classes 'til the end of the school year when my mom finally persuaded me to finish the school year and get homeschooled after (which didn't happen). i'm not being bullied, i actually interact with them a lot in class before, but now i feel very scared and repulsed by them to the point that i want to deactivate my social media accounts, break my phone, live in another place, and forget about them. i actually have a lot of friends, but they are included in the people who pressures me and affects me the most. tbh, there's only two i people i am comfortable with and we aren't even in the same class. i want to ask my parents to get homeschooled, but i'm concerned about the expenses and people might think i'm just overreacting. actually, i also think i'm overreacting, i don't know what to call this feeling when you don't want to talk or see anyone. school is starting soon and i am nowhere ready to see any of them. i am literally so confused on what to do right now, i just want to let this out."
674,"Feel like I didn’t sleep well but I did, according to my Apple Watch?","So I used my Apple Watch to track my sleep last night for the first time because I’ve been waking up often overnight and feeling like I’m not getting nearly enough sleep. I don’t feel rested in the morning, feel slightly sleep deprived etc. 
Well, according to my watch, I actually slept 8 hours? I fell asleep around 10:30pm. I know I did wake up at 1, 3, and then at 6 because I checked the time and my watch also showed me waking at those times so it seems accurate. I’m thinking although I slept almost 8 hours, it wasn’t a restful sleep due to waking those few times? Maybe I also need more than 8? Partly psychological too?? I wanna download an app that will show me if I’m in REM sleep etc. So any recommendations on that please comment too!

678,Overcoming irrational emotion,"Hi guys, thought I might reach out to someone to see if I can resolve this issue.  Over the year I realised my anxiety for failure has sky rocketed. When ever I'm confronted with mistakes I will be on verge of tear/red eye. This is irrational, but my body doesn't not respond to how I like it would. How does one connect their mind and body? It seems like my subconscious controls my body while my brain does the thinking. Should I seek medical attention?"
679,Struggling to have any life goals,"I feel like I’m restless in a limbo where I have no goals, motivation and can’t see my future. 

I don’t even want to do basic things like spend money on myself, watch Netflix, hang out with friends or anything . I get joy from nothing and see no point to life if I have no future to look forward to. But there isn’t anything I want. I don’t want kids or to buy a house.  There is just nothing I want in life and see no point to life. 

I’m seeing a psychologist but it’s not helping much. 

Can anyone relate to this and give me advice on how to overcome it?"
680,Meditation helps me to get rid of panic attacks," 

Hi friends, 

 I had also suffered a lot due to panic attacks and constant pain on the left side of my chest a few years back for taking heavy pressure on myself for managing my kid, family, and my official works.  

The situation was horrible because it was not possible for me to even talking or doing any work with my shaking hands during panic attacks.

The doctor did not prescribe me medicine but advised me to go to a psychologist for therapy. I took 3-4 meditation therapy, I was a little better and then the therapist advised me to do meditation regularly at home.   

After getting a very good result from doing regular meditation , I advised my friends and family members to do meditation and found that they have also got excellent results. This is not possible to share all experiences but I would like to share one or two experiences.

My mother was a patient with insomnia for the last 20 years, currently, she need not require to take sleeping pills. My husband has a tendency to forget everything and now he can remember every small thing also.

So, I thought to share the importance of meditation to the whole world and motivate all.  I follow a special type of meditation but today I will not share that method. But I would like to tell you the importance of meditation with the help of a [small interesting story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPP-TNv5vGQ&amp;t=4s)

681,I can't bring myself to go outside or talk to anyone - when does self isolation become too much?,"I'm in college, I have no roommate and I don't leave my dorm. I've started daydreaming and pretending I'm talking to fictional people or friends to make up for it but it's not enough. I hate loving people but having social anxiety. I can't imagine going outside to even get food, I'll just embarrass myself and I'm too depressed to leave anyways. The only time I go outside is to get food maybe once a week. The only people I've talked to are my counselor and my best friend, all virtually. I hate college and it hurts to know my parents don't care how I feel so I'll be stuck this way for 4 years. There has to be a greater part of life, but I've been made to feel like a prisoner because of my parents so I have yet to see it. I could've been employed by now with my cosmetology license and working in a salon or traveling, but it's my parent's future at this point, not mine. I don't know what to do anymore. My counselor has given me advice but there is not enough advice in the world to fix me. I wish I could sleep forever."
682,Feeling super not here,"I (18)(F) feel so dazed and numb and don’t wanna do anything but like not be here even though I’m not suicidal it’s still that feeling of nothingness and blank I don’t know what to do with myself. I can’t even spend time with my friends without feeling awkward and on edge now all the time I feel so boring and small talk and not fun I’m so in my head and depressed. I just want this to pass and be over but idk how to do that, anyone know what to do?"
683,Feeling alone at university,"Hi everyone 

I’m not entirely sure what the point of this post is, I guess it’s just to see if anyone is feeling the same.

I started university (I’m in the UK) a few weeks ago and it’s honestly been a bit crap. I’ve not really made any friends which isn’t the best start. I get on well with the people in my flat, but there’s no societies running, so there’s not really a chance to meet anyone outside of where I’m living. I’m only physically in a lesson once every two weeks and online lectures are few and far between. The course itself isn’t really living up to what I thought it would be, which sucks because that’s one of the major reasons you go to university.

I’m also a part of the LGBT community and there doesn’t seem to be anyone here who is like me, which just makes it worse. My uni is pretty small too, so I don’t think there’s much chance I’ll find anyone that is. The uni themselves haven’t been great with issues I’ve had in relation to being LGBT, and it’s just making life unnecessarily more difficult than it already is. 

It’s just become a really isolating experience and I’m already getting a bit fed up with it. I know a lot of it is down to COVID and that can’t be helped, but I just feel miserable. I keep waking up and questioning what the point of being at uni actually is at the moment. I think for me personally it doesn’t help that there’s no sense of any routine, because I’m stuck in my room most of the time.

Anyway, I’m sorry if that was a bit depressing. I just wondered if anyone else was in a similar situation or maybe if anyone has started uni and it’s been more positive? 

Thank guys"
684,What therapy do I need,"I don’t really want to go over everything but basically I think I have social anxiety and I want to see a therapist, I just told my parents about my self harm and stuff and if I do have social anxiety disorder where do I go to get diagnosed? I don’t know"
685,I’m so tired,"I’m in college, with a goal to change my living circumstances and hopefully the world while I’m at it. However, after all the obstacles, all the times I’ve been screwed over by things out of my control, all the sadness and loneliness, physical pains, being poor, and constantly juggling school with unfortunate life circumstances have destroyed my mental health and peace of mind. I don’t have it in me anymore. I just want to be happy and live in a peaceful environment. I hate my job, I hate my living situation, my house, the trifling, cretinous family I live with, the constant shortage of food, I hate the school I attend and I wish I lived in a dorm at a different school but unfortunately that’s not possible. I have been imagining killing myself nearly everyday, I don’t have it in me to keep going. It like life has progressively gotten worse, exponentially, each year I continue to live. The only thing keeping me from doing the deed is the fear of surviving. I don’t know how much longer that fear will last I just know I can’t keep going like this."
686,I was listening to a song and ended up making myself cry.. because i miss my friends..,I know that  sounds silly but I'm little sad because i haven't seen them that week.. because college and life..

I have been alone this whole week, because my friends dont have the time to hang out on week days.

691,So what do you do when you’re feeling overwhelmed and panicked... like right now?,So I’m not going good right now. I’m looking at colleges to apply too and I have to pick 10 for this scholarship I’m applying for but if any of them pick me back I’m bound to go there for four years and I don’t know what college I want to go to or where I want to live my life or what I’m looking for. I just applied for another job even though my current ( and first ) job is fine I just want more money but I feel guilty for looking elsewhere especially so soon and I’m scared because I don’t know what to do if I don’t get this college scholarship and I’m terrified I’m going to be miserable where ever I go because I’ve never lived on my own and I already have to deal with Aspergers which makes social interaction really hard and makes people put off and I have friends but I’m worried I won’t have friends at college and I’m scared I’m really scared. I’m in full panic mode please someone tell me what to do.

695,derealization?,"I’m a young 14 year old male and I think I have the mental disorder derealization. I honestly have no idea about actual mental health disorders but my life was amazing until around 4th grade when my step father who was the only real father I ever had killed himself. He left us with enough money and an amazing house but my mother never been the same. Now for the last 2 years I’ve slowly been feeling more off then ever. With Covid and staying home all day I started to play lots of video games and It’s the only way I can talk with my friends from school now. The last 2 months have just felt like a dream, It sounds weird but I don’t feel my body anymore it’s just like my head is moving through space. I think way to much I never not think. My home life is everything i could ask for my mother always puts her kids first and always will. I just don’t know what happened it all came so fast. I have everything a kid could want with amazing friends with the same dark humor as me and we laugh all day together in a PlayStation party. I’d say I feel sad some days but not enough to say I’m depressed. I just think I’m losing touch with the world around me, It sounds so weird but i think of my life in third person most of the time. Am I fuxking insane or just being a dumb Gen z who doesn’t really understand life yet?"
696,What cured your depression?,"I‘m 21 years old. Suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I‘m 15. These days my symptoms are low self-esteem, huge anhedonia (lack of motivation, interest, joy, nothing stimulates me), lethargy, big lows and negative thoughts, would describe it as a huge pain of inner emptiness and kind of living in a dead body and mind. It‘s horrible. The feelings of depression are massive and I don‘t understand them. 

I also tried over 10 pharmaceuticals and 2 depth psychological analytical therapies. Nothing helped. Now I‘m in a behavioral therapy. Still down af and living the life fucks me hard most of the days. Thoughts about suicide? Yes, sure. But never attempting to do it. Never ever.

I think my depression started from social anxiety and the big inhibitions and restrictions it has on your life. Social anxiety kills self esteem, self worth and produces big worries and negative thoughts about future life and own personal abilities. Then it restricts your life to a very low, boring and not much happening or rewarding life. That‘s why I really train hard on socializing and connecting to people right now. That‘s a thing I learned in all these years and gives me hope. If I get better at my social anxiety I‘ll get better at my depression, that are my thoughts. But I should have started earlier knowing this as the depression developed severe and is there now as it‘s own sickness deep in my biological system and thought patterns.

Guys and girls who suffered or suffer from depression, how did you get out of it? What helped/helps you improving not feeling depressive, sad, low, incompetent and empty without perspective and feelings of joy.

I really want to live. Right now I‘m dead alive most of the days. It‘s hurting so much. Let me know about your success stories, suggestions, tips, experiences. I‘m very down right now. :‘("

698,I feel so empty,"I lost my mom when I was 11 from a 10 year battle with cancer and Ive never really felt the full extent of the emotions. 6 years later I still haven’t experienced strong emotions. Yes, I was devastated and I still am but it just feels like it’s distant, like it doesn’t matter. I never went through a severe grieving process it almost feels like I’m in denial but she’s already gone. Ever since then I’ve just felt weird and off. I never really feel anything I’m not really happy or sad I’m kinda just neutral 24/7. I talk to a therapist over an online conference app and I can never word what I’m feeling to the therapist, like what I’m trying to say just doesn’t make sense. I feel almost like I’m on antidepressants but I’m not."
699,Sometimes I like in the mirror and don't feel like I'm looking at myself,So to start off I have anxiety and depression. I was only recently diagnosed in august. But sometimes when I look in the mirror I don't feel like myself. Like it is as if I'm looking at some complete different person.

700,struggling with thinking of the future,"in the grand scheme of life, i don’t really want anything. when my friends talk about the future, getting married, having kids, getting jobs, getting into a career - i just get so uncomfortable and i never know what to say because i just don’t want any of it. i don’t see any point in any of it. i know this isn’t a normal view but i cant even comprehend feeling differently? i literally cannot imagine anybody being able to change my mind, not even the people i love who are the closest to me. it’s so frustrating and exhausting :("
701,No energy to do anything,"I can't even bring myself to eat or drink. I haven't left the couch where I've been sleeping for 5 days. I sleep through the days, wake up late and stare at a wall. I'll feel hungry and thirsty and bored but I can't bring myself to get up and do anything. I'm all weak and shaky so moving is too much effort now and even chewing food is too much effort.

705,Can someone help me identify what’s wrong with me?,"So I have been meaning to do this for a long time I just always dreaded it because the moment I start thinking about my mental health I stop taking myself seriously. But I feel like there is something wrong with me. Especially in the last few months. There are days when I refuse to get out of bed and when I am forced to I get really irritated. I feel like my mind is always clouded, and I never really know what is going on. I can never focus. I cry excessively. Almost anything can make me cry. I feel weak for this world and I have absolutely no idea who am I. Like when I think about myself my mind just goes blank. Sometimes I have mental breakdowns like when I am fighting with someone I start to scream, break things. The other day I hit my head so hard because I was overwhelmed my nose started to bleed. I cut myself sometimes. My body feels like a mess. I lost a lot of weight in the past couple of months which makes me a little happy. I have always had issues of how I look. Like I had this idea in my head then I see a picture and I am completely baffled because I just don’t understand how I can be so ugly. I think I have adhd I was never diagnosed but it’s like I want to say everything that is on my mind at the same time and I am impatient with everyone when they are talking. There are good days too like when I am meeting with my friends I can get really happy that I am unable to contain myself and my friends tell me that I am really goofy haha. But also I constantly feel like my energy is completely drained. And sometimes weird things happen. Like when I am anxious or having a bad day sometimes my body freezes. Like the other day I was doing the dishes and my arms stopped moving in the middle of washing a plate and I was standing in the same position for like 5 minutes and I couldn’t move like I was frozen and I was holding the plate for five minutes in the same position. I don’t know if any of this is normal and I kind of feel like I am going crazy because I am constantly looking for answers. But then for example i have spent the last three days in my bed. Did not even shower. But today I feel like getting my life together. Also I always feel guilty about everything I do and it is exhausting. Please help me. And sorry if it was too long."
706,Recently I have been feeling this insatiable boredom - I don't know how to deal with it,"Hi all,

I have this on and off issue in my life and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've been feeling so bored. Not just, 'eh I'm bored' but cripplingly bored. It's not like I don't have things to do, because I have. I have my art, music, some friends around, access to tv shows to watch (i am very grateful for this). I have my pc and uni work to do. 

Still, nothing ever seems to satisfy me enough. I do have ADHD so I guess that plays into it. I can't tell if its just a form of depression. Recently I have been feeling rather hopeless and stressed and I want to do something, but don't want to do any of the options. I feel so selfish complaining about it as I know I am so lucky to have everything I have and be able to do the things I do. I want to be able to enjoy things and be satisfied easily but for some reason this isn't going to happen.

Has anyone else felt like this? If so, what did you do about it. Thanks"
707,Loved one passed away and I'm having a hard time,"On September 30 I woke up to a call from my mom crying saying grandpa died. I have...had...2 grandpas alive, one I'm not so close with and one who was honestly my first love and another father figure to me. I call one Grandpa, and one Poppy, but she just said grandpa but the way she was crying I felt like it wasnt him..so I asked which grandpa. She said your Poppy. He had health problems but wasnt sick. He went in his sleep, where my mom and brother were unable to wake him. They all live in Michigan, and I moved to Canada in 2014.
He didnt want a funeral, always said it was a waste of money, so instead he and my grammy decided to donate their bodies to a body farm in Tennessee, where they will be studied to help solve cold cases. However, this means there is absolutely no place I can go to see him, no grave, no ashes, anything. Even after he decomposes, the place will still keep his bones to use for further study.
I called my mom asking if I could come home to see him and say bye before they take his body and she said yeah, she would find a plane ticket, as i cant afford one right now. Anytime I brought it up she said she found doable ones, then a few hours later said no wasnt going to happen.
I just wanted to see him one last time and I'm the only family member that cant, even someone that is of zero relation is going to see him.
I'm extremely mad at my mom for even acting like it was a possibility and I told my husband I want nothing to do with her now. Especially since she asked if she could buy me a ticket to come home in a month instead.
I am crying honestly whenever I'm awake. Zero family members have asked how I'm doing, even my mom, I'm drinking to the point of being blackout drunk every night, I'm extremely suicidal over this. The only people I have here with me is my husband who's been great and just letting me be a mess, and my Father in Law who I want to go hang out with to keep me distracted but he hasn't said more than a ""sorry about the passing"" to me.
I honestly dont know what to do without him. I dont know what to do with myself. I just want to see him again, I want to hear his voice again, and its getting to the point where I dont want to live and it's only been 3 days."
708,Is it okay that have multiple mental break downs most days,[removed]
709,Post traumatic downfall.,"I wrote this a few days ago. 
I'm just now getting time to share it. 
A piece of my own personal history.. 

Every waking day seems to be more agonizing than the last. Mental illness is no joke. 
My only hope is to find a sense of comfort in just.. being, although that seems to be an unrealistic hope as of this last decade or so. Ironic enough, even when I find myself happy, I somehow feel discomfort and/or anxiety shortly after realization &amp;&amp; in return? I try to get out of it. 
A complete malfunction within fight or flight.
It's almost as if I've lived in a depressing state for so long, there's some half ass comfort in being..sad? Misery aside, of course. 

I was diagnosed with *post traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, and CTE* 20 months ago tomorrow. 
Why would I remember 20 months ago tomorrow to the exact date?
Because February 3rd, 2019 is the day that I started to maintain my sobriety.
After a decades worth of choking down 100s of milligrams of oxycodone and eventually graduating toward a $100-$150 daily heroin/fentanyl/needle habit, I found my reality in a darkened room after a severe mental breakdown. 
In January of 2019, I began dating a girl named Katie. It was the first female I dated since 2016..rewind- In *2015*, I dated a girl named Morgan..who was a very good friend for years prior to our relationship. After 6 months into a relationship, we broke up due to drug use. Two weeks after the break up, Morgan had passed away on the morning of mother's day in 2016. She passed away in a bed that myself, her infant son, and morgan herself had fell asleep in together every night for six months prior.. 
She passed away early in the morning in that same bed on her very first mother's day as a parent. 
I would assume that's when my post traumatic stress disorder found itself manifesting. Fast forward to 2019, I hadn't dated anyone for three years after, I felt either very vulnerable or ironic enough..numb. 
Usually masking feelings with opioids was the trend for quite awhile, especially after morgan passed. But, in January of 2019 I found a girl named katy that I found myself very into. 
Chemistry was dead on mutual. 
Attraction was there. 
All talks backed by genuine meaning.
Eventually, every kiss turned into a significant couple of seconds. It was pure bliss. 
Or so it seemed..
After a few weeks into our blossoming relationship, I decided to get clean, I started going into a Suboxone/Subutex clinic and taking that route instead of in patient rehab. 
The transition period wasn't bad, my cravings subsided, physically I was okay. But mentally I started noticing myself draining, everything had just felt off which was to be expected after cleaning up 10 hard years of opioid abuse. Katy and I continued to grow closer, until one night.. I still remember it. 
I was sitting in my apartment reading a book and katy had texted me wanting to make plans for the weekend which made me smile, I was game. She wanted to come stay the weekend and binge watch the office (who could say no to that?) So, I of course agreed. I even found myself excited..until an hour later, it was as if someone had went inside of my head and turned a light switch that turned my emotions in a very wild way. I started having panic attacks that night, and I just felt very spacey. 
I remember I tried to sleep and I couldn't. 
So, I had stayed up that entire night. 
The next day, same story. 
Feeling extremely off, heart racing panic attacks all day and night, yet again no sleep. 
Saturday comes, I'm now awake for 3 days and I'm supposed to go get katy for our weekend plans. 
Under no circumstances should I have been driving, and every instinct within me was saying don't go get her, I did anyway. 
She came back to my place for the weekend (everything felt so off) and the poor girl had to witness my all weekend of no sleep, non stop anxiety attacks, fog brain, and now? An overwhelming sense of guilt that was digging deep within my chest. I had no idea what was going on, not in an emotional or physical spectrum. My only conclusion was ""I'm 25 years old and I'm losing my mind"" I was terrified. Becoming desperate for sleep. 
Becoming desperate to stop the panic attacks. Becoming desperate to stop whatever was happening. 
Before I knew it, I had been awake for 9 days. 
9 days of pure agonizing hell. 
All symptoms I listed increased by x10 fold. 
I wound up in a psych ward on my 10th day of that nightmare-like-reality, after talking to a mental health professional at the facility, we came to the conclusion that I was having a *post traumatic stress disorder attack*
Which meant.. I let my mental illness go untreated for so long, when I met katy, it triggered my ptsd since I lost morgan and never found anything significant since. I never let anything close since losing morgan, until I met katy. Basically, for 10 days straight the fight or flight center within my brain was going off &amp; sending as much adrenaline through out my body as possible. I'm a 5'8 male who usually weighs 150 pounds. 
When I wound up at the facility, I was weighing in at 118 and at risk of a heart attack (I'm usually a gym rat &amp; in shape)
The *ptsd attack* also explained the guilt sensations I was feeling, it explained why every fiber of my being was telling me to get away from katy even though I was really into her, it explained not only what I was feeling for that month but also, what I was feeling for years prior. 

I'm now coming up on 20 months clean tomorrow, and I have somewhat of a handle on my mental illness.. even on my darkest of days, they don't compare to the time before I opened my eyes and learned what it is I have. 
Tonight really had me thinking, since I'm coming up on the date tomorrow..I suppose that's why I wanted to share a piece of my own personal history.
To anyone who read, I appreciate you. 
&amp;&amp; To anyone who ever needs a friend, my inbox is always open.

710,"A little bit of a pity post, advice or tough love welcolme.","Hi all, 

I'm 26, from the UK and a further time poster and I'm not great at the abbreviations so apologies if I'm not doing this correctly but here goes. 

I'm feeling shit, the lowest I've felt in a long time. I don't know where to turn and I'm feeling really alone so I'm hoping writing it down somewhere and maybe getting some constructive advice might help. 

I've got a long history of reoccurring anxiety and depression, this is due to the usual shitty childhood and refusal to get any help. I also have some attachment issues, it takes me a long time to let anyone in and even longer to get over the rejection or grief that ultimately comes when things break down or they die (I've had 9 fairly close deaths in 10 years). This all started when my mum left me at 13 to go be with a man accross the country, then my dad moved on too leaving me in limbo for a few years before my Dad stepped forward and has been amazing since. 

Anyway I've had a rough few weeks, 3 weeks ago my brother (25) in law committed suicide, I was quite close to him and it has really upset me. My partner (31) is understandably devastated and needs a lot of support which through my own grief I'm managing to do but finding it hard. On top of this we have 4 children (2 of which are 8 months old), I love them dearly but I'm struggling to juggle it all. I don't have the most supportive family so even finding babysitters whilst we go to the funeral has been tough and has mean we have to travel 4 hours in the morning, pay our respects then leave quite quickly for the travel home rather than see my inlaws who are totally devastated (they only had two sons and now my parter is the only living child).

 I have a best friend who has been amazing, Ive only known her 2 years but it feels like she's been around forever, she has my full trust and my whole family adores her. She has some mental health issues but has always been really open and honest about them and I really admire this about her because here I am anonymously writing about mine. Anyway she's been battling her own mental health lately and I've seen her a lot, she stays over a lot and I've always tried to support her the best I can. 2 weeks ago she went really quiet on me which she has never done, I immediately thought I'd done something wrong but she reassured me and so I've just let her have time to herself and not bothered her other than checking up on her asking how her day has been and she usually replies again quite honestly and just says she's struggling so I offer whatever support I can. The last maybe 5 days she's taking much longer to reply (we have at least text first thing in the morning until 9 or 10 at night for 2 years now), she's been skipping days or taking 12 hours+ to reply. Again, I understand the whole mental health issue and I know she's really close to her mum who she lives with so I'm not hugely concerned for her welfare I just feel  little lost and maybe a little forgotten and unloved. I feel like I've just been pushed aside and I can't say anything because she's obviously struggling and the last thing i want is for her to be upset further. I feel like I'm an asshole for even thinking like this when she's struggling too.

I'm watching my partners heart break more each day and seeing my in laws crumble, and I'm grieving for the friend and brother in law I've lost too. I could really really do with a friend, yesterday I supported my partner to say goodbyes to his younger brothers body, it was awful, we have both been very emotional since and I'm really trying to hold it together but its all getting too much. My friend knew I was going yesterday and didn't ask how it went or offer any kind of encouragement or love, infact i checked to see how she was and she took 24 hours to reply. am I being unrealistic? Am I being selfish in wanting to be supported by someone that is struggling themselves? I try so hard to help everyone even on my dark days, especially on my dark days, am I the weird one? Please tell me honestly if I'm being needy, I just don't know what to do anymore, I can't tell my partner I'm struggling this much because he's already hurting, I can't talk to my best friend and I have nobody else I trust enough to speak to. I can feel the depression rearing its head and I'm powerless."
711,Not sure where to put tho but here goes:,I’m not sure who to talk to about this so I’ve decided to put it here. Recently I’ve begun to really struggle with my mental health. I have gone from never having a panic attack to having 3 in a week (according to google). I feel guilty all the time and I have a constant sinking feeling like something terrible is about to happen. I hate feeling like this and I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading I guess and sorry for burdening you guys with my issues but I just didn’t know where else to turn.

I've known that my family wasn't the best at managing money, I saw notices on our doors about unpayed bills, heard my mom and dad talk about how my mom couldn't see the doctors she needed to, and my brother and I usually got Christmas presents from our school's donation program. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts before, and often don't care that much about my own material stuff. 

Overall, I've only wanted second hand, inexpensive things. Even on my birthday, I don't want anything big, and prefer to have a dinner at home with homemade cake. 

When I want something from a video game, I make sure to not ask for anything for the whole month, and have had panic attacks about ""if I ask for this, will I come off as greedy??"". I feel absolutely awful when people surprise me with something, and I have no idea on how to show or express my gratitude. I'm always scared if I don't use it enough, I'm ungrateful, but if I use it too much it'll get broken. 

I like things that other people don't want anymore. I just feel a greater attachment to those items (like my rabbit, who was originally my brothers, or clothes that were hand-me-downs). I just feel less bad about them. 

Lately, my dad's girlfriend has been wanting to get me things (she's gotten me a shirt and a pin so far) and is hinting at getting me another shirt. I would understand if it were near my birthday, but it's not. 

I don't wanna say that I don't want anything and make her think I dislike her... I just absolutely hate gifts, even from my family. 

Does anyone know what this is called or has anyone else experienced it? Is there a way to feel less bad about it?"
717,Just needed to say some stuff,"Does anyone else just hate existing? Like you wake up in the morning and see why people leave you and leave you on read or never even open your messages. You just see the purpose to your life fall away and nothing means anything anymore? It doesn't matter how much I sleep I'm always tired, nothing makes me happy or even lessens the pain. Nothing I do gives me self worth and so I taken to never leaving my room except for work and food on the occasion. Talking to people makes me anxious because I'm scared to open up. Seeing other people together makes me depressed. But I can't stand being alone because the silence is too big and the feelings of anxiety, sorrow, and sadness are too loud. But I'm too scared to try to kill myself for fear that maybe one day it'll stop and I have a decent life that I don't hate. But with each morning I'm doubt more and more that such a thing exists and that'll I'll be for the rest of my life as I am now; alone, friendless, and with no purpose or sight of a purpose to my life."
718,"Hey, i need some advice.","Heyho there, i really need some help.

20 M

Ive had a panic disorder phase for the last 2~ months, and ever since ive had that i feel like ive seen literally everything i do before. The panic attacks have pretty much stopped, and its just general anxiety now, but that insane feeling of 'ive been here before' is still there. 

The panic disorder was brought up by having my first panic attack on weed also, which ive completely quit eversince that night.

719,Most days I feel nothing.,"It’s almost as if i’m living outside my body, being around people makes me anxious to the point my immediate first thought is, ‘I wish i was dead, please go away’. I don’t know why, it scares me to think about myself. i don’t see myself as anything extraordinary or the scum of the earth. i just exist in a pathetic way. Some days it’s like i can take control of my life and then when it comes to it, everything eats me up alive.

it’s hard to look people in the eyes, express my concern, say a simple greeting. I feel so pathetic and shameful for my existence. Like a gross slimy thing talking to a person, the difference between me and them, is too extreme. I’m sure it’s a confidence thing, my parents haven’t been the most loving or supportive parental figures in my life.

sorry for rambling, i don’t know why i would? I just thought as soon as i was free from my parents grasp i would feel better, not immediately but lighter.

721,"I've been sleeping 12+ hours a night, plz help","Hi all

The past week or so I've been sleeping 12+ hours a night, going to bed around 12-2 am and sleeping sometimes until 2 pm. I guess im posting here cuz I am concerned that depression is creeping up on me and I feel like if I tell anyone about how late In sleeping, Ill just get deemed ""lazy"" or on the other end of that, my family will get so overwhelmingly concerned. I don't feel depressed when awake, Im still able to get things done and am not isolating. But I have been off work a lot due to COVID and am not self quarantining because I came in close contact with a handful of people who tested positive. I wake up feeling guilty and rushed when I see the clock is at 2pm and the day feels so wasted. 

Any tips on how to get out of this rut? My therapist (who i havent seen in weeks because i dont have insurance and am surviving on unemployment right now) recomends a schedule to get up. But its hard for me to even want to wake up when I cant go anywhere or do anything. I don't want to slip into depression tho. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation and what did you do to get out of it?"

724,The Stanford Prison Experiment *DEBUNKED*,"The Stanford Prison Experiment is one of the most famous research studies in modern psychology.

The study took 24 healthy and seemingly ""normal"" male college students and placed them in a mock prison environment dividing them into guards and prisoners. 

The study's lead scientist Philip Zimbardo declared after six short days that The Stanford Prison Experiment had transformed everyday college students into tyrannical prison guards and resigned prisoners, who accepted the social roles they found themselves in.

This one study has has a tremendous impact on popular culture with multiple films being made about it and it becoming a cornerstone piece of research on the psychology of aggression, abuse and power.

The Stanford Prison Experiment was a fraud, however.

Want to know why? Well, you'll have to watch my video to find out why you can't trust the conclusions made by The Stanford Prison Experiment and why it's one ""good"" example of BAD SCIENCE.

725,Struggling hard with impulses,"Fuck. I was out with my husband (we had to pay the cellphone bill for our 13 year old, if you were wondering) and what goes screaming down the street? A firetruck...full lights, sirens, and airhorn. Fuck me. It went down the same street where I had started that rag-fire on the porch of an abandoned house (so I freaked out a bit until I realized that 1) I have been home all day with my family getting Minecraft set up on the XBox for our 10 year old, 2) I legit know I haven't done ANYTHING illegal since I'd gotten out of prison because...Probation...nuff said, and 3) that road also leads to another road further down that leads in a LOT of directions, so they could have been going anywhere.  


It is just a knee-jerk reaction when I see a firetruck go by me...guilt (unfounded) and excitement. Mostly excitement and joy and satisfaction...but I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

I am ashamed to say that I had to go outside on our back patio, which is quite large and all concrete, and burn some papers. It gave me SO much pleasure...and it calmed me right down. I feel satisfied and happy again.   


This is pyromania ffs...how did I EVER doubt it?   


Sorry for the stupid ass post, but I had to get my feelings out somewhere. I am having a REALLY REALLY good day otherwise!! :D Our eldest daughter will be graduating from college in the Spring and I am SO proud of her (as is her Papa and her siblings)! She is working on her Senior Project (her Capstone Project) which is basically her last project to graduate. I am bursting with pride and happiness over this.

I don't know how to sit and just enjoy a moment. Any moment. I want to be happy. I want to just be able to enjoy life. I don't know how. Is one day's happiness worth a lifetime of sadness? So say I achieve happiness on a specific day, then what? What if I can't do it again? I'm struggling and waiting for this one enjoyable day to eventually come, what's the point?

Is this really what life is? Every day just waiting to see if you will feel happy or have a good day. I do smile a lot. Maybe I experience happiness more than I think, and if that's true, what the fuck am I doing here? Why can't I remember those feelings? I feel like I live every day hoping to experience the feeling of joy a little stronger but at this point I think I may just be chasing a fairytail feeling.

I got to thinking, maybe I did permanently screw up my serotonin by doing drugs as a teenager. Everything catches up to you eventually I guess? I just don't know. I wish things were different. I wish I enjoyed my life more. I wish I wanted to be me. I wish I could be content with what I have because I really don't have it bad at all..."

731,How to set boundaries with a friend who have depression,"I live in a dorm with a friend who got diagnosed with depression. Today I spent the whole day out with my family who came visiting me and we had a great time.

Her room is next to mine so she must notice when I arrive, or she probably waits for me to get home. She doesn't have another close friend in the same building so she relies a lot on me.

Recently I feel anxious when I am in my dorm room. Such a shame since I love staying at my room a lot. I start getting sleep problems at night and getting irritated during the day. I had mental health issue too (which she knows of) and it took a lot of efforts to reach my current state.

740,my housemates make me want to leave the university I love...,"(hopefully they won't see this)

&amp;#x200B;

I got into my uni of choice a few months back and moved in 3 weeks ago. Currently I am living in a block of halls, and we are split into little corridors of 4 people (for covid purposes these are our new 'households', we're not allowed to mix with the other corridors). I met my housemates online through snapchat - I live with three girls and all are studying dance....I'm a trans guy studying Politics. I feel a tad outnumbered here. We got along okay in our little snapchat group before we moved here and the first few days were alright but things have taken a bit of a turn and it's making me want to leave.

In our halls of residence, visitors are currently banned (because, uh, global pandemic) and we were told \*multiple times\* not to have visitors, we had to read Covid-secure guidelines and confirm that we had read them. Basically, it was made very very clear. However in the first two weeks I would come home to my housemates having several visitors in the kitchen or their rooms - once there were EIGHT PEOPLE in my kitchen, which is also breaking UK law at the moment (rule of six and stuff). It was making me super anxious that they would have visitors who could have COVID because I knew the people they were having over were breaking all of the rules and had been travelling to high-risk areas such as London, mixing with multiple other households, not socially distanced etc etc etc. It was making me so anxious that I was feeling physically sick so I spoke to university accommodation about it and they sent an email saying it was banned. Unfortunately another student told my housemates 'you have to be reported for them to send you that email', so my housemates are inches away from finding out it was me who reported them. Even more unfortunately, I today learned that even though I hadn't broken any rules myself, we were being punished as a household and I now have a strike against my name on the housing record because my housemates were repeatedly being reckless (3 strikes and you're out and I now have one for \*no reason\*).

My housemates are also very loud - because I am doing virtual learning but they aren't (because their course is practical and mine isn't), they don't understand how difficult it is to do Microsoft Teams calls and talk to my lecturers and classmates if there is a tonne of noise in the background. I've put a sign on my door saying I'm in a live meeting/on the phone, I've told them when I have my meetings and asked if they can keep it down so I can hear and be heard, I've even had to apologise to my lecturers, get up and ask them politely if they can keep it down ""just for 20 minutes whilst I do this meeting"" and every time they don't. I've tried several pairs of headphones and they can still be heard in the background when I try and answer questions or add to the debate/seminar. I understand that they are dance students but they're not making noise from practising or anything like that, they're just talking (sorry, I meant shouting), making Tik Toks and listening to music/watching Netflix so fucking LOUD. I'm sick of apologising to my class and lecturers because whenever I speak/contribute they can hear 'WAP' in the background.

I think the worst thing though is that they have started lying to me (like I'm stupid and won't find out) Today they lied to me and said they were going home to their families (for the third consecutive weekend....) because they miss them, but when I logged into Instagram, they had gone to Brighton together on the train and were on the super busy Brighton Pier, like COVID didn't exist. I'm pissed that they lied to me and I'm pissed that they're out being reckless, because their constant trips and excursions are making me anxious to go to my in-person classes 3x a week and even to the bloody supermarket because I'm scared their reckless behaviour will bring home coronavirus and I could unknowingly spread it everywhere. Covid is a particular anxiety for me because I come from a family who had to be especially careful as both my parents are heightened risk and it angers me so much that they're out being reckless, yet my parents are at risk and are facing unemployment as a consequence. If I miss my parents, I can't go home to them because my housemates are so fucking reckless that I could be killing them both and leaving my two disabled brothers at the mercy of the social care system.

I know I'm difficult to deal with sometimes - I have Aspergers Syndrome and I've always found it hard, I know I'm very different and people can find that a bit...intimidating? But if they don't like me, just fucking say it. I'm not exactly alien to rejection and being disliked despite the effort I put in. They make me feel so anxious about going out and make me feel so unsafe at university because I don't want to give COVID to anyone - they could be vulnerable like my parents, or live with someone who is vulnerable, COVID could be really really serious for them. I don't want to live with the guilt of giving someone a potentially deadly illness. I feel so fucking isolated and scared that I'm not sure if I want to stay at university, which is a huge shame seeing as I got a place on the men's hockey team (a huge achievement for a trans guy like me) and I do enjoy my in-person classes. I've even contemplated leaving this week, jumping on the train and going somewhere - as I have so few in-person classes and my housemates barely notice when I'm here/not here, nobody would notice if I left until I was far away from here. I love the uni and I love the hockey team and I enjoy my classes but the people I'm trapped in an apartment with make me want to leave. I can't imagine being locked in our apartment for 14 days with these girls if they did stupidly bring home coronavirus and we needed to self isolate, I'd go insane. I can't imagine doing anything with them really. I just hope I manage to stay at uni without having a mental breakdown anytime soon."

742,Hello father,"What you are about to read is something that I write in my notes when I don’t feel that well. 
————————————————————————————

hi father I really want to know what would you recommend me doing in this situation

first of all, I’m pretty sure that you guys wouldn’t sell the house if you were still alive 

I’m pretty sure that I wouldn’t be the same person if you were alive 

But you know father somethings you can’t share everything with mom and sometimes it really hurts 

It hurts to feel alone it hurts that I don’t have a father to share my problems with it hurts that I don’t have a best friend next to me 

You know what I mean just that things are simple problems but at the same time are the only ones stopping me feeling happy 

I really don’t know if having more friends will make me happier or having a girl will make me fulfilled 

Honestly this is the only thing that’s missing so I am going for it

But holly bananas do I suck at texting or having the right things to say

The more I think about it the more deeper I’m falling into negativity 

Countless times I’ve been trying to escape my own thoughts but it never that easy

Even after reading books about it watching motivational videos, it seems like everything is being forgotten I start from 0 

Hypnotically speaking it really looks like a sinkhole and the more I stay at home the more fucked up is getting 

Like nobody cares or thinks about your life or what you do or don't do with it

Love is a choice but then I see life as a choice too, how should I cope with myself alone

Every time is getting harder and harder I don't know if I would be able to keep fighting myself away from my own thoughts

Like, come on... almost 22 and unable to find the right person to have a relationship with like holly fuck 

The more I live the more I am able to see that we live to suffer 

I feel like I'm living to find a purpose to be happy to find friends to not be alone to find true love to be happy...

Fuck you fuck me fuck your neighbor fuck everything I know that these sinkholes will be the end of me, some sunny day I will not be able to fight it anymore 

I’m just looking at the ceiling of my living room, the time is 10:38 PM and it’s killing me. I can hear the wind whistling from the crapy window of my apartment. The room temperature is normal but I’m freezing. If people were raining i’m drizzling. The more time that passes the more alone I feel. It hurts truly, it hurts that being alone feels normal, it hurts that imagining being with someone feeling unnatural. Just knowing that you never been loved for your real you is kind rough. It feels like I’m living to accomplish dreams that feed my ego. My thoughts are like a carousel a loop that you can’t escape. I try not to think about it and keep telling myself that everything will be alright but it never seems to go away. Happy moments come and go but when I’m in a sinkhole it feels like nothing really matters..."
743,"this is the first time I'm ever discussing my intrusive thoughts out loud, i don't want to tell anyone i know. **trigger warning**: i will mention things about d*ath, r*pe, &amp; p*dophelia","i really hope i'm putting this on the right topic. i'm really sorry if i'm not. i don't remember when these thoughts first started and i don't know if i should go and figure out if i have any mental health issues that may be causing them but i have really disturbing &amp; sometimes extremely violent thoughts that happen at just any time. they make me wanna throw up and sometimes i can feel my stomach flip afterwards. sometimes they're mild, but majority of the time when i have them they are really really harsh and just gross to me. i physically feel awful and i get the chills when i finish thinking of whatever i thought of. for example, i tend to get thoughts mostly about being raped brutally and being left to die. I'm starting to believe it will eventually happen to me since it just comes in my head at random times. then sometimes i'll think about me as a child and my family members on my dad's side like some of my uncles being disgusting towards me and looking at me gross then eventually doing something to me. then the death ones are just gruesome and gory, i can't even get into them. i don't know what to do, they make me really anxious and make me want to bawl out in a million years. how do i cope with this? should i see if i have any type of mental health issues?"

745,How to not be angry/frustrated at someone.,"Possibly relevant personal information first, I am a 17 year old straight guy.

I kinda got rejected by a girl. It's more complicated then that, but that's the basic jist of what happened. The two of us were planning on meeting up this Saturday, but she's been acting kinda strangely and seems to want to change those plans. Seems like hanging out with me is a chore she has to get through rather then something she'd enjoy. 

Either way, all of this really frustrated me. It's not her fault though. She has every right to like someone else and be with them. I never really allowed myself to get to attached to her as a crush anyways. However, it still left me feeling angry. I've been struggling with my mental health over the last year and I feel a lot better now. I understand that my fear is a natural reaction and that from that fear came out anger, frustration and other bad thought. I've lost trust in her and feel like I don't wanna have anything to do with her anymore.

So what should I do? How do I redirect these negative feeling into something else. I understand that they are just psychological and biological reactions if my body to rejection, but that still doesn't stop them from hurting."
746,"Anxiety, depression, PTSD, anything where you used to think it may have been ""weak"" or an ""excuse"" what was it that changed your mind?","If and when was the moment you acknowledged mental illness's validity? Anxiety, depression, PTSD, anything where you used to think it may have been ""weak"" or an ""excuse"" what was it that changed your mind? Preferably a question for older generations. I am really struggling to try and explain mental illness validity to older crowds. I'm an aspiring therapist and have my BS in Psychology. My family friends have reached out requesting help for their situation with their daughter who I also know personally. Obviously all I can give is unofficial advice as they already see a family therapist but they cant see their own behaviors to even have this be beneficial which is why it wasnt working which led to them reaching out to me. Their daughter struggles with anxiety and depression and they have ignored her cries of self harm and mental decline for years. Pretty much they were extremely permissive and unfortunately that often carries into mental health views because they'd rather avoid a difficult topic than address it. It doesn't mean they don't care per say but cannot face their own discomfort with the situation so it is seen by the child as uncaring thus turning to cries for help in multiple scenerios (theres nothing wrong with this nor am I judging just simply stating the cause and effects at play). Ive talked to both parties and its pretty much the exact situation I figured, and to make it more difficult there's an over bearing step parent involved and a by-choice absent biological mother. I've been trying to explain simple things to the parents like calling their daughter a drama queen and manipulative is ineffective and not true, just because they perceive her reality as some cunning schemed carefully planned execution its just her own anxiety getting the better of her and she doesnt want it to effect other people. Their guilt is their own, not hers. It seems like theyre still really struggling with the idea she has any issues at all. I even explained her visible self harm alone quantifies needing help so ""faking"" a mental illness still validates needing help, so why does it matter the reasons you think there are that you can't confirm? She deserves help for just wanting help. I'm trying to think of more ways of getting through to the parents because its only getting worse and the girls about to run away at the rate their going. They pay for her therapy but invalidate that too and of course, as guilty parents do. They cant trust the therapist because they validate her too much (... aka their job because she feels alone right now and invalidated). I'm just an undergrad so any advice is very helpful. I usually dont get involved in things this above my skill for ethical reasons especially with family friends but when both kid and parents are begging me for help and I see patterns of my past and my expieriences I couldn't sit by and watch. Thank you for reading and your time."

Hey nick. I know we haven’t been in contact for so long. I know you don’t try to think about the future and I for sure try not to think about the past, but we need to.

I understand your anger. I still feel it all the time. But you need to know you need an outlet for your anger. It’s not okay to keep it bottled up like you do. You are not alone even though you feel like no one sees you. Your mom sees you. Your dad sees you. Your brothers love you. But I know you don’t see it. I didn’t see it. 

Let them in. My best advice I can give you to ease your seemingly endless pain is to let them in. If you just open up one of your walls to let someone a little bit in you will feel. And I say that because I know you can’t feel anything but sadness and anger, but you will feel love and happiness. The amount of love that comes your way is astronomical, you just don’t know how to receive it yet. Your family cares even though it’s doesn’t seem like it. 

STOP comparing yourself to your brother. No one else may know that you do, but I do. You are not him, you are not his “prodigy”, you are your own person and that person is amazing. Trust me, you will find out he’s not the perfect guy you think he is. He feels pain just like you do, he has gone through his own problems, and he even wishes he’s living your life. Can you believe that? He said that. He wishes he can live our life, but he doesn’t see our pain.

I know you struggle with your self image, but you need to fix this path now. Allow others to help you so you don’t become obsessed with your self image. It’s okay to look the way you do. It’s okay to have only one or two close friends. It’s okay to be you, and you really are perfect. 

I cannot stress this enough. Let someone in. Please. You can’t deal with all this alone, you’re only a human. 

Breakups. Yeahhhhhh breakups. It’s going to happen. I know it’s crazy right? We finally found a girl that could accept us. It’s terrible that’s what we were looking for, acceptance not love. At the time you are with them you will feel on top of the world, like nothing can hurt you ever, happiness, love, the perfect life. But it’s not true, your happiness is from the other person and that’s something you need to realize. You need to find your own happiness because this person will not be around forever. You need to learn this lesson before the breakup, you need to not be in that dark place. I hope you never have to experience that dark place. I hope you learn from my warning and learn to find your own happiness. 

Sorry about all the sad stuff, not everything in our life is so sad. I’m smiling as I write this because I know even though you have and will go through so much, you do find happiness. You meet people who truly love you, your walls will be broken down whether you want them to or not and you will feel genuine happiness. And that may not sound appealing to you now but when you feel it, you will love it. Just never ever give up. 

Nick, I love you. I love you so much. You really really really are loved. Your mom loves you more than you could ever imagine. Your dad? He thinks so highly of you, his love is unconditional. Your brothers? Well one might be a little cold but the other leans on you. He cares about you more than you could ever know. You have the support system you need, they are there if you allow them to be. Stay safe nick, you will make it, you were always meant to make it."
749,I think I need to go to a psych ward,I can feel everything crumbling around me. I think I'm reaching my breaking point or something. I'm really scared and my head hurts. And I feel suicidal all of a sudden. I think I should get some real help for once.
750,Mental Health Day?,I needed a mental health day so I told my boss that I had food poisoning so I could leave early. Never done that before. I have work tomorrow. Do I need to call out tomorrow so it sounds legit or do people get over food poisoning in less than 24 hours? I'm worried that if I call out tomorrow they won't let me come back to work until I have a COVID test.
751,Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask...,"I have a friend who has a lot going for her, she’s successful, attractive, intelligent... but she has super low self-esteem. Her boyfriends are absolute losers, she can be quite snappy and defensive and when she has a drink, she becomes confrontational and generally horrible to be around. 

She’s 35 and has done / does a lot of work on her self, self-care, therapy, exercise and is very open minded. I can’t understand why she lacks confidence so much and still has this super volatile side to her even after all the work she puts in. I understand everyone has insecurities, but I always thought with acknowledgment and work, people can overcome them. 

I’m not so convinced now, and because I’m super chilled and don’t make people feel uncomfortable I’m in the firing line a lot of the time, and when I don’t react it makes her even worse.

Any opinions / advice appreciated, many thanks"
752,I feel empty,"I feel nothing 
I ate the whole day
Tried to something useful
But it didn’t work
I feel empty 
Just empty 
I don’t who I am, what I am, who I wanna be, wtf is the meaning of life? 
I’m constantly stressed of nothing 
I just feel empty and my chest feels like my heart weights a ton or something I feel like suffocating.

I got accepted in the art school that I applied for but I still feel empty and I feel like a loser that doesn’t fit in everybody is so confident there or is so cool etc.. and has friends or is social.

I’m new and I need learn more cuz school started a month ago and I was there on Thursday, Friday 
We gonna have holidays but I still have school so i think maybe I can get used to normal school life cuz I wasn’t in school for a year after I dropped out."
753,When is life 'ok'?,"This is something I'm wondering for a while now.
Over the years I sometimes heard that thinks like trauma therapy will not work for everybody. You have to life with it and stuff like that.
On other topics it's kind of the same. it's not something where is the solution for so you have to learn to live with it.
But when is it 'OK'? When do you stop trying to get better? And what if you just don't want to life with the problems?"
754,"I keep wrath, hate and evil urges within me. I supress them but they're still there.","Certain things trigger me to want to kill, destroy and torture.

I think it's weak and pitiable things that cause it. Happened when I was a kid, watching some random Digimon. A creature was born out of an egg, and it loved and pitied the phrase  ""I'll take care of you"". Now it's some goddamm puppies in a story based game, that were are really cherished.

My first feeling was to pick one up and throw it against the ground. I kept getting more and more frustrated that I couldn't do anything, it kept going up until I was sticking my nails into my skin from closing my fists and kind of shouting. This derived into wanting to burn them with a lighter slightly to hear them squeak and many more things.

Mind you, it is NOT animals. I love animals, many times more than humans, and I'm a vegetarian. It's the concept of this newborn thing that drives me crazy.

I don't know what to do with all of this frustration and evil, my hands shake sometimes ready to snap at anything. When I come to my senses again I feel quite bad.  I'm thinking about getting something like a boxing bag and let it ALL out on it, until I'm tired and no longer hate-filled.

I made a great effor trying not to go all-out writing all caps about my hate.

Any help is appreciated, but if you're here to judge or criticize I invite you to leave. Anyone say something please."
755,Covid19 situation,[removed]
756,Having a HUGE problem with myself [21M],"A little bit of context: I am a 21 year old male living with my parents (Asian-Pakistani heritage) while attending a university that is 25 minutes away. My life feels like utter crap. Never had a kiss, never been on a date, never flirted, never been in a relationship, and never been laid. Yes, that is life for me. I have always been alone and always relied on myself, never really having the ""friends"" to really do anything, so I always did things myself or always ended up being alone at home or anywhere. I have always been manipulated based on my parents' desires (living on campus vs. commuting) and followed through, but now realize, and lack all the necessary ways to live the life I want for myself. I have been trying to go out there, talk to people, talk to girls and make things happen, but nothing really came. Worst yet, I felt more awful than more proud of myself. No friends to go out with, no attention, and worst comes, my self-confidence and self-esteem is waning to the point that, at times, I do want to end my life. 

I am resenting my parents for their closed-mindset on life and manipulating my decisions (something that don't take as their fault, though I have accepted my fault in allowing them). I am desperately and actively looking for friends, but find myself in a dire situation that I come off weird AF or something of the sort. I am constantly going out, most of the time alone, and find myself in a situation that comes off worse for me with talking to girls, talking to other guys, and stuff. I try to approach girls in social settings, but it comes off awful 100% (please, I know, 1 out of 100 but its 0 out of a 100). I am trying to move out but the situation comes with my parents in their financial setbacks for others, and the job market is tough considering I am a full-time student looking for internships. Literally, everything I want to do, keeps coming back at my face with a punch saying ""NO"" and I hate it. I really hate it! I don't know what else I can do. I hate my life.

You must be wondering, what do I want in life? Overall, I just want a really good life. I want a fun and relaxed life. I want to go out to bars and clubs with friends, meet other people as well, and approach girls with confidence and have the ability to take it further. But overall, I want to have good moments with friends, and I am desperately trying. Previously, I thought life with my family was the way to go, but coming out of the bubble, I realized it was a toxic and bubbled-up environment that I really don't want to get myself trapped in. Currently, I still live with them, and I find their presence annoying as I live in a very open house (big house but open environment). And then, with the bars and clubs, the ""friend"" I thought I had that had experience in bars and clubs is a fake. So, I am at a point that I need to figure out what to do. I am at the verge of major depression, and I don't want that, but at the point that I am at, I am afraid that I could come out awful mentally. What do I do? Where should I do? How should I be? Is this life I want not mean't for me?"
757,I don'tknow if I have feelings anymore or if I ever did,[removed]
758,You may need to hear this!,"Hey everyone, here’s something to think of when you’re having one of those “what if” days...

*What if* everything works out?
*what if* your hard work pays off? 
*what if* you’re gonna feel amazing tomorrow or next week"
759,I don’t understand anything about myself.,"When i was younger i always used to feel like everyone was always watching me. That there was a constant camera on me and everyone was watching me doing the most embarrassing things, like crossdressing or doing fun gestures or dances while i was alone. I thought everyone could follow my thoughts, so i always shot them out of my head. 

I’ve had such a good life until these last 6 months. Always had friends, super caring family, good education. But, as a result of this i’ve never really had much time alone to think. Now that my friends are done with school and i’m moving up to a higher level, i’m all alone with my thoughts. And when lockdown began, all the thoughts began.

But i still don’t know jack shit. I don’t know if i have ADHD, because no-one takes me seriously on it, don’t know if i’m trans, cis or a femboy(technically cis) or whatever. Don’t know why i make up so much fake worlds in my head where i’m completely different persons. Don’t know if what i’m feeling is depression. I don’t know shit. 

I feel like i’m just an empty shell being piloted by something else. 

I’m still doing pretty well for the circumstances but i can feel it worsening every week. Thursday, at my part time job i had to go to the bathroom twice to just catch my breath (like in a movie where you lean against the wall and slide down to sit and just are breathing like you just ran 30 minutes. 

I don’t know where it all comes from, and it sucks that people on reddit won’t help prevent something but only try to heal it. I know reddit isn’t an answer but nobody takes me seriously enough to take me to a therapist. Sorry, i don’t want to kill myself yet. Probably will in a couple of months. Only sometimes i have suicidal thoughts but everyone has those."

762,"if they don’t appreciate your presence, make them recognize your absence","don’t put up with anybody’s shit. 

you are strong, you are beautiful, and you are worthy."
763,No motivation,"First of all, I feel the need to say that this probably isn't as serious as many of the other posts on this sub, but I couldn't think of a different place to share this.

I'm a 14 y/o boy that have struggeled with a lot of stress for a while. I had a lot to do, and I always overthinked it way to much. I don't have OCD or anything, but I'm 100% an absolute controlfreak, and it really messed me up. It probably hit its peak right before summer this year. But after summer, I was able to cut out the ""stress-giving"" activities to a minimum, and it felt really good!

Lately, however, I've really struggled to find motivation.
Not primarily for school, just in general. Most days are just so heavy to go through, and I don't know why, because I'm not stressed out at all.
I feel pretty embarrased about having no motivation for school, because I get really good grades. Talking about not having any motivation makes me feel like I'm really lazy.

I'm pretty lonely. I have great parents, and a loving little sister. I have friends, but none in my class. Im not fantastic at socializing, but I'm not crazy introverted like many on this website claim to be. It's just really hard for me to get friends in my class. There aren't anyone that I fit in with. I had a friend in my class, but he decided to stop hanging out with me.
This feels really biased and cheesy to say, but in my class, I'm just seen as a smart loner.

My parents got divorced about 3 years ago, and it was totally a surprise to me and my sister. It hit me really hard, because I just couldn't believe it was happening. I've gotten over it now, but both my mom and dad have gotten new partners. I don't have a bad relationship any of with them, but they both moved at the same time this summer, and it feels really weird. (My mom's boyfriend has kids aswell, that makes it even weirder...)

I guess the combination of lonelieness and weirdness makes me feel bummed out. I don't think I'm depressed though, I think I'm probably just a little bit sensitive to the things that I've mentioned. (Moving, lonelieness etc.)

Being sad kind of hits me in waves. There are some days where I'm really happy. A thursday, some weeks ago, I went to bed with a beaming smile on my face, because I felt so happy (for literally no reason)
Other days are just horrible. Lately, these days have been more common than the others.

When I'm doing something that makes me happy, it helps me get through the day, but I'm struggling to find things that makes me happy."
764,I think im seriously going crazy,"I think I might be going crazy but, at first i used to have really bad intrusive thoughts about killing my family and not actually meaning it. But now I actually do want to kill them and its kind of scaring me because i didnt think i could get so out of touch mentally. help?"
765,Break,"It’s so frustrating to give yourself a “break” or an off day when you haven’t done anything. 
You need the break but it’s not from work, it’s from all the thinking and stress of not doing the work that drains you so you just need a day of not worrying about not doing or starting a task. But there’s so much guilt cause you haven’t even done anything what do i need a break for? It’s easy to just keep going to i need a break it’s so tiring but nothing has changed so what difference would it make"
766,How do i stop being so hard on myself? And is it too late? I am always anxious and unable to focus. I want to change my life.," 

I am always freaking out every single day. I have a psychiatrist appointment next Thursday and can't stop beating myself up that i've taken this long since my last psychiatrist appointment to start trying again. I definitely have severe ADD, anxiety, and FOMO but would never accept it and its done nothing but cause me to ruin my own life.

I am so hard on myself that i bring myself down. I'm just looking to for attention and hope someone reads this and tells me its not too late but it feels that way.

I am 24 years old and still living with my parents. Yes, i know. I know...

The plan was to live at home for a year, save up, buy a house. Well i hit one year in November 2019. And now i'm about to hit two years.

I don't know. I was still a stoner. I was on anti depressants. The anti depressants made me not care about my insecurities like body count, dating life, the fact its been over a year since i got laid, i've never been to rave, never gone golfing, dont have a friend group, don't do anything at all on the weekends exept play video games. Which i can't enjoy because i just sit there playing and start thinking about the past. How much i've missed out on. Then start fearing how its too late to do those things. How i can't even do those things or it wouldnt be fun to do alone. And that i'm only doing it to cross of a list without actually enjoying it. You see what I'm doing to myself? I can't stop because i cant get myself to find an answer. I don't expect things to turn around overnight but nothing has remotely changed these last two years

With My lack of concentration and procrastination or whatever i didn't apply for a home loan until March 2020. Then Covid and i guess i took it as an excuse but things on hold because no one was doing anything and my smoking increased with WFH making my anxiety worse

Now. Just recently I have quit smoking weed for good. Its been about 4 weeks now. I can't even do it once because of how anxious it makes me and i can't enjoy it. I am currently not in a good head state and I hate it.

I am seeing a therapist. He kinda sucks. He keeps saying tell yourself ""you're doing it now"". Then the weekend hits and i end up doing nothing and my mind goes into full cycle again. I try to forget about the past but i can't. I think i need medication as a start to move forward and i'm kicking myself because i've tried so long to move forward without the medication and nothing is happenig and now I'm FINALLY seeing a psychiatrist and hope he prescribes me something helpful.

It does not help either that i fucking hate my job. It has gotten much much worse. I work at a semiconductor factory and boy is it toxic. I already work like 10 hours a day and when things aren't going right I end up in 7pm or 10pm meetings. I end up working weekends. And there is also on-call for a week every 5 weeks which is brutal. And i can't focus/sit in a chair long enough to apply to other jobs. I get anxious thinking about starting a new job, where it will be and tell myself that things will get better at work. I've been telling myself this for like 8 months now since the pandemic. 8 MONTHS.

Now. I guess when the meds making me start feel better I want to start doing things.

I want to go on a lot of dates. I want to hook up. I want to get drunk with friends. I want to be productive when its comes to my growth. I want to go camping. I want to go to concert and raves. I want to start golfing. I want to start working out and boxing. I want a NEW JOB. I want to live somewhere else but at the same time there are some many cool things to do in my home state that i never got to do. I've just been a vegetable in my room for over two years now. I'm almost 25 in 3 months and will have been out of college for 3 years now in May'21.

I want to hear that its not too late. I want to hear i can do all these things and more and not just once but tons of times. I want to hear that life will get better. That I will be able to do all these things before i get married/have kids. Because EVERYONE always tells me that once you have kids all those things i talked about won't be the same and are less likely or harder to happen. I AM SO YOUNG AND WASTING IT AWAY.

I've wasted 22, 23, and 24. So many opportutnites gone by. Just thinking about it makes me anxious. I know i am typing out a mess right now. I am crying so much as i type this. I just need help. Next thursday can't come soon enough. I just need support. I wish i was doing this for myself sooner. I'm just typing this as a cry for help. Hoping someone will notice. I don't want to end up sad,depressed,anxious, and one day end up killing myself. I do not want that."
767,just got out of psych ward; feeling emotionally confused. is this normal,"ok im a 16 year old girl, i just started my junior year last month and the stress was so overwhelming. ummm basically i stopped taking my meds over the summer then got a new doctor and started some new ones. they either didn’t work or made things worse. I never did any of my school work and spent my algebra class every day fantasizing about suicide. so basically that on top of some other things made me feel like there was nothing i could do to make things better. I went to the emergency room with a packed bag and told them I was “kind of suicidal with a kind of plan” and they admitted me, of course. it was literally the worst decision of my life so far. I had already been to this hospital 3 other times and I felt like I didn’t put enough effort in those times. i came this 4th time determined to fix myself but due to the decreasing quality of their treatment i ended up signing myself out and leaving after 5 days. i felt like i was wasting my time, my mental state was worse than it ever had been. it was completely unbearable. staff was rude, the groups were useless, doctor didn’t care, and they took forever to give me my urgent meds lol. anyway i got discharged this morning and my parents decided im not allowed to have my phone until all my schoolwork is completed. i have a lot of online friends and only a few irl ones, so this really sucks for me. i agree that i need to spend less time in my phone but my father seems to think it’s my only problem, meanwhile i have a mood disorder and other genetic illnesses. ok enough with the backstory: I’ve been crying and panicking all day. I feel so confused and I don’t know how I feel, I just have so much going on emotionally I can’t handle it. I won’t let my mom out of my sight bc I’ll freak out being alone. and i just keep crying and crying. so yeah did anyone else feel this way when they got discharged?? im so SCARED of everything for no reason and i have never felt more alone. &lt;3"
768,How can I stop my “seasonal” ptsd,"In the fall, everything lines up leading to me having flashbacks and feelings of a traumatic event that I’ve experienced. The way it smells outside, the positioning of the sun, the way it gets dark sooner, all that just triggers me so much. Last fall was hell, and although I got through many many other wonderful falls throughout my life I can’t help but think about last fall when things went down. How can I get past this? It feels like all my previous fall memories have been erased and now it’s only flashbacks and zoning out and being anxious because of it. Any suggestions?"

770,I’m loosing it....,"I’m mentally and emotionally loosing it. I’m not suicidal, but I’m so exhausted. Every direction I look there’s always something blocking my path. I just want to feel at rest in my soul and mind for once..."
771,I Can't Make it Stop,"I have pretty severe PTSD and general anxiety, largely stemming from a violent assault and traumatic brain injury I suffered 5 years ago, so panic attacks are absolutely nothing new to me; I generally have them 4-5 times a week, usually at night. In the past, I've had numerous panic attacks that were severe enough to trigger loss of consciousness, usually due to hyperventilation. 

But something has been different lately. The severity and veracity of my panic attacks has sharply, radically increased, as has my general sense of dread. Idk if it's related to the current global crises or the political tensions or whatever, or if it's something more personal, but it's been *bad.* 

I've had to call 911 twice this week. I had never called 911 for a panic attack before. The first time, I was driving alone on the freeway when a massive panic attack just suddenly hit me for no apparent reason and I very nearly passed out, had to swerve onto the shoulder and called an ambulance because I didn't know wtf was happening (and because I was also hit with a sudden bolt of pain in my head, and have that TBI, I wanted to make sure that there was nothing neurological going on). At the ER, everything was pretty much normal and they just chalked it up to a panic attack. But I didn't know how to explain that it's never been quite like *that* before. And it happened again this morning -- I had a panic attack at home with my mom and it rolled out of control so abruptly that she called 911. But once again, I was medically cleared.

I *have* had panic attacks while driving in the past, and I've also lost control of my breathing to the point of syncope before. I once had a panic attack in a public restroom and hyperventilated so severely that I just huddled into the corner of a stall and collapsed. I regained consciousness almost 20 minutes later to find the campus police yelling at me (they assumed I was drunk). So it's been bad before. But bad enough to warrant calling 911? So bad that I legitimately believe I'm about to have a fucking seizure or a stroke or something? Definitely not. 

And idk how to make it stop. My typical anxiety meds (gabapentin, Klonopin, duloxetine) have been rendered useless. My typical breathing, grounding, and stress exercises have abruptly stopped working. I feel like I'm dying all the time. I'm terrified of everything. I get so scared at night because I feel like I'm being hunted and something awful is going to happen and I can't sleep because no matter how many locks I put on the door, no matter how many weapons I have, no matter how *realistically* secure I am I still just don't feel safe. Getting through those awful hours between sunset and sunrise has become increasingly painful. I feel like I'm just bearing down against the clock and anxiously waiting for morning to come. My general resting BP has risen from 100 to nearly 140. I can't get myself to settle down.

I don't know why this has suddenly gotten so much worse and I don't know what to do about it. I saw my doctor yesterday but all she did was increase my antidepressant. The only thing I can think to do is to just lean into the fear rather than fighting against it, remind myself that I am physically, medically fine, and be comforted by the knowledge that if I do lose consciousness, that might actually be a blessing -- at least then I can relax and get some sleep. And that's helped. But it doesn't help enough to fix the problem.

Idk what to do at this point, I'm just so sick of being terrified all the fucking time."
772,Something feels off,I'm scared of people. I think people are going to hurt me. I can't be in a room with people. I'm scared to make eye contact with people. People's eyes look scary. I'm scared to talk to people. I cry when people talk to me. I'm scared of people's voices. I haven't left the house in 8 years. I opened my third eye.
773,I imagine people watching me and I imagine people talking to me,I know there is not actually anyone watching me or talking to me I just imagine it. But it won't go away. I can't make it go away.
774,On paper my life is good but I don’t like it,"On paper my life is largely progressing well but I am miserable. This was the case for a few months before lockdown too but lockdown is making me feel worse. I was in a bad spot in my early 20's, I hated myself, I spent a lot of my time just thinking about killing myself or just crying about how I had fucked up my life and then numbing it all with drug binges. I changed so many things about my life to avoid being that person again and I am achieving a lot of my goals but I always felt that this mental state was never far away and  I am back in that same mental state though without the drug abuse. Also having a lot of recent issues with work ethic and maintaining hobbies and healthy habits, all of which I used to take pride in but I don’t see the point anymore. 

Early 20’s, right after college
Job: Abusive, low paying, no room for advancement.
Hobbies: Drug and video game binges.
Health: Heavy drug and alcohol use and had a diet of mostly of fast food. Obese weight range. No exercise. 
Social: Difficulty dealing with rather basic social interactions due to social anxiety. Never dated, only ever had 1 close friend.

Late 20’s, Now
Job: Great job
Hobbies: Diverse hobbies including biking, gym, programming projects, and video games. 
Health: Very fit, healthy diet. Occasional drug and alcohol use.
Social: Got much better at transactional relationships due to work but still can’t form friendships or enjoy spending time with most other people. Still never dated or made more friends.

I am a very goal oriented person and I frequently have this drive to change my life. When things are progressing fast I feel fine but whenever I feel like the change slows down I have to deal with my current situation which I don’t get happiness from. Looking back, I don't know if I have ever found happiness from a stable life situation. I don’t know if this is a sustainable mindset as I assume that life should get more stable as I age.

I used to think that a job would bring me meaning or happiness. I have a job with a lot of responsibility in a field that I have looked up to since my mid-teens, I respect the people I work with, I usually feel respected, I get paid way more than I need but I get no pleasure or meaning out of it. I got meaning while my career was progressing but I have no real further career goals as this was my long term goal for a long time and any meaning jobs gave me beyond paying the rent is gone. I have enough savings that I don't need the job to pay the rent for a while so I am trying to work on discipline alone and no motivation which I find very hard. I can't think of any goals that feel at all desirable to motivate myself towards.

I maintain hobbies as I feel it is good to have hobbies but I rarely get much satisfaction from the activity after the honeymoon period of the first few months. I try to maintain them because I fear that if I don’t my life would have less happiness potential down the line. Activities like bike rides and video games often feel like they have a large chore component to them which they did not used to. I schedule days with a mix of work, hobbies and chores as if they are all things that I have to get done and just then do partly mindless activities like browsing reddit, lie back and do absolutely nothing at all or just cry or vent to myself about something in my mind. I also try and do my hobbies with meetups occasionally but I don’t enjoy dealing with large groups of strangers so I have not found those fun at all. How do people make a hobby satisfying for years? 

In college I sometimes obsessed with making friendships and dates happen but the dating never worked at all and the attempted friendships always felt empty and one sided. I put in less effort socially over the past 5 years though I still do occasionally try fruitlessly to date or make friends. I often feel like people don’t like me except for shallower transactional relationships such as coworker-coworker but I don’t know exactly why. I know that I miss social cues frequently and that I have been described as weird. I find it difficult to set social goals as I am introverted and I resolve most of my goals with obsessive efforts so unlike other types of goals just binging attempts until something starts to work seems like a miserable and potentially unethical strategy.

The one friend I have is in a very different stage of their life. I care about them and enjoy spending time with them but we have less and less in common and we just check in and catch up from time to time. We are both putting some effort into it rn so I hope that I am wrong. I get the impression that my family doesn't like me but tries due to the social obligation to care for family. I commonly get that paranoia about people so idk if it's based on reality or just in my mind. 

I need help but I have been reluctant to burden my family or my friend with this as I am afraid of making them feel too uncomfortable or muddying those relationships and I don’t think they can do much anyway. I looked online but I was a bit lost between psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists and counselors and I don't know what to ask for. What kind of professional might be helpful in my situation? What would I ask them for?  I am in the US."
775,I think I had some sort of stress-induced mental breakdown and I want to make sure it is nothing to worry about..,[removed]
776,We can't cope with our baby,"Our baby will be 12 weeks old in a couple days. He's amazing, my fiance and I are very much in love with him.

But we're both REALLY struggling. I've had postnatal depression hit me hard, I found it difficult to bond with the baby at the start and have been having panic attacks/suicidal thoughts and starving myself since he was born. 
I no longer struggle to bond with him and we have a beautiful relationship now, when I leave the room apparently he stares at the doorway until I come back, he gives me lovely smiles etc. However, even though my fiance coped well at the beginning, he is now struggling himself and isn't bonding with the baby anymore. He can't cope with the crying and gets super stressed out, to the point where he starts yelling and has to walk away from the baby and wake me up to take over. 

I've found this difficult because ever since he's been struggling I've been doing 80% of the work and it's fucking killing me. I'm still struggling badly with postnatal depression, which is triggered by exhaustion, so now I'm getting much less sleep I feel like I'm going insane. But I can't ask my fiance for more help because his mental health is the reason I'm doing most of the work in the first place.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared one of us is going to hurt ourselves badly soon. He's in therapy now and mine is getting set up but it hasn't made a difference for him yet. It doesn't help that we're in a horrible financial situation and barely have enough money to feed ourselves. It feels like my head is just above water and soon I'm going to drown."
777,Why do I find urban areas and suburbs depressing?,
778,When someone looks at me I get angry and annoyed?,"When someone looks in my eyes when im doing something or im with family I get really annoyed and peeved. This especially happens with family and my dad is concerned and he said ""ever since your depression you never have been the same"". I want to get better but how can I start by not getting mad when someone looks at me? And what even makes me mad when I'm looking at someone's eyes? Do I have autism"
779,Another breakdown today,"I've been having lots of breakdowns lately. Last night I wrote this whole letter that I'll never send to my best friend who's completely ghosted me in the darkest part of my life. I cried myself to sleep yesterday. 

Today I heard a song that reminded me of all I've lost, and all the pain. I started spiraling fast. I was hitting my head against my stool, I scratched myself a bit. I tried to choke myself out even though I knew it wouldn't kill me, but I wanted so bad to just tie a belt and end it, so I was doing what I could to get close I guess. I think I would describe this as a self harm episode, and it would be my first one, but definitely not the first time I've gotten close to killing myself.

My life has been in shambles for months, and now I'm starting to gain some momentum but it's all just getting darker and emptier inside, and that hope I had that putting the pieces back together would grant me some peace is gone now. I'm realizing there is nothing I'll be able to do to make it better. I want an out, but I can't bring myself to do it, I've promised my best friend I won't, and I promised my ex I wouldn't after we broke up. I'm fucking living for 2 girls who aren't even here for me anymore.

I laid in bed for a bit after and now I'm back to being empty. I know I need to go back onto medication, but to do that I'll need to get a new doctor, go to several sessions, and play the guessing game for which medicine will work for me. I don't even have health insurance anymore, I have to work at my new job another 2 months before I'll have insurance through them. I'm $800 behind on rent because of my unemployment period, so I don't have any extra funds to move around. Even if I did it would need to go to fixing my new (to me) car, that is having issues already.

I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep waking up every day empty and alone. God my birthday is this month but I've never had a good birthday in my life. Last year for my birthday my mother evicted me (on my birthday), knowing I had no where else to go, because we got in an argument about how she was taking way more of my money then we agreed on, and then I could afford. Year before that I was forced to quit school and pack up for my entire family so we could move away from everything I loved. Before that was a mess of either not having a birthday, or them throwing my name in when they sang to my youngest brother for his birthday the month afterwards. If I think about it though, surviving longer is the worst present I could get this year.

tl;dr: fuck me"
780,New Member: My Story,"Hi Everyone,

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since age 12.  I had an eating disorder for a while and now I am being medicated for anxiety and depression with Celexa @ 20mg.  I recently forgot to refill a prescription and went 2 days without my dosage.  I feel as if I've turned into a person who I don't recognize. I am extremely exhausted, irritable, can't focus, at times hyperfocused, and cannot control my emotions.  I also drink everyday about 2-3 glasses of wine and/or some hard liquor about 25% ABV. Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this when forgetting to take meds at this amount?

More of my backstory is that I quit my career after finishing school and now I'm just trying to find something to fill that gap of a passion that occupied me and gave me a purpose as much as I suffered emotionally from it. I have a few close friends and I'm so sure I'm with the love of my but I'm so lost and unmotivated...."
781,I need help,"I’ve been so scared of heart attacks a couple weeks ago I had to go go the hospital cause I thought that’s what it was and they said it was anxiety , I felt ok for a couple of days then I stared again , I went for a cardio graph and they said I was ok everything was clear and it was anxiety disorder I haven’t talked to any medical physiologist but my heart has been racing 24/7 and it randomly feels weird , do you guys think it’s anxiety making me feel like I have something wrong with me ?"
782,Sometimes I wished no one knew,"I kind of wished I never told anyone/close friends/family about my mental health. I've kept it hidden all my life (I've always managed and been strong) but due to recent events of life, it forced me to let them know. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. Although they are very supportive and caring (which I am thankful for) there are times when one of my friends or family member tell me that they feel obligated to respond when I send a message. They fear that it will be my last message to them. They feel as if I can't be left alone and need be babysat. I feel very misunderstood at times when I have my setbacks. I do have a therapist I'm talking to and I'm on medications for the first time which has helped. I guess I just feel bad because if I'm exhausted from having mental health problems, probably are too and sometimes have shown it. Do you guys ever experienced this with friends and family?"
783,Why do I feel so sad?,I feel really sad (like almost at tears) as well as really tired and weak every time I go to certain places or talk to a certain person. Why is that?
784,Family and weird nightmares.,"Hi, I will try to word this a well as I can. English is not my native language so please spare me.

So, this is my first post in this subreddit. I have been diagnosed with depression for about 2 years, but I guess it never really occurred to me that I actively suffer from ""depression"" until the past few months. Recently I started to realize that my relationship with my mom was pretty abusive. Getting hit every once in a while wasn't so bad, so I ignored it. It wasn't happening daily anyways. What set off my alarms and made me go ""Maybe this isn't too good"" was realizing that I was considering suicide fairly often, mostly because I kept getting told that my mom would ""rather die than deal with this shit"". After that, chain memories of mental abusive started to show themselves again, stuff that I have learned to ignore as they were 'not that bad'. These were stuff like getting yelled at and told that I was useless just because I cried, or having to constantly deal with my mother's stress that had nothing to do with me (My mom is a lawyer, which is obviously a stressful job.).

Anyways, I was recently told by two of my teachers that I might have ADHD and/or OCD (I also have dyslexia.) and when I asked my mom to get tested, she raised her voice and told me it would only bring more problems with it as if the illness doesn't exist if you don't get if diagnosed. I insisted that it was necessary, she started to yell again and didn't stop until I was very clearly crying and having a panic attack. She then sat down and I just started to list off every abusive thing she does daily. Me, just talking, her, just nodding and saying yes sometimes. Now, I know people want to be proven that they were understood, but my god, did I ever feel as good and understood as my mom just not speaking. So, I kept talking, and she kept agreeing until the topic came to manipulation and gaslighting. She just suddenly started yelling when I told her what gaslighting was, getting up and screaming about how I was trying to 'frame' her. And at that point, I was still pretty calm, until she said ""This is who I am."". Now, these types of quotes are her most common excuses to not feel bad about the stuff she does, 'I am human too', 'I am no saint I have my limits'. So, when I heard then, it triggered something in me. I just laughed (NOT an expected reaction from me, im usually silent and non-confrdential.), and asked her why she made me explain how much of a shit parent (I never swear, not IRL at least) she was for the past 2 and a half hours. At that minute, coincidentally, my older sister called my phone. I opened the phone, put it on the speaker, and asked my sister, in as calm of a voice as I could sound at that moment, what she needed.

""\[my name\], you sound upset, are you okay?""

""Oh no, im doing amazing, other than the fact that I explained how awful she was to our mother for the past 2 and a half hours just to be told that im overreacting!""

(not knowing mom can hear her) ""Well, expected reaction really. Do you wanna talk about it or should I call later?""

So I end the phone call, look at my mom in the eyes for a few seconds and then just go to my room and lock myself in.

I still love my mother, don't get me wrong, and I definitely want to keep a good relationship with her. But I can no longer ignore the obvious problems she has that she refuses to confront. I have been staying in my room for the past few weeks, not really going outside or even to the other rooms of the house, not interacting with my mom at all.  This all also happened after I butchered my high school entrance exam, even worse then I had expected and I thought I was lowballing.

I have also not been eating properly, talking to anyone, or be able to sleep. (I actually try to sleep but I can't, Im writing this at 5:31 am)

I started to have nightmares recently. For like.. 3 months now. Pretty much every night, sometimes even twice at a time. These nightmares aren't like any I had before, they aren't someone murdering people, or me getting chased down or all that normal stuff. These nightmares are always set in the room im sleeping in, my body unable to move, stuck in the position I fell asleep in, or the one that im going to wake up in. These nightmares usually star these ambiguous figures, nearly none of them actually being gory, but having different aspects of them that are creepy (like really messed up anatomy).  But the catch is that none of these 'creatures' actually interact with me, or even look at me directly. They are just.. there. Two of the most rememberable and reassuring of these 'creatures' are a human top with a hard-shelled spider body that crawls on the ceiling and a man in a suit that I can never see the face of. I came here mainly to ask if there is anything significant about these nightmares.

I think that's it. I know that these are probably me just overreacting as a teenager (Im 14, and I am aware that that is still relatively young.), or at least that's what im told. But it won't hurt to try this, right?

Im sorry if I wasted someone's time with this that they could use on someone who needs it more, sorry."
785,I wish I didnt have issues,"Sometimes I feel like I cannot manage my life like other people. I dont deal with stress very well. I hate talking to people unless I know them. I feel like people hate me. I also get a lot of paranoid thoughts. I take 10 mg of abilify every day. I also have Autism. I also struggle with sadness sometimes.

Other people I know are moving out of their parents houses. I feel so lazy and incompetent. I dont even have a job. I dont know if I could manage a job interview. Some days I wish I could just be normal. It would be just a bit easier. I would probably be able to deal with my stress better. I would also quit having paranoid thoughts. They get so bad sometimes. I start to think that people hate me and that they want bad things to happen to me. I also feel like they want to keep me down and they manipulate me to keep me feeling bad about myself. Even though they say they want to help. The medication helps with this."
786,Not being able to control yourself,"I just had a mental break down anxiety attack ptsd episode. I overthink and have thought loops and obsessive dumb thoughts. I’ve had no one I could trust or betrayed my from friends to family, I need help it’s getting worse I started punching my thighs and cutting myself lightly and now I just sliced up my leg tried to slice my throat and take my own life I always wanted to hurt myself but never kill myself. I feel like I’m loosing it. I feel weak been through to much that I can’t take it any longer I feel useless and hate myself for letting everyone walk all over me and hurt me my whole life and I’m scared and the fact I can’t control my mind or anger makes it harder because I try to hold on and that makes it worse and I want to jump out of my skin and just don’t know how to control it I need help I can’t take it anymore I had a near death experience when my ex from a 5 year relationship and so much abuse, I was 15-20 in that relations he tried to kill me in a car crash and the abuse just got worse and worse each time because would have anger outbursts and abuse out of no where I feel dumb for saying with him during that but that was my first long term relationship we were young and and my dad was only in my life for child support and a lot more. I have no one but my amazing boyfriend and this has been taking a toll on our relationship because I love him dearly with all my heart and after my freak outs I hate myself for putting him through it all and that’s when I hurt myself because I get so mad he deserves the world and I’m just not mental stable he’s by my side no matter what and I appreciate that so much support. This just feels too much and I can’t control."
787,My close friend is planning to kill himself by the end of the year and I don’t know what to do,"I always knew he wasn’t totally there and happy like he always seemed to be because there were times he’d stop going to classes and basically self-sabotage himself. The first time he did it was last year when he broke up with his girlfriend (didn’t know it at the time but just recently found out). They were together again after that but that time he disappeared from many of his old friends’ lives-including his best friend since highschool. He only talked to me and a couple of other people since then. Now, he’s broken up with his girlfriend again and he’s dropping out of school again. He told our group (me and the people he still talked to) that he’s planning to kill himself and has been since that first time he disappeared. He said he’s always known. Can’t tell you how painful and sad I was realizing that all this time where we were making memories and having fun he was feeling that way through it all. I have no idea what to do. He hates it when I tell him he needs help because apparently he’s tried and he believes they just use a script. He’s one of the most stubborn people I know so I can never get him to do something he doesn’t want to. Telling his family is not a good option too since they don’t have a good relationship and he explicitly said involving his family would make it worse. When someone told his mom that he stopped going to classes again that’s when he spoke to us about killing himself. I’m not even supposed to know that he’s still planning to kill himself because he’s only told one person who he swore to secrecy. I’m glad that person shared but I have no clue what to do. Please help."
788,Is it wrong to want to be the cause of everything wrong in the world,"I know I'm not mental sound, I accepted this long ago, but why can't I just be the route of all evil. Why can't I just be the thing that ruined it all for everyone?
Why can't I be the one thing, everyone blames so when I die someone out can find a good reason to live for? 

All I've wanted is someone to give me a reason a purpose. All I have is an excuse, all I have to keep.me going thing the fact that when I die someone gonna waste a tear on me. It's not even a real reason to carry on, even if I keep looking for another 14-50years it's still no guarantee that I'll ever find a reason. 

St this point I just want this stupid virus to kill me so someone else can just blame it on it just like I would. 

Sorry I wasted your time with that 
Just remember I'm the reason people make mistake and it wasn't your fault it was mine."
789,Fathers death,"Hello everyone. Last week, the best man on this planet passed away. My father. I walked in on it, and so did my mother. I’m 21, and while my mother frantically screamed in the back, 911 forced me to do CPR. It did not work. 

The thing is, it’s been a week, and i still see it every single day, multiple times a time. The entire incident. His pale face. The noise. My mother. Everything. I see it as soon as i wake up, when i’m showering, when i eat, when i paint, when i converse, etc. 

I don’t know what to do, the only option i see is suicide. As i simply cannot live with this memory of my father, especially seeing it constantly. I’m not sure what this would be, PTSD, Depression, maybe everything combined. But i cant live with it. So please, if anyone has a recommendation on how i can get help or something, let me know."
790,One of my Zoom classes seems impossible and I want to vent,"So I'm taking four classes. Three of them use Zoom and one is sort of free-form. I've had no trouble with three of the classes, but one of the Zoom classes is going very poorly. Allow me to give examples: this course requires a separate website (Launchpad) that most of our assignments are on. Launchpad is glitchy as hell for me. The biggest assignments will not save, so they cannot be completed. I also have to change my password every time I log in because of some weird glitch. I emailed my teacher and called tech support. They told me to do things I already did, no luck. 

There is a quiz for each module that is actually on our class's Blackboard, not Launchpad. The quizzes are open for one hour only on a day we don't have class. There have been two quizzes so far. I forgot to do both of them. I emailed the teacher explaining how I genuinely forgot. I didn't check my email for her reply until the next day. She had responded the same day, saying ""I opened the both quizzes for you today at 3 and 4 pm."" So I'm reading this the day after. I had missed it again. I sent a reply pretending I thought she meant today, the day I checked, and said I would look out for the quizzes today. I started doing homework for my other classes, realize it's 5:30pm and I hadn't remembered to check if she opened them again. I feel like I'm going crazy. It's my fault, but I just wanna say ""why can't you just keep the quiz open and say it's due at a certain time, like all my other classes? Why are you making us use this website that doesn't even work? This class is so needlessly complicated compared to my other classes."" 

On top of that, there's a guy in the zoom class who always talks before I can say a response to the professor, and he always says something fucking weird and pointless. Half the class is taken up by people asking questions about technical issues. 

I tried to drop the class but it didn't work. I checked the school calendar, it says from now until November, classes can be dropped with a ""compelling reason."" So I sent an email to the school saying like, ""the website my teacher uses doesn't work, I've tried to fix it, and I can't. I don't want to spend so much time on technical issues when I should be doing schoolwork"" and I'm hoping this is a compelling enough reason. I wish the school would get back to me as fast as she did yesterday. 

Anyway, I feel dumb and I'm angry. Please share your ridiculous zoom stories with me or something. And thank you for reading. I hope the format isn't all messed up."
791,"To those who are struggling or have struggled, how did you go about moving out and being independent?","Just as the title says.

I’m growing up and I want to learn to become independent but it’s so difficult doing so while struggling with multiple mental difficulties"
792,I feel terrible and I just honestly need someone right now.,"My parents and I have had a terrible 5-7 years of apparently MY bullshit. Even tho I had been diagnosed with MANY disorders.

I really need it. I am 17 about to turn 18 in December. My parents told me that they are gonna kick me out on my birthday so I really need all the help I can get. If you read this whole thing.

793,I feel depressed from lots of things,"I wanted to add more flairs but it made me only choose one. Like the title says, I feel depressed from lots of things and I can’t seem to talk to anyone. Not even my husband or my chain of command. I’m in the military, yes. So, I have all of this bottled in and I feel like I’m gonna explode. 
Let’s start with my job. I feel like I can’t reach out to anyone in my shop because no one can keep a secret. Everyone talks about each other’s personal business like it’s everybody’s business. I’m not happy with the job I ended up with and I’m only a year in. I get anxious and depress about going to work the next day. 
I can’t talk to my husband because when I talk about my feelings, he always says “why you gotta be like that””Debbie downer””why you gotta be a grumpus””you stop being a grumpus?””why you gotta start fights?”.  I’m starting to think this marriage isn’t working out and we lost our connection. I’m sure when he reads this, he might ask why I’m saying these things even though I told him how I felt. 
I either want to scream or cry my eyes out but I can’t because I’m mostly at work and I don’t want to cry in front of my supervisors and co workers. When I get home, my husband is there and I don’t want to cry in front of him. 
Idk what to do."
794,"Would Like some wholesome advice or whatever,",[removed]
795,I don't think I'm mentally prepared for university,"I've only had my induction so far and I'm even staying at home. But I don't think I can even do that. 

I used to think that if I didn't go I'd end up so bored and lonely I'd want to die, but I'm stressing out more than I could've imagined. It's on the same level of stress as when I had a very bad two months last year, the worst stress I ever had. 

I'm killing myself slowly and unintentionally. I'm already underweight and when I get stressed I can't eat much.

I don't know if I should stick with it a bit longer and see if I feel any better or take a year out to get therapy and work on myself, even if I will be painfully lonely. Although we are in a pandemic so I guess a lot of people are lonely. 

I feel lost and stuck and very scared."
796,I have an intense fear of social media,"You could say I am inactive on Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat and whatever else.

I have accounts and they have a few pics but not really anything from the last few years. I am fine being anonymous or being the persona of my gamer tag though, I feel no anxiety with reddit or xbox.

I think it is stems back to childhood (I am 22 now) I was overweight and bullied for it, I dyed my dark hair and was bullied for it, I liked twilight, I was bullied, I liked Halloween, a rumour started that I hate Christmas. I think the worst werr the comments about my weight... and body. I still hear those voices when I look at myself in the mirror... 

Being depressed and thinking if people knew I was upset and hurt and lonely they would realise how horrible they were being and would be my friend, like in movies when people have a heart to heart, except I posted these on Facebook. Nothing bout suicide, just like some people are so mean, I have no friends etc, cringy and I now know that being down and miserable doesn't make people want to be your friend, it can get annoying.

People I didnt even know came up to me in school, people years younger than me said hey, aren't you that depressing girl from Facebook? 

I just want to state we had a school uniform, and one time said why do you always wear black??? Like cause we all have to? Lol but I wasn't a goth or emo, I wore white shorts and blue jeans at home, no make up, just brown or red hair... 

A few years back I lost 75lbs and posted one picture of my face, posed, in the sunlight freckles showing where I felt good and posted it. No bad reaction but I haven't posted since. I have gained maybe 45lbs back, (being in a relationship and having what I think is an undiagnosed eating disorder).

Thing is, posting on social media fills me with panic and fear and anxiety, I picture myself making tiktoks and posting them, using Snapchat when messing about, posting pictures of my cute outfits on Instagram.  But I do not like how I look and I am scared of someone being mean and calling me fat, even I would I am not, I think I am and that would confirm it.

Everyone my age uses social media and I want to hop on the train but I am scared... even commenting on things on a profile where my face is visible makes me anxious, what if someone hates my opinion and finds my profile and calls me ugly? I do not care if people do not like me but I care about them attacking my appearance.

University is online and as a vocalist lots of my classes have webcam, and this makes me anxious! I have to record me singing my assignments and it makes me anxious! I want to post singing videos of YouTube but the idea makes me full of dread! 

I have no problem singing in real life to big crowds or one to one. I am confident on stage, I am confident on stage with an audience and a camera. I am no confident with no audience and just a camera or an audience through the camera...

Any advice?"

798,why being suicidal/mentally ill makes everyone treat me as a child?,"I'm 21F and I already went in more than 5 doctors and therapist and they ALL insisted in the same thing: they want my mom to go to the appointments with me.

I had mental illness during all my life and my mom refused to pay a therapist for me. I had to wait until I was 18+ and had some money of my own to be able to look for treatment for myself and even after all that they still don't want to help me. I understand why having a support is important but not in my case! I don't want my mom with me for a million reasons but no one hears me.

My options are either getting help or suicide and I know what's the right one but I have no motivation to look for one more doctor and have the same experience again and again. My last therapist and doctor were awesome and I thought they were the right ones and they still insisted in it.

Honestly, some days suicide seems to be the best and easiest option..."
799,TW : mentions of s*icide,"When I was 12/13 my best friend at the time, we’ll call her Mary, had depression. 

The summer before grade 8. She was ‘self diagnosed’ but it was so obvious she had it. 

I remember always making plans to hangout, and she never really wanted to. Saying she’d bore me. 
I’d go over anyways, with chips, some drinks, and a fully charged iPad. 

She’d always say, “I found this funny video you’d like.” And I knew that was code for ‘I can’t get out of bed today.’ 

We’d spend all day in her bed watching movies, talking, and I’d do my best to cheer her up. Or make her feel a little better.

She often talked about wanting to die, and I’d always convince her there was more to life. That she was too important, too many people care. 

Come grade 8, she was doing better now that she had a routine. But she was short with me, mocking me, bullying me, and having to prove she was better than me at anything and everything.  

I still stuck with her, defended her, and stayed her friend. 

I didn’t realize it then, but she was trying to push me away. She wanted to convince herself nobody cared, her parents said she was faking it and her sister was far too young to understand (fully). 
She thought nobody cared and nobody understood.
But I understood and I cared. And because of that, she pushed me away a lot (to protect me from her demons - or so she said a few years later) 
She wanted me gone. So she would feel no regrets leaving herself or fully giving up without killing herself. 


We’re now 16, no longer friends. But she didn’t push my away. 

She started getting better and feeling better. And then, one day, it dawned on me, she didn’t need me anymore. 
So I let go. 


I just hope that someone is still looking out for her like I once did."

801,How do I stop working so much?,"This post might seem odd or counter intuitive from the loads of ""how do I stop procrastinating?"" questions I see here a lot, but I work, study, and work on my crafts and skills practically all day with barely any breaks in between, and if I do it for a while, then it starts affecting my mental health negatively.

Everyone I know tells me to ""take a break"" or ""rest"" but never tell me how I can break myself from this cycle, as a day or two off won't really change the mindset I've had since I was 15 years old.

Also I work on improving my craft and skills, or just do ordinary side gig work whenever I am bored, which adds to the stress in my life.

tl; dr I am a workaholic and want to know if anyone knows how to break the cycle."
802,Please help,"I need to cry right now but I can’t, I can’t cry or make myself cry no matter what I do the emotion just isn’t strong enough but I want to cry so bad and I’ve tried so many ways, if anyone knows how I can cry right now please lmk because I’ve got nothing left, the only way I can think of to make myself cry is through physical pain and not even that’s worked before so I have no idea what to do I’m just trapped"
803,Memory Loss (Possible tw!),"
The first vivid memory I have took place a few weeks before my 13th birthday. It was of the first time I self harmed. turning 14 in December this year. All I can remember from my childhood is that I was bullied, but that’s it. Barely any details. 

I know one boy pushed me into walls, stole my stuff, (and way more I’m not fully aware of but I know happened) but I don’t really have the memories, they’re all cloudy if you know what I mean. The ones that aren’t cloudy don’t even exist. 

I know I’m October last year (I was 12, so before I cut for the first time) a friend called me a sin in front of a whole class, but I can’t actually access that memory, it’s also cloudy. I just know it happened. 

Even the memory of me self harming for the first time is starting to get cloudy. I don’t know why I can’t remember anything but I hate it. I hate it so much. Does this happen to you?"
804,How to move on from emotionally abusive friendship,"Long story short, I had a “friend” a few years back who was pretty terrible. She gaslighted me, harassed  me, violated my privacy, almost forced me to make out with a friend against both of our wishes, told me I was a burden, the list goes on.

She always played the victim and NEVER took responsibility for her own actions. She always made out everyone else to be the bad guy and pitied herself 24/7. Even in situations where it’s so blatantly clear that she was wrong, she was entitled and self righteous.

The worst part is that others don’t know that. Those who do don’t do anything about it. A lot of people view her as a good person who is talented and stuff without knowing her true colors. She mistreated me and others and got away with it through manipulation and gaslighting.

A part of me wants to destroy her, but I haven’t even seen her in years. Our last encounter ended on decent terms, I wasn’t interested in interacting with her and her feelings seemed neutral-good. 

I still feel angry from time to time. For financial reasons, I can’t afford therapy. I also don’t have any friends who are really willing to listen. 

How can I move on from this?"
805,Why I quit everything.,"I recently quit working because I was sick of people telling me what to do and disrespecting me even though I do everything they ask me to (I’m a perfectionist so ended up panic attacks at work)

After work I would come home to a sick mother who is always telling me what to do, and criticizing my every move: how I should walk “straighter”, how I should wash my face 3 times a day and how I should eat more veggies with my meals etc. etc. Every move I make is being criticized. My blood boils everyday.

Spending time with my boyfriend consists of me doing chore for him. My boyfriend who has constant demands for me, keeps telling me to do things for him. Like buying him smokes and  giving him money. Which i did even though i didnt want to.

Then, on weekends I go to drills for national guard, where obviously I can’t even piss without getting permission and yet again I’m constantly getting told what to do. 

I started talking to a church pastor who I thought would be helpful. He was good at first but it came to a point where he would constantly ask about my body weight (and if lost weight or not). He said loosing weight would make me feel better. So I went on a diet..

Few months later, my doctor tells me I’m anemic and low on many key nutrients. 

I keep on thinking this is not the life I want to live. Over and over. Im sick of being told what to do EVERY f,ucking day. Im sick of my every move being criticized EVERYDAY. I DONT GET FREEDOM AT WORK, HOME OR WITH MY BOYFRIEND. Even my weekends FEEL LIKE A PRISON because of military.

I WANTED TO BE FREE! And do something on my own for once without being told what to do by someone else.

This is why I quit everything.

I quit my day job. 
I quit the relationship with my boyfriend.
I quit eating vegetables.
I quit going to church and seeing the pastor.
I spend most of my days in bed, reading reddit and crying because I dont want to live this way. 

I have no desire to be around people anymore.
Because I get panic attacks around people nowdays.

I dont have the desire to smoke/drink/do drugs or have sex.

I dont have the desire for ANYTHING/ANYONE.
I have lost my passion for everything and I dont know what to do."
806,Living in black and white,Today I was supposed to go see my friends that I haven’t seen in quite a while but I couldn’t get myself to go see them the main issue on why is because of my mental health you see I took a tab of acid and got stuck in a trip with a new reality being that everyone can hear my thoughts and that everyone feels what I feel and as much as I try to push myself to be optimistic and cheered up I’m depressed nothing feels right no matter what I do I stay in my room when I’m not at work .. I try to express emotion but as soon as I try my brain just freaks out or hold back on feeling because I don’t know what’s real and what’s not real I don’t care anymore if people can hear my thoughts I just want the truth and I’ve had some pretty strange things happen ever since it started to verify that it is true I’m on meds now but it’s still kinda feels the pain I just don’t feel as much I guess so if you all really can hear me just say so.
807,I don’t know what the hell is going on with me. Can someone help?,"I don’t exactly know how to characterize my mood changes/overall issue with my mental health. I go through a cycle of moods that lasts about a week and a half. I go for 3-4 days in a severe depressive state (I don’t get as much work/school done as I’d like, and I actively plan my own suicide). Then, I transition to a state of indifference for another 3-4 days, where I don’t actively want to die but I also don’t feel happy or content. After that, I see a day or two where I’m at least moderately content; not very happy, but at least content and somewhat positive. Then, I fall to a severe depressive state and the cycle begins anew.

I don’t really know what this is or what it means. Can anyone help?"
808,I’ve had a rough week,"   So first of all due to school starting up again recently my schedule for taking my antidepressants is wack. 
No physical side affects but I can feel the depression coming back full force and it’s killing me inside.

However, it’s gotten worse this past week.

   Second of all, I had to deal with this massive rumour that one of my friends were gay. They weren’t - my other friend was actually the one to spread the rumour.
So I had to figure out how to correct the rumour, because I was the one to notify the rumour’s victim.
I felt like I was betraying both of them. The one who spread it because I was throwing them under the bus, and the one who was called gay because I wanted to support the rumour-spreader as well.

   Third of all, I had to deal with a test and two projects - one of which has to deal with making a public speech.
All of this combines with the earlier stress of my mother having surgery. She’s doing great but that repressed stress is not helping.

   I have broken down 5.5 times this week into a meltdown (I have ASD) and I wonder of the point of it all.
Everything seems so... hopeless. Hopeless but I know that it will get better soon but there’s the constant thought of what if it doesn’t get better soon??
My cat scratched me Friday. He was trying to play. 
It made me cry.
My mother - my dear, dear mother - has been supporting me all the way through.

   But I can’t take it.

I can’t take the stress of it all - any of it. My only relief of the pain is poetry, because regular art and writing is no longer working.
Neither is hanging out with friends.
Neither is hanging out online.

It just... hurts.
I want to know how to fix it, how to be less stressed."
809,I Feel Useless,"I feel really useless to my groupmates in my school projects at the moment. Although I'm basically the most responsible person in my group, I can't help but feel useless because my mind is really clouded right now and not working well at the moment ever since one of my classmates and friends died last month due to suicide. I feel very stupid that I can't force myself to think harder. I feel angry that my mind just won't work well when I need it the most.   


Sorry for the rant. I'm struggling with my studies. I wish I could get out."
810,I have psychosis and I’m scared.,"Someone told me to post this here.

In the very early morning I saw a spider on my wall. It may have been a hallucination.

I heard a knocking on a downstairs window. That’s impossible because there is a screen on it. An auditory hallucination?

Tonight I saw something black at the corner of my eye. It looked like a black shirt being picked up fast in midair. It was probably a hallucination.

I just heard a loud short beep noise. Possibly the fire alarm or another alarm of some kind. But... possible hallucination.

I was so scared that I cried. I thought my psychosis wasn’t that bad. I thought it was triggered when I was mentally and physically tired.

I don’t know what to do."
811,Not doing so good with my first job. My mental health is getting in the way,"I started a job as a concierge about a month ago- I wasn’t harsh with myself because I thought I’d give it some time for me to get comfortable. But I’m still really uncomfortable and quiet and awkward. I don’t have my sleep schedule under control. I’m not sleeping, I’m constantly awake for 24 hours. My eating disorder habits weren’t under control before and this isn’t helping. I don’t know how to socialize. Quarantine made it worse and I haven’t had actual social interaction in a long time way before that. I’m there for 9 hour shifts. I feel like a burden and like no one there likes me. Or I give off the vibe that I’m helpless and so fragile and someone they have to worry about and take care of. (Not the case at all but I give off that energy without wanting to). I’ve never been so conscious. If I do or say something wrong- I can’t stop thinking about it. Ever since I started, I feel like I can’t stop thinking about how awful I’m being. It takes me a long time to get comfortable but this is so slow. Maybe it’s the age differences- I’m okay in school around people who aren’t so different from me. I’ve always still felt like an outsider and like I don’t belong anywhere but since working, it’s more intense. I also have to be happy cheerful for the job and it’s tiring. I don’t have room to be depressed. I’m not good at the job- I’m not thinking clearly from food and sleep deprivation. I feel useless too because I work on the days that there’s nothing to do- they’re not busy. I feel like I stress everyone out even more. I’m definitely shady- I won’t eat in front of them. Or give explanations for my strange behaviors. I haven’t told anyone about my mental illnesses. I feel like they all see how uncomfortable and awkward strange and hidden I am and don’t wanna be around me. Another thing is when my mood drains and I get depressed to where it’s more noticeable- I drain everyone around me and suck the positive energy out of the room. I definitely overthink and over analyze and feel like it’s not safe for me unless I study every person and figure them out before I can socialize. I get complimented on how I look but nothing else. I think they think I’m just sitting there all day doing nothing and am not smart and nothing but a “pretty one” that watches the lobby and attends the guests. I’ve NEVER been this self conscious about social interaction."
812,Traumatized by recent experience with Baker Act- very long sorry!,"I (30sF) am hoping my post here will help me gather some support, shared experiences and any suggestions on how to deal with what occurred. Little nervous to post.  Will probably delete lol I live in New England area. TL;DR at bottom. 

I have a history of depression and anxiety. I have a therapist/med prescriber who I have been seeing for 5 plus years. I take anxiety medication. I have taken anti depressants but don’t really like them and try to manage with therapy. Mostly, I’m in pretty good shape but I’m easily overwhelmed by stress. In recent weeks I have been going through a very difficult time. I came very close to making an undoable decision about two weeks ago, but obviously did not. There was no actual action or attempt. I contacted my therapist and family support, shared what happened, and have been trying to work through it. I’ve definitely been bummed out since then. Sleeping a lot, took some time off work. But still showering, taking my dog out, ran a few errands... 

However, earlier this week I experienced a stressful situation that threw me into complete panic, an active panic attack. I ended up driving myself to the ER and asking for a mental health evaluation. In the middle of the crowded public waiting room a hospital staff member asked me, “If you were going to kill yourself how would you do it?” I gave a response. The way the question was phrased (or how I recall it being phrased) I did not realize I was being asked if I was planning to actively do this. My own stupidity. This was within the first five minutes of my arrival. I was taken back to a room and held and within about 45 minutes I was completely calm, extremely remorseful and realized I had acted incredibly impulsively. I was evaluated by a clinician and another staff (a PA maybe?) I was totally lucid, explained that I had no intention of harming myself, spoke about my supports and requested that before any decision be made that my therapist be contacted. In the course of the discussion, I paused to ask what was occurring here, what my rights were, what a Section 12 involved etc. and the clinician responded poorly to that. She made a statement along the lines that she felt because I was well spoken and intelligent that I was trying to be evasive. Long story long, they held me for 6 hours during which time I was able to contact my therapist, who was appalled that a section was being considered, wanted to speak to staff and wanted me released with stipulations. The clinician would not speak to her until she already completed the section, contacted my insurance, and found me a bed. Contacted her after and said, “This is a courtesy call.” Most of the staff were nice, but the evaluating clinician was openly condescending to the point that another staff apologized to me. 

I was then transported by ambulance to a facility. I was not happy and continued to repeat my belief that this was unnecessary given that I was clearly calm, had outside supports, a therapist involved, etc. After finding out about the section my therapist advised me to request an emergency hearing as soon as I arrived. 

On the ride over I was pleasant with EMS staff (when they dropped me off they apologized to me because they felt I was clearly not headed to the right place.) I was brought up to the acute ward. I was calm, polite to staff and evaluated by the night nurse. Her evaluation was that I clearly was not appropriate for this facility and did not need to be there. This was noted in my file. (Later that evening, a second staff member spoke to me and stated the same thing, as did the nurse in charge of medications) However, I did sign the conditional voluntary admission as I was told by staff at the hospital and facility to do so as it might at least minimize the stay to the 72 hours. I requested the emergency hearing immediately. 

When everything was done it was around 11:30. I was placed in a room with a woman who alternated from catatonic to needing sedation and staff intervention and who soiled herself and left it in the bathroom where no area was cleaned until I asked. The patients on the unit ranged from not awake/lucid to screaming threats, withdrawing from drugs, defecating and urinating on themselves etc. 

I want to pause here and say I hold no judgement about any of these people. I work in the mental health field myself and struggle with mental illness. When I was not consumed by my own fear while there I was consumed by fear for others and the conditions. The staff were all very nice, but the facility felt unsafe and was not sanitary at all. However, I do also understand that for many people these stays and course of treatment are helpful and needed. 

Sorry I know this is long I’ll try to wrap up. I was there for 15 hours before my admission was complete and I was able to speak with the clinician who evaluates patients and decides who stays and goes as well as my case manager. During this time, I asked multiple times to please speak with someone. I spoke with my therapist multiple times and she was eager to speak with someone to have me discharged. Each staff member I spoke to prior to my evaluation echoed the same sentiment: that I did not need to be there and they were all noting this and advocating for this. 

When I spoke to the “team” I maintained composure. I spoke again about my supports, my plan with my therapist, the fact that I did not feel unsafe at all, had no plan, had never made any attempts, etc. I took out the “rights” they had given me upon my arrival and stated that I felt my right to appropriate treatment was being violated and that I was not being treated humanely as I was on a ward where I felt my mental health and physical well being was being actively harmed rather than helped. During this evaluation I also brought up that I had requested an emergency hearing upon my arrival 15 hours ago. They had never had someone request that before and had to look into it— I was then informed I was not entitled to one because I signed the conditional voluntary. I was told I could sign a 3 day notice. 

During this time the case manager spoke to my therapist who echoed that I needed to be released, this was not appropriate and that I was not a danger. The case manager, night nurse and unit manager all wanted me released and stated so. The evaluating doctor did not. She was not in any rush and instead only wanted to discuss what medication for my depression I would like to have them give me during my stay. When she left the room the case manager stated that she and the unit manager disagreed with her opinion and were going to go over her head. 

Once it became clear I was not being discharged and would have to spend another night (which I can’t even describe the terror of) I stated that I would not continue with the evaluation and wanted to speak to a lawyer. I stated I would not return to the unit as it was unsafe. Once I began speaking about a lawyer, they were pretty quick to get the lead doctor (sorry I don’t know the proper term- but the head honcho) in to speak with me. He asked me 3 questions, spoke to my mom, and had signed papers for my discharge within 20 minutes. I was home within two hours. 

I have been home for a few days and feel completely traumatized by my experience there. For 17 plus hours I did not leave the room I was in. I didn’t eat or shower because I was afraid and the facility was so unclean. I saw and heard things that frightened me. I have met with my therapist. I have been having nightmares. I woke up screaming last night. I don’t want my husband to leave me alone because I feel anxiety that someone from the facility will show up at my door and drag me back (I know they won’t). I want to stop all mental health treatment (even though my therapist basically saved me from languishing in there). I feel so ashamed that in a moment of panic I started such a chain of events. I can’t even imagine the bill I’m going to get in the mail. I have a child and during this ordeal he was with his father (who I have a great relationship with) but was scheduled to come home to me. I informed him of the situation (I didn’t describe what led to where I was, just where I was) and keep obsessing that CPS or something will show up or I could have my son taken from me because I was held in a facility. 

I know this was a novel but it’s the first time I’ve shared it in a community I feel safe in. Was my experience fair? Am I overreacting? How long will this feeling of trauma last? I apologize again for the length or if anything I’ve written comes across as unkind or offensive. I felt for every single person on that unit because I was so shocked by the conditions and the true state of the mental health system. I just feel lost. I know everything I have written is scattered. If you take the time to read and comment thank you! 

TL;DR- Was sent to psych facility on Baker Act. Held for 17 hours. Multiple supports echoed section should not have occurred in the first place, facility staff advocating my discharge, personal therapist as well. Doctor still tried to hold me and I was discharged almost immediately once I went above her head and asked for a lawyer. Feel completely traumatized by my experience in facility and almost feel worse because of it. Don’t know how to process, if I was treated fairly etc."
813,Overall mess.. multiple mental illnesses.. need advice??? maybe just to vent??," TW: disassociation, Eating disorders

(19f) i have struggled with depression for years now and it’s just gotten unbearable lately. i am completely numb and struggle with horrible dissasociative episodes and they have gotten worse since i stopped therapy. i lose time, i can’t tell whats real anymore, i feel nothing. i feel like i’m watching a movie of someone else’s life. everything feels fake. any time i feel anything it’s just an overall bad feeling that feels like everything hurts. it’s to the point where i can’t even hold my own body weight anymore. i just collapse on the floor of my room and sob. but the worst thing is this goes for a week or two unless i decide to completely shut out my emotions and fall back into being numb. it’s only getting worse bc i recently was diagnosed with a life altering and debilitating spinal condition and i have been unable to move out of an emotionally abusive household. i just don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t look at myself anymore. i’ve covered all the mirrors in my room and bedroom and won’t look at myself in my camera or in windows.  i don’t even know where to begin to fix this. the only time i feel anything is when i sob for hours or have a fucking panic attack over the smallest things. Everyone makes me out to be lazy at this point and i feel like i can’t turn to anyone without them saying i’m not trying to get better. i really am though. i want to be happy so bad. i don’t know why i can’t just be fucking happy. 

i guess what i’m trying to say is... where do i start? how can i even begin to get better"
814,On paper my life is good but I don’t like it,"On paper my life is mostly progressing in line or above my expectations but I am miserable. A few months ago I started I started to lose most of my motivation and spending more and more time finding small things I don't like about my life, unproductively crying about them and questioning my life value. Lockdown definitely made it much worse as I think I could handle most of it before but I think that I have other long standing issues. 

I was also in a bad spot in my early 20's, I hated myself, I spent many hours a day crying about how I had fucked up my life or thinking about whether to kill myself and eventually just numbing it all with drug binges. I also feel like I had reasonable reasons to hate parts of life, my job sucked and was abusive, my health was bad, I had no hobbies other than drugs and video games and could not handle many basic social interactions such as talking to store attendants and only had one distant friend. I changed so many things about my life to avoid being that person again. At 27, I now work my dream job, am very fit, active and mostly sober, have diverse somewhat respectable hobbies and although I still have not made any more close friends or dated, I am much better at handling regular social interactions due to the practice I get at work. I am achieving a lot of my goals but I always felt that this mental state was never far away and briefly came back when I had any void in my life. I am almost fully back though without the drug abuse. From a big picture, my life should be the best it has ever been and completely different but I feel like I am back in the same bad place.

I am a very goal oriented person and I am usually trying to find ways to make long term changes to my life. When things are progressing fast I feel fine but whenever I feel like the change slows down I have to deal with my current situation which I don’t get happiness from. Looking back, I don't know if I have ever found happiness from a stable life situation. I don’t know if this is a sustainable mindset as I assume that life should get more stable as I age.

I used to think that a job would bring me meaning or happiness. I have a job with a lot of responsibility in a field that I have looked up to since my mid-teens, I respect the people I work with, I usually feel respected, I get paid way more than I need but I get no pleasure or meaning out of it anymore. I got most of my life meaning from my job while my career was progressing but I have no real further career goals as this job position was my long term goal for a long time and any meaning jobs gave me beyond paying the rent is gone. I have enough savings that I don't need the job to pay the rent for a while so I am trying to work on discipline alone and no motivation which I find very hard. I can't think of any professional goals that feel at all desirable to motivate myself towards.

I maintain hobbies as I feel it is good to have hobbies but I rarely get much satisfaction from the activity after the honeymoon period of the first few months. I try to maintain them because I fear that if I don’t my life would have less happiness potential down the line, doing nothing seems to suck more than doing something. Activities like bike rides, reading and video games often feel like they have a large chore component to them which they did not used to. I schedule days with a mix of work, hobbies and chores as if they are all things that I have to get done and with any time I might have left I do partly mindless activities like browsing reddit, lie back and do absolutely nothing at all or just cry or vent to myself about something in my mind. I also try and do my hobbies with meetups occasionally but I don’t enjoy dealing with large groups of strangers so I have not found those fun at all. How do people make a hobby satisfying for years?

In college I sometimes obsessed with making friendships and dates happen but the dating never worked at all and the attempted friendships always felt empty and one sided. I put in less effort socially over the past 5 years though I still do occasionally try fruitlessly to date or make friends. I often feel like people don’t like me except for shallower transactional relationships such as coworker-coworker but I don’t know exactly why. I know that I miss social cues frequently and that I have been described as weird. 

The one friend I have is in a very different stage of their life. I care about them and enjoy spending time with them but we have less and less in common and we just check in and catch up from time to time. We are both putting some effort into it rn so I hope that I am wrong. I get the impression that my family doesn't like me but tries due to the social obligation to care for family. I commonly get that paranoia about people so idk if it's based on reality or just in my mind.

I need help but, I don't know much about using any service. I looked online but I was a bit lost between psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists and counselors, saw a bunch of different platforms and I also don't know what help to ask for. How should I start? What kind of professional might be helpful in my situation? What would I ask them for? I am in the US."

**Just a heads up: some of what I’m saying here may be in some way(s) triggering. It’s not my intention to hurt anyone with my words. My primary goal here is to just be heard.**

*I need someone to hear me.*

In my endeavors to become a stronger man, I feel as though I’ve subjected my brain to a plethora of ideas that may be considered neurotic. For a while now, I’ve held the perception that my brand of motivation for being stronger is something that’s unorthodox. Every time I explain my motivations, I feel as though I’m interpreted as someone who is *absolutely insane*. Before recently, I only knew one way to describe how I felt about bettering myself, and it was that I spent/spend most of the process feeling angry about something. Like there's a fire burning in my brain that won’t put itself out. Why is this? I’ll tell you.

Because my motivation, at its core, is a feeling of frustration. Feeling pissed off. Fed up. Fucking sick of it. I worry that in some ways, it can be a dangerous line of thinking. If I were to describe it in the edgiest way possible, it almost feels like my efforts to be stronger have been a means to exact some sort of vengeance on a life that made me feel weak. Unfortunately, it’s felt good in some horrible, terrifying ways.

For some background information, I’m 26 years old. Male. In the past year, I’ve lost about 130 lbs. I still have about 70~ lbs to lose, but for the most part I’m at a place where I have accepted myself, and am convinced that I can do hard things. I still have issues though, and I’ll get into that further into this post. 

I’ve posted a lot about my process on another subreddit, but I’ve never openly spoken about exactly what I think it’s done to my brain. However, before I delve into what weight loss has done to my mind, it’s important that I delve into what being fat has done in the first place. It’s turned me into someone who grew up feeling afraid and weak. That’s something that growing up obese from the dawn of your cognitive perception can do to you, especially when you’ve been surrounded by the wrong sort of company. The sort of company that has no reservation against attacking the weak. I can’t tell you how many times in my childhood I’ve been a victim to being targeted because of my weight. I’ve always been an inherently sensitive kid - it was simply my nature. Stack on top of that nature multiple events of harsh words and/or chaos sourcing from people who were supposed to love you, bullying and the fear that bundles feeling that you’d be stabbed and/or killed for trying to defy it, and you have a recipe for a person who lives their life feeling like a target. It only takes feeling like a target for so long before you become toxic to yourself. Which leads me into what I was before I started trying to better myself.

**A self-defeatist.**

For a good chunk of my life, I believed myself to be someone who was fundamentally incapable of doing difficult things. I felt that I was a hideous, unlovable child/teen/adult. I believed myself to be absolutely worthless in any position I could find myself in, whether that was in my friendships, my relationships, my jobs, my career endeavors. In any group I could find myself in for any reason whatsoever, I considered myself to be someone who didn’t belong. Something akin to imposter syndrome; it spanned seemingly my entire existence for many years. It was a recipe for failure that often ended in failure. I was always one of the first people in a social group to make fun of himself, joke about hating himself, and then to often chase that down with some sick sort of joke about killing himself.

The worst part is that they were never entirely jokes.

Here’s the thing about being a fat, sensitive kid. I really do think that the years I spent being an obese child have taken their toll. It fucked me up, via aspects both external and internal. For some reason, typing that makes me want to apologize. It makes me want to apologize for possibly seeming like someone who is trying to garner sympathy. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not; I can't always make heads or tails of what my intentions are. Although it was never entirely single-handedly responsible for every shortcoming I’ve had during the lion’s share of the past couple of decades, being the fat kid was something that I interpret to having been the catalyst for the self-destructive behaviors I’d eventually adopt. I remember things would go on like that until a few months before my 24th birthday. That’s when all hell broke loose for me. Many of us, we have a rock bottom moment in which we essentially open our third eye, recognize the proverbial shit hitting the proverbial fan, and decide to get up and do something about it. The chain of events that I’m alluding to would serve as a transition into my next (and current-ish) state of mind.

**A self-preservationist.**

It’s a strange concept for me to wrap my brain around. It’s almost as if I reached a specific boiling point in my life, in which all at once I just decided I was fed up. I had issues with school that left me feeling worthless and pathetic, death in the family that I was handling very poorly, and stacked on top of that I had serious family drama and serious drama with a friend of mine at the time. Everything seemed to be converging in the worst way possible. I can’t think of too many ways that my brain could have snapped worse than it did during that specific summer (2018). I told my family things that I’d only told myself at my darkest moments, things that I often pretended didn’t exist; I often felt that I was just being dramatic, and maybe I was - I have no clue. All of the sudden, people other than me knew just how much disdain I felt for myself. It was humiliating for me, but it was also eye-opening. I remember sitting there next to my sister - we were both crying. I don’t think I was quite there mentally though. If there’s ever been a moment in my life in which I’ve dissociated, it was then.

For a brief moment, I retracted into my mind and told myself that things needed to change. That I couldn’t just sit there and wait for my inevitable demise. I’ve sustained too much mental damage by my own hand at that point (and believe me that the bulk of it was very much self-imposed), and it was time that I started doing something to fix it.

I needed to protect myself.

So for the next year, I (with the help of a mentor who I treasure dearly) figured out what it meant to accept myself for who I was. There was no physical health progress during that year, but the mental progress was immeasurable. Suddenly I learned what it meant to value myself, to not hate myself for merely existing. Life gets a whole lot easier when you begin to accept the aspects of yourself that may be considered off, maybe even unorthodox. When you stop feeling so damn ashamed for being fallible.

It was after that year that I began focusing on my physical health; I even remember the exact day I started (July 31st, 2019). I didn’t know it right when I started, but it was through losing so much weight that I learned (or at least rationalized) how much being fat had affected my mental health. My realizations about my weight being the root of many of my mental issues were only apparent to me when I almost neurotically began chipping away at it week after week, month after month. In some ways, it almost even seemed like a desperate, hellbent endeavor. Plateaus used to upset me way more at the beginning of my process than they do now. If I was stuck on a plateau for too long, I remember succumbing to my own sorts of hysterical mental breakdowns. I won’t go into detail about what that entails, but just know that it was, in itself, humiliating enough that discussing it brings me some amount of shame. It wasn’t until around November (2019) that I began making peace with the concept of weight plateaus. I made peace with the patience that you need to slowly sculpt your body into what you want it to be. With that peace came a sort of code that I’m still abiding me, and it’s that come hell or high water, I will never give up on myself.

When I said that I’ve become a self-preservationist, I meant this: **in the face of anything that threatens my world, I will fight tooth and nail for myself.** This can apply to anything that’s internal or external. I’ve become a very proud individual, to levels at which I’d at times (in my moments of clarity) consider to be toxic as hell. I’ve blown up on people who I shouldn’t have. I've become calloused to the people I’m supposed to love and cherish. Vehemently argued against perspectives solely on the basis that they challenged my worldview. I used to stand on a soapbox and preach against the sort of person I’ve turned into, so imagine how sobering it’s been for me in the past couple weeks to realize that in some ways I’ve become the exact same thing I used to despise.

If the dial before I started working on myself was pointing all the way toward self-hatred, I feel like I somehow rotated it toward the exact, polar-opposite direction. There’s supposed to be a balancing act between being strong for yourself and still holding on to your humanity for others, and I feel as though in some ways, I’ve lost myself in my efforts to find myself.

If there’s any message that I’m trying to present here, it’s this:

I’m sure that for many of us, self-betterment is a long journey. It’s very much a quest for redefining ourselves, and/or learning more about ourselves. Just make sure that you don’t lose sight of the things that you were supposed to be standing for in the process. The more I focused on myself, the less I focused on the fact that I share this life with so many other people, people who should matter more to me than the way I’ve treated them suggests.

**I’ve certainly been a monster of my own creation, and I need to be better.**"

820,Positive Affirmations,"So I started seeing a new therapist who basically claims to rid me of my anxiety and panic disorders in a number of weeks. I’m desperate at this point so I had my first appointment with her. Basically her techniques were all about positive affirmations. That said, I’ve never found that works for me. I mean...saying “I am safe” and believing it while I’m quarantined with potentially covid(can’t get tested, panic attacks when I try to go) seems impossible. Nobody knows if I’m safe...I’m crazy sick and could potentially have a world pandemic disease. I’m about to have my second appointment with this therapist this week. I’m freaking out to show up with zero progress.

Does anyone find positive affirmations to work for them? Was anyone doubtful before they worked? Is there any specific tricks to this besides just saying them every second of every day? I know the mind does powerful things but I just can’t get myself to truly believe any of this.

Thanks!!"
821,Depression has won. I'm done just waiting on the date,My plan is set. My things are ready to go. The stuff im leaving the one person is packaged up. All I have left is write my goodbye letter. There are 6 significant dates in my life coming up from now until the end of the year. One of those days will be the day I leave this life.
822,OCD and 666,"For the past couple of months I feel like I have been seeing 666 everywhere. I was raised in a fundamental Baptist Church (I no longer attend church). Growing up, this number was always associated with the Devil, hell, and damnation. I will also point out that I am gay. I fear that God is trying to send me signs that I am living “wrong”. 

For instance, the other day I was watching a YouTube video about religious trauma. This video had 66 views and 6 likes...666. A coupe months back I had watched a video debunking conversion therapy and the video had 667 comments. Well today I went to watch it again and the video now has 666 comments. I was driving yesterday and noticed a road sign with 666 on it. I found this guy on Instagram attractive. I was going to follow him but he had 666 followers. Am I delusional or is god sending me signs? Is this OCD? I feel like these are too specific to be coincidences. 

I fear that this is God sending me signs that I am living wrong in his eyes. Maybe this is my OCD? This is causing me a lot of distress. Any advice in appreciated."
823,I don't want to be alive anymore,"Pretty much as it says in the title. I've spent years on this issue in my mind. Tonight, I may have actually come to terms with the fact that I am destined not to continue my life. I am OK with dying, with not being here anymore. I'm OK with nothingness. I'm OK with no afterlife, no reincarnation, no heaven, no hell, I'm OK with just dying and having nothing more. It may be the ultimate definition of peace for me. So now what.
I'm crying, I can barely see. I have no Paracetamol here to do what I will with. I don't want to do anything messy. I would prefer to take 50 valium and die in my sleep. So I guess all I have to do is wait. Not even sure why I've posted this. I guess this might actually be a final cry for help."
824,Looking for something to do to improve my mental health status,"honestly i can’t complain about it because it is not that serious but i’ve been struggling with several mental disorders and i got really tired so i’m taking a break just for a semester from college.
i want to find something meaningful to spend my time with. i will go to the gym and try finding a part time job. but most importantly i want to learn more about myself. is there any resources available i can use? for example, a book of questions about self to answer everyday.... something like that?? i’m tbh just so lost."
825,"I've been dissociating for months, how can I stop it or at least distract myself?","For a few months since quarantine has started I've been dissociating more than I ever have. I can't hear myself think anymore and I feel like I'm dreaming... I feel like I'm forgetting who I am and I cant even remember what it feels like to feel normal.

I'm so sick of this, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've been going to therapy but I'm scared to bring this up, even though I know I should. In the meantime, any advice or tips on how to distract myself or help this would be so amazing."
826,I can't stop zoning out,"Every time I read from a textbook I zone out at every sentence, I keep thinking about other things and I stay up until 4 am to do work. My mind is always drifting somewhere else and I live in my head. I can't stay still and I always have to be walking or moving. I almost got held back in preschool and 7th grade because of this but now I'm in college and it's worse, no one has ever tried to tell me if something is wrong with me. I don't know how to deal with it because everyone thinks I zone out on purpose for being disinterested or something."

829,I don't trust my family because of how they're handling themselves during the pandemic,"Some background: I live in a place that just removed its statewide ordinance and my younger sister goes to a local university where she lives in a dorm and as a roommate who I know isn't properly social distancing and comes from a family of people I've never seen wear a mask (I live in small town and have seen this myself).

My brother is an essential worker and goes to the gym.

My parents both work as essential workers and one of them works a job with people who are MAGA folks that have already ""convinced"" them ""we're all going to get this virus."" Both of my parents continue to espouse the views that ""COVID only affects the elderly and they were going to die anyway.""

I've been quarantining with my family and absolutely hate their approach. However, being a millennial with limited job prospects I can't afford to leave at the moment and few countries are accepting US citizens anyway. The ones that do have a terrible COVID record themselves. 

It's been hard to watch my family go to church on Sundays, knowing that their pastor and other Trump supporters are bent on doing things as quickly as possible and with little focus on harm reduction despite rising cases in the local community.

My sister has been coughing all day and I suggested that she gets a COVID test once she goes back to school on Monday just to rule COVID out. She simply shook her head. The way things are going, my stepfather has had a terrible record of going to the doctor, even if he were to have a tough time I doubt he'd even GET tested until his job or church forces him to. His brother died of COVID already, and if you're wondering whether or not this will change hearts, it won't.

I'm going to try to work as hard as possible to save as much as I can and instead have opted to take a COVID test myself as often as my insurance will let me. However, once I leave I may never return. After having to constantly beg them to let me wipe their phones, beg them to remember their masks, or remind them to wash their hands, I'm getting so tired. We might survive this pandemic and may even make it unscathed, but I think my relationship with my entire family will change forever.

My extended family have ALL contracted COVID. One of them is a nurse who told my family a lot of conspiracy theories and lied about her and her husband's positive status. Others simply haven't told us. Another relative of mine SELLS MASKS, and as I understand it she caught COVID from not following COVID19 protocols, infected her staff, and her entire immediate family. Her father died and she was hospitalized.  

Another relative got sick because she works at a fast-food restaurant. She was young and infected the whole family, who are still having effects, but who continue to socialize even though they should be resting. I can't do telecounseling because I'm not in a position to be alone and therapists require things to be confidential, though I hope to find therapists that might be open to chat therapy.

I understand that there's a stigma, but being surrounded by people who think it could never happen to them, who consistently hang out with folks who aren't social distancing, and who are arguing about ""acceptable deaths"" is harming my mental health. Thanks for providing this space to vent."

831,Why do I put mental double standards on myself?,"I always seem to assume the best of others and the worst of myself, even if it's not true. For example, I was thinking that if someone cut in front of me. I would think that they must have had a good reason or they may be going through something and I don't need to make their life worse. If I cut in front of someone, however, I think that what I did was selfish and horrible, even if I did so to help someone else or for some other altruistic reason. Even things I KNOW aren't true get applied to me. Like, I was watching this TV-series and I thought that this one character was cute. My mind immediately was shaming me for thinking that and calling me perverted even though I thought it in a purely non-romantic or sexual way. If someone else remarked that the character was cute, I wouldn't have even thought for a second that they had any ulterior reasons for saying so. 

I feel like I give every benefit of the doubt to others but untruthfully assume the worst about myself. I think it's good to give others the benefit of the doubt, at least sometimes and question yourself to keep your moral compass aligned but I almost ALWAYS think everyone else must be some kind of saint with their intentions and me some horrid monster even if that isn't at all, reality.

This also makes me sometimes put up with things I shouldn't. Like people will talk to me or otherwise treat me in a way that in completely undeserved but I will just bite my lip and take it because, for one, hate conflict but also I think that they have problems and I shouldn't be selfish and bring up my problems when they are having their problems. I don't know, something akin to that. 

I would really appreciate some advice going forward. I feel like I have done a lot of introspection and understand my emotions well but am too clouded by my life situations and mental condition to make good decisions. I think that others can read this and provide a more objective, logical point of view then I could. I would really appreciate that, even though you are by no means obligated to do so!"
832,I almost cut myself,"I’ve never been suicidal but i’m ok with dying. I’ve never in my life had the urge to hurt myself, but I had an extreme urge to cut my wrist. I didn’t end up doing it though. I’m freaked out by it. Am I considered suicidal?"
833,How do I stop feeling guilty and anxious for doing the simplest things?,"ever since march I have been taking social distancing and mask wearing very seriously. I always wear a mask when I leave my house. The only occasion where I do not where one is when I see my boyfriend and we are completely alone. I have been feeling so much anxiety and guilt doing things for myself. For example, I went to go get my nails done at an outdoor salon and everyone was wearing masks but it took so much out of me. Again, today i got a manicure. It was only me, the tech and my mom but it gave me so much fear. How do I stop being scared of doing these little things? I haven't gone shopping for new clothes since march because of how scared I am. I am so sick of being so scared. Any advice?"
834,Sister in law having manic episodes but cleared of bipolar... please help,".


Hi all

To give a little back ground. My sister in law has two children. She we thought might have had Postpartum depression after the second because she turned to adderall and drinking. After having an abortion and seeing the light. She moved back home to leave that lifestyle. It’s been over a year where she has been substance free. 

As of late she has been having sever manic episodes. Can’t sit still, can’t stop talking, moving doing things. Feels on top of the world. This lasts for a week the. She crashes. Since then she’s been tested Rigorously.

They prescribed her Seroquel at a low dose. I was against it but I thought if they started her low she can get off of it if needed. She’s been on it for about a couple months and the doctor has been raising her dose. We ALL thought bi polar or hypomania. The tests came back No thyroid disorder, no bipolar etc. 

Now the doctor raised her again which is numbing her out and wants to prescribe her lithium which is why I came here to ask for help before she goes to that stage. I feel she shouldn’t be on any medication until they find out properly and she gets a second opinion. 

My question to you all is what do you think this could be? One thing we noticed is whenever something happens or she gets nervous or scared triggers this mania episodes and they last for about a week. She does smoke cigarettes and marijuana but that’s about it.

If this sounds like anything you guys can think of I’m just trying to figure it out for her. Thank you all!"
835,Should I check myself into a mental hospital? 18f,"
I'm currently delving deeper into depression than I ever have. I'm too lazy to eat anything, I barely shower, and i am always procrastinating with my school work(college). I just want to sleep all day everyday and often find it hard to even stand up right. It takes everything in me to just function normally. 

A year ago I developed an anxiety disorder, I was having panic attacks everday which resulted in me dropping out of hs and doing independent learning until I graduated. I also started dissociating as a result of my anxiety and so I'm now currently stuck in a constant state of depersonalization (which sucks ass btw)

I was briefly on lexapro but my parents made me stop taking it after 2 weeks since they were paranoid and overprotective. I don't know it it really helped but it did make me feel emotionless, which was a refreshing break from the overwhelming anxiety I was constantly feeling. I haven't had a panic attack for a few months but I'm never at peace.

I have in the past thought of ""ending it"" but I've never acted upon it. Although I did come very close to suffocating myself with a trashbag in the bathroom of my dentist office during I very inconveniently timed mental breakdown. 

I recently started researching into mental hospitals and think that I could benefit from staying there for a few weeks. I think it would FORCE me to get my act together instead of just wallowing in my nasty self pity and depression. But before I make any decisions or bring it up to my parents I want to be 100% sure. That's why im asking for you guy's advice. Do yall think it would be worth it?

P.S: yes I do have a current therapist but he's kinda shit at his job and has been dropping the ball alot lately."

837,"Is this normal mania for bipolar-1? Not in any danger or any danger to anyone else. Started to post on my personal facebook, but didn't cause that's a little too manic"," I miss the ""how are you feeling"" facebook, Im gonna tell you even though you didn't ask,  i haven't slept in two maybe three maybe more days because I'm experiencing the worse manic episode I've ever had, but I'm not trying to kill anyone??? Including myself??That's not typical of me to say the least, literally just disassociating the worst I ever had thinking about ways to sneakily abolish prisons by putting it up as a front for treating addiction? (This is my normal political opinions, just not as elaborate lol)  Literally texted two friends talking about this unannounced, as if the plan was being acted out successful until one of them texted me asking what I was talking about, and then I remembered it's not the revolution right now it's a  Saturday???  Oh! Another fun thing, after my sister left I seen her or her boyfriend alternating at the door every five minutes or so, before disappearing?  but I knew it was a hallucination. Other things too but I've but fortunately I can tell when something is a hallucination. 
Note: I do not wish harm on anyone or myself, I'm simply experiencing a manic episode completely self aware of it, 

Adding some more information than what I put on my FB post draft 

So I wasn't completely scared the way I was before this happened in a bit until I didn't have anyone to talk to for a bit and was just left with my thoughts, it got worse. What's going on with me."
838,What is happiness,"Now I know this sounds stupid but I’ve been bi polar with mild schizophrenia for basically all my life and when I have manic episodes I get big rushes of energy like a kid with a sugar high.

Is it just not being sad or is it an actual feeling?"
839,Starting to worry my incredibly low self esteem will never get better.,"I am spiraling badly tonight. I saw a comment thread about people’s mental health when they were children vs now and I (24) realized that while some things didn’t spur until my early 20’s- my inability to spend free time without guilt; my tendency to overwhelm myself with taking on too much - I have ALWAYS, always had negative self talk, low self esteem, and problems comparing myself to others. I talked about being stupid and not good at anything and wanting to kill myself as young as 10 years old in my journals. I love my mom, but I think a combo of mental health issues in my family history + hearing her own negative self talk all the time really did a number on me very early on.

I’ve been in and out of therapy 4-5 times, often spending a few months with someone before realizing I don’t feel comfortable or my therapists arent focusing on the things I wanted to before giving up. My last therapist told me I seemed like “I was doing much better and probably didn’t need to see her for the time being!” when I wasn’t okay at all. I spend several months out of therapy, spiral and feel horrible, and then try again. I haven’t gone since March and feel like I might need it, badly. But I’ve tried the mantras and work pages and lists and reminders and I haven’t seen improvement. 

I had a wave of my most severe depression from 18-20 years old: suicidal ideations, hating the world, everything feeling pointless. I feel grateful that I was able to move on from this and see purpose and joy in some of the small things in life, and I love the small circle of people I have. I type this as my wonderful boyfriend is laying asleep next to me. But my self esteem is so low, I don’t ever feel good enough for him, and I constantly tell myself he must regret ever dating me. As of the past few years, I constantly feel like people in my life don’t truly like me. No matter how kind my boyfriend/friends are to me, I have a deep rooted certainty that they are bothered by me at least 50% of the time. I’ve lost so many friends over the years through drifting and being a less-than-ideal friend that I’ve convinced myself I’m just not that likeable. I’ve never been able to convince myself I’m beautiful (even if I have a good week here and there where I feel attractive) and I constantly compare myself to others who just look better and seem more successful are are further ahead in life. I can’t stand it. I wish it would all go away. I should not sit and think about how my boyfriend probably feels like he settles for me and won’t ever want to get engaged; or that my best friend probably finds my social media post stupid or doesn’t like how emotional or fandom-obsessed I am and finds me embarrassing. But I do. I assume these unconfirmed things alllll the time. Do I try therapy again? What else can I do?

TL;DR, I’m worried my negative perception of myself, and my belief that most people are bothered by me or dislike me, are so deeply rooted that I can never get rid of them."

842,I f*ing hate depression and anxiety.,"Came here to say that I fucking hate this mental state. It has impaired me to operate as a normal human being and has taken the joy out of my life.

I moved to another country 7 years ago. Since then, I have seen my parents around twice a year.

Because of the pandemic, I hadn’t seen my parents in almost a year. So I decided to travel and fly to see them. Overcoming the anxiety of Covid and being able to fly was a huge win for me. But somehow, now that I’m here, I can't seem to enjoy myself. I’m super anxious, I’m cranky, I don’t really smile and it feels like I cant stand being around my parents - I silently judge them for everything they say and do, and it feels like I forgot how to spend time together and just relax. I’m constantly thinking about Covid, masks, exposure.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with my depression or anxiety or the fact that I have been living away for so long, but it feels like I lost my joy, and my easy-goingness. I used to be fun, and joked around. Now I’m always serious, talking about serious issues, and I lost that part of me that my parents say was my best part - it was great to have me around.

Did I change so much and just didn’t realize? Is this just life? Or is depression and anxiety a factor in “personality” changes over time?

After writing this, I just feel sad and feel like crying because I just “lost it” and don’t know who I am anymore."
843,I feel like a disappointment and an inconvenience.,"Seriously, I mean what am I here for? I just disappoint and annoy people, and those who say they are proud of me will probably soon be disappointed anyway.

I’m not that likable, and probably just bother every single person I meet anyway. Sometimes I feel invisible. Maybe it’s better that way anyway."
844,How can I tell when I need to find a new therapist?,"Hi, first post here so I’m not sure if this is the best place to ask this.

I’ve been seeing the same therapist for about 3 years now. I started talking to him about issues I’ve had at college, friend group dynamics and some mild family matters mostly. Im graduated now and ever since March, I’ve had to move back home (which is in another state). I still have tele-therapy sessions with him but the distance and disconnect has really changed it all. Additionally while he is nice, I tend to do 80-90% of the talking during our sessions and it feels like he isn’t giving me any new guidance.

Should I stick with him as my therapist or try to find a new one? Thanks"
845,"What does it mean, when I'm constantly belittling my problems?","Hi everyone!
I've recently started seeing a mental health professional. Whilst telling my story, I always talked as if whatever had happened to me could have been so much worse and how great my life actually is. I'm just ungrateful and lazy.
This is how I'd speak all the time. My therapist mentioned that to me and now I'm wondering.
What does this mean? Am I not actually in need of help? Or is this common?"
846,"If I get an ordinary check up and speak to my doctor about my anxiety, could I possibly be prescribed something?","I've been due for a routine check up for a while now and I don't want to waste the visit when I have it. 

What Happened Last Time: 
The last time I had a check up it was because I needed a few shots- but for some reason having stuff poked in my arm causes me so much fear my blood pressure drops way too low and I almost faint. Because of this I brought my little sister with me to keep me company because her personality soothes my mind... but unfortunately I didn't know that during this check up they'd ask me about my mental health. With my little sister being there I couldn't say anything. If I say something this time about my anxiety (which has been much worse lately) will the doctor be able to do anything for me?"
847,Burnout/other mental health stuff,"So I'm a music major at a university (senior year), and I've been realizing that i struggle with a cycle of burnout. basically, every semester, i reach a point, maybe halfway in or less, where i just lose all desire to do anything school related beyond the requirements that are visible to teachers (homework, going to class, etc). i often will skip some classes if i think i can get away with it and just loaf around, sleeping or doing nothing. Most importantly, i wont do any practicing on my instrument, even though that's kinda the whole reason I'm here. this will last for at least several weeks, and I'll never really recover the level of productivity that i started the semester with.

I've done this consistently for at least the last 3 semesters (including this one), and i really need to figure out what the hell is going on before it ruins my chance of graduating.

as a little more context, here are a few other things that seem to be related to the issue, that i don't know how to organize

* I've always wondered if there was something wrong with my brain
* I was very lonely and depressed(?) in middle/early highschool.
* i had panic attacks/fight-or-flight meltdowns in late highschool/early college
* I've been nearly a straight A student since i got into college (i think academics just come easier to me/I'm very curious/I'm good at taking tests and giving teachers what they want)
* I was homeschooled, and really slacked off in highschool for some reason (same burnout?)
* I seem to have a similar pattern with other things, where i have a period of obsession, followed by a period where i have no interest in doing it anymore. moderation/task switching is a bit hard for me and even with eating, i will often eat all of my sandwich, then all of my apple, then all of my drink.
* I feel like my memory is messed up, like names just fly out of my head, faces aren't that much better, and it feels like my brain can only hold a very small amount of stuff in it at a time. I like to make cheat/sheets for things because of that. 
* My mom and i are a ton alike, and i know stuff like adhd can be passed down and left undiagnosed in parents a lot.

Sorry for the flood of info, but there's just so much stuff going on in my brain that seems a little off somehow, but i can't seem to pin it down. Does this seem fairly normal, or could i have some sort of condition that should be treated (or that i should at least learn how to live with)?"
848,Absolute stress and pain,"online classes started 2 months ago, and i got into a new hobby 3 months ago, i taught myself how to write stories and i quickly became a writer who loved making stories, i made multiple chapters a week, although they were all really badly written, i still loved them, they were entertaining to me but i never shared them with the world.

But then started online classes, at first i loved it, i was a loner at school and i loved that in online classes everyone was basically a loner like me.

I never failed a single subject in at all in my life, i passed all of them, although i never got honors, i still did pass all of them.

But online classes was different, i couldn't really digest the information given to me as my teachers explained a certain subject, one of my teachers didn't explain a topic because she said that we learned it last year and that we should know it by now, which i didn't.

Online classes was something i wanted, i loved it more than normal classes, I'm unathletic, i have an ugly body, but i was still an average student in terms of grades.

Sure i didn't make it onto the honors list, but i still didn't fail.

But for some reason, online classes was far, far worst than what i thought it would be, i thought i could just open up some assignments, answer them, and just play games when i was done.

But it didn't end that way.

 i ended up not answering an astonishing 40+ of my assignments, in one of my subjects my grade is an absolute 0, and I'm not exaggerating.

Something about online class just made me hate it more than normal classes, sure i would have been an absolute loner, sure class days would be longer, and sure I'll feel left out not joining a single sport or activity, but it was just more practical than online learning.

I got really stresses out because of online classes, my mother saw my grades and kindly asked me what was wrong, i told her it was fine and that i needed work done, my mother told me not to fail cause she would be disappointed.

I never reached my mothers expectation in terms of grades, but i never went below her ""passing grade"" which was a line of 8.

But now, online classes just made me so stress that i can't even think properly, i tried studying, but i just lost all focus,, i tried sleeping, and when i woke, i just felt worst, the stress was killing me.

Remember when i said i was a writer? well, since i only started writing 3 months ago, i never actually made an actual good story, but i had a lot of enjoyment writing stories, but that enjoyment just faded away.

The stress i felt affected my writing style as well as my passion, not only that, it also affected my sense of humour.

I would always watch memes on YouTube and reddit, but for some reason, i can't really find enjoyment in then anymore, i was just so stressed out.

I punched myself in my head multiple times, it hurt, and i felt dizzy, i ended up lying on bed, and when i woke, i felt weird, my mind felt like it couldn't think properly anymore, and it was uncomfortable to think about.

When ever i would write stories, they would be simple and easy to understand, but for some reason, my stories now just got worst, the writing style became boring, and i couldn't change it for some reason, i uploaded an old story i made onto wattpad, and several people upvoted it, but when i uploaded a story i made when online classes had already started, no one upvoted it, people read it, but just stopped reading after that.

My writing style became worst out of stress, and my passion just disappeared.

I had so much fun writing, i loved my stories so much, but now, i tried comparing a story i made a few weeks ago to a story i made 3 months ago, and i noticed a huge difference.

My old story would always have multiple string of words which sounded good when placed together, it was like a melody of a song, but my stories now are bland and boring, there is no rhythm in my writing, and there is no enjoyment in reading.

I ended up having a zoom meeting with one of my teachers and she told me that i should never give up, dont give up, fight, fight for your hopes and dreams, for your goal and heart.

But what would i fight for?

I got so stressed out that i made a small notebook writing all my thoughts on it, handwriting was more terrible than my usual handwriting, and there would be some pages with scribbles on them which overlapped words that i had previously wrote before that i can't remember.

I gave myself 3 days to die before suicide, but when the third day came, i rolled a dice, i said that if the dice were to roll on a one, i would spare myself and live.

I rolled on one.

i thought that fate was doing this to me, but that just made me hate life more.

I would rather die an empty death than live a life which worth lies in depression and hatred.

a few days later i rolled a dice again, if it fell on a certain number( can't remember what number i chose) then i would never kill myself.

it fell in another number.

I got a large kitchen knife and held it right next to my neck, i thought that if i stab the side of my neck then i would be able to cut some kind of nerve and just die isntantly.

But i didn't.

Instead i stabbed the notebook with the knife twice, and when i checked for the hole, it was small and thin, i said ""a knife like this isn't going to kill me"" and i just gave it up.

It has been a few weeks since then, and my stress just keeps getting worse.

tomorrow is my exams , and I'm not even studying.

If u were to fail, my mother would get very mad at me, she would hit me with a broom or a belt, i talked with my father about my grades and he doesn't seem to care about it, but im afraid he would.

because of my stress and depression, my passion changed, my sense of humour changed, my writing changed, the way i thought of the world changed, so many things changed.

i used to be a huge anime fan, i watched all of re:zero in just one day, but after online classes started, my love of anime just died.

my love of writing died.

my love of the world died.

my will to live is now just floating embers which came from a large fire of hope and dreams.

I'm just having a hard time."

850,Advice on keeping a job with severe anxiety and depression,"I'm really struggling right now. I'm 18 and I can't hold a job for the life of me because of my mental health issues. Every boss I've had has basically said that I'm not cut out for working, and I have no idea what to do. I worked at an ice cream place and got fired, I worked at Dunkin Donuts and got fired for having a panic attack, I just got a job recently since I was doing a lot better mentally (and I still am) and basically got fired today if I can't come up with a good enough reason that my boss should keep me on. I go to work and just think about how happy I am that I had that opportunity and how much better I was doing compared to the beginning of this year and I keep thinking about dying even though I don't want to. I have a plan for my life, I want to move to Japan and go to college for art. I'm just really depressed today because I basically got fired and I keep thinking about dying... How do any of you keep jobs? Is there a specific industry I can try? Should I just give up?"
851,I get gory images of my loved ones dying,"I am 16 (F)
I often get sudden images in my head about my family dying horribly or getting very badly hurt.
I never sat down and thought about this properly but i guess this is bothering me very much. I dont show it to them but I'm very stressed about this. I keep imagining that one of them will get horribly hurt at any moment.
Suppose my mom is working in the kitchen, i suddenly get images in my head about her getting badlyy hurt,lots of gore. 
To make things worse i have a tendency to pass out or vomit on seeing someone HURT or bleeding, which makes me unreliable to be with.
Help this is manifesting my head. I want to find a way out before it gets worse. 
p.s. istg im not exaggerating."
852,How do you manage large workloads?,"How do you manage large workloads and exam stress, especially with school/uni?

I usually get into a very bad mental state when there’s a lot of work that I procrastinate on doing and end up taking life a bit too seriously. It would be interesting to see how you guys cope because I certainly don’t cope very well"
853,I think I’m ok now,"I just wanted to share this somewhere. I hit a milestone today in dealing with my childhood. I’m a man in my early 30s with an amazing wife and 2 amazing kids. Nobody but my wife knows just how damaged I am, and even then she didn’t know all of it until today, 11 years into our relationship. 



My childhood was severely traumatic, full of violence, death, loss and everything else you read about. I still have ptsd but I realized today that I fully disassociated  with my child self. It never occurred to me before the conversation with my wife but I don’t remember my childhood as mine. All my memories outside the mild flashbacks are fully in terms of remembering someone else. It has the same connection as if I remembered something from my sons early childhood. That person is someone else, and even though my heart breaks for him, he isn’t me anymore. I’m really ok now.

Accepting the ptsd and flashbacks for what they were helped and i can thank my wife for that. They still happen but it doesn’t take me out of the present. They play far off in the background now and they are getting better. I still can’t listen to certain music, I still can’t play uno, I still can’t tolerate the smell of hospital food, and I’m way too nostalgic about things that trigger me. I grew with my wife and because of her. I can honestly say I don’t hold a grudge against anyone anymore. I’m not mad at my parents even though my feelings toward them are strange at best. They have grown and changed and it wasn’t really their fault anyway, at least not fully. 

I’m new to this opening up thing, so thanks for listening. And yes, I’m totally alright these days. A well adjusted, very successful adult with a much greater appreciation for meeting new people, and experiencing new things."
854,I cannot stand living in the US,"Before I get into it I just wanna say that I don’t want to have any political arguments regardless of where you stand and I don’t mean to offend anyone.

I feel such a heavy weight on my chest. I can’t go any length of time without thinking of politics and it’s wearing me down. There is so much hate so much anger and so little empathy. I feel so angry and upset all the time because there is ALWAYS something new. I don’t recognize America anymore, maybe America was always this way and we’re finally showing our true colors but I think regardless of party affiliation it’s undeniable that we’re divided and tensions havent been so high in a while. I have never felt so much tension and I feel like I’m going crazy. I feel like people don’t even care or even worse don’t even notice. I want so badly to just escape it all but I don’t even know how. Why do people care so little about other people ? 
I feel like such a “snowflake” but I honestly don’t know how to keep doing this I can’t keep dealing with all the crazy. 
I literally cannot escape politics no matter where I go whether it’s signs on the road or masks of customers at my job or family members Instagram posts and I’m losing my mind and my faith in humanity."
855,Starting to feel alone again,"I’m not sure why, but I’m starting to feel down and out of it again.

856,I want to die but can’t kill myself,"I don’t feel like going into detail but I’ve been feeling this way for years, ruining great friendships and opportunities due to my literal loss of a will to exist like I’m actually living.
If anyone relates/ wants to talk feel free to dm"
857,I'm not living because I want to anymore...,"Life was bad, isolated, it's shocking to me how normal this quarantine feels. Then I pushed myself to give the world more of a chance, sought new experiences, and made new friends. I found a life partner and a best friend, then after seven years she had a sudden heart attack and died, and he decided screwing middle school kids was an acceptable response to a broken engagement within a six month period. 

I am only alive right now because she made me promise I wouldn't kill myself when she inevitably died, was very sick, so we both knew it would come for her before me. But I don't want to be here, nobody on Earth cares that I exist, and I don't particularly care about anyone on Earth. I don't know how I'm supposed to form ne relationships in this damaged state. The things I used to want, I already have them. Home, collections, etc. just make up parts of the giant funeral shrine I live in.

I want to have passion for life again, to have new meaningful connections to others, but I don't know how to start again. I don't even really know how I made it happen the first time, it all just kind of happened to me. I'm far too old now to be getting invited to parties, and I have no interest in bars because I don't ever want to be anything like my alcoholic father.

But I know I have to find some new connection to the human race or I'm going to end up breaking my promise, and then if there is an afterlife she'll probably ignore me for a thousand years or some shit like that, that fear is all that keeps me going in this life."
858,help?,"so, all my life I’ve struggled with mental health issues. I’ve always been the outcast, the loner, whatever. I thought that getting a job in my desired field or working out regularly would fix that.

It hasn’t. It’s gotten worse.

I have a good group of friends that I love, but spending time with them almost unilaterally makes me feel worse. 

I work out with them frequently, I’m trying to become more interesting. It’s not working.

I’ve been having suicidal ideations almost nightly for the past six months. I want to make art. I try to make art, get discouraged and feel worse than before. 

Sometimes I’ll meet someone and feel better for a bit. But I realize that banking my well-being on another human being isn’t manageable, nor will it ever work out, because when they lose interest I get crushed. 

I’ve been thinking about the future in bleaker and bleaker terms, and honestly I don’t think that it’s getting much better. I can’t view the future in any way other than out of reach or inaccessible. 

I used to really hate people. Myself. The world. Women. Whatever I could do to shift the blame. I’ve grown past that, and realized the issue is with me. 

I don’t think talking to a therapist will help.

I’m not at the point where I will straight up take a knife to my wrist, but I just. Fantasize about dying. Fantasize about taking revenge on people, and shortly after I become angry when I realize it wouldn’t be revenge. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I can’t even view positive media without feeling poorly. I can’t look at good things without comparing myself to someone in that setting or someone doing something. 

I watched a movie a month ago, and it almost led to me killing myself. 

A movie.

I see beautiful people and my immediate reaction is just. Sad. Longing? I don’t know. All I think is “I will never be able to have someone like them. I will never have this experience. I will never have this feeling.”

Right now, at this point in time, I don’t know if I want help, to feel better, or to be dead in a ditch. 

Sometimes I’ll be ridiculously happy, almost manic. I’ll be cheerful, active, creative. I’ll be over the moon. 

And then I crash. I can either be hateful, cynical or just downright miserable. 

I cannot recall a time in the past year where I thought making plans for the future would be helpful.

Any assistance, input or stories, anecdotes, whatever would be loved. 

Thank you for reading."

860,At the end of the day. Dying would just be easyer.. That simple.,I have a fucked up history. I'm 20 years old. 1 of 6 kids. My entire childhood I was abused. Not with punches or kicks. But with a belt. Brutally. Every single time I did somthing that my parents didn't like. Broke a plate and cut my foot and bled on the floor when I was 5. Beat with a belt. Parents thought i might be lying. Beat with a belt. Didn't know what a Philips head on a screwdriver was. Belt. Fell over and broke a hinge off of a cabinet. Belt. Took a bath at 4 and touched my genitals by accident. Belt. Did anything whatsoever to display the emotions I was feeling. Belt. Wasn't in bed before 6 30. Belt. Wasn't awake before 7 belt. I didn't have any friends because I was trapped inside  we weren't allowed out. To do anything. I never had friends  didn't go to school. Learned to talk to strangers at 16 when I got a job. I moved out at 18. Now I am suffering the incredible affects of my trauma. It is burned so deep into my soul it will never go away. I have an extreme nightmare disorder. Scars all over my arms from when I was a teen. Anxiety that makes me feel like I have a heart attack. Depression that makes me want it all to just stop. Depersonalization and derealisation. No medical insurance to continue therapy. No will to keep going. I'm so tired. I have lived more terrible things than most people can imagine with their frail fragile weak minds. I hold the entire world in contempt for what I endure. Im so hateful and sick of everything. Of everybody's games. Drama emotion. Every thing in my life is dark and cold. My emotions are so repressed I don't feel all that much except for the hatred and pain. I'm so fucking tired. My entire life I have only lived the worst parts that humanity has to offer. I'm so sick and fucking tired of everything. I don't cut myself anymore because I don't care  all that was was the an ability to process the feelings I have. No I can. And all that I want is to leave this place. Leave this disgusting world and it's disgusting people. I just want to be alone forever. FUCK
861,What am I feeling?,"Sorry in advance I am typing this out on my phone.

As quarantine goes on I’ve become more and more distant from my friends. As of recently I’ve been having random nights where the only thing I want to do is cry or be sad. I’m just trying to understand what I’m feeling. It’s like I’m looking for an excuse to be sad. Is it because that’s the only real emotion I can feel? Am I hoping somehow someone will ask me if I’m ok? Am I trying to look for pity from others? I don’t tell anyone that I feel this way but it feels as if I’m doing it for a reaction. Sometimes I hope for there to be a tragedy in my life so I have an excuse to be sad. All I think about when I’m laying in bed at night is seeing my friends who I haven’t been with in months.

If anyone understands why I feel this way could you explain it? Is the cure seeing my friends again? Do I have some sort of mental problem where I want to make myself sad so others pay attention to me?"

864,Conflicted,"I (F17) need some advice. Sorry for the long post. 

I was dxed with traits of ASPD and BPD few months back. I have a psychiatrist and I'm on meds. But I don't go to therapy at the moment. Every therapist I've been to has said I don't have my conditions at all or that I do, they just can't treat it so they tell me to find someone else. 

Now here's the conflicting part. Im aware i need help. One therapist I tried to see said she wouldn't see me unless I did residential. My last therapist said residential is bullshit and I don't need it (her husband worked in residential). 

Two years ago, I went inpatient for 9 days and outpatient for probably a month. DBT. Hated it. One year ago, did outpatient for probably a month. Also DBT. Hated it. Before I went outpatient the 2nd time, I tried to go inpatient but my insurance pretty much said ""you've gotten help before so there's no point"" so I had no choice but to do outpatient. They cut me off after a month so I had to leave. 

I kind of want to do residential but im a Little wary because DBT doesn't do anything for me, I wouldn't be able to see my SO with all the corona shit, and inpatient sucked so why would residential be any different?

I can't see a therapist who specialises in ASPD and BPD because im not 18 so they Just refuse to see me. I can't see a normal therapist because they don't know how to help me. 

Every time I've reached out for help I get shut down. 

I'll be 18 in July. If I try get help now, insurance won't help so I can't get help, and no one wants to help me anyways. If I wait till I'm 18, then I have to pay for my hospitalisation which I cannot afford that shit. I'm pretty sure my father is still paying off my inpatient from years back. My father is in good Financial standing, however even though I'm working 2 jobs at the moment I can't afford much so I can't do it on my own. 

I did some math from the quote sheet, just for me to exist in residential program for a month would be worth almost a new car, 40,000 dollars. No food, no therapy sessions, no meds, just for me to simply be there. 

To summarise, Do I wait til I'm 18 to try to get help again? Do I try now? Is there a point in trying at all?"
865,It’s too much,[removed]
866,Just venting again im sorry I just can’t handle this anymore it’s gone too far,[removed]
867,I don't know what to do...,"I don't even know where to begin...

There are so many frayed ends you could pull on and I would just unravel to expose the complete disaster that is me.

I won't go into my messed up childhood. I'll just fast forward to the here and now:

I'm the worst.

I'm unmotivated and selfish. 

I'm married to a man that out right has spoiled me rotten and what have I done to repay him? I've continued to disappoint him...

We had finally bought our house last year, just before COVID hit. It had been painstaking to find a house in a good school district and for a price we could afford. Despite my husband's job paying well, my job pays horrible. So, it took us forever to save for the minimum down payment. During our search, I felt so guilty everytime we looked for a decent home and left disappointed. I knew I was the reason we couldn't afford something better.

I felt/feel indebted to him for being the main provider in our marriage. (He doesn't see our marriage like this. Just me. He's so good to me...)

""It's ok"" I thought, "" I'll make it up to him one day when we have kids.""

Eventually, we found a place that was in a good school district and only needed minor work. My husband was in love with the place. I hated the kitchen. It was plain flat panel cabinets that had been painted a disgusting shiney brown. It was clear the place had previously been a rental and the owners put no love or thought into the home's appearance, but it was the first place my husband was excited about. I told him as long as we got rid of the disgusting cabinet doors in the kitchen, I'd be ok with the place. Big mistake.

Again, let it be said, money is tight. Once we bought the house, my father-in-law says he will redo the kitchen for me and begins to ask me for flooring types, cabinet styles, backsplash patterns, models for a new stove and fridge. I got excited with the idea of getting rid of the horrid brown painted cabinets before I slapped myself and asked ""Where is the money for this going to come from?"" We would be lucky to just paint the cabinet frames and replace the cabinet doors. I didn't understand why my father-IL was asking me all these questions, but he aggressively persisted until I was on the phone with my husband crying about how much I hated the kitchen in our new house. I cried about how I knew we couldn't afford a new kitchen, but his father kept bugging me about it. I cried because his father kept making me look at nice things that I could never have. (That ultimately opened up a can of worms about being dirt poor during my childhood and thinking Santa hated me. That is still quite sore...)

My husband felt so guilty about his father's harassment and my tears, he worked overtime at the hospital to get enough money for materials so he could remodeled the whole thing with his father and brother for me. &lt;3

That's ultimately how I caused my husband to hate the house he originally loved. While remodeling, one of them would find something wrong with the damn house. Faulty wiring here. Water damage there. Every single step to fix the kitchen was painstaking. I regretted not being stronger and keeping my mouth shut about the damn brown cabinets in the first place. 

Fast forward down the road, we've settled into the house and finally feel like we're where we should be. We started to think ""What next?"" We bought this house because of the good school district, right?

I'd been desperate for a baby for years, but my husband and I had been living with my brother-in-law to help give us a bit more wiggle room to save up for our house. Now that we had our house and we were settled, I really wanted that baby... And a dog.

I teased my husband about getting a dog. He was not amused. He's not a dog person. I kept going on and on about a dog. He flat out told me that he wouldn't let me have one. So, I teasingly said "" Well, either we get a dog or have a baby. Which is it going to be?"" 

He chose baby. 

First period went by. Then the second... And the third. 

Surely, I'm not so old to the point my chances of getting pregnant have shrunk that much... Have they?  32 isn't unreasonable to have a kid... Right?

My periods kept coming and I tried not to show my disappointment to my husband. It had only been a few months. Some people try for years. (This started to plant the seeds of doubt in my mind. )

My clock is ticking. I'm running out of time. What if my time is already up? What if something is wrong with me?


BOOM!



COVID-19



At first, it seemed safe. I was working virtually. 

Then September came...

... And now I'm only working part-time. Business is down. 

Too many hours to qualify for unemployment and the federal aide, but still 2/5 less a paycheck.

I already made horrid money and now it's 2/5 less?! And and and we have a brand new mortgage to pay...

...

...

...

...

It's ok. I'll just look for a new job.
...


...


...

There are none. At least none worth leaving the part-time work I have. 

...

...

...

Do I go back to school? Do a complete career shift? Something recession proof?

That's 2-4 years before we would see any benefits from it.

...

...

...


Suddenly no more trying for a baby.

...

...

...

Can't afford afford a baby if I'm only working 3 days a week. Can't afford a baby if I go back to school.
...

...

I'll be 35-37 by the time we're comfortable again. 

...

My clock is ticking. I'm running out of time. What if my time is already up? What if something is wrong with me? How will I repay my husband for taking care of me?! I have to try now before it's too late!


Just found out my co-worker is pregnant.

Congrats!

I want a baby so bad.



I'm running out of time.

I'm running out of time.

What if something is wrong with me? 

I have to try now before it's too late!

...

...

I pressure my husband into trying again. 

He's anxious now. 

He's the one that budgets. He knows that he's ultimately the one who has to figure out how to afford it if we do have a child. 

I shouldn't have done that. I had no right to pressure him...

That's not fair to him.

I'm the worst. 

Selfish.

Selfish.

Selfish. 

I can't even do the one thing I promised I would do for him...

I'm such a disappointment.





I don't know what to do...

I know I need help, but it will cost an arm and a leg. This is just the tip of the iceberg. My husband doesn't even know how bad my mind is. He suspects, but I'm too afraid to seek professional mental help. I'm afraid I'll get in trouble for what I allow my mind to do to me.  I know it's bad. I don't need someone else to tell me it's bad. I feel guilty enough. 

I don't know what to do..."
868,I sometimes get strong sudden urges to cry and I hate them! (why might this occur?),"It doesn't happen often, but there are times when I am just hanging out with my friends where a sudden urge to cry will rush over me and the only thing I can do is shut down and not say anything, otherwise, I feel that I will burst out in crying. I don't know why this happens, but it happened again today. My friend was introducing me to some of his other friends and they were showing me where he goes to college, when out of nowhere. BAM. I am hit with this feeling and all I can do is hold it in with all my might and act as normal as possible. I hate this feeling because it brings a brief disruption to my conversation and sometimes ends them all together. Does this happen to you? What are your thoughts?"
869,Borderline Personality Disorder : 7 Hidden signs of BPD," Have you heard of borderline personality disorder or BPD before ? it's a personality disorder that affects about one to three percent of the population.

After researching some things, I came across some details around it. So, today I will throw some light over the BPD's hidden signs in my blog.

871,Tripping and extreme mental illness,"**Okay, so a little backstory about me:**  
**I've been depressed my whole life, anxious since my teens to this day (I'm 22), and extremely out of control in every possible aspect for the last 2 years (drinking, reckless behaviour, and 24/7  thoughts about suicide).**   
**My relationships with friends and family are a complete mess, and an intimate relationship is basically impossible. My work performance is very low because of my anxiety and forgetfulness, and I can't keep a job for more than a month.** 

   
My first trip was when I was 17, it was 1-p LSD, and it was the best experience of my life.

But after that I started to notice too many things that I couldn't unsee, and that unlocked my extreme anxiety.

  
On my second trip, I looked at my ""best friend"" in the eyes, and it triggered the worst nightmare of my life.  
After that first bad trip, every other trip I've had was a bad trip, where I am afraid of my friends, run away from them (as if they are my enemies), isolate myself, unable to speak and feeling totally like an alien around them.When I trip alone, I also get a panic moment but I'm sometimes able to control it. I've grown used to bad trips, but every time I get an extreme panic attack when tripping (I've tried lsd many times and shrooms twice so far).   
Ever since the first bad trip, something inside me tells me that I'm one good trip away from gaining control over myself (That's why I continue to do it despite my experience), but also one bad trip away from killing myself.   


After every trip, I tell myself ""never again"", but every few months, almost a year, I have the urge to trip again hoping to win the inner battle. After every trip I feel as if I'm closer to defeating my demons, but in the long term I can see how my mental health is deteriorating rapidly, and I don't know what to do.  


I live in a country where mental illnesses are considered bullshit, and unless you have a lot of cash for private therapy, there is no help for you available. And I don't have money for therapy.   


I've come to a point where I'm asking reddit for help. I don't even know what my question is, this is an open discussion. All comments would be appreciated."

876,What is the point of this sub?,"This sub has one of the lowest participation rates of any that I’ve seen.

I checked the latest 100 posts, and 48 of them had no reply.  Following this sub for the last couple of weeks, I began to notice a lot of posts with no replies, and had the feeling that it was about half, so if my little count tonight is representative, I’m right. 

The majority of these orphaned posts are by people in crisis, and I can’t help but think that it’s detrimental to these people to reach out and be completely ignored. 

I would suggest that, if it’s not the purpose of this sub to engage with people who are making those kinds of posts, that they should be actively discouraged from posting here. 

If it is the purpose of this sub to encourage people to post the sort of thing that is currently getting no engagement, then I would suggest that the members of this sub step up and start participating in a program of active engagement with those who are reaching out. 

It’s possible that this sub is mostly people in need of help, and not many who are offering help. If that’s the case, then the users are going to have to start helping each other, so please, even if you feel you don’t have any particular wisdom to share, just offer a little note to recognize a fellow member’s struggle."
877,NEED HELP/ADVICE PLEASE,I really don’t like to post but I can’t stand myself anymore. Got really bad anxiety and bd depression. Have been going to therapy but I really need some advice. I keep ruining relationships and pushing people away and I absolutely hate myself for it. Is there any advice that has helped any of you to stop this habit? Constantly feeling worthless and empty or even just really upset and going off on someone you love and just pushing them away. Is there a way to control myself and keep my insecurities from hurting/affecting anyone? I’m sorry for ranting just would like to be able to communicate my feelings in a proper light.

You've told me the worthless thoughts of your self and the ideas that there's no point to life.
I know I'm the one who put that in your mind. 
I'm sorry

Today I tried to end us. You got pissy about something and we had an argument. I, overwhelmed, agreed-when you asked if you should leave.
I didnt want to tell you but I wanted you gone so I could cut. Maybe do worse things. 
But you didn't leave. You sat down, cleared your head and said ""this is stupid, I love you, were not ending anything""
I kept trying to push you away but you know how to move my heart. 
You never let me out of your big arms length 
You are the best thing thats ever happened to me; If I hurt myself I don't want you to be around. 
I didnt and never will want you gone, I just thought you should leave if im hurting myself or if I attempt- I dont want to put you through that pain. 

But later today, when we were snuggled up in bed. Under my warm blanket, allowing all of me to touch all of you, you looked at me with tears in your eyes you begged me ""don't try and get rid of me, i want to make you my wife.""
I promised and apologized. 

You always say that you've been through worse and we can beat this depreasion, but I see the Depression winning in me and its coming for you now. Like I said there are many signs
You claim im your savor but I feel worthless and like I'm  bringing you down. 

I dont know what to do. Youre the love of my life. I just dont want to hurt you. I love you baby so much"

Used to get picked on when I was young about “all Asian look the same” then it started in my mind seeming like if I went out with an Asian woman it would be like going out with my sister because the Asian race lacks genetic diversity?

In my mind this isn’t racist because this is what society has conditioned and raised me up as? I don’t find any attraction to the Asian race? I’m 29 by the way and have had a lot of time to think of this but in hindsight I also grew up being 1 of many 3 Asian people in the entire town?

&amp;#x200B;

and at this point i don't understand why i'm crying. my therapist (it's the college's own therapist) was praising me on how well i was doing, but now i can't even see her anymore because i graduated. i'm on the lookout for another therapist, but in the meantime i'm just going awol just letting my thoughts run too much in my head even though i tell myself to calm down.

there's nothing wrong in my life, i talk to my friends, my family, my boyfriend, and i know they all care and love me. but why can't i just come to terms with it? i'm feeling like i don't deserve any of these relationships and i worry for the future.

I don't even know if I'm actually trying to get better anymore. I feel like I'm already ruined. I'm just a serial monogamist, with no ability to maintain non romantic relationships. I have no real social skills. I keep quiting jobs because I just become a panic attack mess. I keep failing classes and can't complete my bachelors. My mom's response is to hospitalize me eberytime I'm having a rougher time. 

I haven't taken my own life, so I feel like I should say that that's some kind of victory. But what even for? Its not feeling like a win...

897,Can somebody name this?,"Hi everyone,

I have quite a few problems related to my mental health and I don't have access to therapy. I don't wanna go into too much detail but there's one of them that I used to describe as ""social anxiety"" until I looked up what social anxiety means and noticed that while it is similar, it is by far not the same. So now I'm wondering if there's a name for what I'm experiencing.

So... I get anxious about entering group situations but there's nothing in particular I'm afraid of. Like, I don't worry about doing something embarrassing or experiencing bad things from another person or anything really. I'm just anxious in a general, obscure way, if that makes sense. I also don't get physical symptoms, I just feel bad mentally. It's worse if there's people I don't know or if I go into spaces I haven't been to before. It also flugtuates a lot in general. Like, sometimes it's only about large groups of people, sometimes I avoid encounters with just one other person and other times, I can't feel it at all. Like, when it's not there, I can be really social and extroverted in large groups. Sometimes when it's there, I can push myself to enter groups (and it's usually fine then), other times I can't even leave my room at all. I think how safe I feel in specific circles plays into that a little bit, but it seems to just flugtuate at random.

Um, so can somebody help me name what I'm experiencing? Thanks."
898,I feel I have no power over my actions.,"It feels like you could do anything, literally. You're on the bridge and you see the abyss - why won't you jump? You could do it. How do I know if It's just image, thought in my head or reall will? You see a child - you could harm him/her. You can do it as well in many ways, sometimes you don't even realize that you said/did something wrong. What if I will do something unforgivable one day? I know it sounds mad as you read it (and best thing is I see it too) but everytime I see something or someone - questions appear in my head. ''Why won't you rape her? You could do it. Why would you do it? Why not? Do you like it? No... But why?'' These questions don't stop and they can relate to anything. Even stupid things like deciding what will I shall eat. ''What would you eat? This? Okey, but why? You could eat something else. You could also eat nothing. Why am I suppossed to eat?'' And there are no feelings to guide me lately, everything is as good as bad. After all I do what I would've normally do, but it's automatic and feels like im robot. What's hapenning?"
899,Need.Assistance with my Medication,"Quick background. I have been battling anxiety and panic attacks since age 11, ( I'm 39 now. My parents figured that I would somehow grow out of it, however that never happened. Ypu name it, I've been on it. Currently taking Zoloft, 100mg, Buspar, and 1mg. Xanax. This combination I have finally begun to help me immensely. I do not abuse my Xanax or take it to get high. I am prescribed 30 for be 30 days.
It seems to lift my depression even more so than the the Zoloft. Life-saving is an understatement. Occasionally during very stressful periods, I may take an extra. I know that this is counterproductive because near the end of the month I end up going several days without. I'm not here for any judgment or lecture, when I would like to know is how others make their medication last. I need ideas. I don't wish to ever go through running out. Thank you in advance."

Anyways I want to warn you guys that when watching these videos don’t take them to seriously because It can mess you up really bad, like it has to me. I can no longer close my eyes without seeing the faces of the ghost girls in these videos, or the faces of men stalking through a window, the creepy smiling face of a deep web video, the crawling man wearing a mask, the man staring at the camera with a red filter… I simply cannot get over these pictures and many more. What I am saying is please pace yourself’s when watching creepy videos, I know how entertaining and addicting they are. I watch these videos from the morning to bedtime. At least 2 hours a day worth of content, and its taking a toll in my mental health. (I will list more examples) I can longer go to sleep without tossing and turning for hours on end, every time I walk the corner I feel like there is going to be someone just waiting for me there smiling, or when I open the bathroom door, I cant walk in the dark without feeling someone watching me behind my back. I’ve become paranoid. I look over my shoulder everyday in my own house. I am writing this because I think people should know about this more, because I’ve tried to do research on mental health about these videos and couldn’t find much about the trauma that this leaves you.

904,Feels like life isn't worth living.,"

3 years ago, I decided I wanted to become a web developer.

Now, 4 years later, I am on the verge of giving up.

I'm 22, and jobless because of a few mistakes on my part and corona. I have a BSc, and yet I cannot find a job or an internship. I am in the Middle East, and nobody wants to hire newbies here. In 2018, I had to intern, I got one out of pity, and unpaid one where I had to spend money on transport. I thought I'll earn it back once I graduated. Now, a year after graduation, I'm wondering if I made the wrong decision and if I should give up on my dreams.

I am willing to do a WFH unpaid internship and have been emailing companies and no response. I had to do a 'test' for a job listing. Made a static website and did not get any response or feedback. I have been called for interviews and rejected because I don't have the experience. They don't want to hire freshers but they want people with experience. Nobody wants to even give people an unpaid internship. Why? Because they cannot accept work from home.

I am miserable, I am extremely depressed. I don't know what to do, I have no guidance or anyone to ask for help. I am tired of having my dreams broken. I keep telling myself to have patience but the future seems so bleak. I always imagined I'd be happy at 22, maybe working, or studying. I want to help my parents out financially since we've been on hard times since 2019. But I can't even do that. I feel like a failure. All day the voice in my head tells me to kill myself and end the suffering. I'm so tired."
905,Dealing with Online School,"Hi guys, I'm a 17 year old currently in my senior year of high school. 

I thought online schooling would be a breeze for me as I'm tech savvy (most ppl my generation are i guess) but I didn't expect this many assignments.

 I don't have the best home life and it's easy for me to slip into a depressive episode. Most of my assignments have strict deadlines and the quarter ends soon. I came here to ask if there's anything that could help me.

 I journal my thoughts from time to time, drink water, blah blah, but sometimes I feel like I could avoid all of this if I just died. It's very hard for me to focus (I struggle with \~brain things\~ akin to ADHD.. feel like I have it but I'm not diagnosed)

907,Things seemed okay... for a day,"I thought that one of the main sources of my anxious thoughts and depression had disappeared because I managed to sort it out, but now I learned that there's still very much that same uncertainty and I have to wait again for my university to respond. All this waiting is making me hate myself and think about all the mistakes I did this year and that I'm a total failure and that even though there are people around me who care about me, none of them actually understands how I feel and how I've felt for a long time now.

What's more, my dad shouted at me because he thought I'd missed a very important deadline again. I didn't. It had nothing to do with university. And when he found out he said that he doesn't care if it has nothing to do with university. That hurt me because I'm tired of being defined by my grades or by my degree. And he's made mistakes as a father as well, but I'm not reminding him about them every few days. We barely had a relationship while I was growing up and he was constantly busy. And then all he did when he came back from work was watch tv. Never cared about anything more than ""how's school"". 

What's more my mother was very strict and always wanted me to be doing all these extracurricular activities because ""you never know what might be useful in the future"". I grew up being scared of what she will think of me if I failed. Or if I made a mistake. 
My parents never taught me how to talk about my feelings and I was constantly scared of being judged by them if I seemed weak. 

I know they might not have been aware of that, but I still have to deal with the psychological effects of their actions. I don't know what I'm asking here. I guess of anyone has gone through something similar. Or if anyone has any tips on how to start working on my mental health without feeling like a complete failure because I failed one class at university."
908,I can’t socialise and it’s negatively affecting my mental health,"I’ve been out of high school for almost 2 years now. Since then I’ve lost the only friends I had (they were *those* extroverts, if you know what I mean). Being on the spectrum, social/communication skills isn’t exactly a strong point of mine.

To help with getting a job, I’ve been with a job recruitment agency since the start of 2019. In that time no one there has had much of an interest in me, and I’ve failed to make friends with any of them.

Over the past few weeks I’ve been making an effort to try and bond with some people there. I find starting conversations is much easier over text, so I texted a couple of them.

One opens all my messages, but never once replied because he’s “always busy”, or so he says (he actually tried talking to me a bit when we first met, but I probably didn’t seem too interested). I tried to start conversations with him in person a couple of times too. They went ok, but they felt awkward to me (because I feel uncomfortable with this stuff) and they didn’t last long.

I did good with another person though, except that conversation was mainly asking how she was and getting to know her. After that, I never tried again as I don’t know when it’s appropriate, or what to say, just for a casual conversation.

The other day one of them (the one who keeps ghosting me) was having a full-on conversation the entire time with someone who’d only been doing group stuff for the 2nd or 3rd time. This was upsetting me because I was alone, everyone was talking to each other, and I wasn’t able to join in with any of the conversations.

By the end of the day I was breathing somewhat heavily, and I was constantly changing seats when we were on the train. While moving the last time my head hit the window, then the heavy breathing turned into crying.

One of them asked if I was ok after hitting my head, I said “I don’t know” as I started crying. She, and another person, were asking me what was wrong and if I wanted one of the staff (they were downstairs). They asked if it was stuff at home, I said “Kind of”, as there’s some stuff happening at home too. They then said they hope it gets better, or sorry to hear about it, or something like that.

I’ve been depressed for most of the weekend because of this, and there’s likely no way out. I finish that program I’m doing with the agency in 2 months, so this is probably my last chance at making friends with them. I feel like these people would be my best chance of making friends, but I give up. It’s not possible for me to make friends, no matter how much I try.

Don’t bother giving me advice, it never works. I’ll just end up being alone for the rest of my pathetic life... I pretty much just wrote this to vent."

910,I (18M) let my past school trauma affect new friendships,"Hi Everyone,

I was bullied from the ages of 11-16. I was a very eccentric pre-teen/teenager who had little stereotypically masculine traits, which made me the target of bullying by these individuals. Over the years, this has made me depressed and extremely insecure, so much so that I refrain from going to gyms or other public places for fear of being mocked at (part of the bullying was due to my skinny build). 

I have since long accepted the fact that I indirectly contributed to my own bullying, as I acted very immaturely when others had already grown out of that phase. Additionally, I realised that I was gay, which contributed to some of my effeminate traits that also caused the bullying. 

When I was 16, I found out that my closest friends at the time were part of those who contributed to the bullying. I cut them all out of my life, and I progressed into my 17th year without having any friends from my past.

However, for these past two years, I have made multiple close friends, and have deliberately ended these friendships because some actions that they did reminded me of the individuals in my past. It came to a point whereby I deliberately wanted to find faults in them to convince myself that I should cut them out of my life and remain alone. 

I have done this to 4 individuals, and until now I regret doing so because they were genuine people who had my best interests at heart. I now have a close friend, but I am feeling these same toxic feelings towards him as I did to those other friends. I keep thinking that I am better off without him, even if that means I would be alone.

912,Is there anyone else out there in this unique situation? (Basically mental illness is too overwhelming and now want to freeze sperm for possible future generation after I'm gone),So after 33 years of battling the most horrific and debilitating illness with over 20+ unfixable soul crushing symptoms I've thought of the idea of freezing my sperm and giving custody to my family to do whatever they want with them if I happen to die for any reason. I'm at the stage of just getting my specimen analysed to see if they are viable or not but haven't moved further on in the process such as donating to a sperm bank and figuring out the legal way of giving my parents legal rights to them if I happen to die. I attempted to take my own life about 3 years ago (water and food starvation got to 6.5 days but was caught and sent to hospital) and all this time the thought that I'll have nothing to show for this horrific life I've lived against my will adds further anguish. Note I've had a wonderful wonderful family which in the end doesn't take away any of the suffering and misery of this most dreadful illness. Has anyone out there thought of such an idea or been in this predicament where their mental illness incapacitates them to the point where they cannot function at all and cannot be in a relationship and raise children even though deep down that is what they desire the most? I want it to be a completely voluntary thing for my family to decide after I'm gone - if they would like to do surrogacy and IVF they can.

914,I have zero self esteem. Just when will I die,"I am young, physically healthy, I have friends who love me, my family is not dysfunctional, financially we are doing fine but still I am not happy, I don't know how can I be happy. I have been using antidepressants (Prozac 80 mg's a day) and meeting with psychotherapists for more than 3 years now. I can't speak a word with anybody but my close friends and my therapists, I just freeze. Now I cant see them too because of the pandemic. 
I am the most self pitying, lazy, useless asshole ever. Me me me me. I always think about me. What is wrong with me? Why can't I get anything done? Why do I fail everytime I try? What a privileged cunt I am. People in very shitty situations try their best but I don't have the fight. I can't face with any problem. 
I spend most of my time, lying in my bed, playing Nintendo Switch. I am very susceptible to addiction. First year of college and my first time away from my parents I used to heavily drink alcohol. Was having blackouts once a week, one time I poured beer to my very expensive new gaming notebook and broke it unrepairable. Second year, I stopped drinking when I found myself in hospital with a needle in my wrist, pissed in my pants, friends worried to death. I quickly changed to smoking shit load of weed. It didnt harmed my body as much as alcohol, in fact I think it was lot more healthy but it was an addiction no less. Because I know I smoked it to escape from my problems. It kept me sleeping whole day and high all night. Also because it's illegal in my country I had some severe anxiety crises. My gpa is 1,22. I can't achieve anything.
Now I am with my family my addiction changed into video games. One thing I am good at is switching my addictions fast, without much withdrawal. I don't even miss alcohol, just anything to make me escape from reality and quite my blabbering my mind is fine.
I wrote all this because I am about to explode. We went to visit my grandma yesterday, to another city and I have lost my wallet. My cash, credit cards and most importantly ID card is gone. In Turkey, ID cards are extremely important nowadays because cops tend to check you and want to see your ID. My smooth brain makes me forget or lose something, almost always when I go out and this time is the worst. I keep telling to myself ""when will I die, when will I die, when the fuck will I just die, just die"""
915,Ive been restricting food,"I’ve been restricting food for a few weeks now and at this point i cant tell if its from a loss of appetite or i just wont let myself eat. I eat one meal a day (dinner) so no one gets suspicious but i eat as little as i can. I also suffer from severe anxiety. 

Its honestly almost like i know im self destructing and destroying my body but i can stop?"

917,Does this sound right?,"So I came in from a nice Sunday walk earlier and found my mum putting the clothes on to wash. Just before I went into the lounge after saying hello, she asked me to record something on the TV, I said ok.

A few minutes later, I remembered I needed something from my room so I start to walk upstairs and on the way see my mum. I tell her that I couldn't find the program she was looking for. She said ok.

I came back downstairs and sat in the lounge and she soon joined me, but her presence made me feel terrible, like I'd done something wrong because I 'went out of my way to inform her of the program'.

It's just like whenever I do something nice or something that she's considers I have gone out if my way to do for her she takes it as if I'm being needy and trying to be too 'friendly' to her, like a kid in pre school trying to make friends and thus treats me like a needy loser.

I know this is hard to grasp by the short description, but in can hardly breath, I have to walk on eggshells in the house or she takes everything the wrong way and blows everything out of proportion.

I love her and she's always there for me, but my whole everyday existence is basically thinking how to escape her 'trap'."

920,How to cope with COVID-19 loss?,"Hey there.

Today is a dark day for my extended family. My uncle sadly passed away due to multiple complications following a coronavirus infection. 

I'd been honestly enjoying this lockdown since it started in my country. Being an introvert by nature, I got so much time to enjoy my hobbies and connect with friends over the phone I've not been able to talk for a long time because of my otherwise busy schedule.

But then this happened. God knows we've tried our best to arrange for the best doctors, the best treatments, plasma when required. A week of something bad happening, then that getting rectified, followed by something else worse. One thing led to the other, and the all money, all the medical expertise we could arrange for, all went to vain. 

My uncle was not really at fault: he had contacted the virus himself while helping out others in his family. He had been a fit, middle-aged man with no history of medical conditions. My mom often used to tell me about his love of academics, having fetched multiple degrees across diverse fields. This comes as a shock to everyone, especially my cousins who have lost their father and my aunt, who has lost her husband. How should I get over it, and what could I do to help my family?

Some sound advice (esp. mental health professionals, if any) could go a long way.

Thanks."
921,I need help!,"I’ve had trouble with my mental health my entire life. I blame genetics as my father commit suicide several years ago. He wasn’t diagnosed with any particular disorder, but something obviously wasn’t right. I suspect I have bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder along with anxiety. I’ve never really been properly diagnosed with anything. I just have manic episodes as well as a lot of trouble thinking and acting logically when I’m in one of my moods. It’s really dragging me down. 

I was on Zoloft for years and it worked great, but recently I’ve had more trouble than help with it. It cause me to feel numb, and disassociate. I weaned off of it and am now trying to learn how to naturally self medicate myself. I use CBD oil daily. My question is, what have you found to help with the symptoms of your mental health disorders? I’m hoping to find something natural that can ease this. I know it won’t go away completely, but if I could get some sort of relief I think I’ll be okay. Thanks to those who read this far. 💙"

923,Why do I crave depression?,"I want to achieve and be the best version of myself, but I always end up struggling with depression and low self esteem. At this point, I think I actually crave depression. I gravitate towards things that make me feel down and think negative things that make me cry. I feel annoyed when I hear others laugh, like I don’t understand why they want to be happy. I burn out from acting happy and positive with people and need to spend a while isolating myself and being sad to balance that out. I don’t know. I just find ways to make myself depressed? While I don’t physically hurt myself, I’m realizing this emotional destruction is also a form of self harm. I’m not letting myself be the best version of myself and achieve the things I want to achieve. I sabotage my happiness and my energy so that I can wallow at home and do nothing. What is going on?"
924,What is therapy supposed to be like?,"In August I was hospitalized and then I did an intensive outpatient therapy program and both were the best things I’ve ever done for myself. They set me up for therapy after and I’ve done 3 sessions now and all 3 times I’ve felt like they were a complete waste of my money. And it’s been a lot of money.

I’m an open book. I talk very openly about whatever’s going on with me with both IRL and online and I feel I get good immediate feedback from that. Therapy just feels like old news it’s just like a conversation that I’ve already had a million times. I’ve learned nothing new by having that conversation again. What am I supposed to be getting out of it? 

Is it just helpful for people who don’t openly talk all the time like I do? Or is my therapist doing something wrong? 

I thought he is supposed to be like asking me questions or teaching me something or idk. Anything. 

At the end of all my sessions he asks me what was most helpful and I never have anything to say so I have to really reach to make something up. I just feel like it’s a colossal waste of my time.

I had such high hopes for it. But it’s been such a major disappointment.

Everybody talks therapy up like it’s life changing. But I don’t get how just another conversation is so life changing. I don’t get how simply talking to another person (except I’m paying him) is supposed to be so magical. What am I missing? 

I went into it willing to let it work on me since the other programs worked... it’s not like I went into it closed minded."
925,Self worth,"I can't stop thinking about what others think about me, I constantly feel like everyone around me finds me annoying and a burden. I used to never be this way, I used to feel so confident in myself and in my body but no matter how hard I try, how many therapy sessions, meds, what I do I can't shake this feeling. I constantly want to separate myself from everyone. I don't do any of the things I used to do. I have to force myself to do my favorite things. What is this and if anyone feels this way too, what helps you overcome it?"
926,Wtf am I feeling,Ive been seeing my school counselor for a while now  and usually I'd go see her tommorow but I just feel so dumb and I've convinced myself to not make an apointment. The last thing we talked about was about me not feeling anything anynore and the fact that I constantly felt like I needed to cry but just couldn't. Ive gotten a little bit better at feeling things but I still feel nothing most of the time or I don't know what I'm feeling. I self harmed for the first time a week ago and she doesn't know and I really dont want to tell her. Ive always had imposter syndrome but after that I just started feeling like I was lying about everything. Like Im faking everything I do and say and feel and that nothing is real and that Im just making everything up and don't deserve to see her because there isn't actually a problem besides me being an atention whore. I dont know what Im feeling or even if any feeling is even real I'm just so tired of my bullshit.

928,What is wrong with me?,"I thought it was just stress and anxiety at first because I had exams coming up but now that it’s over it’s still the same. At night I just lie in bed feeling empty and it feels like I don’t know what makes me happy anymore. I don’t enjoy video games anymore. I have every reason to be happy, yet right now the only thing that’s really keeping me sane is my dog. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me, I’ve been getting more bouts of just intense feelings of void at night. It feels like I have no purpose, or anything that I’m passionate about. I don’t think I’m depressed and don’t worry I’m not going to do anything stupid I’m just trying to get out of this phase or whatever and understand what’s wrong."
929,Online School and Assignments,"So I’m in my last year of high school and just like most people I have to go through online classes, noting special, I also had online classes in the 2nd half last year of school too.

Last year I’d say I was pretty happy, I was regularly doing all my assignments, attending the zoom meetings and I even got to catch up with two of my old friends, who switched schools like way back then, now I’m confident to say they’re my best friends, which is a big deal for me since I’ve never really had one up until now and I’ve always been scared of being emotionally vulnerable but always wanting to do so.

Now what makes this year different is that well, I’ve just been thinking a lot and I can’t help but feel like I wasted my high school years, I realized the amount of missed opportunities to make friends, sure I’ve always been closed off but my lack of friends, or the lack of people I feel confident calling friends, is always something that would make be upset, and that feeling is even stronger now, and it’s worse because I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling like this anymore, I have a few friends that I know care about me and I just feel like it’s disrespectful to them for me to feeling like this, which is why I’ve put off from telling them, I know that they would understand but I just can’t help it.

I know that this problem isn’t really a big deal but it has affected my studies negative way too much, I’m just mad at myself for becoming like this, especially in my last year, I still try my best to finish my assignments but the marks always ends up being garbage and I regularly miss the zoom class meetings.

I just wish I knew how to stop all this, this is my last year and I can’t be failing now."

Listen to this guy saying this: [https://youtu.be/lL-df-6LGJA?t=692](https://youtu.be/lL-df-6LGJA?t=692)

Whenever someone, like that guy, says multiple things in rapid succession, I feel like they are throwing too many things at my brain at once, and none of those things have enough time to process.

So, when I'm chatting in real time, and someone says a long string of phrases, my brain doesn't process those ideas because it isn't powerful enough to quickly understand them. Therefore I look like an idiot, trying to figure out what they said, but failing.

932,Mental health struggles for a mental health worker,"I've worked as a mental health support worker for the last 2 and a half years, and it's the most satisfying job imaginable. We take in patients from the local area who may be suffering from a range of disorders, from Depression to Psychosis,its extremely challenging. Around 3 months ago, a patient was with us experiencing paranoid thoughts, actually lives very local to myself too, which made it a little more difficult. During one of my night shifts, he attempted to hang himself, with a belt, over the door of his private room. I was the only one that could squeeze through the door due to me being a skinny ass, and had to remove said belt. What happened was an agonising 3 hours where rapid response was called due to him not breathing, and with adrenaline pumping we got him stable and he went to intensive care. It was very tense, we had dealt with self harm countless times in the past but this one was too close for comfort.

For about a week after, back in work, I struggled. I was getting angry, getting upset for no reason, and had to take myself away from the job many times to compose myself. I thought I felt fine over the Incident that had occurred, after all he was alive and now getting the treatment he needed. About a week after, I broke down over something very small that had happened, and was sent home. Since then it's been a downward spiral, my anxiety has shot through the roof, my appetite is non existent, I feel drained and empty, I've started Fluoxetine anti depressants (about 2 weeks in) and feel even worse. My social anxiety is through the roof, and am constantly vigilant, and jump very easy when people come around corners for example. I've been getting very angry with my local Facebook hubs due to their stupidity over anti masks, so have come off social media because of that, but now feel a lot more separated from people. Lockdown has affected me massively, as I have worked night shifts all through the pandemic, and now I'm off work it feels like I'm absorbing all the changes and all the bad news even more. 

I've got a very short attention span, which is unlike me, and I've taken to smoking cannabis a lot more than I'd have liked. I have been a regular smoker for around 10/12 years, always functioned well, never been a problem, just use cannabis as a way to relieve stress just how others would have a drink, but found myself consuming it a lot more since being off work.

I've spoken with therapy and am starting EMDR therapy for PTSD, they seem to think the incident sparked something, even though it was the best possible outcome of him being alive and with no lasting damage

I guess I'm just looking for advice and somewhere to rant, I'm meant to be going back to work next week after 2 months off but feel worse now than when I went off, is there anyone that can offer advice in the way of getting back to normal, on one hand i feel that getting back to work will help me gain a routine back, but feel like I can't look after others if I don't look after myself"
933,I need to go to a therapist but I’m too scared to tell my parents,"I have been sad for so long, for seemingly no reason.

For example I yelled at my mom today because she misplaced my phone charger. I feel really bad about it and I didn’t want to yell at her. I really need to talk to somebody but I am to scared too. Please help"
934,Gentle reminder that not working on your mental health will destroy your relationships.,"Im sure its been said before but i have today realised this important lesson and i need advice.

I (23M) have systematically destroyed a relationship with the love of my life by not looking after my own mental health or working on my faults in time. 

Ive struggled since pre-teenage years with depression and anxiety. With an unhealthy amount of emotional and physical abuse from my mother in those years, ive also taught myself some pretty toxic coping mechanisms, which i should have dealt with sooner i'll admit. Ive since suffered with extreme addiction problems and been to rehab as a result, to which i have also (until recently) not followed the advise of. A few failed suicide attempts later, i found the woman i thought i could turn it all around for. Again a mistake as i wasnt doing it for myself.

Our relationship bloomed until the fateful day COVID hit. I lost my job and with no furlough, i worked 4 jobs to pay my bills and debts, leaving me under £2 a day spare for months. I was miserable, i was stressed and i was nearly broken. 

I thought not being able to use my usual vices would be a good thing, but i made no effort to make sure they didnt manifest in other aspects of my life. My anger went through the roof and my partner (quartining away from me) took the brunt of my eruptions in the form of emotional abuse. 

I would break up with her over nothing and then beg for her back in minutes, id call her names when i was angry and generally pick at her self worth. 

Today it happened for the last time. The damage is irrepairable. Ive suddenly come out of a haze and realised how horriffic ive been as a result of forgetting my mental health.

Ive since sought councelling but i dont know what other steps to take to fix myself before i do that to someone else. Any advice is appreciated. 

Sorry for the rant but i really wanted it off my chest."
935,Is it okay to ask for (if there is something like) ADHD test to my psychiatrist?,"I never really asked what my diagnosis is to my psychologist, but from the list of meds which my psychiatrist gave I got an idea it was for anxiety and depression.

A few weeks ago, I just discovered r/ADHD and I can relate to almost everything that were posted there. I know, self diagnose is a terrible thing but it's been on my mind lately, what if the anxiety and depression is caused by untreated/mistreated ADHD??

I want to ask my psychiatrist about these things on my next counseling schedule, but I can't seem to find a right way to tell/to ask about it.."

***TW Overstepping Boundaries and Emotional abuse***


This is going to be partially prewritten things that I’m copying and pasting from my notes app and me venting in discord. 


At home life: 

Okay so I am a minor. My dad is obviously my dad. I scared my dad twice by saying “boo”.  The second time I said that, he “jokingly” came after me and he essentially pinned me between the kitchen table and the open drawer. I told him “stop, personal space.” He said “I’m you father, you have no right to personal space.” At that point I was starting to get overstimulated. Somehow I got away and I ran into my room. He didn’t follow me then but yeah. I’m lucky he never tried to touch me but he lost all of the trust I had for him (not that much to begin with) and I really don’t want to talk to him but I have to for the next few years until I can move out. Also he invalidates me. He is emotionally abusive and I can’t do anything about it. My parents argue way too much (like 3-10 times a day). 



School or things relating to school: 

Background information: I am assigned female at birth and I identify as a demiboy. I haven’t transitioned at all. 


We as a system feel like every two years are terrible. The 2018-19 school year was trash and so is the 2020-21 school year aka now. In the past two years Kai (host)  has attempted probably 5-7 times, three of those times last month. Lately ne has been getting triggered more than usual. A few days ago Kai didn’t Front for a day and a half due to a event that happened. Shay was there for a whole day and then I was there for half of the next day. Also what Hellenes two years ago in TL;DR is I was on a volleyball team and it was tearing my mental health to shreds and I feel like I was only “happy” because I was skinny and I was 90-95lbs and 5’5-5’6 1/2. Now I’m in high school and I’m 5’8 and I’m 120-130. I feel fat. I would do anything to be under 100 again. I don’t eat breakfast. I eat a small lunch and I have to eat a big dinner. I would love to not eat at all. Today I’ve promised myself to no breakfast, try to skip lunch or eat something small and also eat dinner. No snacks. 




Miscellaneous: 

I’m suicidal a lot. I relapsed on Self harm a month ago after 466 days clean. Yesterday I relapsed after 5 days. Exactly a month ago I harmed 30 times in two days. On the second day on suicide awareness month I attempted. Then again a few days later and then about a week after that. People on Discord has been telling me to tell my parents but I can’t. My mom will overreact and my dad will invalidate me or just tell at me for something he did. I would love to have therapy sessions but I can’t ask for them. I truly wish Texas and my school district had better resources. 





That’s the end of the vent and if you read this you’re amazing.

938,my friend wants to commit suicide,"hey everyone. i met my friend while playing a game online. she lives in a different state than me, but we’ve grown very close by talking to each other over the phone. last night while we were talking i felt something was off. i asked what was going on and she told me that she wanted to kill herself. she confessed to me that she really liked me and that she thought that maybe it would be better for us to stop talking than for her to make me unhappy. i disagreed and we continued to talk until we said goodnight and i tried to sleep. it’s the next day now and i’ve been trying to talk to her for 2 hours now. maybe she’s still sleeping, or maybe she’s ignoring me. what can i do to help my suicidal friend choose life? thanks for any help in advance"
939,Agitated,Idk why but lately I’ve been feeling really agitated and annoyed like I don’t wanna talk to any of my friends or family. But it also feels like I have no emotions and my brain is just on autopilot where I don’t care about anything or anyone
940,I think I’m depressed but I don’t know where to start to seek help.,"I have been feeling the weight of it for at least a year now. I live alone and I don’t have any one close near by. I don’t know how to start seeking mental health resources. Do people bring it up during the annual medical health check? 

I live in the Boston area, MA if that helps."
941,How do you support a partner with depression or mental health challenges?,"My partner might have depression, not officially diagnosed but it's a possibility his therapist has raised with him. His mental illness comes out in different ways, but usually, it can be intense, either in the form of self-hate or anger and frustration from feeling overwhelmed. It's gotten quite bad and it's difficult for me to cope with sometimes. What is the best way to support him in those moments? I never know what to say and often feel like anything I say just adds to his frustration."
942,Best source for online therapy?,I have a range of mental health “issues” that I am aware of. I don’t think they’re issues but they don’t follow societal norms and I would assume it would be in the extremes although I don’t see it as that bad. I don’t have health insurance or anything like that so something that I can pay out of pocket for x amount of times would work for me. These problems have been going on for a while but I feel like I need to get to know my therapist before I actually open up about deeper things so if there is a way to read about what the therapist has had experience in then that would be great.
943,I overcame severe mental health issues and years of physical/mental abuse. Wrote a story on how I managed to do it with a lot of useful information.,"This post is about how I managed to beat generalized anxiety, trauma, severe panic attacks and depression. Also how I healed from many years of physical and mental abuse. Hopefully this can give others a different perspective and move on as well.

I had extremely abusive parents growing; physically and mentally. My mom was very manipulative and despised me to my core because I was born with an undoubtful resemblance to my dad. My dad would always argue with my mom and she would use me as her punching bag, she always redirected all her anger towards me. And when my dad would get home he would beat me as well. Mom tried to suffocate me when I was 5 years old. I told my dad and he called the cops, I lied to the cops and told them my mom didn’t do that and that my dad lied. My mom hated me after that point and convinced my brothers to do the same. Was forced to live with my mom’s resentment until I was 18 years old. This was my every day life until I was 18 years old and the occasional fist fights and arguments with my manipulated brothers. I was a pathological liar in high school. I had a ton of friends growing up but always felt overwhelmingly lonely. Deep down I loved my family so I never spoke out against them because I had no trust against anyone anymore, my family was happy with each other and I didn’t have the heart to break it apart. I spent so many years feeling sorry for myself and having pity parties with everyone I met online. I had no aspirations and no motivation for anything. I spent 3 years not understanding what was happening to me. I dug into my traumatic past because I realized I had forgotten most of it. Tried forgiving my family and attempted to love them again but my older brother was still very resentful towards me and one day during an argument with my mom he beat me with a rock and attempted to stab me multiple times with a kitchen knife. After that point my whole world shattered. I was homeless for a while and began to have panic attacks. I had severe panic attacks every 5 minutes of every day for the next 6-8 months. Hospital trips, 100+ attacks a day, silent panic attacks.

&gt; Understanding my anxiety:
Anxiety was formed by recurring negative thoughts. Thinking about the worst possible outcomes from any situation. Excessive worry. Feeling afraid. I realized I needed to be more confident in life. If I worry about something that hasn’t even happened yet, I just suffer through a situation that hasn’t even happened and might not even happen. Learning to be aware of when you are entering a negative thought cycle and being able to pull yourself out of it. Meditation has helped with being able to focus and being more aware of when I enter thought loops and allows me to quiet my mind at any given moment. It is much easier to enter thought cycles when you are on autopilot because you function on habits. Try do new things to stop from entering autopilot. Try to become aware when you are in autopilot and pull yourself out.

Here’s how I was able to turn my life around: (The chronological order doesn’t matter but hopefully you can take away some information that would help you overcome what you’re going through)

&gt; I had to put myself before anything and anyone else. I am my #1 priority. I knew if I were to beat anxiety, I had to lay everything out on the table and stop lying to myself. I knew I was negative. I knew I was lazy. I felt like a failure. Used depression, anxiety and my past as an excuse to get away with doing nothing with my life. I knew I was doing everything wrong so I had to do the opposite of the things I named because they were getting in the way of my happiness.

1) I had a bad habit of bottling up all my emotions: 
I knew I had to open up to people and normalize opening up to everyone. I knew if I opened up to one specific person I would grow attached and they would eventually break my heart and make me not want to open up again. So whenever someone was willing to listen I would share my story.

2) Learning how to find myself:
I used to be a pathological liar because I didn’t know who I was so I could never add anything genuine to any conversation and lying about stuff was easy. So I brought it back to the best memory I had of myself, when I was 5 years old when I was a pure and happy soul, before I was tainted by any negativity. I knew this was the most genuine/happy memory of myself. I loved my family more than anything and loved helping people that I loved. So I worked extremely hard to try to get to that point. (Still trying)

3) I struggled with being able to love anything or anyone:
I knew if I were to leave my family I would never be happy again. If I wanted to be happy I knew I had to learn how to forgive them.

- I knew I had to forgive them in order to love them: (forgiveness only benefits you. holding resentment or hatred towards people is only a burden towards you.)
In order to forgive them, I needed to deeply understand why they did what they did. This doesn't mean that they didn't do anything wrong by me. This just helps to make it feel much less personal.
I realized that my parents were raised in a very violent environment and their parents were just as violent towards them. They also didn't have the privilege of having an education (both pulled out of school at the 5th grade). 
From there I knew that they were just a product of their environment. I knew that if my parents were born in a loving and compassionate environment, they would have been loving towards me. I realized they just weren't educated enough to be in control of their emotions because they were surrounded by impulsive and uneducated people all their lives. My parents still fed me and somewhat cared for me in their own destructive manner. This allowed me to shift the blame away from my parents. 
(Being a product of their environment can be used in your everyday life to understand why people are insensitive and bad people and make things feel less personal) 
I don't take anything personal anymore because of this.

-I also knew that if it wasn't for them I wouldn't have had an education. I would never have been able to recognize that they did wrong by me. Recognizing other people's faults was a privilege that they didn't have. They were living in a world where violence and mental abuse was normal.

-I slowly began to be appreciative and grateful of all the tiny things they did for me, after being able to ignore their faults. I realized that I slowly began loving them again through that appreciation. I believe that appreciation is the gateway to love.

4) Finding my purpose:
I knew I loved a challenge. I knew I was good at math. I knew I loved helping people. Space is exciting to me. I always had really great ideas for inventions. Love to speak in front of crowds. So I knew I had to do something challenging, involving math, space and inventions. I chose to study aerospace engineering because its the most difficult career path and would give me the knowledge to be able bring my ideas to life. And eventually become a motivational speaker after becoming successful to inspire kids who are going through a similar experience.

5) Retaining and finding motivation:
Everyone needs some support pillars. We all need people and things we can rely on whenever we are going through bad times and that’s what support pillars are for. My support pillars became my family and myself. I used every single situation that happened to me as a source of motivation. I figured that I was still on this earth for a reason after going through so much. I will not stop trying until I figure out what that reason is. I know my parents sacrificed a lot for me despite their ignorance and destructive behavior. So I will make my own sacrifices and do all I possibly can to do right by their efforts.

Hope this serves as some inspiration or gives you some knowledge that can help improve your life :). Thanks for reading!"
944,Need advice,"My parents are very....old school (don't know how else to describe it) when it comes to mental health. They think everyone who has mental health issues is looking either for attention, weak-minded, or just looking to numb themselves with medication. Talking to them about this stuff doesn't seem to change their minds and it's more than likely why I've never sought to get myself help because I know they'll just say there's nothing wrong in my life to make me depressed. 

Anyway, so my boyfriend and I have been together for a little less than year and they have yet to meet him because he lives in Colorado and I live in Texas at the moment. Eventually they will meet him, but I haven't told them that he has type 2 bipolar disorder. After I told them about him having a breakdown in his mid 20s and that an accident happened from it, they're already judging him for it and I feel like telling them about his bipolar will make them sign him off as crazy and a loon. 

So I guess my question is...how would you explain this to them? His bipolar disorder doesn't stop him from doing everyday things and he is taking medication to help stabilize his moods, but I know that they'll judge him for it."

We didn’t date long at all, only three weeks and then he dumped me over text and wouldn’t even come pick up his stuff. That was over a year ago and I haven’t dated anyone since. I honestly felt like I’ve never got along and vibed so well with someone. I’m not sure why, but I still think about occasionaly. In the past months, the thoughts have definitely slowed down. And then all the sudden I’m starting to get dreams about him again. It’s all weird. It affects my mood as soon as I wake up, has anyone else had this or maybe have an explanation for why all the sudden that’s happening?"

949,Day 1 of my journey,"Today is my first night of trying to improve my mental health. 

Let me give a background to what i have been through.

My earliest memory of parents are of them fighting. They were always on each other's nerves. My entire childhood has gone being scared and and being underconfident ( I am 18 years old now) .

I have developed a very toxic habit of overthinking and stressing and having lots of anxiety.

I  recently read self help books such as ""No more Mr.Nice Guy"" which have instances that are exactly the same ones that I have faced. I have also started my NoFap journey as a way to improve myself.

So I thought as a way to not fail and stick to my goal.. I will post updates about my progress here.

I will post more about myself in a later post, since this is my first ever time I will write about it, i haven't articulated my thoughts yet and also I am not very confident whether I should post stuff online. 

Thank you :)"

951,"About to start a job as a mental health nurse, looking for advice.","Hello all!
In about 3 weeks I will be starting my first nursing job as a mental health nurse in a psychiatric hospital. I would just like to know from those of you that have been in mental health facilities the best way to treat the clients.

What kind of nurses have stood out to you as being the best? How should I interact with the clients in a way that they will be able to trust me?

I've always been interested in mental health and through nursing school the mental health clinicals showed me that mental health and nursing is my passion.

I've dealt with mental health myself as far as addiction and depression, I've managed to recover and I am hoping to help others using my own experiences.

Any advice and personal stories, if you wish to share, would be greatly appreciated. I would like to go in and be the best nurse I can be. Thank you so much!"

953,"Need Advice- Chronic Pain, Looking for a Lifestyle Change/Community to Move To","I'm a 29 year old male. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis and Crohns Disease, which will come as no surprise to those familiar with autoimmune diseases, have greatly limited my ability to work or even maintain friendships. They have also caused years of depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, and even some derealization at particularly low points.

I spent three weeks in July of this year at a clinical residential program for behavioral health. The constant socialization completely stabilized my mood, helped me push through pain when exercising, and motivated me to try new things. I might have been able to handle part-time work if I had been able to continue managing my health/reducing my inflammation/staying motivated.

I NEED a supportive community like that around me again. Otherwise life is not worth it for me. That's not a threat of suicide, its just a fact. I am determined to make a big change in order to get what I need.

I am looking for solutions to this problem. I am not interested in advice to ""join a group"", ""call your friends"", etc. because I have already tried all of that. Those things are good ways to supplement a healthy life, but they are not core solutions. People often overlook the fact they receive the majority of their socialization from work, and that avenue is currently cut off to me.

954,I wish I was empty,"I won’t go into what happened but I’m in a low spot and I feel like if I had no emotional connection to anything I would be just fine 

I’m not some intelligent person either so it doesn’t help with any of the hurt. I have no one to talk to about anything and I just would rather feel nothing than all this hurt

But then again I think everyone feels the same"
955,I don't really know what to call this.,"Ok, I've felt alone for the longest time, but it's never really ""gotten"" To me. I mean I've never been happy about the situation, but I manage. But now it's starting to get to me. It's really odd to me that I'm craving affection someone to tell me ""I love you"". I shouldn't need that, right? I'm a 20 year old guy. I don't like this, in fact I hate it. I feel weak. Hopefully it will pass. But if it doesn't I'll just have to deal with it for as long as I need to."
956,I'm nothing.," 

What do I do when I'm nothing? I don't know who I am anymore. Why is it that everything and everyone I try and help or fix I just end up breaking even more? I don't think I've ever wholly helped anyone. Or anything. And that's all I want out of life. That's truly my whole identity. I remember one time I was walking back from school late one night. There was this old grandpa that had a blank look on his face and seemed like he was lost. I was walking by him when he called me in Hindi and asked me come over. I walked to him and asked him if he was lost and he told me he just didn't know how to get home. So I asked him if he knew his address, he told me and I used gmaps to find his home and tried to give him directions in Hindi. And I don't know why it felt good, but it did. That was nearly 3 years ago and I still remember it so clearly because that's one of the only times I felt like I was needed, like I had an identity. When I helped people. So why do I feel like I'm so alone. Just me and my thoughts. Nothing helps except music. Music's been a constant in my life. Music can change my thoughts and moods so easily. And it seems like it'll be the only one. Connections, experiences, skills. You need these things to form an identity. I don't have any of those. Helping people and music seem to be my only ties to my identity. I don't know if I belong to anyone. Belong anywhere. The funny thing is, deep down, I know I want that. I want to be invisible. That's all I've ever wanted. Just to disappear. Just to vanish. This one dream that I play over and over again in my head is one where I can press this button and just have never existed. Removed myself from everyone and everything I've ever interacted. How many people would be better, how many could I help by never having existed?

Heavy trigger warning: &gt;!suicide and intrusive thoughts.!&lt;  &gt;!I just don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. No purpose. No desire. At all. I don't know what I'm going for anymore. Why do I wear so many masks. Why am I so broken. Why am I just nothing. Everything seems so unreal. Not people, not things, not places. I feel like I'm just completely and uselessly trapped inside my own head. The real me is just hiding away from the world and I feel like I'm continuously on autopilot. I seem to mess everything up. School, college, family, friends. If not those, there's always something wrong. Something I'm doing wrong. And these past few weeks have just been awful. An amalgamation of repeated events that just piled on. I'm so damn suicidal. I just want to vanish. Intrusive thoughts yesterday did not help either. And I feel so useless. Why do I feel so useless? intrusive thoughts part. I was driving yesterday night and I just saw something that triggered a suicide dream I had and it was just an overwhelming amount of numbness. I wanted to turn the wheel and just crash. It was an empty road too. it would have been so easy to just turn the wheel into the woods next to road. If my dad wasn't in the car with me, and I didn't think I could hurt anyone else by crashing. I don't know what would have happened. Maybe my dream would have finally come true.!&lt;"
957,I procrastinated waaay too much,"And of course, instead of actually doing the work that's overdue, I'm just venting about it on the internet because that's what hardworking people do..

But yeah I think I reached this point where there is so much crap to do that I just temporarily ""gave up"" or ""shut down"". Like, I did like one thing but that's about it.

Yeah, I think this whole thing is just a first world problem, and I probably sound entitled saying all this, but I gotta get it out somehow. My mood has just been an up and down for a while now, and now that I'm a down phase WITH this sudden pile of stuff to do, it almost feels like a burning laptop.

""Just do your work"" ""Why didn't you get it done earlier"" ""The phone is probably distracting you a lot""

I mean, those are probably true, I should put away my phone for a while after this, and yeah, I should've just manned up (or womanned up in this case) and give myself the willpower to get shit done BEFORE time starts running out. I actually have been able to do that for the most part. ""You got this girl, c'mon!"" ""Hustle bitch hustle!"" Usually I can pep talk myself into getting it done, even if it's imperfect. But right now, I'm barely getting ONE thing done, and all I feel is a lack of energy and a looot of shame. I feel so pathetic and useless, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people that know me are disappointed at least to some extent; they have good reason to.

Dam, I think I'm self pitying too much, it doesn't feel fair that I'm being upset because of something that's clearly my fault. On that note, I gotta put my grown up pants on and get a move on now that I got this off my chest. Good luck everyone, we got this!"
958,Last night I tried to kill myself but I don’t remember,"Pretty bad. It was my friends birthday yesterday and we were on her boat, me her and two of our friends. We were drinking and they were smoking weed but I wasn’t as I don’t like it. Got to around 11 and I was on my third drink (gin and lemonade) which is not a lot for me as I usually drink quite often (only with friends) and usually much more. I can’t remember anything past 11, I blacked out for around 4/5 hours I believe. Apparently I was staring into space and my friend took me downstairs and I started saying about how time isn’t real and stuff like that ( that’s happened once before after drinking and I also blacked out that). Idk much else of what I did bc I frankly don’t want to know but I was saying how I wanted to jump off the boat and kill myself and I was also apparently trying to get out the window. I ‘woke up’ just before the ambulance people arrived to take me away and I was in hospital for a couple hours before I went home. I feel fine now. I’m probably depressed but I don’t feel suicidal so idk why I did that. Just feel embarrassed and shitty. Does anyone know what could have happened to me? My boyfriend thinks it could be psychosis. I’m calling the mental health people tomorrow to get something"

960,Triggered by parents???,I moved away from my parents two years ago at 19. I’m 21 now. They came up to visit this weekend and I realize how much they stress me out. I think they literally trigger me. I honestly feel like they bring out the negative in me. I don’t know what it is. But I have overwhelming strong feelings towards them. They make me feel “insane”. We got into a huge argument before the left and I just decided that I never want to speak to them again. Has anyone else felt like their parents triggers them?

962,Social media is making you depressed. Here’s some help,"I don’t have the heart to delete all of my social media because it’s toxic to your mental health, so I set some rules. 

I deleted anything that *didn’t bring me joy* which meant deleting my Facebook app as a whole, and unfollowing pages/ people on Instagram that I didn’t care for. I only follow creators that will make me happy. I don’t follow influencers and celebrities who make me feel bitter about my life. I follow so many mental health and self development creators. I certainly **do not** follow any news forums. 

So I’ve compiled a list of my favorite creators/ organizations in hopes that you find what you’re looking for! Forgive me cause I’m on mobile so idk how this is gonna turn out. Note that these are all Instagram pages and require the @ in front of them when searching. 

• we the urban (one word)- affirmations 
• loving me after we (one word)- relationship help, self improvement, therapeutic 
• Rachel Cargle (Rachel.Cargle)- black equality + feminism 
• Sober Girl Society (one word)- sobriety + support/ community 
• The Retired Party Girl (one word)- sobriety, ^^, just enough social issues highlighted 
• letstalk.mentalhealth - mental health + wellness, self care"
963,"I have MPB, but was unaware I had it until recently, do I tell the person that I've been attached to and has been affected greatly by it that I have it?"," I didn't know it was a thing until recently, but when I got diagnosed with it and was asked to think about my past friendships with people to see if the patterns lined up they did, but the most recent person our relationship is very rocky because of it.

They're still nice to me and caring about me and still talk to me even though I have no idea why and I want to be friends with person and they know me inside out, so maybe they already know I have it, I don't know, but should I tell them about it?"
964,Somethings wrong,"Hey, this won’t be the most articulate post ever but I just really wanted to vent about how I feel. 

For my entire life I’ve felt like I can’t really talk to anyone about my feelings. This is my fault as I tend to tout myself as the strong and independent friend that you would come talk to if you are ever having problems. I never talk to my friends about my mental health because I don’t think anyone should have to deal with the burden of knowing how I actually feel and I also just don’t think anyone could help me. I go to a therapist but I always tell her that I’m okay, just like I tell everyone else. No one suspects anything because I’ve learned how to hind my more unsavory emotions within myself. On one hand it makes me feel like no one cares but on the other hand I am self aware enough to know that it is my fault that no one knows how I feel because I’m too scared to tell them but I’ve taught myself to be ashamed of my emotions and to hide them at any cost. I want to be able to talk to my therapist about it but I’m scared of two things. I’m scared that she’ll tell me that there is something wrong with me and I’ll go from being the strong friend to the emotionally dependent one who has depression. I’m also scared that she’ll tell me that everyone feels this way and it’s normal because if that is the case the how do I stop feeling absolutely miserable all the time. At this point I’ve walled myself into my dorm room to be alone because it’s the only thing I know how to do despite the fact that being alone makes me miserable. I guess the fact that no one has really contacted me in many days asking if I’m okay hasn’t really helped. I don’t really know what I’m asking for by posting this. Like I said I just really needed to vent and I suppose I wanted someone to read it if anything goes south on my ends."
965,"Can someone help me with this? So if I vote for Trump does this mean I also support The Proud Boys who are a far-right,neo-fascist, male-only group or If I vote for Biden I support Antifa?

What happened to the independent party?
966,Where to start...,"I’ve been thinking about hurting or killing myself again, with increasing frequency. I guess it started about this time last year, and a lot of it was due to work-related stress. Since then, I started a new medication and a new job and things started to get better, but the thoughts never went away completely. Lately they are increasing and worsening, but it’s been more due to family-related stress and anger. My daughter is so defiant and frustrating. I often have to physically stop myself from hurting myself in the midst of my anger towards her. Which makes me more angry, but towards myself instead. I get the urge to just slam my face into a wall or window or throw myself down the stairs. I literally bite my tongue to keep from screaming at the top of my lungs. I dig my fingernails into my palms to keep from swinging my fists into the nearest object. I know I need more help, but I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve been on meds for like five or six years, a few different kinds. I’ve been in talk therapy for like five years straight also and feel like I gained nothing. Five years of telling two different professionals about the issues in my relationship, the same issues over and over again, and neither of them even slightly hinted at the fact that my husband was being straight up emotionally manipulative and maybe that was unhealthy. I came up with that shit on my own. Go me! But that caused me to lose faith in talk therapy completely. So I’ve been trying to deal with things on my own. My husband started his own course of therapy due to the conclusion I came to about our relationship and it has improved. Now I need help. But I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to find the right treatment. Obviously I don’t think regular therapy is going to help (and I don’t feel like going to a strangers office to bawl my eyes out while wearing a mask, thank you COVID). I don’t like the idea of video visits, I feel like it’s less personal and just have a bad feeling toward video chats in general. I don’t feel like I’m “in a crisis” so I don’t want to call or text the crisis hotline and take someone away from someone who needs it more than me. I don’t feel like I’m “bad enough” to be hospitalized or even go to a residential treatment type facility. I get out of bed and go to work every day, but when I get home I just want to be left alone. I love my husband and daughter. I want to spend time with them. I just can’t stand them most of the time and I hate that. I hate getting so irritated all the time. I hate that I don’t have the energy or desire to play. My family doesn’t deserve this. I just want to be better."
967,Things have been really rough lately. I think I just lost a friend because I have been mentally unhealthy for a while and I have such a negative mindset to this world,"She said that it hurts her to see that I’m destroying myself and that she doesn’t care anymore. Should I apologize? I never responded to her message last night. Last time something like this happened, which was in the beginning of last year, many hurtful things were said to me.

It turns out she was a toxic friend, but after confronting her mid year, tWICE, she (now, this year) is a lot better so we are still friends. But a part of me is still paranoid about these things. I don’t know if I should chase after this person now, because they’re such a good friend but maybe I should leave them be. Maybe they need space. I admit I do vent a lot, but I’ve been journaling more now and talking to my therapist more openly to avoid burdening others.

I don’t want to lose her. But, if it makes her happier...


Maybe I should end up taking medication like my therapist was considering for a psychiatrist...I’m so against it because I’m scared to, but it’s really hard to cope with things right now."

What if I won't be able to get through it?,"I have just started college a couple of days ago and I already feel like I am incapable of taking this new step in developing my life.  I probably have social anxiety (which I still have to get diagnosed) and low self-esteem, depression that stem from it. I compare myself to everybody I see, because this has been a big change for me going from a small town to the capital city of my country where my university is. I see everybody around me...so pretty, confident, not afraid to speak up, having friends. And there I am trembling at the thought that I will have to answer questions from professors and make new friends...oh god, I don't know how I'll do that, I don't even remember how I made my first friends in high school like how???. I feel like I am so boring that I lose all motivation to even speak up.

Everything seems so hard to do.  I want to have friends and laugh and go to parties and meet people and get into a relationship...but how, if I am so afraid? If I get quickly drained in social situations, if I overthink everything I say and do, if I'm just not cool enough?

How will I succeed in developing my career if I will never take chances and involve myself in things and get myself going?

How can I compete? My looks, personality, confidence are not adequate for this world. idk how did you guys survive this?"
970,My exgf called me to talk this morning and told me that she’s in a very abusive relationship. Idk how to feel or what to do,"My exgf and I used to be in a pretty toxic relationship when we were a lot younger, we both sought therapy and have patched things up. We don’t keep in constant contact but will check in on one another from time to time. 

Anyways, she reaches out to me because she knows I won’t judge her and will just listen. 
She tells me that she’s in a relationship with a man who abuses her physically and mentally. Her beats her and threatens her. She’s also having miscarriage because of all the stress. 
He’s currently in jail for crashing her car and fleeing the seen while having a warrant. 


I feel guilty because I don’t know what to do, other than tell her to leave him and get some help. She’s scared of him and It kills me inside. 
She doesn’t deserve this at all, and she’s stuck. She’s scared to do anything about it and doesn’t want anyone getting involved.

I have been through trial and error through the past years trying to come up with possible explanations which took me a long time to finally understand my situation. I am simply just a girl from a toxic neglectful distant working-class family where emotions are not practiced, it doesn't even fucking live here. all fundamental rules and necessities to raise a child had been thrown out the window when I was born. I know I'm not alone but I blame my impressionable years for deceiving me that I am alone, that no one feels what I feel. I suspect I'm a sociopath and I'm an extreme antisocial person, I want friends so bad but IDK how to maintain them. lately, I have been on a mental diet, keeping myself busy with assignments, listening to affirmations (although it seems I'm distant and cold I actually consider myself very spiritual and believe humans can overcome obstacles by reprogramming their mind), and listening podcasts about AI; well because... AI is pretty cool. but today my in denial schizophrenic mom was at it again. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a complete asshole to her, we fight. today she said some fucking comments to me which usually would've set me off, but I bit my tongue bc yesterday my brother and made amends (sorta, we fought a little then talked about the issue, fought a little more, then came to an understand and we both apologized).  and he made me realize like I need to not be so selfish and toxic myself, which I agree. after she made these comments I went to the kitchen to grab some food and she started yelling at me that I always appear around her when she's making food and told me to stop putting something in her food? she speaks another language so I couldn't tell what exactly she claimed I put in her food, but when she said this I was a little surprised, not bc it's the first time; but it was so unexpected. I asked her repeatedly ""what did I put in your food?"" and whatever I just left, sat in my room trying to wrap around what this feeling is, it felt like so invalidating, it felt like i was a ghost living my human life and someone telling me no you've been dead for 3 years u arent here anymore, and then i respond back saying ""but what do u mean i am a human I'm doing x,y,z I've always done x,y,"" like that kind of inavlidation, she lives a very sad tragic hermit life, shes on welfare, has no family or friend connections, I'm mad that she let her life go to shit and crumble before her eyes, I'm mad that she couldnt do any better for herself, I'm mad and i feel like I'm going to fucking break; because i cant tell if i feel pity, anger, sadness or form a new feeling combining all of them, and selling that new feeling to the human psyche and live off my dividends. when she dies I'm not sure what my perspective of her will be because she's a range of emotions and she's not stagnant in an emotional sense. i dont love her but i feel immense pity, would u still consider that loving someone?"

He did some tests online and in all them he matched. When i saw that tests, i also knew he would match because many of those things are so him and his behaviors.

I would add that as a child he was monited, controlled, his mother would not let him do and learn things by himself because she was always terrified something would happen to him. So....
He had suicidal thoughts. He has mood swings, goes from 0 to 100. One day he would die without me, the next day he acts like i dont exist. He has autority problems, if i say please dont do it  - he has to. Has episode of complete numbness almost to the point of just existing or overworks himself at work. Doesent reply to his friends for days because he doesent deserve them so he doesent want to bother them. Or he would go to the extreme to do anything for friends because he feels like they would leave him if he is not around all the time. He was always unhappy with his body, thinking he is ugly/ fat. Many times he asked me how can i be with him. He is very impulsive, he would come up with a tattoo for a day and book the appointment. When he gets angry, he doesent know what he is saying and to who, he becomes so heartless. In arguments, if he is not right, he will punch himself or hit his head against the wall because he hurted me."
974,What is it when your mind focuses so much in a problem to the determent of all else?,"I have had a history of hurts in relationships that make me doubt myself, what I'm seeing and feeling.  

But I cannot let go of it and keep looking for signs.  Proof to validate these emotions or thoughts.  

Which create a negative and heavy emotional toll to myself and those I'm around.  I function but not in any semblance of healthy.  

I cannot focus on much of what I enjoy or that which is good for me that isn't being pushed by the negativity or some illusionary future fantasy such as Success (Ego) revenge.  

Meditation is something I've been trying to do but am find it problematic to shift my focus and feel anything ""Good""."

I have my good days sometimes among a storm of bad days, but holy crap it feels like the good will never be good enough.

976,How can I help a loved one that is experiencing Psychosis but doesn’t accept a diagnosis. HELP,"My family is currently going through a hard time with my younger sister (FM/25) who has suffered with mental health for a long time. She was previously diagnosed with Bipolar 1, but has done nothing to help or acknowledge the illness she has. She’s gone about a year without any major episodes but last week sent our family in a downward spiral that has left us without any options on what to do with her. I’ll elaborate.

She was hospitalized last week on a 72 hour hold (spent the week in a mental health unit) for sending several family members messages/speaking in riddles about different Greek gods, demons, telling others that she was God, a whole bunch of stuff that nobody could really understand, and also appearing at a family friends house later in the morning in what I can only describe as a psychotic state, asking them to help her” find Prometheus”, searching for some kind of Labyrinth, and then jumped to telling them that they had to confess their sins to her because she was God. It was a pretty ugly scene that resulted in her being put on a stretcher in front of the whole neighborhood. 

About a week later she has been released, and she has refused that anyone is allowed to see her medical records, or speak to anyone that is a part of her care plan. She is handling all of her therapy and psychiatry appointments herself, we have no idea if she is going to them, whether or not she will be taking medication that is prescribed to her. The worst part in all of this that she has told us she has PTSD and ADHD and that she was only having a panic attack and that is why she went off the rails. She denies being bipolar, or anything new a psychiatrist may have diagnosed her with in the hospital. I really must add to this, that this is what she has diagnosed herself with. 

The really alarming part here, is that she is still experiencing some kind of manic/psychosis episode because she keeps telling us that she is a “trained medical professional” because she went to nursing school for a year and worked as a Phlebotomist and that she can diagnose herself and the doctors are wrong. She thinks she is like the female version of Elon Musk, and that she is a super genius. During all of this she becomes angry, screams at people, tells us she’s having a panic attack if a certain family walks in the room. Just saying extremely hurtful things to us over nothing. It’s complete chaos here and she has refused any sort of help. What we can we do? We want to help her but she doesn’t want help."

981,Haven't felt myself in a long time.,"Everything I ever wanted in life, I no longer feel the desire to go after it. I no longer have the desire to leave my bed. I no longer have the decide to apply for jobs. I no longer have the decide to go outside. I no longer have the desire to have any relationship with anyone near me. I used to be somewhat happy person surrounded by friends and over the last few years I started losing them. A part of it was my fault. My anxiety was strong enough for me to flake at plans last minute. I also lost some friends because they just changed entirely. As soon as the COVID lockdown started, my life took a sharp turn. I am turning 26 in a month and I am just at a place, I don’t know if I call it sad, I often just don’t feel anything. I will order food to eat, but won’t feel any joy in eating them. I can taste the food, but I can’t seem to appreciate the taste. I haven’t hugged someone in such a long time. There would be time at night I will almost cry because I want to hold someone close intimately, but I can’t. I am 26 and probably the most pathetic person to ever live on the surface. I got laid off from a job and live with my parents. I don’t have the best relationship with my parents and will constantly argue with them. One of my parents I feel like is also depressed because they just do irrational stuff when they get mad and that makes me feel more depressed. I feel like I want to get into a car and just crash into a barrier. I will probably feel pain for a minute or two, but it’s strong enough to just to make sure my organs are harvested for someone else to use and will die kind of peacefully. I have also done some research on how to kill myself without any pain, but also make sure my organs get donated since I am an organ donor. I always struggled with friendships and relationship in nature. The friends that were close to me are now live in a different place, like thousands of kms away. Making new friends almost impossible. Dating never worked for me, so I pretty much gave up on that. I haven’t had a good job in awhile, and all the job I had in the past before the pandemic were shit. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even feel joy watching movies. I also get angry a lot and I just lock myself in the room just to avoid confrontations. I just wish I had someone I don’t know hug me and tell me it’s going to be okay. Or tell them my feelings like share with them. I am looking to see a therapist, but asking for help is so god damn hard. Thank you for listening, I just had to get this off my chest."

I always get the new titles and play them to completion, have fun etc. But as of late, I have no idea what’s wrong with me. No game seems to make me happy anymore. I don’t even enjoy playing them. They all honestly seem like the same thing. All the formulas and gameplay feels like a chore. None of it makes me happy anymore.

I’ve been pushing through it and forcing myself to go out, and talking to my doctor but I just have the most awful feeling of dread and idk what to do"
987,Sudden Changes in behavior,"Hey everyone, I have a couple questions about general mental health and odd behavior. My mom recently got very sick, she was sick for 3 or 4 weeks, sleeping almost all day, barely eating, but wouldn't go to the doctor. We gave her a covid test which came back negative. She's been feeling better and hasent been sleeping all day, but after she was recovering she started doing something really really strange.

One day I got back from work and saw a giant cardboard box blocking the door way to the other side of the living room. I figured my parents just didnt want our two dogs in there because they were cleaning or something. I ask about it, and my mom casually said ""S (our Australian Cattle dog, super hyper and friendly) keeps looking at me."" I thought she was joking so I laughed it off and asked again and she said ""I'm not joking, every day for the past two weeks she just sits by the door and stares at me all day, even when I'm sleeping. Its creepy."" 

Now, I know exactly why S is doing this, school just started so S isnt used to my little sisters not being around her all day. She sits at the door waiting for them to get back. I'm always at work, so my moms the only one she can really interact with.

Every day now my mom blocks the door so S can't look at her. Yesterday S was sitting in the same room as her, and my mom was holding a pillow up infront of her own face just so S couldn't look at her. 

All of this is new, my mom never acted like this around S. She always said she's too hyper, but that was it. Then when she got sick, she suddenly started to hate that sophie was looking at her, or even around her. I know this Is a long post, but I wanted to give a lot of information on it. 

My question is, does it sound like my mom has some kind of mental issue going on? She has really bad anxiety, always has, could that be a cause? We've tried talking to her about it and she just says ""S is creepy"" and leaves it there, if we try to push and ask more questions she gets defensive."
988,Its confusing and scary,"Been to a psychiatrist about two and a half months ago, wasn't sure about a diagnosis, possible Major depression, although was worried about bipolar 2. I was put on citalopram 50mg and 50mg of lamotrigine for about a month and it did absolutely nothing. for the next month was put on sertraline 200mg along with the lamotrigine, this resulted in severe insomnia and the feelings of depression as well as severe anger becoming worse. Now I've been put on 200mg lamotrigine (at 100mg now, titrating up) and 50mg of quetiapine, which has so far made me feel better. Does this actually point to bipolar 2 or can major depression still be justified with this set of medications?"

991,Struggling with unmet expectations/being single/late bloomer,"So I'm 20/F in college and would really like some advice. I've been feeling really depressed because I hate my life as it is. I didn't want to be 20 with no romantic experience (never have been in a relationship) and a fucking virgin, but it just happened to be that way. I used to be ugly, but I got my ""glow up"" (according to people around me that have known me for a long time)

 I feel like such a lame-ass loser for being a fucking child compared to all of my peers who have already had sex and I hate being single. I honestly feel like I've already had enough time by myself and I'm wondering ""When is it my turn?"" I've noticed a trend that only fit/skinny girls have boyfriends and even at 105 pounds I feel like a fucking fat cow. I wish I could starve myself without feeling like I could faint just so I could be good enough to be likable for more than 2 dates and actually attract guys who aren't ugly to me. I genuinely think my standards aren't too high, and I'm not aiming for super fit/buff guys or guys who are top-tier in looks or finances (I'm more into the nerdy type, but even nerds turn me down.) I'm debating spending 300 on a prostitute just to get my virginity over with (I have the finances for that). 

My family and friends say I'm pretty and nice and skinny, but I'm starting to feel like it's complete bullshit. I even have a hard time making friends, how is anybody going to like me in a romantic way? Not to mention that I always get ""friend zoned"" (sorry that sounds super incel-ish to be honest) but I'm always a friend to guys and I'm wondering if I have some awful fatal flaw that people are noticing that I'm not picking up on. 

If I turn 25 without any relationship experience, I am going to go off this earth. I already feel shitty enough. 

I want some happy pills to make this feeling go away. I'm sick of my own bullshit and I wish there was some magic pill that would help me be happy, make me skinny, and make me sexy enough to be good enough for people to like me. I hate myself, I hate being myself, and it's not going to change until I achieve my goals (I'm very much a goal-oriented person and most of my happiness comes from achieving my goals). My passion doesn't even make me happy anymore because I'm so annoyed with having to be by myself."

I hate myself, I hate myself so much that everytime I look in the mirror I just start punching or cutting myself because I dont want to be the thing I see. I feel like my brain is in the wrong body, the body of somewhen I hate everything about. Everyday I start thing less of myself, and less of my future. I don’t really see a future. I don’t hang out with my friends because if I where them I wouldn’t want to hang out with me. I’m a pathetic cringe fucked up creature that serves no purpose in life and the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because my parents spend all this time raising me, I can’t just kill myself that wouldn’t be fair. But life gets more of a struggle everyday and I just want to feel good again. I just want to talk to someone but I can’t. I’m trash talking myself and my future every minute at least 5 times.

995,Off my chest: I got drunk and lied to a friend that I attempted suicide at 16.,"So, to keep things short and bitter, I got really drunk last night and around 7-8 lagers in I started talking to my friend about pretty emotional shit. He spoke about his issues, I spoke about mine, we shared some mutual grievances about life at present etc.

This is not unusual for me and my pal, we've gotten drunk and emotional quite a few times haha. But, I have a nasty habit of lying about things to gain more sympathy. I think this is because I don't want to share any deeper problems at risk of sounding like a wimp so instead I invent fantasies to make my suffering in the past more justified. Or something like that, I don't really know.

My life was kind of ruined at 16 when I developed panic attacks and agoraphobia almost overnight. I was unable to go to school, lost all my friends, and stayed inside most of the day feeling depressed and suicidal. I was on track to going to a top 10 University in my country (England) and studying the subject I've been invested in since early childhood (Environmental Science). That all changed, and to this day I'm still reeling from the effects. 

When I was talking about this, I randomly decided to tell him that (I can't even remember how I brought it up), I walked in front of a Car when I was 16. This was a recurring fantasy when I was that age, if I was going to kill myself, it would've been suicide via vehicle, so I know where the lie emerged from. Even still, I only ever considered suicide, I never attempted it. I didn't have the courage.

So I wake up the next morning with a horrific hangover remembering only that I lied. I threw up, cried a bit out of sheer guilt, and tried to summon the courage to tell him I lied. But, I can't. It'd be too embarrassing. I feel like a twat. Why do I lie? I hate lying. I wish I was secure enough to just talk about my traumas without adding extra shit in to try and seem more pitiful.

I'm still reeling from the guilt of it all. I'll downplay it if he ever brings it up, in hopes that I can just palm it off as an accident or something. I'm never drinking in a dour mood again.

At least he's honest with his life experiences, and I got to hear him out. I just wish I could be as honest and secure."
996,How can I be happy when I’ve been depressed all my adult life?,"I’m only 20, but I’ve had mental health issues since I was 12. Around 12-13 I became deeply depressed, and so suicidal I’m still shocked that I survived trough that. Nobody knew about it because I was deeply ashamed of it and I got over it myself. The next few years I was more or less happy, except that I had periods where I was very «melancholic», but nothing as bad as before. I don’t know if that’s normal? A few years ago the depression started again. I can do basic things like shower unlike the first time, but I’m deeply apathetic and simultanously stressed. I cannot do any homework at all (I’m a uni student, so this is very distressing) and can’t even watch tv shows or do anything that’s fun. I’ve never gone to the doctor, I think I have some issues with trusting them and feeling like a nuisance.

How can I learn to be happy and function normally when I’ve basically been like this since I was a kid? Will I always be like this?"
997,Feelings of calm or Tranquility After Abusive Relationship?,"So it’s been a little over a year since I’ve gotten out of an extremely abusive relationship. I’ve been to therapy, let the relationship go, don’t carry any serious feelings of resentment, and I don’t really get triggered anymore. For a couple of months now, I’ve noticed feelings of extreme calm and lack of anxiety. 

This isn’t a bad thing; I’m not numb or anything. I still feel things. I’m just confused because it’s such a new feeling. The thing is, I’ve always struggled with anxiety disorder. So I figured that once I felt healed from the relationship, I’d go back to that baseline of normal anxiety. Has anyone else felt this in the wake of healing from an abusive relationship?"
998,Why am I sad when everything is so good?,"My life from march - july was awful. I was sad all the time just because I was lonely and scared about the world.

I’ve made some amazing friends, my roommate is awesome, I’m living in one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen, I’m surrounded by like minded people, I like my classes, and I’ve started dating a boy who I really like and who really likes me back. I have everything I wanted and more. But still, I’m sad. I come back from hanging out with my boyfriend and just start to cry. I have a really hard time falling asleep. During the day when I’m by myself I feel shriveled. I even dissociate sometimes. This is all very new to me. I feel like I’ve been a happy kid for most of my life. What’s happening to me?"

I have been severely depressed in 2020 and 2 hospitals for suicidal ideation. I have gone through a lot this year. I had used psychedelics to try and numb the pain but I ended up having a death trip, where I was losing my mind and ended up threatening suicide to nurses at a hospital, first inpatient. Then the upcoming weeks after I was released seemed to get way worse. Neither me or my parents changed so it became a spiraling depression into suicidal tendencies. I have never attempted but had very serious ideations. Any coping skills anyone would like to share as I seek hope for a better and improved life. Thanks, C"
1000,My mum is a narcissistic prick,"She tried to tear me away from my dad in the living hell that was last year. Now it’s all coming back up. 

Nothing much. Just angry."
1001,"I don't know how to help my mum, or how to help myself when she triggers me.","My mum has schizophrenia - I don't know how relevant that is to this, I presume a lot but could be wrong. At the moment, she has no friends and depends on me and my sister (quite often me) for support. I try my best to be there for her. It's tough since I've got my own stressors and worries in life, but I try my best.

But every now and then, she will send me a long email or message out of the blue talking about how I wronged her and asking for an explanation, or apologising for something she'd did in the past (which I usually can't remember, or if I do I haven't been dwelling on it). I've asked her in the past not to send me these apology messages and instead ask me what I think about what happened instead of jumping to the conclusion that I'm angry/upset with her about it all, but she never seems to respect this and apologises for something else a few months later).

The most recent message was about how I didn't even acknowledge a big birthday of hers and didn't even get her a present. She asked why, out of all the birthdays, did I forget that one, when she just wanted to spend time with me and my sister to celebrate?

I replied with what I thought were the reasons and apologised. After a bit of back and forth, she emailed me again and said she couldn't wrap her head around my excuses, and more or less broke them apart and told me why I was wrong.

I didn't really remember what had happened at the time of the big birthday, so I went back a few years in our messages to check if anything had happened at that time. Well, turns out that I'd got sick around her birthday so we postponed her celebrations, but she has said that was completely fine at the time. Then she actually got sick so we postponed it once again.

And as for the present, I had offered to pay for a gardener to come round, then offered to pay for new clothes for her as a joint birthday and Christmas present (because it was a lot of money at the time and I wasn't being paid much). So we went clothes shopping together a couple of months after her birthday when I had the money and I bought her quite a few things.

I told her all this in my reply and included screenshots because she tends to think that I lie to her. I asked her to apologise for accusing me of something I didn't do - that I didn't forget her birthday as she assumed. But the next message was her apologising about something unrelated.

I find this so frustrating because there are genuinely things that upset me about her behaviour, but she doesn't apologise for these things at all and instead apologises for little things that I really couldn't give a damn about.

I'm almost at my wit's end with all this. It makes me so depressed that I have to deal with this on a semi-regular basis. I honestly just don't know what to do about it at this point. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing?

I know she has schizophrenia and it's beyond tough, but I'm not sure where to draw the line. I feel like I can't keep putting my own mental health on the line for this.

She's had therapy in the past (incidentally, just before that big birthday that I allegedly ignored and which my sister and I paid for), but since then she's said that therapy is too emotional and she can't handle it, or that her therapists are never good."

I was studying for a chem test and i didnt feel stressed or anything but then my mom said something funny and i started laughing, laughing turned hysterical and then i started sobbing. i managed to clam myself down after 10 minutes but i still felt weird the whole night, like the smallest thing was going to set me off again.

1004,This is the lowest I've felt since 2018.,"I just had one of the worst days ever. I was taking a first aid course today and the course wasn't accessible. I'm someone with central vision loss and the classroom had the smallest white board I've ever seen as well as the smallest TV. Thank god I had done all the theory online prior to the practical class but I literally felt awful. I couldn't read anything the instructor put on the white board, neither could I see what was going on, on the TV. The worst part though is that it took me so long to grasp certain practical concepts because I couldn't see what the instructor was doing. He would have to come to me often to show me how to do things and I felt stupid and embarrassed around everyone else. I actually cried in class and I hope no one noticed.

I was exhausted during my course as well because I didn't get much sleep the night before. My boyfriend said he wanted a break for his mental health and financial situation but I'm very anxious that after the break is ""over"", that he won't want me back. He strictly said he doesn't want to break up and just wants to better himself for our future together but I can never be sure. I felt so anxious all day that my IBS exploded. I haven't felt this terrible since 2018 when I left my cheating ex who also made fun of my blindness.

1005,Visual hallucinations or floaters?,"So recently I keep seeing things in the corner of my eye, but only for a split second. Things like black spots, shadows and sometimes I could swear I see my bedroom door shut, but I catch it just as it shuts.

I don't take psychodelic drugs. I was diagnosed with BPD in 2017 with schizotypal traits. My brother died of a brain tumor 3 years ago when I was 21 he was 26, so I've been tested for that too. 

I also have body tics, parts of body have tiny spasms that feel like bubbles beneath my skin. Mainly in my face and legs, my doctor put it down to motor tics. So I don't think I'm epileptic. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Think I'm going to get my eyes tested soon to make sure it's not my eyes.

1007,OCD and 666? Advice please!,"For the past couple of months I feel like I have been seeing 666 everywhere. I was raised in a fundamental Baptist Church (I no longer attend church). Growing up, this number was always associated with the Devil, hell, and damnation. I will also point out that I am gay. I fear that God is trying to send me signs that I am living “wrong”. 

For instance, the other day I was watching a YouTube video about religious trauma. This video had 66 views and 6 likes...666. A coupe months back I had watched a video debunking conversion therapy and the video had 667 comments. Well today I went to watch it again and the video now has 666 comments. I was driving yesterday and noticed a road sign with 666 on it. I found this guy on Instagram attractive. I was going to follow him but he had 666 followers. Am I delusional or is god sending me signs? Is this OCD? I feel like these are too specific to be coincidences. 

I fear that this is God sending me signs that I am living wrong in his eyes. Maybe this is my OCD? This is causing me a lot of distress. Any advice in appreciated."

Video games used to give me so much joy and I would always look forward to playing them but now I just get on to just look at my library and I’m bored and don’t feel like playing anymore. Once in a blue moon I’ll have so much fun playing and get a taste of being filled with joy but then it fades away. My friend that I’ve known online for years got a girlfriend in January and just kinda forgot about me. He puts her before me like he should but just doesn’t really talk to me anymore and I feel like the fact that I’m not hanging out with him all the time just makes it not fun anymore. And I also feel like quarantine just completely burnt me out. Now life just seems like an endless cycle of waking up and sleeping. And I talk to my mom about it and she just tells me to “look at all the good things”. I hope someone read this and could tell me something in the replies that’s not just “find a new hobby” or something. Just want some opinions or if someone else is going through or has gone through this.

The process however is taking months and it’s getting harder to cope. Is this just the doctor I’m seeing or does everyone find this to be the case? I wish I could explain to them that waiting another month will be extremely hard to do. It’s as if they don’t understand how debilitating this is and it’s discouraging.
1011,Does this sound like bipolar or just anxiety?,"I’ve suffered from bad anxiety my whole life (I’m currently 24). Would never consider myself depressed. Just overly anxious. Health anxiety. Panic attacks. GAD. A little OCD as well. I went through a really bad run in 2016. Since then, things were going really well. I was functioning normally. Well my dog died last March suddenly and that fucked me up. It took me almost 6 months to pull myself out of that rut. I started doing well again, and then c19 had to come on by, and with all my anxiety history and issues, I’ve been a off and on mess since March. I was coping okay, until July. I started having panic attacks weekly, then daily, then went into a complete spiral of anxiety and due to how bad my depression was affecting me, I become depressed. I seemed to pull myself out of it slowly, it was fucking hard. I was literally staying at my moms everyday for a month because I couldn’t be left alone due to how bad my anxiety was. I had/have a major fear of fainting. Anyway, like I said I slowly was coming out of it. I forced myself to stay home one day, and I did it! And I stayed home. I felt like I was becoming more productive again, still having panic attacks off and on but I could handle them. Only issue I still had/have is bad insomnia every night. I started laughing again. Smiling more. Joking with my husband and having sex with him again. I felt like “I made it through it, I fucking did it”.. then, a few days ago out of nowhere I woke up feeling off. Ever since Friday I’ve been feeling way more anxious again. Basically how I felt at the beginning of my last anxiety break down. I’ve been assessed by many professionals btw. Anyway, i did something stupid and googled and somehow came across bipolar disorder and now I’m obsessed with worrying I have it. Today I was having such intrusive thoughts this morning, I kept saying what if I open the door and jump out of this moving car? What if I like lose my mind and I can’t control it and I just do it? I’ve had intrusive thoughts before but these were so scary.. I don’t know if I’m in the right place and yes I’m aware nobody can diagnose me on here. I just want advice from people and if my experience sounds like it could be bipolar.. or if this sounds more like just bad anxiety and anxiety induced depression. Lack of sleep making me sleep deprived too? I feel extremely emotional as well like I just wanna cry. If you read this, thank you."
1012,Intrusive Thought Influx and Concerns,"TW: Mentions of Violence 

I have been getting a huge influx of intrusive thoughts lately, and I'm not exactly concerned about them, per say, just curious.

They're all incredibly violent, all towards women or my pets, but no one I know in real life. I don't really know why I keep getting these, and I have increased homicidal ideation as well. Its like I mentally want to k\*ll someone, but physically I have no real desire to do so. Though I guess that is the nature of intrusive thoughts.

I read on the internet that intrusive thoughts are relatively normal until you start obsessing over them. I guess my mind is occupied on this topic for most of the day, and earlier I found myself wanting to buy a knife or something, but besides these instances I don't really care about it yk. Like oh death, who cares. Does that count as a concerning obsession?

Any reason why I may be doing this? Do I need to get it checked out?"
1013,I MIGHT DIE. THIS IS PROBABLY A SUICIDE NOTE,"I took pills. Alot of them. I might die in a few minutes or a few hours.
This probably is a suicide note
So, I'm trash. I am Trash.
What do you do to trash? Toss them away.
I will die. I will rot. Like trash. Like nothing.
I am supposed to write things like I'm sorry I'm leaving, sorry I'm dying. Sorry I'm leaving. But I don't feel it. It will hurt for a while probably but it would be worse if I stay.
I look at happy couples, happy people, happy moms and I get jealous, it hurts. Why can't I be stable and provide people that? Half the times i don't even realise the stuff I did until its done.
I might die. I feel dizzy. Is it the crying? Is this the pills?
Did I do this on an impulse? Idk probably.
I've thinking about killing myself alot, especially this week. I didn't think I'd actually do it. I didn't think much before taking the pills though. People think I have Borderline Personality Disorder. Idk about that. I just wish I always knew what I was doing. I WISH i was always aware of my actions. Even the pills, I didn't want to take them on an impulse. I wanted to die but not on an impulse.
I might die."
1014,How do you explain to someone that you’re upset even though you didn’t have a bad day?,"When I’m sad or feel like shit my friend asks me what’s wrong and I can never find the right words that don’t sound odd, how do I explain this to him?"
1015,Death,"It’s the worst month of my life.  Every October. My brother killed himself.  So. Yeah. It’s a hard month. I will never have those that soul in my life again.  My brother, my protector, my soul twin.  Life is so empty now.  I wish I joined him. He was life to me.   And it hurts so much. 
It’s not for me to decide. It just is. 
Grief.  It’s a bitch. And it’s like yesterday. Just needed to say that out loud and you can’t fix it or 
do anything about it. AND that is ok. It’s life. It’s rough. And life hurts."
1016,Idk anymore,"I have been feeling grief, anxiety, low self esteem, and I dont feel like myself I also dispute my achievements as a mistake or dismiss my success, I have parents that do shame me, think I dont have privacy, and my mom promised she would get me mental help but it's been about 4 months and I'm waiting, we have no financial issues and we haven't moved houses in at least 12 years (I'm 15) I also have a history of self harm but it was in 7th or 8th grade and it was over school I would pull my hair out as like a ""punishment"" for not doing well and when we had benchmark for English I got a c and I wanted to jump off a bridge but when I got home I took a pair of scissors and cut my arm. I have attempted suicide only twice but I didnt do it (I'm not sure why) and I would lay on the floor and cry myself to sleep. I need help please"
1017,TikTok is making me realize I might have ADHD or even be on the autism spectrum.,"First off, I am absolutely NOT trying to self-diagnose. I have a history of mental illness and it runs in my family. In the past, I have been diagnosed with a few different things, but my current psychiatrist has me down for seasonal depression and anxiety (my previous psychiatrist was determining whether or not I had BPD before I had to switch doctors, but that’s neither here nor there, I guess).

I’m not very good at pin-pointing things that I deal with in my head on a regular basis, and I’m not good at finding the words to express what I’m feeling or thinking. Various things that I see as “normal” for me are apparently not normal, and I never realize it until someone points it out (in this case, I found my way to ADHD and autism tiktok). I don’t have friends to talk to about these things, and I’m not sure how to bring any of it up with my psychiatrist. 

Mostly, I’m posting this to get it out of my system, even if it ends up going into the abyss. But if anyone has experience with these things, please share it with me."
1018,I Think I Have Depersonalization,"A year ago I have been feeling the symptoms of Depersonalization felt like a robot, things felt unreal etc... What should I do it happens often and it happens a lot but not as bad as it can get."
1019,Having trouble completing basic tasks and don't know what to do,"My depression has me living in slow motion rn. I've had four goals literally for the past month - clean my room, finish a LinkedIn learning course, call my doctor to recommend a therapist, and work on sending out job applications - and I've made zero progress on any of them this whole time. I cannot find the energy or motivation to do anything but go on my phone. I can't seem to fix my sleep schedule either so I'm always tired. Every day is the same."
1020,Unbearable midnight breakdown,I am having mental breakdown right now and it's the middle of the night here. I have access to sedatives. Have taken double my usual dose (which is still safe. Don't worry) but it's not kicking in. I am beyond crying  now. Have spent almost 2 hours on that. Now I am just anxious and scared. No one to call or write to right now. What should I do to make this night at least a little bit more bearable? What do you do to comfort yourself in similar situations? I have a sublocator and I'd like not to wake her up.
1021,"me, showing clear paranoid and delusional symptoms: *needs serious help*","also me who hasn't told anyone about my symptoms and poor mental state: noooo, i'm fine :)"
1022,I dont know what to do,"I am very confused right now. On one side, I am thinking about ending it all, considering my grades ad social status rn, but on the other side, I keep thinking about my future and what wuld happen if I'm gone and what my family and friends are thinking of it. Before you say there is always help, in my circumstance, I tried and it hasn't been much help. Im still on the hesitant side, because I've gained some really close friendships lately. If (by my age) I die, there isn't much left of me to cause an impact. Call me a karma whore all you want, Im just not sure what to do."
1023,Does anyone else know what happened to Gwen?,She last posted yesterday. I haven’t heard anything since. She’s in my thoughts and prayers (although I am not very religious). But I was wondering if anyone has an update.
1024,My anxiety is getting worse I think? TW: Death and paranoia,"I just was wondering if anyone else went through something similar. Or if there was a name to any of this? I have had these symptoms on and off, but they seem like they get worse as my mental health deteriorates. 

In general my social anxiety has gotten worse. Also my feelings towards my body are getting worse as well which makes seeing even people I like difficult. However the next three symptoms just seem so strange to me and I know they aren’t reasonable. 

1.) It has gotten to the point where I feel like people are going to hurt me. Like pull out a gun and just shoot me. I am weary about anyone who knows about my money situation or address. 

2.) I can’t stand to say or hear that something bad could potentially happen. It would be like because I said it/thought it I’m going to make it happen. For example I would never make a joke about getting in a car wreck because then it would speak it into existence. I can barely stand when people tell me to stay safe. That’s like why are you implying something bad will happen. It feels like that will cause it to happen. 

3.) I feel like certain numbers are kind of following me. I know it will sound cliche, but obviously the number 13 is the worst for me. I see I have 13 minutes left on my gps that means that I will get in a car accident. I see it’s 2:13 that means something bad is going to happen etc. 

All these symptoms affect my thoughts and feelings and make me feel unsafe. Besides making sure I don’t say something “bad” I mostly try to live my life as normal as possible. But it’s a mess in my head. I am on Zoloft. Can’t see a therapist right now. Not as much looking for advice, but just wondering if someone has gone through something similar."
1025,Just a bit sad.,"It’s like having an unhealed wound in me that I keep suppressing. Being happy or even trying to fake it has become incredibly difficult. I am sure everyone that I meet can see it right through me that something is wrong with me and I can’t help but be it the way it is. At least I don’t share my problems with anyone around me because no one truly cares and it’s rare to find someone who does. I am extremely sad and lonely and lost and so angry. I hate many aspects of myself. Life is the way it is but I can’t seem to walk in the direction the way life is right now. There are people that I am close to and they can’t empathize me. I wouldn’t like to end this pain because I need to feel it the way it is but I wish I could numb it for a moment or numb my brain and become an ignorant in life. Isn’t that a bliss? I don’t remember when was the last time I laughed so hard it made me cry. I don’t remember having fun. I don’t remember smiling. Because sadness is a taboo. I will not share it with anyone around me. I keep it with myself until it eats me away or vise versa. But right now, tonight, I am sad."
1026,I’m at a crossroads,I’ve been diagnosed with 3-4 different disorders over the past 10 years along with several classes of drug treatments. It all seems like a giant guessing game. What can I do starting today to improve my mental health? I’m trying to clean up my diet and become more active throughout the day but I don’t know what else to do. I can’t hang with friends because my social anxiety is crippling. Meds work but side effects cancel out the benefits. My lab work suggests I have low levels of testosterone so perhaps that’s the answer. There’s no reason I should feel this way and yet here I am. Doctors say my chemicals are unbalanced but they can’t even measure chemicals. SMH
1027,How do I deal with built up anger?,I feel so angry at practically everything including myself. I dont even know how to bring this to my therapist.
1028,Relationship advice,"I have a feeling that my BF is about to break up with me and he has every reason to. I’m not mentally stable and I’m a very stressed out full time student right now. I don’t handle emotional situations well and I often have to take time to process, he says I’m giving him the silent treatment when I do this.

Well, I think he’s hanging on because he knows I get suicidal. How do I let him know it’s okay to leave me and I’ll be okay?"
1029,By the Numbers: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on American Mental Health,"are there any other studies that contradict those in this article? it is basically founded on the last CDC announcement supported by other studies.

Everything is getting blurry, idk"
1031,"what should i do, i don’t know what i’m feeling...","i don’t know what to do. i’m a 15 year old girl still in school, so i can’t just stop everything y’know? i mean i still have to go to school, and continue doing this daily routine. the thing is when i thing about the future it doesn’t make me want to continue. i hold no hope or attachment to it. i really don’t want to live anymore, but that’s where the problem comes in. i don’t necessarily want to die, i just want to disappear. for everything to stop and for time to stand still. i don’t want to do anything, i just want to curl up and sleep all day. i really really really want to disappear, that or for someone to kill me. i don’t think i’d be able to make the decision to kill my self but then again i don’t want to live. it’s confusing. what should i do. should i try to go to therapy? but i just really don’t want to go and have the possibility of them shooting me down and making me feel even more invalidated yknow? i mean i don’t SH, i’ve tried but always chickened out, and i feel like i’ll be taken less seriously bc of that. should i still try to get some help or just wait it out?"
1032,Do I look at my self esteem first or my anxiety?,My anxiety is more intense at the moment and undoes everything else it also is my now default state now. But self esteem caused this or lack thereof. Which do I work on first?
1033,Abuse and mental health,Does anyone think that long term mental and verbal abuse should be reported? It’s been like this for me for yrs know. It’s starting to ware down my mental health throughout the days. I keep getting sent places cause I tried to do something to myself.
1034,Cycles.,"Life is strange. 
I always find hope in one day finding true happiness. Or maybe just true belonging. 
I find hope because my life feels like a cycle. 
Everyday is the same. 
Sometimes though, I feel okay. 
Maybe for a week or so I get excited. 
I feel that maybe I have found peace in my situation. In my sad life.
That I’ll make it on my own. 
It’s all so temporary. 
Hope fades and the sadness returns. It always does. Sometimes I can bear it and sometimes trauma hits you like a truck and suddenly you’re staring endlessly at the ceiling for hours. Thinking. Finding nothing but a blank canvas above you. Nothing. Nothing will change. Nothing will get better. Nothing is what I deserve. I am nothing. Nothing matters. A cycle. 
It’s hard to want to be around people. Knowing I’m too far gone to be myself. Knowing I’m too much and knowing I get exhausted when I come across anyone new. A good conversation doesn’t mean forever. Maybe that’s partially my fault because I stop trying. Anyone who is new would think I’m uninterested but old friends would tell you that I’m just in another funk. They know how I disappear. How I won’t bother them even though I so badly want to. I hate myself for being dependent on others but never reaching out. I’m stuck in my head and I want to get out. I know about my cycles, I know myself but why can’t I do anything about it? I just want to change but I’m tangled in webs of cycles."
1035,Should I starve myself?," I (13M) want to starve myself because I feel fat and my family is going on a trip and I don't want to look fat. Should I starve myself. I'm fully open to alternitaves but i think if I starve myself for the next 3 days, I'll become a little skinnier. I'm not over weight, but I'm not super skinny either. I almost just started crying because I felt really bad."
1036,Why am i unaware,"I dont realize i always over talk or overshare etc everyone always asks me dont you think before you speak? I dont understand why people are mad at me
I dont understand why i react in ways i do anger at even slighest form of rejection i go into hysterics
etc

I dont know what could this possibly even be"
1037,Marriage,Significant other is pretty disrespectful and rude towards me. We have children together an have been married for years. Just started recently being very controlling and obsessive but at the same time has been very different in the way of like they never want to show any kind of love towards me and it’s super frustrating. I suffer from Depression and anxiety and they have some mental health problems too but my problems never seem to be enough to matter to them. Anyone ever experienced this? What do you do? And yes I have talked to them lots of times with nothing gettin any better
1038,I need advice from fellow body dysmorphia sufferers for our college finals,"Hello! For our college finals we were tasked with making a ZINE on a topic near and dear to us.  I chose the headline 'Worth at every size' and it is going to be a zine that gives positive encouragement  towards other BDD sufferers.  

I'd like to stress that i'm not trying to cure or diagnose anyone. I myself know that thats really stupid- it's just an encouragement thing. I want to execute this as tastefully as possible.

1039,How much can a psychiatrist do for depression and anxiety? (US),"Both of these are tearing my life apart, I need to do something about it.  
When I get depressed, I often cannot even do any of my classes; I've had to drop one of my classes because of my depression, and the quality of the work I turn in is terrible. I can't even do anything important without wanting to go back to sleep. I've been taking naps almost 24/7, sleeping 16 hours a day. I couldn't enjoy my birthday because I was depressed.

My bigger problem is my anxiety however. It pushed me to become impatient, angry, etc in simple situations, and both my depression and anxiety have me expecting the worst to happen. For example, I push family members about something, because I get anxious, which causes me to think too much and get scared they will forget or mess it up, which ends up becoming a massive fight. Or I get impatient when my girlfriend is busy, and end up coming up with all these stupid scenarios because of my anxiety, which has affected our relationship. With school, I get anxious even if my teachers do not grade fast enough, or if I even have an assignment at times.  


I want to see a psychiatrist, perhaps so I could be prescribed some type of anti-depressants, or anti-anxiety medications, however I have never trusted them, and believe they are not helpful, so I have not been to one in so long. I am also scared of people seeing me as inferior if I were to go to one. I am afraid of being seen as mentally unstable or such. I have suicidal thoughts almost all the time but I am scared of it forcing me to be committed to some mental institution. 

  
My question is, how much can they do? How much can I tell them without being forcibly committed? How much can they help me? What do I tell them?"
1040,I'm having trouble with thinking I've done 'enough',"I watched Schindler's list the other night and in one of the scenes he says ""I could've done more"" and this really resonated with me. 

I'm always described as overly generous with my money, time etc but I always get incredibly sad over thinking that I've not done enough. I go over situations where I think I could've made someone happier or been more impactful if I had just gave more time or bought them something else etc.

Is this a common thing? I'd really appreciate speaking to anyone who can relate or share advice."
1041,Had my first breakdown in 2 years and now I'm filled with guilt,"I am diagnosed bipolar and maintain a full time job, relationship and home. I have had control or my mental health for years and am extremely proud of how far I have come after a suicide attempt 8 years ago.

Yesterday I woke up feeling off but just ignored it, I should have known to take it easy and take some anti anxiety meds. My house was messy and I just lost my mind and completely disassociated and ended up punching a wall, which resulted in me having a fractured hand.

I'm so disappointed in myself and honestly I just feel so overwhelmed by the fact I may not have as much control over my mental health as I thought. I just want to cry and I feel like the weak 16 year old I was 8 years ago. 

This is just a reminder that no matter how much you think you can control your mental health, you still need to be aware of those triggers and pay attention to what your head tells you.

Be proud of yourself and love yourself for how far you have come even when you slip back into old and toxic habits."
1042,I’d rather end a friendship on bad terms than “good” ones,"It sucks so much that I know they’re out there, somewhere, thinking about me like I do them, and still not reaching out. It sucks that we could still be talking every day like nothing happened. It sucks that I hate myself because I don’t know what I did wrong. Most importantly, it sucks that I still love and care about them and I keep trying to make contact. If I was upset with them this would be easier to deal with, now I’m just confused and trying to understand why exactly we had to end things if we both cared for each other. God I want to go back"
1043,I don’t know how to make friends anymore.,"I (28f) haven’t had a close friend for over three years now. Even then, I’m not even sure how good a friend they were. Everyone always seems to leave me and because of that, I actively try not to become close to anyone in fear that they won’t be around for long. Recently I quit my toxic job and I assumed that a few of those coworkers would keep in touch, but it seems that they truly weren’t my friends, but only the illusion of friends. In this crazy time in the world, I guess I overestimated my ability to be happy by myself. I’m alone and lonely."
1044,I feel hollow.,"The pandemic has bled me dry financially. I'm overloaded with the pressure to do well academically. My oldest friend is flaunting her relationship with a boy she knew I liked and who liked me, for a while at least. I'm terrified of what the future might hold, for me and for the world.
I can't fucking do this anymore."
1045,Everyone’s losing it but no really I’m losing it,"I just need a safe space of sorts to say almost everything in my life that I thought was stable is falling apart, I’m under constant stress at work and home, everyone’s like “HAHA MAMA NEEDS WINE” “HAHA MAMA IS HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN” and it’s NOT. FUCKING. FUNNY."
1046,Hoping there is someone out there I can talk to,"Ive had a rough couple months with my depression and anxiety , and as a result my girlfriend left me and wont give me any explanation. Anyway im looking to find hope. I've always struggled and i need to face my problems. How can I build self esteem and confidence even a little bit to get me started?i think it plays a large part in my problems  I feel like im going to be alone with no friends or love life forever and my ability to find a job out of my comfort zone is greatly affected.  It is seriously discouraging and results in having no motivation."
1047,Cant even sleep anymore,Sleeping was my favourite thing before cos I could be away from this shitty world for a bit. I didn’t even mind having nightmares which I often did cos at least it wouldn’t be real. Now I just feel so shitty I can’t even sleep. I feel like I have no one to talk to and I’m just withering away. I’m scared to go to sleep cos I don’t want to relive what happened last night (see last post). My hearts been racing non stop all day. I’m just so sick of all of this
1048,Feeling like a different person,"Hi, so I’ve had this feeling that I’m a whole different person, just with the same memory’s and stuff, not really sure why I feel like this, it just feels like I’m someone else, does anyone else feel like this? any thoughts on this?"
1049,How do I stop disrespecting my mom,"My mom is not a great human being, loves to shout / scream, curse, inflict verbal abuse towards people when stressed but she’s also nice.  I’m learning her habits, since I’m very close to her and she’s the only person I hang out with and now I’m using what I learnt from her against her, only ten times worse.  I get very angry easily and I take it out on her.  Before, I would’ve been beaten to death but now since I’m an adult, I no longer fear her at all, but that’s the problem.  I’m very awful, I also start cursing her directly to her face sometimes when I’m angry and I act in a way that disrespects her.  How do I stop disrespecting my mom? I get very angry easily!"
1050,my girlfriend tried to kill herself today,"My girlfriend has bipolar disorder, and she’s been in a depressive episode for awhile but it’s been getting worse the past week or so. she’s been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and she’s tried to cut herself a few times; i’ve stopped her for the most part. but today she tried to overdose on her prescription meds. thankfully i was there and was able to grab it out of her hand and she only took 2. then she went to try and cut herself and i had to grab the knife from her but her arm still started bleeding. I told her I needed to take her to the hospital and she agreed to go. this would be her second time being hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I’ve been in contact with her therapist so she’s been guiding me on what to do to some degree. But I’ve never dealt with anything like this before and I have no idea what the process will be like. I’m currently in the ER waiting room, they took her back but I wasn’t able to go with because of COVID. Can anyone that’s been to a psychiatry hospital or had a loved one go tell me in detail what the process will be like? Will I be able to visit and how often etc. She also has an ESA puppy and she was wanting to bring him with her but I’m not sure if they’ll allow it, even though he’s an emotional support animal? Any info would be much appreciated!"
1051,Do you ever feel like your pain isn’t as valid because you’re not diagnosed?,I feel like some people act like they’re better because they’re diagnosed. I can’t afford a diagnosis.
1052,don’t really understand my brain anymore and tired,"Throwaway. 
I used to have extreme manic depression when I was younger. The depression was so low and the manic was crazy and impulsive. And now as I’m older I’m experiencing a different type of something. Not even sure what it is anymore. I’m just tired all the time, I have no motivation, I feel like my brain is just off. When I was younger when I’d get depressed I would actually do things like write, work harder in school. Now I just feel so unmotivated and can’t even do my job properly. I’ve been in a constant state of anxiety recently and thinking really irrational things (like I made plans with friends and backed out and lied to them and then I freaked out and cried to my bf because I didn’t want to be a liar, or if I do something like something bad really happen) I’m not sure what to do. I’ve seen therapists all my life and I just recently saw one and he was terrible. I don’t know what I am anymore I don’t even want to say it’s depression but it’s just like I have this brain block and I can’t even write simple emails for work."
1053,Has anyone here called into work or skipped school or another event because of anxiety or depression or another mental health issue?,"I (M, 21) don't know about you guys/gals. But there are times when I have intentionally skipped school because I was depressed.

I remember back in high school in 10th grade a time when I was super depressed. I had a mental breakdown the night before and my mom had to end up calming me down. I didn't feel mentally well enough to go to school and I'd only be excused from school if my parent called in, which my mom did.

I feel it's less acceptable to miss school because of mental health compared to something like calling in sick because of mental health issues or you just need a mental break, which has somewhat become more or less acceptable.

I had 4 jobs (all temporary seasonal jobs, not counting the one I have now), and other than the one I have now, I've never called in sick to work. Neither because of physical or mental health issues.

But I have called in to the job I currently have numerous times (I've been there 1½ years now). Probably because they're more flexible and my managers are pretty chill and understanding. I've called in both because I was sick and because I was depressed. I never told them I was depressed, but whenever I would call in, I'd simply tell them I'm not feeling well then it'd be all good.

But I think it's getting harder to call in depressed because of Covid-19 since they're probably gonna have to ask you questions on whether you have symptoms. 

I've also missed opportunities to go to social gatherings and events because of my depression and anxiety. I lost all my friends in high school and that's where my depression and anxiety started. I never really had any friends and that social anxiety was the reason I chose not to go to high school graduation or convocation.

I missed my summer and winter parties at work due to social anxiety last year. Whenever I get invited to social gatherings, these negative thoughts always come to my mind and trigger my anxiety. I'd almost end up crying just thinking about those events and how much fun I would have had or how much of a fool would I have made myself. 

I missed multiple opportunities to go out and network and meet other people as well."
1054,I dont know if anything around me is real anymore.,"I dont know if the people I see around me are actually real. Are the things around me even real? I have to make sure they are. If I push someone, will they react like how I expect them to react? If I try to break apart the display case at the store, will it actually break apart like I expect it to? Of I jump off the roof of my house, will it hurt like everyone tells me it hurts. Do the people around me feel the same pain as me? If they tell me that putting my hand in boiling water will burn and likely scar me, will it actually happen? I've never experienced that before, so how do I know that will happen unless I try it?

I'm not sure if the buildings around are real or if they're owned by real people. Is everything just my hallucination or is it some sick type of Truman Show type deal. That can't be it. There's nothing special about me. I dont know if anyone on reddit is even real. All the replies I'm getting, are they from real people? How can I be sure you are real? I've never met you. 

If I cut my arm with a knife, will it hurt? Everyone tells me it hurts. Will it hurt for me? I've never done it before. How can I be so sure? How can I be sure unless I try it? How can I be sure anything around me is real? If I die, will everything just disappear? I won't be alive and conscious to perceive anything. I dont understand."
1055,Anybody know what the fucks going on??,"Im at a point where ive lost all motivation and just cheated the last 2 yeard of school, i have no passions and i don't study or eat and i never do anything even if i say i want to. am i just lazy?? its not like im happy when i fuck ofv and do nothing"
1056,Is This Relationship OCD?,"Hi, so my girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months and recently we hit pretty rough patch. After some self-reflection and research, she feels like she has OCD.

She talks about how she feels that if she doesn't do certain stuff correctly that bad events will happen from it. For example, if she doesn't shower a certain way, or put food in the fridge a specific way, her mind tells her that we're going to break up. She also goes into cycles of asking herself ""Do I really love him as much as he loves me?"" or ""How can he say he loves me so much if I don't have anything to give?"". Is this mindset possibly arising from undiagnosed OCD that she may have?"
1057,Need help for my brother,"I (33F) need some advice to help my brother (35M). When he was about 15 years old he fell through an unfinished house and hit his head on some concrete. He had a seizure after this. Ever since then, he has had psychosis symptoms. First it started out as paranoia and hallucinations. My family had been trying to get him to a psychiatrist for years, but it finally happened after a crisis happened one day when he hit my dad in 2009. Since then, he has been on different antipsychotics, most recently I think he has been on Latuda plus lithium. He has a co-occurring disorder where he also has some addictive behaviors, mainly to marijuana but also has recently been abusing ketamine which was prescribed to him for ""depression"". My brother has lived with my dad during all this time, except for 2 years when he was on his own (with my dad's financial help) and working full time while he was on clonazepam. He said he had to stop taking clonazepam because it was causing him memory loss, and therefore could no longer work and had to move back in with my dad. I've been trying to get my brother on disability since the first time he was admitted to a psych hospital back in 2009, but his psychiatrist at the time said he would not diagnose him with schizophrenia, only psychosis, because he was on marijuana, which can also cause psychosis. 

My brother has been unable to work for several years due to mental health issues. He can't take care of himself. My father has been caring for him. For the past month, my brother has been showing signs of grandiose delusions (thinking he is a prophet and can predict the future), hearing voices, getting on facebook making tons of really long, illogical posts, and telling everyone he is ""kind of a big deal"", that people should listen to him. He has been showing signs of mania as well. He has been sending several long, illogical messages to his old friends and some family members, to the point where they had to block him to get him to stop, and messaged me asking if he needed help. I even got to the point where I had to block him as well (which I've never had to do before). 

I told my dad he needs to go to the psychiatrist and get his medication adjusted. I told my dad that my brother has all the symptoms of schizophrenia, and that he needs to get the proper help. My dad wants me to say that he is bipolar because of the stigma of schizophrenia. My dad has been in denial about how sick my brother is for a long time. He keeps thinking if they try a new treatment that he will get better and be able to function and get a job. He doesn't want to ""give up on him"" and say that he has schizophrenia so he can get on disability. My dad is a jail minister, and he is Christian. He believes in speaking in tongues and prophecy. He is playing into my brother's delusions in some ways, making it worse. My brother feels validated that he is not delusional because my dad and some of the people involved in his ministry think my brother has been touched by God in some way. My brother has gotten onto facebook and found people around the world to believe that he is a minister. 

My dad and brother got into an altercation last weekend where my brother kept pestering my dad until he reacted badly and ""threw"" him on his bed. My brother called the police, and they showed up and put my dad into handcuffs. They didn't end up charging him with anything. My brother told my mom at one point that he felt like he had to get my dad to hurt him. My brother has Medicaid. What he really needs is to go to a long-term inpatient psych treatment facility to get stabilized on the proper medication, but he won't voluntarily do this. I don't know where to go from here. I feel like it's not a good situation anymore for my brother to be living with my dad. I don't want my brother to end up homeless. I want him to get the help he needs, but my dad won't make him do it. He won't give him the ultimatum of getting help or getting out, because he doesn't want my brother to end up homeless. Has anybody gone through the process of getting somebody declared mentally incompetent? Is there any way to get my brother to go into a treatment facility before he becomes a threat of harm to self or others? I love my brother and want him to get better, but I just don't know where to go from here.  I also feel like my dad needs a break from caring for him before the stress takes a serious toll on his health."
1058,The pain won’t go away.,"I feel awful. I feel guilt. I feel regret. I wish I were someone else. I wish I weren’t a failure. I’ve caused myself so much pain. I’ve made bad choices and mistakes. I feel like an awful person. I don’t really see much ahead of me. I’m not suicidal, nor have I ever practiced self harm. But I’ve been having more and more thoughts about ending my life. Not seriously. Maybe it’s just seeking attention. I don’t know. But like my sibling is now worried I’ll end up like their friends sibling. Everyone’s worried for me. But I don’t deserve their concern. I am haunted. I can’t escape. I’m going to therapy for over a year now. What do I do."
1059,How common is it to finally be able to get help when you don't really need it anymore?,"Scenario:

You have overcome your illnesses and are managing. You get well enough to start a new whatever. This new thing brings in new issues. The issues trigger your illnesses. Unfortunately you are also now in a new country/place. Here the mental health department is not well funded, psychologists don't need licenses to operate, some are reputed to bring faith into their sessions and you couldn't afford it all anyway (pandemic + you've made the decision to cut off from family finances). 

You know that all you need to do is get a grip again, but you don't exactly know how. Its trial and error and you hope things and time just fall into place. Things get overwhelming. You need help. You push through waiting and hoping to find it somewhere somehow. 

Finally, by the time you can get it (in my past experience) you don't even need it anymore cause you got a handle on things. Your finances are in place but so is your ability to resolve those issues. You think you still want to see a therapist but you don't know what to say. You don't know how worth the money is seeing someone for something that isn't happening anymore. So you don't and this whole ride starts up again later on in some other way.

I'm actually still in the middle of the ride, but just wanted to write anyway to see if I'll get any insightful input."
1060,Teenage years randomly feeling crap for no reason?,"Hi guys, I’m turning 16 in 10 days and I skate almost all day everyday to keep myself busy because if I don’t I lay in my room all day and usually overthink a lot of things. Today is a rest day because I’m so tired and sore. But I always feel like crap when I’m at home sitting in my own thoughts. I never talk to anyone and my phsych has been so busy so I haven’t seen her in months, I don’t talk to my friends about anything because it’s unfair to put my problems on them. I’ll write the rest in the comments"
1061,How can I feel depressed again?,"Before anyone says that this is unhealthy and that I should strive for happiness please listen first. The reason I want to be depressed is not for attention or to feel bad for myself, I just want everything to make sense again. As of right now, I cant understand what I feel, i dont know if the laughter i have is just me thinking it's appropriate for the situation, or if I'm genuinely happy. I'm in this sort of half numbness, where I can still feel emotions, but they dont make sense or feel real. Back when I was depressed, everything was clear, I only felt a couple of different emotions. And though hating myself and wanting to die was horrible, I almost found a sense of comfort in knowing exactly what I'm feeling."

1063,Does someone's death hurt less or more when you haven't talked to that person for a year or more?,"Does someone's death hurt less or more when you haven't talked to that person for a year or more? Does it hurt less when that person pushed you away &amp; you haven't seen that person for a while?

Why does it hurt more if it hurts more?"
1064,My dad died last week and I'm having trouble talking to anyone,"My (21f) dad died last week. He was in the hospital for a few days prior and while he was unconscious it was still horrible to see his breathing grow labored. He would make these horrible choking sounds and sometimes his eyes would open like he was looking straight at me even though he was still unconscious. It was horrible and incredibly traumatic. But for some reason I'm completely numb to it. It should be the worst week of my life but I'm able to go about my day fairly regularly. The only thing is I'm getting tons of messages from friends, family, professors at college checking up on me and thinking about answering any of them makes me physically sick. I need to answer them because they keep piling up and I think people are concerned about me but every time I open my texts or Messenger I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack. What should i do about this?"
1065,"Old memories just make me want to kill myself, anyone else?","I will literally just think of something I did or said, and I just cringe soooo badly. Like it won't even be anything crazy, it's normally just  something obnoxious I said or something like 10 years ago. I'm sure people don't even remember the things I've said or done. 

It's never anything like mean or anything it's just all dumb stuff in the grand scheme. I can't escape the memories and I don't even know what else to do anymore, they literally make me want to kill myself to make them stop. I used to physically shake my head to make the thoughts stop until people started pointing it out, so now I just resist the urge.

It's just so hard when the thoughts take over, I just don't know what else to do. Anyone else deal with these types of thoughts and know of a way to relieve them?"
1066,I couldn't control my anger while dealing with a friend that had just been abused and now I think I made it worse.,"Hey guys. I'm a big dude (6ft1, 130kg, boxer/powerlifter). My friend showed up last night with a broken nose because her boyfriend hit her. I did try very hard to be rational and supportive, I just let her talk and listened to her...

But as her face continued to swell and she showed me pics of his abuse and stories of sexual abuse, I became enraged.

She fell asleep so I messaged the dude, called him, drove over to his house and banged on his door. I threatened to murder him and screamed at him, he ran and hid. I said I'd attack him on sight if I saw him in public and then I went to the police about the whole ordeal (they know me and didn't think my threats where an issue as the dude refused to speak to them)

I know I've probably made her situation worse but she just like showed up at my door knowing my history with abusers (I've knocked out a few abusive dudes over the years) and I really don't know what she expected me to do... 

I just feel very frustrated and I'm sad she's no longer my friend.

Tldr: heavyweight boxer threatens to kill wife basher, feels bad about it."
1067,What does it mean when I have symptoms of trauma but never experienced it?,"I have never gone through any experiences that qualify as traumatic but I deal with a lot of the symptoms of trauma. Mostly I get very nervous when people are angry/violent/yelling, I dissociate, and I over apologize when I don’t need to. It’s starting to affect my life a lot. 

I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression as well as ADHD, but I don’t think those would explain my symptoms."
1068,Someone told me to get over this on a different subreddit...,"Before I tell you what my dilemma is, I must let the reader know that they do not have to agree with me, I just yearn understanding. First of all, I'm a Christian boy, I live in a Christian home, and my morals are Christian, even regarding homosexual intimacy and lusts, which is regarded as sin, and therefore I honor God's word and regard it (the action and pride, not the emotions and temptations itself) as sin. If the reader is gay/bi/pan/trans, please understand that I am not against you in any personal level, I wish goodwill and blessing to all, and I firmly believe that sexual orientation is a matter of condition, a gay person can become straight as well as a straight person can become gay. It has happened to numerous people I know.

My dilemma begins with a girl I've come to care about deeply (I'll refer to her as simply her), and her deeply towards me. I've welcomed her into our church, and she has invited her brother. My initial stress is that she feels welcome and doesn't get offended by anything (primarily our position on homosexuality). I've never talked to her about it, though she probably knows that the action of such intimacy itself is essentially sin. I haven't really worried about it until more recently when, under a few hints such as her mildly celebrating Pride month, I asked, and she confirmed that she was bi. This didn't bother me too much initially, sure she's bi, I thought, as long as she doesn't *do* that kind of thing. My worry though, is how I will have to tell her that affirmation for the celebration of this sin isn't okay. You have to understand how I feel; an organization such as Pride revolves around lustful desire, and it perversely displays itself. I've seen, in a clip from a Pride parade, men and women lewdly dancing in their underwear, waving banters and shouting, and even children were present. I found footage of this parade from the front a Pride page she frequently interacts with. I don't want her to go through the affliction of regretted lust, the way I have (I must confess that I have a history with pornography, it has stunted my mental health and trust in others.)

My stress upon the situation has risen, and in numerous cases she seems uncooperative when I try to talk to her about the Bible. I'm stressing, with every bone in my body, to make her feel as welcome as possible and not attempt to figuratively shove the Bible down her throat. I encourage her to speak out to me if she has any concerns. This has stressed me enough to lead me into coping mechanisms such as self-harm.  I love her dearly, and I want to have an honest conversation to help tackle this together and understand each other, but I'm scared. I'm scared she'll get offended, I'm scared she'll leave. I've called out to God for help, to no avail. I've asked people I'm close to, and they told me to either be honest right away or to wait until she feels at home with the church. I've asked r/Christianity, and they told me to get over it and that I may not even love her. I do love her dearly, and I fantasize a wholesome marriage between us someday. I'm typing this out while frequently looking at the marks on my wrists I just bit into from stress. Because of my previously mentioned afflictions, my imagination takes me places I hate to go. I've pictured break-ups, cheating, suicide, and even homicide more times than I can count. 

If you are to comment, I beg you to be considerate, and please don't give me your opinion on homosexuality, chances are, I already know your opinion. I just want another soul to talk to, without the shame of tainting my identity, and please don't make me regret spilling out my emotions."

1070,Children Mental Health,"This is hilarious, they keep making Scapegoats and golden children go face their MS13 slavers and the kids are just a bonus to the pedophiles with satellites and dox every last detail offshore that gets ignored just to see them melt and kick them out. They lie on those porn sites, there is no revenge. It's just Pedophiles and incest freaks get to kill a baby with verbal abuse and finally cancel culture from the grooming."
1071,I haven't felt ANY positive feelings for the last 5 years,"Hi. I know the title might sound a bit of an exaggeration to some, and you wouldn't believe how much I wish it was all a lie, but my emptiness is starting to kill me both mentally and physically. Believe me, I'm not making this up. 

I have not felt excited, happy, surprised, or even thrilled about something for about 5 years now. At first I thought it was a phase, but I couldn't be more wrong. As a child I had created my own sort of fantasy world in my head and almost everything around me felt magical or at the very least interesting. I grew up and in my early teens I still had the ability to get excited about things. I can still remember what a nice feeling excitement is. It's a great feeling. Happiness as well... At around the time I was 15-16, I started noticing that I was becoming empty on the inside. My everyday life began feeling more and more like an act. I slowly started to forget what positive energy felt like. 

I thought it was cool at first because people around me appeared to be attracted by that emptiness. It was almost as if they found my almost robotic acting more fascinating than my real character. However, after a year or so I realised that I was incapable of feeling even the bare minimum amount of excitement. Since then, I've done some insanely cool things. Things that I know any rational person would get excited for. I mean the people around me get excited FOR me. I miss feeling genuinely happy or excited. No matter what I try, I never do. 

After 2 years I decided to start goin to psychologists and psychiatrists. I was prescribed antidepressants 2 different times. I stopped both times after a few months because simply nothing changed for the better. I know many ppl will insist that it is depression, and it might be, but could it be something else? 

I'm desperate. I'm watching the days go by and I'm standing still. I can't even feel the most basic human emotions. I would do anything to feel these things again... I really would... Please, if you have any idea what might be happening to me, help me out in the comments below. I'd be forever grateful."
1072,My (24M) girlfriend (24F) is having a depressive episode and I don't know how to help her,"My (24M) girlfriend (24F) has depression and has been somewhat open about it since the beginning of our relationship. She would get little episodes here and there, but it was never that big of deal. She often just wanted to be left alone for a couple of days and then she would call when she was feeling better. I tried to be there for her, but she just wanted to be left alone and I gave her her space while and I respected that. Well, flash forward to now, and we're living together in a one bedroom apartment. Another episode comes up and she won't get out of bed. I tried helping her again, then I gave her some space for a few days, but it just doesn't go away. We're going on a week and a half now where she won't get out of bed, won't eat, won't shower, won't do her part around the apartment.

I try suggesting things and making things like accomplishments and goals like ""by the time I get home from work, could you please put the chips back in the cabinet and plug your laptop in"". But it doesn't work. I try helping her shower and change and that doesn't help either. She just get mad at me and starts crying. And its frustrating because she won't allow me to help her but she won't help herself either. I tried calling her parents, but they live out of state and won't fly back here ""just to take care of their overdramatic daughter"". I tried contacting her friends too, but they said to just give her a few days. The thing is, it HAS been a few days and it's starting to get concerning.

Beyond hygiene, I'm worried about her physical health too. Because she won't eat, she's losing weight that she really can't afford to lose. She got out of bed to use the bathroom yesterday and passed out. I wanted to take her to the clinic to make sure all was well, but she didn't want me too. Today, she stayed in bed all day at the expense of literally peeing her pants and laying in it for an hour this evening until I came to check on her and noticed the smell. Then it was a whole other issue to make her take a bath.

I don't know how to help her anymore. She was on medication, but I can't force her to take them even though I really try. I tried calling her psychologist office, but he's out of town until next Wednesday. I really don't know what to do here. I don't want to take her to the hospital because I know she would hate me for it, but it's starting to seem like my only option because I don't know how to handle this on my own."
1073,I feel like I'll never make it.,"I'm 18 and a senior in high school and I feel I've already squandered away the chance at my ideal life, I've made sub-par and awful grades my whole school career including high school, I've made no progress in the pursuit of a career in music and I haven't even applied to a college or anything yet. To me, life feels almost meaningless, toiling everyday for nothing, I get out of bed only to go to school and for what? My grades aren't going to get much better before I graduate and I won't get any kind of scholarship from my grades, I know that I'll be stuck with student debt if I go to college. I seem to have short term feelings and long term feelings, sure my night is going fine, but the future seems like it isn't worth living for, I'm sick of having to wake up, I'm sick of being a burden on people and I'm sick of living every day knowing that I'm only going to be a disappointment to those around me if I'm not already. I've barely even been making music recently and it serves as my number one escape, recently I've just been laying down mindlessly watching YouTube and such, and anything I have made I've just completely dismissed it as garbage. I just have to say that if I knew that life would be this difficult to live through I would have opted out, and I know I'm only 18 how hard can life be? well it's pretty hard to do even the most basic things when you don't even want to be alive, doing my chores are a struggle, it's like my body physically hurts just doing my basic chores, as if I'm physically sick of it as well as mentally. I really disappointed myself a while back as well by cutting myself, I never was a frequent cutter but when I get really pissed, stressed or numb I'll slice my thighs up bad, and I hated myself for doing it because I know how bad it is to do. For years I've felt my existence as pointless, aimless, and pathetic. I know I need help, but a therapist would just have me reduced to an incoherent, sobbing mess. I've tried to talk about my problems, my many problems, but I always feel guilty, as if I shouldn't, at least when I type it doesn't hurt so much."
1074,I need help,"Long story short my SO has been dealing with depression for awhile. Recently it’s gotten much much worse due to life stresses, job, etc. I want to get him help but I don’t want to cross any boundaries or do anything he doesn’t want me to do. I don’t know how to help and when It was brought up he told me “how can you help when you’re the predominant cause of it” and “the only reason you care now is because it effects you”. I care about him obviously. I don’t know when to bring things to his attention. I saw him getting bad but I felt if I said anything it would make it worse.

1075,Alone all the time,"I’m just venting but advice or anything would be really appreciated. So I moved in with my ex fiancé across the country during covid, but he did some bad stuff so I had to break it off, I ended up moving alone a state over where I know nobody. I’m currently unemployed and looking, so I spend all of my time alone inside because of covid. I’ll FaceTime people occasionally, but I don’t feel comfortable making new friends in this city with covid happening. I barely leave the house and have spent months without talking to anyone face to face. I don’t hate being alone, but I’m starting to feel so isolated and kind of scared to do stuff. I’m so used to having someone with me all the time, and in this new city some guy attacked me on the train so I’ve been even less likely to go outside now.

1076,"Brother has severe anger issues, help?","I (17f) am really worried about my little brother (13m). He is completely unable to control his emotions, and the littlest things send him flying off the handle. He screams, cries, punches, kicks, slams doors, etc. He’s still little but it is scary to be around him when he is raging, and when he grows bigger he is probably going to hurt somebody. My parents refuse to take him to therapy, my dad doesnt think there is a problem and my mom blames me and my other brother (15m) for his emotional issues. My parents are the type to just ignore the problem until its too late, and i have already begged them to get him help. The other night he literally sleep walked and punched around his room. I know very little about anger issues so if anybody could enlighten me i would appreciate it, and if anybody has any advice for getting through to him/my parents i would love that too.

TLDR: my little brother has severe anger issues and it is becoming dangerous, what do i do?"
1077,I feel lost and life is passing me by... What can I do?,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I feel like people here might understand... 

I’m 25M, I graduated from college a few years ago, and I’ve basically been living at home since then. I went through college and did really well academically. But besides my GPA and diploma, I didn’t come out with much (no job lined up or history of internships during college). I’ve had the luxury/curse of having my mom’s support, at least financially. So for the past few years, I’ve just been sitting on my hands, making no progress towards anything, at all.

I’ve never had an actual job. And it’s not exactly because I lack desirability. I just haven’t applied much. In the past few years till now I’ve thought a lot about what the hell exactly I want to do in life. No answers. I deal with major depression, so that’s been a huge weight on me (and I’m now working on it). But I think the bigger problem here is that, although I see a lot of things I’m interested in, I don’t see anything I actually want to pursue. For example, I’ll get interested in the work consultants and portfolio managers do, but then I’ll think more about it and realize it goes against what I envision for myself. I’ll just be a cog in a wheel that churns out money for people who don’t need it. I feel like I would make good money but feel like I’ve betrayed myself... so I drop the idea. As another example, I see myself possibly working in a NGO which promotes a cause I actually care about like poverty. But then the job that’s available to me is something like a social media manager or fundraiser associate. Sure, the cause is good, but the work is something that would make me feel like a slick bastard buttering people up and playing politics. And you might say I should maybe go to graduate school so I can get a position I’d actually like, like researcher at a NGO. But the thing is, I need to have the passion for that kind of work to pursue it and make it through the years it takes to finish graduate school. I’ve never felt that passion post-graduation.

I feel like I can’t do work that has no meaning to me, that doesn’t “purpose” written all over it. I realize that I have a lot of options open to me. It comes down to me picking one. But that’s what I’m stuck on. I kind of want to pick all of them and none of them... I know I’m extremely picky, in so many aspects of my life. And I so wish I wasn’t.

I’m sorry for the long post, I just wanted people to understand exactly what I’m struggling with. I’m wondering, for anyone who’s had these struggles similar to mine, 
Did you find something that gave you a feeling of purpose in life, something you work hard on because it’s important to you personally? How’d you find it?
If you never found that, what did it take for you to go on with your life and stop being static?

Thank you for reading... hoping I can start living because I’m just here watching it all go by and I’m starting to feel invisible. Thanks."
1078,People shutting me out because of my mental health.,Lately in my life I’ve been trying to find the courage to open to my friends about my diagnosis but most seem  to be looking at me different. Some have been accepting and extremely kind but most seem to have a different opinion of me. Makes me not want to tell anyone I meet or anyone I work with and just makes things tough for me on days when I feel everything around me going wrong. The one person I want a response from won’t even acknowledge me. Everything is making me feel like I’m living my worst fear people won’t accept me for trying to be myself.
1079,How do I gain confidence like permanently?,"I lack the confidence to tell off people who walk all over me bc I'm perpetually always afraid of getting in trouble,  weather it at work or with my family. I want to know how to gain confidence permanently."
1080,I feel so insignificant,"From time to time, I get these urges to do something that will shock and upset my loved ones. Actually, I wouldn't classify them as ""urges"" so much as obsessive ideas. Mostly, these thoughts center around harming myself or suicide. I don't want to commit suicide, though I used to be deeply suicidal and almost went through with plans to kill myself, but I was stopped by this fear that I would traumatize those close to me. That idea scared me so much, that I could take my own life and my pain would be over, but even to people who I'm not important to, it could leave this psychological scar that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.

I feel like it might be kind of narcissistic to think that way, maybe. I fear it might be a sign of an inflated ego to think that if I ended my life, it would traumatize people *so much*. What if people grieved for, like, 3 months, and then went on with their lives, occasionally thinking of me but then going ""oh, how sad"" and then continuing with their day? I don't think that's an inconceivable idea.

The kind of thoughts I have that center around this theme are, of course, suicide, but they're also things like ghosting my family by running away from home or signing myself into the psych ward, as a way to shock them. I think my family would be shocked if I signed myself into the psych ward, but this type of fantasy really revolves around them suddenly losing the illusion of my stability, and being forced to reckon with the idea that all might not be the way it seems. I also have thoughts that center around me sending a ""goodbye"" message to my friends and my boyfriend, to make them think that I was going to kill myself. The idea of them suddenly feeling their stomach drop when reading that, makes me feel like I am something. Like I'm not just a powerless young woman who just has to deal with her mental health problems, like someone who makes others feel profound and scary emotions. I think that's what it is.

Another thing I fantasize about sometimes, is having a manic episode and fully losing control of everything, and destroying all my personal relationships with impulsive decision-making. I think it's really not something people expect from me, and it would be a way to spite them. It would be awful, I know it would ruin my life. But the idea that I could break free from this menial existence and just scare the hell out of everyone is so, so appealing to my mentally ill brain.

In reality, I never want to do these things. They are just scenarios i fantasize about when i get upset, and they make me regain a sense of significance. I really don't understand myself.

I hope I'm not the only one."
1081,am i depressed or no?,"im a young teenager who lives in asia.

im pretty moody and i cry yet im happy. but i cry more. ive had awkward moments and i keep degrading myself as well. i feel nobody wants me, and that they wld feel better w/o me. 

am i depressed? or not?"
1082,"""Intrusive thoughts"" but not OCD? How do I combat this?","**TW for violent and/or sexual intrusive thoughts**

~~Putting the trigger warning there just to be safe~~

Ah, this is gonna be a long one. I'm sorry. I'm not sure if I'm having a panic attack right now? But I'm currently in a very bad mindset, so with that in mind I do apologize if I misunderstand something and this is an inappropriate subreddit for this type of post. If need be I will delete it when I'm able (I'm about to, hopefully, get some sleep, so it'll be a few hours if that's the case)

I'm honestly just trying to figure something out right now. I'm not really looking for anyone to diagnose me, but I'm just kind of confused and feel scared tbh

So, I'm not diagnosed with OCD, and I don't think that I have it, but I DO experience ""intrusive thoughts"" from time to time? Like, while I'm driving I'll think, I could drive off the side of the road. I could break this object that means a lot to me and/or is really expensive. Most of the time, though, they're sexual, and disgust me and disturb me immensely. They're sexual in extremely inappropriate and immoral ways that I'd rather not disclose, but it's stuff that makes anyone sick to their stomach. They're illegal and immoral and disgusting and I never want to do those things. But I think about them. And I can't control it. I just had some particularly awful ones a minute ago, and it sucked

And, I have these thoughts, but don't perform any compulsions to rid my mind of them. I just distract myself until they go away, for the most part

Now, for reference/additional context, I also have ""compulsions,"" but I don't do them to rid myself of any bad thoughts. Like, I pump the soap a certain number of times. I have to push buttons a certain number of times. If I spin/turn around in one direction, I have to do the same in the opposite direction. If I brush against something, I have to brush against it a certain number of times. I have to eat a certain number of chips or cookies or whatever. I have to chew in a certain number of bites. My thoughts (by that I mean, the voice in my head) plays out like a broken record, getting ""stuck"" on phrases or sounds or words or whatever, until it's ready to let them go (sometimes this happens with reading too). What I've mentioned are only off the top of my head, I have more I either don't recall or don't know how to explain effectively. But I don't do any of them to rid myself or combat any thoughts. If anything, I feel like these ""compulsions"" could be related to undiagnosed autism or adhd, but I have yet to confirm that (I've heard that people with autism and/or adhd experience ""compulsions"" or ticks like this? If I recall correctly)

But the ""intrusive thoughts"" I currently have are giving me a lot of anxiety because I feel like I can't trust myself. It feels like my control is slipping from me, only the teenist fraction of a bit, but I'm worried that one day control will slip completely from my fingers and I'll do something awful and be revealed to be the horrible person I am. Part of me is extremely confident that I'll manage to keep my control, but another part of me is terrified of losing it. I know that people often say ""just tell yourself that they're just thoughts"" but part of it feels too real for me to believe that with this. I'm scared and I'm worried and I feel like I really can't trust myself

Has anyone else had this? Does anyone know how I can control this? Or manage it, at the very least?"
1083,Any clue what I have or what I could do?,Recently I have wanted to stab people and kill people a lot I have been going insane stabbing things left and right and laughing very randomly and crazily (I also smile when doing it) I run around with knives and just be crazy with them I have also been getting voices in my head and have been hallucinating the voices tell me to kill and sometimes they scream idk what’s happening any thoughts?

1085,Lead dust is driving me insane (Contamination OCD),"I worked in construction for a few months in the last year before my contamination ocd really kicked into gear. I quit because of my ocd. I wasnt a labourer but I was around the construction all day and spent a lot time in the site trailer which was absolutely filthy. 

As my contamination ocd has gotten worse and worse I started researching possible contaminates. I came across lead dust and it has sent me into a spiral. I remembered I would come home everyday from work with my clothes covered in dirt/dust and just carelessly walk around my house spreading the contamination. Sometimes I would'nt even shower and essentially never washed my jeans. 

My mind has been spiralling out of control telling me everything's contaminated with lead dust. My car, my bed, my couches, my sheets, my clothes, my carpets, my shoes, my washing machine, my floors, my kitchen, my dressers and so on and so on. I washed my sheets but my mind still tells me theres lead dust on them. I'm too afraid to clean my car because the dust will go airborne and I'll breath it in. I also don't want to create a bunch compulsions and safety behaviours by cleaning everything. I want to fight my ocd and not give into cleaning compulsions. Even when I clean things my mind tells me the dust is till there anyway. 

I regret everyday that I went into the construction industry. I should of known better. Now I have this ghost haunting me wherever i go in the form of invisible lead dust. Its driving me insane. I cry everyday thinking about how I'm risking permanently damaging my brain everytime I go near a contaminated area. It doesn't make a lot of sense and I'm aware of that. I've spent too much time researching lead and the effects. Small amounts can have pretty adverse effects and damaging my brain is my number one fear. Lead can stay in the bones for decades and in the brain for years. My mind tells me everyday that I fucked up and should of known better.

I dont feel comfortable anywhere in my house or my car. Everywhere I go my brain screams at me that I'm doing brain damage. It's been living hell and I dont know what to do. It's so hard to tell if its even real. My mind is obsessed with particles that might or might not be there. Everytime I wake up in the morning my brain tells me I shouldn't have slept in that bed and I'm going to regret it the rest of my life. 

I'm living in mental agony and I cant even encapsulate it all in this post. I'm just mustering up the courage to be able to sleep in my lead contaminated bed tonight. My mind tells me I fucked up my life and future and that I'll never be able to escape this lead dust contamination. It will follow me everywhere. I've been in therapy for almost 3 months and it's done nothing. Everyday it just gets worse and worse. More and more weight added to me back with no where to escape or run. I don't know what to do."
1086,HELP!!! Confused and scared,"Been to a psychiatrist about two and a half months ago, wasn't sure about a diagnosis, possible Major depression, although was worried about bipolar 2. I was put on citalopram 50mg and 50mg of lamotrigine for about a month and it did absolutely nothing. for the next month was put on sertraline 200mg along with the lamotrigine, this resulted in severe insomnia and the feelings of depression as well as severe anger becoming worse. Now I've been put on 200mg lamotrigine (at 100mg now, titrating up) and 50mg of quetiapine, which has so far made me feel better. Does this actually point to bipolar 2 or can major depression still be justified with this set of medications?"
1087,Why is my girlfriend's sister like this? I would like to shed some light on this issue because my girlfriend and I are very concerned for her sister.,"&amp;#x200B;

Her sister has recently been having crazy attitude issues. At the age of 11 this would be very common if they weren't on and off on a very inconsistent basis. On top of that, she is also babied by her mother while my girlfriend gets the worst of it. She has never been seriously punished and is a very snobby girl. Also, it has recently come to light that she has attachment issues with her friends to the point where her friends are scared of her. To make a long story short, she was copying her pansexual friend ie. trying to get the same haircut, adopting a similar attitude, etc. On top of that, she is a super sensitive person and doesn't take the friendliest of criticism lightly. An example would be of a picture of her wearing a certain mask being shown at a family gathering. She would run into the bathroom weeping with her mom in trail. When her mom tried to calm her down, she made a scene in the restaurant where the family gathering was. Another issue, which is by far the most important and frightening of all, is that she seems to act depressed at a very severe level. An example would be of her collecting hoodie strings and showing my girlfriend how she would hang herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what we do know, is that she definitely was raised in a very laid back and almost unattentive manner. Also we believe she has been exposed to social media at a very young age which may be the crux of the issues. We also know that she has not been deprived of friends or family during COVID. She regularly hangs out with the few friends she has.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all issues that are very concerning to my girlfriend and I and when she brings it up to her mom she is told she doesn't have a right to tell her how to raise her child. If someone could please shed some light on the origin of these issues and what steps could be taken to avoid, at worst, (god forbid) her taking her own life in the not so distant future.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"
1088,I keep daydreaming my family dies so I finally have a good excuse and more motivation to kill myself. What the fuck is wrong with my head?,"I love my family, and would be fucked if something were to happen. But I long for the feeling that people just accept it. “Yup I wouldn’t even blame them if they killed themselves.” I just want a reason/motivation because I know it would fuck people up if I did."
1089,Should I be concerned if I fantasize about killing people? How do I remedy bad thoughts like this?,"In my life I rarely seize the opportunity to release my anger and frustration. I was raised in a somewhat strict household. I never voice my own opinions because I know I'll be shot down and it'll just make me look like a bitch. In a sense I let people walk all over me without saying anything. Not being able to convey my emotions makes it very easy to resent someone. Sometimes I take all signs of disrespect equally. If I get taken advantage, used, insulted, violated or demeaned in any faucet of life I despise that person with all my being. I'm not proud of myself for not being able to forgive people. I'm even ashamed that I can't be a better person about it.

I obsess over taking revenge or getting even. I record everyone's name and information on my personal shit list, if the opportunity ever arises for me to do so. I usually won't go through with it, but sometimes I will vandalize or sabotage things if I am confident I won't get caught. I've gone so far as to steal and forge mail, ruin people's transportation and schedules, disrespect property, and lie a lot. Little stuff. I get off on it, but I do feel bad about some of the things I've done. On the other side it never exactly qualms my anger.

Sometimes I fantasize about killing people. Never really anyone I know though, except for one person. I see and hear about disgusting, abusive people in all walks of life. I think to myself, if someone had the guts to take them out, they could never hurt anyone again. Sometimes I daydream about killing these people with handguns, poisons, and meticulously rigged traps. Sometimes I want to set fire to people's houses, or just jump them with a baseball bat and break their limbs. Only people I perceive as dangerous that have no desire to change. Sometimes I think taking out someone who's really hurt you, the people you care about, or the innocent and helpless would be worth every year in prison. I read the news and watch crime dramas and documentaries and my blood is easily riled. I feel bad for the victims and I always imagine what it would be like if they planned out and murdered their tormentor before they could do any fatal damage

Sometimes these fantasies make me feel powerful. I never feel like it would be the right thing to do. I can't even kill anything larger than a spider and even when I kill those I feel bad. I feel lots of remorse for some of the things I've done and said. At the time they felt so right. I'm disappointed and sometimes even afraid of the person I am today. I want to change and I don't know how. I'm filled with a lot of rage and misery, that I can rarely let out. How do block out these negative thoughts? Is it worth reaching out to a professional to talk about?"
1090,I have no clue what’s wrong with me (graphic),"Hey Reddit, not sure if this is common or even real but, sometimes when I lie on my stomach I have the most excruciating imaginary pain imaginable. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like there’s knives inside my stomach thrashing around and I know it’s not real but it feels very real. Another one is when I’m chewing sometimes it feels like my teeth have crumbled and feels like I’m chewing them. Smoking weed only made these thing increase tenfold. Whenever these happen it’s accompanied by extreme anxiety, does anyone have any clue what this is?"
1091,I've hit a wall and I feel like all the progress I've made is slipping away,"This year I've made a lot of progress in my mental health. I am now 9 months sober from alcohol and recently stopped smoking weed which was a big issue for me for a  long time. I've been talking to a therapist for a few months and taking medication for ADHD, which I did not know I had, and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

But something is now causing me to feel very lost and hopeless about the future. My therapist brought up the possibility I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I have a session tomorrow to see if I officially meet the criteria. And I know you're not supposed to self-diagnose but I have been reading up on it a lot and the more I read, the more I'm certain that I am Borderline.

&amp;#x200B;

This is causing me a great deal of stress because according to what I'm reading, this seems like a life sentence. Now it feels like things will never truly be peaceful or stable in my life. I guess my thought process until now was that if I keep working hard on my mental health, I can put the majority of my issues behind me and be a happier more productive person. But now it just feels like I will always just be actively managing the problem and it will never actually go away or become less intrusive. And then I start to think that putting the work in is pointless, and if I'm always going to be miserable I might as well just give up and get used to it. I know that's not a productive course of action, but it's so hard to motivate when it feels like my goals are impossible.

I guess I'm wondering if anybody here dealing with BPD or similar issues has any advice on how to cope with these thoughts, or what I can do to better my outlook. Thank you for reading."
1092,i don’t know what to do,"i feel like my life is just constantly getting worse and worse. every time something good happens, something even worse follows after. i’m either extremely depressed and lifeless or anxious and scared. i overthink everything, and it’s ruining my life. i feel like i have no self worth. i’ll never be good enough for anyone, and i’m never enough to be someone’s first choice. they’re all prettier than me. skinnier than me. more outgoing, more fun, more...lively? i’m scared to be happy because every time i am, something terrible happens and feeling like you’re on top of the world to feeling completely empty and worthless is the worst. i feel so alone. i have nowhere to go. the one person that made me feel safe and happy has no more interest in me. i can’t tell my family anything because they’ll compare my problems to someone else and tell me i’m being over dramatic. i would tell my friends, but i’m never able to be vulnerable because i’m afraid i’m being annoying. i hate myself. i hate myself so much. i need help but i have nowhere to go."
1093,Med Switch Depression,"I have bipolar disorder and my psychiatrist just switched my meds. I’m finally weaned off my old meds but my doctor said it could take up to a month for the new ones to start working. I’m unbelievably depressed. It’s not too bad when I’m really busy (even still) but i obviously can’t be busy all the time. 

Any tips? I can’t even remember the last time I was this miserable. I feel like I’m drowning."
1094,I'm stuck in a hole and don't know what to do,I've been stuck for a few months and I just can't get out. to be more specific it's to do with my passion. I'm 17 and I've been trying to pursue my dream but lately I'm unable to make any music or anything. I will sit there for hours and still can not come up with anything. What should I do?
1095,What are suicidal thoughts?,"I don't get thoughts or feeling that I should die or I want to kill myself; I however have this feeling that it would be awesome if somehow I stopped existing anymore... Again, I don't feel like I will hang myself or something but the thought of me not existing feels... nice... 

Am I suicidal or just a loser thinking of an easier way out?"
1096,Update,"So a few people habe read my posts i guess and know what my ex has been gling through and what happened. So yesterday i found out that he wants to marry his nee girl. I also found out through his sister, bc she likes me, that she hates his new girlfriend bc she is even more depressed and has even more problems. She told me that she is scared that he will do something bc she told him to and tbh i am too. Yeah i don‘t really care if he comes back or anything i just want him to be happy bc i do still love him a bit, i mean he was my first love and the first person that made me feel good. But i‘m also a bit scared for him. Our relationship went downhill the moment he started seeing her. So once a few months back he was with ne but his mind was with her bc she was trying to end her life. So i drove him there bc he wanted to be there for here and i understood that. After that he felt really bad but she wasn‘t there for him, he told me, so i told him to broke off contact bc she‘s not good for his mental health. Apparently he didn‘t do that, welp. And since then our relationship has gone down hill, just like his mental health. But the part that i still don‘t understand is when he started seeing her. He said since february and later he said march, even later he said a month ago. In february/march we still tried to rescue the relationship and he was still his old self so i just guess that he was confused and still is tbh. He wants to marry her after 8 months of relationship, where at sometimes he was still with me. Idk his sister is very worried bc she says she‘s not good for him and i don‘t think she‘s good for him. Again i don‘t want him back, not a romantical partner, a friend yes bc he is a great guy if you take the cheating and lying out of things. His sister also told me that he‘s been also lying to his family, not just me and his stepmom said that started the moment he started seeing her. When we were together he made music and went out almost everyday. With her from what i heard they are just in her apartment and do nothing all day. I‘m like a bit worried that they made some kond of pact to kill themselves after they get married.
It‘s not my place to tell him all that, especially bc he doesn‘t care i think but i‘m a little worried that she will kinda like suck him dry and then leave him. I told his sister she should talk to him and tell their family but i don‘t know if she does that. Idk maybe i‘m overreacting and he really loves her but i don‘t believe that tbh, everything he did and didn‘t do just shows me that he‘s just with her so he feels normal, he like wants to rescue her even tho he can‘t.
It‘s not my place but i think if noone does something then she will tell him to do something."
1097,"I have no reason to feel anxious, but I do?","Every few weeks I find myself feeling anxious, it’ll get triggered by something super minor, like an email that’s slightly curt, or a just a request for some information. Nothing that would normally cause me to even bat an eye.

But sometimes it triggers anxiety that’ll leave me feeling anxious for days. And it’s more of the physical sensation of anxiety like in my chest rather than actual thoughts.

I have a pretty high stress lifestyle (consultant) but I normally cope very well, could I be bottling emotions up? Are they just all coming out at once?

Or is it something else? Does anyone have any solutions?  

CBD helps take the edge off, but not always."
1098,Can memory loss be a coping mechanism?,"I have really bad memory, i can only really remember things “vividly” if they were 3 days ago max. I have forgotten my entire childhood, although im still a teen so like 12 years old and below, and im now almost 15. Idk if im overreacting but i cant remember anything specific about family or friends for very long. But for some reason i can memorize everything in school easily. Idk if this is trauma of some kind or just a straight up illness but it gets depressing not remembering anything about anyone you know."
1099,Complicated,"Hey everyone, I have ADHD and I feel like it has gotten so bad to a point that I cant even remember what i did today. I cannot go to a psychiatrist or anything for a few reasons so thats not an option. I was diagnosed a few years ago when i was living in a country where medical records arent transferred to the u.s so I can't get ritalin which is what i used to take either. Is there anyway I can make this better for myself on my own?"
1100,Not having real emotions,"So, my empathy is very very low, i have to fake emotions to fit whatever scenario im in, and im either aromantic or i also dont love anyone. So i have textbook narcissistic parents, invalidating everything you say to them, “im the parent your the child” etc.. and i think they might’ve messed me up pretty bad. As i said i fake emotions to fit the scenario so for example i get a gift, i have to fake excitement. If someone is hurting or sad i literally could care less but i still help them with it ofc, but it makes me feel terrible for not caring. And its extremely hard for me to love someone. The only person i think i love is my little sister but that might be because i was forced to take care of her for quite a while and still do sometimes so shes like my own child. Im just wondering if this happens to others or something because it makes me so sad that i cant experience emotions and such like others. Any thoughts would be awesome, thanks"
1101,I don't know if I have PTSD or not.,"Hello. This is not my main account, but just created to make sure it doesn't trace back to me (that's what I hope)

Forgive me if I've offended anyone with this post as it is not (and never) my intention to cause any harm or being ignorant, I'm still learning. I might delete this later on.

I have social anxiety and have been seeing a psychologist as well as a psychiatrist just this year. Before that I didn't ever thought I could have it, I just thought that I'm just 'reclusive' and 'shy'.

In 2014, I went on this vacation trip (13 hours flight away) with my extended family (cousins and their mothers) (without my own close family). I was younger, and didn't think that anything would go bad as I was fairly close with a couple of my cousins at that time. But things do go south as just early on in the trip my cousins turn cold towards me just because I slept in. (Or that's what I thought, there's no closure to this situation). Naturally, my other cousins turn cold as well and would make remarks when their mothers asked them about me. Throughout the rest of the trip I was just desperately wanting to go home and been tearing up and crying in the washroom a lot (they didn't notice I was crying and thought that I caught a cold because it was around 0 degrees Celsius at that time). I felt so alone and helpless in a foreign land and there's still 2-3 weeks left on this trip. I was cheated of 25 Pounds for a mediocre phone case as well.

Fast forward to 2019, last year, I know I should've learnt my lesson but I went on a vacation trip again lasting almost 3 weeks, but this time it was with my two long-time friends. I thought that it would be fun to go on a trip with them as we've gotten closer that year (The 2014 trip didn't even came into my mind then). Just 2 days in and I can tell they were annoyed by me. Though, again, I'm not sure of the exact reasons but in my guessing I suppose it's because of personality differences and probably my restriction of eating beef causes inconvenience to them. One of the two would just talk to the other and tell the other things while I just stood at the side. She would also only ask the other for advices on clothing and what not. Whenever we were shopping, the two of them would go together as well while I went to browse alone. When I followed after them after picking what I wanted to buy, one would tell me to go pay first. I did reflect on my actions and tried to offer help in carrying things as they've helped me with my luggage quite a lot but they refused my help. I'm somehow fluent in the language of the country we went to, but they depend on google translate instead. There's also other instances but I'm not going to go into that much details. I felt left out and alone, tired and inferior, cried a lot and many times held back my tears and naturally the desperation of wanting to go home came rather quickly and the memories of that 2014 trip came into my mind a lot. I started seeing a lot of similarities between the two trips. 2 female cousins and 2 female friends. Got cheated of my money as well. I blamed myself for making such poor decisions. 

After returning from that trip, I actively avoided them. I guess they could tell as they asked me about it in a group chat. They don't understand why I'm like this and avoiding them and I didn't tell them what the problem is as well. I know I am at fault for not giving them a closure. One day, a few months after this 2019 trip, I applied to take a break from school as I couldn't get myself to go to school anymore and received the help I need. (I guess this is unrelated as we're not from the same school) (I have a number of school worries as well and social anxiety doesn't just stem from the trip but I suppose it does contribute in building up) 

I'm going off topic but the other day I've seen a post on Instagram concerning PTSD. The definition it gave is that it is 'an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events'. It also says that 'any situation that a person finds traumatic can cause PTSD', and gave examples like serious road accidents, violent personal assaults, and serious health problems. As compared to what I've experienced, my situation didn't seem that bad to me, so I don't know if this can be classified as PTSD or whether I should bring this up to the psychologist that has been seeing me or if it would be helpful or redundant to even bring this up. (not that I know how to bring up this topic anyway) 

Sorry if there's any typos or if it's unclear, I'll try my best to clarify and thank you in advance for the replies!"
1102,How can I make boundaries and stop allowing my family to get to me.,"I hope Reddit community can help me or at least assist in guiding me. I’ll vent a little(because I have no one to vent to) I want to apologize in advance for the essay. 

A few years back, I was helping my cousin move, along with some of my siblings and her husband. In the process of moving, I ended up alone with my cousins husband in the new apartment while the rest of the people were in the old apartment still bringing stuff. I was in the bathroom putting their toiletries away when my brother in law followed me into the bathroom and inappropriately touched me. I brushed it off the first time but he did it a second time. I told him to stop and to leave me alone. Once he left I was very shook and started crying, my little sister found me, I told her what happened and I told her to promise me not to say anything to anyone, she promised she wouldn’t and that was that. 

Since then, I’ve forgiven him what what he’s done, but I kept distance and I’ve been only visiting my cousin when her husband was away and when we were all together in the same space I was polite and just went with the flow of the family dynamic. 

A day ago,  my cousin and my sister were drinking together, several glasses of wine later, my sister slipped and told her what had happened. 

My cousin and her sisters Called me and asked me if what my sister said was true, at first I was hesitant and denied, but my cousin assured me that family comes first and I could tell her anything and that she would always protect me because were “blood” 

Finally, told them what had happened. They asked me why I kept it to myself all these years and all I could think of was the fact that I didn’t want to break her marriage and I had already forgiven him so I chose to free myself from that baggage. 

Then my cousin and her sisters continued to call her husband innocent and shifted the blame on me, and even went as far as to say I “lead him on” 

This summer, my other cousin and I moved together to a new state, but now decided that she wants nothing to do with me because I tarnished the “reputation” of her brother in law and said she no longer wants us to live together. (I totally didn’t expect this from her because she was once also assaulted, so I thought she of all people would understand my dilemma) 

They also decided they no longer wanted to be associated with my sister because she knew all these years and chose to keep it as a secret, and were now blame us for breaking the family apart. 

Another reason why I chose to keep the incident to myself was because I knew this would be the reaction. 

Right now, I feel really hurt and misunderstood, but I also realize that I need to forgive everyone so I don’t carry this baggage around for the rest of my life. One of my least favorite qualities about myself is that I forgive too fast and too easily and sometimes my family members use that against me. The same said family members have repeatedly hurt me in other situations and I’ve constantly been bullied by them and their hurtful words against me. 

Yet, I continue to forgive and help when they’re in need. Sometimes it hurts me and right now I’m hurting really badly, and even though I choose to forgive them, I no longer want them in my life because they keep stabbing at my wounds and I really need to heal. 

How can I build and maintain healthy boundaries? How do I detach emotionally? 
Because unfortunately, I still worry about them and care for their well being (Like right now I’m worried about my cousin and if her relationship with her husband is holding up, I’m worried about my nieces and nephews and how this my affect their future) 
But no one cares about me, no one cares about my well-being. 

It hurts because sometimes you realize the people that surround you aren’t capable of loving you as much as much as you love them or care for them. And most encounters are just hurtful and damages your emotional and mental well-being. I’m tired of giving love when I don’t receive love. But I don’t think I’m capable to hating because I hate the way I feel when I try to hold grudges. 

Right now, I don’t know what to do, I didn’t give a reaction to my family yet, because I want to be calm and grounded when I respond, but I realize I may have to take steps to start separating myself from some family members for my mental and emotional well-being. 

If anyone can give tips on how to do that I would greatly appreciate that."
1103,idk anymore,"i've been working for almost 1 &amp; 1/2 year now. Too much family debt to pay off. I know everything will be over in the future but sometimes it just feels a little more heavier each day and it's painful even just to breathe. I know I needed to go to therapy but with my salary, I can barely afford to have a proper meal. I just don't know... what to do anymore... I don't know how long I can keep up with this."
1104,Dissociating?,"Almost exactly a year ago I started taking off brand lexapro for anxiety and depression. About 6 months later I began having odd “episodes” where I become very energetic and talk a lot and say odd things and it usually lasts until I go to sleep. When I wake up I have little to no memory of the experience and only know it happens because my boyfriend tells me my symptoms, saying that during these episodes I describe it as feeling like I’m high or in a dream. At some points it gets to where I genuinely question if it’s a dream. Shortly after it happened I saw a therapist and she diagnosed me with attenuated pyscosis disorder. Before she could decide how to help me overcome this I had to see a neurologist to make sure what was going on wasn’t a neurological problem. After seeing the neurologist, I was informed that I have temporal love seizures. However, these seizures are supposed to last for two minutes at maximum, but mine last for hours and once, two days. I was prescribed offbrand keppra to stop my seizures, but I still have the same episodes I did before, and I believe that I definitely have those seizures sometimes but I think my episodes are different since they shouldn’t last for hours. I just hoped someone could give me some guess as to what might be going on with me?"
1105,I’m very confused,"Recently, I have been experiencing very intense episodes of dissociation from reality. I’ll zone out and when I do, nothing has a label or makes sense. It’s very hard to explain. For example, a few days ago, I had one of these episodes. I looked at a picture of myself and didn’t know who I was looking at. It seemed like someone else, but deep down inside I knew that was me. Also, looking at anyone during these episodes is strange. People don’t seem real, or look real. Everything seems false. I really can’t put it into words, because it baffles even me. I should note that I was taking SSRI’s for some time then abruptly stopped a month ago. I also smoke marijuana every day. I just want advice and input as to what these episodes mean."

1107,Complicated,"Alright guys so to give some context, I was diagnosed with ADHD at a relatively young age and still feel like I am struggling with it. Although I do well at school and in my classes, I always know that there is something wrong while I observe my peers during classes. I feel like my ADHD has gotten so bad to a point where I do not remember what I do somedays specifically while I am at school. Not only in classes but when I talk to people too. Sometimes in the middle of a conversation its like something hits me and I suddenly realize I am in a conversation with someone. Randomly I either feel extremely intoverted and try to end the conversation as quick as possible or I competely shut down and say awkward and stupid stuff. Although this sucks at that moment. I do not remember it or feel anything about it a few minutes sometimes. Almost as if I turn into a different person. This is not some DID shit because I am completely aware of everything that happens it just my personality changes all of a sudden but like i said I know for sure this isnt DID or any kind of mental condition except for something caused by my ADHD. Like I said there is usually 4 characters that I stick to and it changes from week to week or even hour to hour. Usually it is caused by something I smell, hear, feel or see. I know it sounds stupid but I cannot focus on anything so pretty sure my ADHD got so worse to a point that I dont even remember my own personality. I was diagnosed while i was living in a foreign country as a kid and my medical records did not transfer to the states. I cannot see a psychiatrist for a few reasons so thats not an option. I also cant obtain ritalin which was prescribes to me before because of the same reason. I need some way to change this issue on my own so any suggestions please?"
1108,"When you know you need medicine but have no insurance, no money. Anyone conquer this?","I don’t want to get into too many details, but it’s been years trying to solve this problem without insurance. I’m 25 (m) and every job I had has paid the bills with not much left.

I think I can spiral into a thinking that I’m not even in control of my issues, and on nights like tonight, it just makes it worse. I’m going through some big changes right now including the end of a relationship I was happy in, and even that was due to not having medicine as my partner had to take on so much trying to deal with my anxiety.

The panic has been constant for days and I go to sleep and wake up literally feeling my heart pound and that breathless panic. I can’t keep this up, so I’m going to look for some help tomorrow. If anyone has tips for me to solve my mental health problems even though I don’t have money to spend on therapists, insurance right now. Thank you all and I wish you all the best in your own struggles. 🖤"
1109,Mother misled me about purpose of loan interest charges,"I went to take out a private loan for school and was told by my mother not to, that those places charge exorbitant fees and to just take out a loan through her instead. I agreed and she offered me an interest rate of “3-4%” I don’t know why she never will tell me an exact number. She said she was borrowing against something called a HELOC? I finished school and moved across the country for a great career opportunity and am still making payments on my loan. She mentioned one evening before I left that she was happy to give me a loan because she was “making a little something back”. I asked her to clarify what she meant and she stated she had paid off the amount she had borrowed from her HELOC and my interest payments are going directly to her pocket. I have no issue paying the entire amount with interest but I feel betrayed. She told me the interest was because of the HELOC and she’s just been pocketing my money. It’s making me depressed and I don’t know why."

1111,Disassociation/Psychosis,"For the last few years I've been suffering with what my smarter friends have called, ""High Functioning Paranoid Schitzophrenia"". I'm currently seeking professional help but haven't been officially diagnosed, hence the use of the homebrew title. One of the biggest problems that I've been dealing with in regards to it is this constant state of psychosis, or disassociation however you wanna phrase it. Essentially I constantly feel as if I'm living life in the third person, watching someone that's supposed to be me carry on through the boring minutia of life. This has led to me virtually giving up and taking very few things seriously in regards to myself and others. I constantly joke about serious troubles me and my friends are having even to their faces, I don't have a sense of morality or empathy, I self harm and do debaucherous things just for the sake of having them done, and while I know these are not positive things to do there's little will inside myself to stop. Life constantly feels like it's going to end at any moment, like I'm in a constant state of fear to a point where I've just accepted death as an inevitable, quickly approaching outcome. To summarize; nothing feels real anymore and I while deep down I know I should care, practically I couldn't care less about how I treat myself or anything else because nothing is actually happening."
1112,I think I became dumb,"I’m 21 and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I can’t study, think critically or focus and I start losing all motivation to even try to. I have very strong issues with my concentration and memory at the moment.

I’m inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don’t have opinions on certain topics. I can‘t find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‘t follow conversations because I just can‘t focus.

For the same reason I just can‘t focus in uni online classes. I‘m present all time but I don‘t remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‘t remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on.

I feel like I can’t even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don’t know ANYTHING. It’s like I forgot everything I’ve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. This really fucks with my self worth and self esteem. I mean being socially anxious (not talkative, not open, asocial), depressive (low mood/anhedonic) and then dumb, too?

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts, knowledge or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‘t learn new things anymore. I read things I’m interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I‘m not sure if I‘m able to complete my last two semesters of my psychology bachelor being like this. Even if I would complete it, I don‘t know in which job someone like me, a young man with depression, social anxiety and now also cognitive deficits, could work and get his job well done. Then how would I ever be able to socialize when now even my cognition lets me down. How would soneone like me ever be happy and confident or create real friendships/romantic relationships? These thoughts worsen my depression but it‘s so realistic when I stay like this, disabled.

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others..."

1114,A friend casually told me she doesn’t believe in depression. How do I educate her about this?,"She’s highly self-aware, hence why she’s never controlled by her emotions... or so it seems. (I say that bc I blame her mental strength for her belief)
I’ve experienced depression myself and wish to educate her about how real it is, but I’m not sure how to approach her opinion because to me it very absurd not to be able to understand why and what depression is."
1115,Mindful Monday!,"Good morning friends!  


What are 2 things you plan to do this week to practice mindfulness?   


Mindfulness means to become the empowered viewer, rather than the helpless participant, in your life. To observe, without judgment, your thoughts and feelings. To be able to take a step back and enjoy an experience, without feeling the need to move to the next experience."
1116,Experience: Quitting/Reducing Smartphone Usage,"Hello friends,

does anyone here have experience with completely quitting or just reducing smartphone usage/time and seeing definite improvements in depression or (social) anxiety?

I'm very down at the moment and in a very depressive, anhedonic and lethargic state. My social anxiety is back on power again and my cognition (concentration, memory, access to thoughts or knowledge) is very bad and inhibited. My motivation and drive is very low, just as my mood.

I would love to read about your experiences, success stories and suggestions!"
1117,Could someone help me with this one?,"So I gotta decide on a career.

 I've got BPD, Borderline and panic attacks, already dropped a year and now I gotta make that choice. 

I strongly want to be a medical physician but the current circumstances are making it very hard for me. I am put all that I have got into studies but can barely do so because my medicines do not allow me to remember anything.I am going on the assumption that things will get better and I will be able to remember stuff and hence be able to the course.

Is it a viable to stay on that assumption and think of being a physician?"
1118,Do I have an Antisocial personality disorder?,"I have never spoken about this to anyone so I will do my best to be as honest as possible. 

I'm worried that I might have an ASPD. I'm a 29 year old guy who has spent much my 20s exploiting people for my own selfish gains. I've been a serial cheater in almost all of the relationships I've been in, which incidently have all been only around a year in length. I have never loved the person I was with in any of these relationships, and I have known this at the start before even entering the relationship. At the same time, I have used these relationships as an emotional crutch and as soon as they end, I feel worthless and suicidal.

I have been a serial liar since about the age of 14, I'm very good at it and I'm also a good mimic. I have a strong poker face and I'm very good at reading people's emotions and body language. I can use these traits to easily perceive people to get what I want. I have been accused of gaslighting people in the past, particularly in relationships where I will try and convince the other person to see and agree with my point of view. I'm very opinionated and find it difficult to understand people when they disagree. Around the age of 14 I went through a phase of stealing money from my dad. I also kicked my mum during an argument and regularly bunked off from school.

When it comes to friends, I find myself only interested in talking to them if there's something in it for me. I assume that they won't have anything to say that I want to hear and I find it a chore to maintain the communication needed to sustain a healthy relationship. In conversations with friends and strangers, I find it a lot easier and more satisfying when talking about myself.

I have a strong sense of self importance, and I feel I am superior to most people. This is despite the fact that my own life is a bit of a train wreck and I have actually achieved very little. This means I often avoid social situations with people I see as beneath me. I quite often wonder about how weird it is that almost everyone on the planet doesn't even know I exist and struggle to get my head around the fact that the world would operate in exactly the same way without me.

The scary thing for me right now, having only just uncovered all this, is that I don't even know how I feel about it all. Am I ashamed to be like this or am I proud, I really don't know. 

I guess by now this is looking like a slam dunk case of ASPD but it would be good to get the thoughts of others. Thanks for reading."
1119,Why am I feeling so anxious?,"To explain, because I'm immensely depressed and lethargic, I recently decided to do something about my health and started working out six times a day at my local gym. There's this guy that works there who's a professional and has been super nice to me and about two days ago he asked me out. At that moment I froze, said no, and ran out of the gym. Since then, I feel extremely nervous and on edge every moment. I think about that moment every second and feel anxiety. Maybe it's because he was a large, jacked guy and I felt threatened or because I'm not very social and a person liking me came across as a shock. It could be that I questioned his intentions or the fact that I have to go back to the gym( I also take other classes there) and face the awkwardness But the main problem is that it's been a few days, and I still feel abnormally stressed out and tense about it. I have been recommended medication for my depression, but I chickened out and never got further help. I have no idea what to do and what is happening. Any form of advice and help will be great. Thank you!"
1120,Should I go to therapy?,I’m 16 and ever since 9th grade I’ve atleast have sad thoughts every single day. I have anxiety and I’m insecure and I’ve have/had friends that are not right for me and it even triggered my self image. It’s as though I want to turn back time and shape my life so that I don’t end up as the person I am today. I just feel like I need to release my built up emotions and I can’t seem to talk it out with my strict parents and siblings.
1121,Does drug use at young age cause permanent brain damage in bipolar type 1 people?,"Hi all, new to reddit here. So pretty much this is my story.

A bit after I turned 15, I started smoking weed quite frequently. I was one of those guys who thought “Weed is harmless”. 

My excessive smoking trigged my first “Hypomania” (Bipolar symptom) state which is a more racy mind, more heightened and intense emotions, more impulsive and erratic, easily angered and triggered, and supposedly “more creativity”. (Keep in mind I felt these symptoms whilst sober as a result from constant smoking).

I enjoyed being in this state for a while, as this was only the beginning of the illness. At school, I had so much energy and was acting as the class clown a lot of the time, whilst exerting my energy to others in a very unstable way. Fact is, I’m naturally more of an introvert, so my behaviour shocked many of my friends and classmates (and probs teachers too)... but I didn’t give two shits at that time.

As my smoking and Hypomania progressed, I started losing touch of reality. I started experiencing delusions, very far-fetched ones. I thought I could read peoples minds and that others can read my mind. I actually cooled down the excessive “outa” energy and got very internalized. All my excess energy started producing more in my head, so I had more racy thoughts.

But that didn’t stop me from smoking.

Later that year, my mind couldn’t take it. I stayed up all night til 6am reading Facebook posts, thinking people were sending me hidden messages, trying to “lead me to the truth and right direction”. I had totally lost it. I felt like I was in a conspiracy. But it was all really in my head. 

But I had school that morning too. My mind was racing so fast and I was now in a “Manic state” with “Psychosis”. My dad came downstairs and saw that I was distressed. We argued a bit until I called the police and said I was going to kill myself. And as reliable as the police are, they came to my house and took me to the children’s psych ward.

I was forced heavy medications and injections. I was in the ward for a month. I turned 16 then. 

When I got discharged from the ward l, I was depressed as hell. Everything was slowed down heaps and I wasn’t used to it. I was used to being manic and full of energy. 

There’s a lot more to the story, but basically I had been smoking heaps at 15, a little bit at 16 and 17, quite a bit at 18 and 19, heaps at 20, and this year 2020 aging 21, I’ve been sober. But I’m still concerned whether the heavy drug use over the years, especially at a young age can cause permanent brain damage?

Plz leave comments below. Thanks 🙏"
1122,Evening Anxiety/ Mean Reds,"So.. Lately I have been experiencing some severe anxiety that comes up in the evenings mostly and it’s very potent to the point where I can’t really do anything. I have tried several things like different herbal teas, melatonin, gaba just go to sleep, which sometimes works all right. But I still got things to do in the evening which I’m now unable to do. 
I am experiencing some physical symptoms as well like there’s a fist that’s closing in on my heart and pulsing on it, my stomach feels weird, squeamish and I feel very nervous. I can’t really stay in one place and my thoughts don’t really take shape in these episodes. Its more like thinking in a loop: ‘I’m so anxious. I’m so scared, this won’t stop, my heart hurts, what’s happening? Why won’t this stop?’
I’ve been wondering if any of you have any experience with Xanax or other meds that you can take or if you have recommendations what else to do when you don’t necessarily want to start taking pills for it? Thanks :)"
1123,I think I might have bipolar disorder,"This is stupid, but I watch shameless and there’s this character named Ian who has a severe bipolar disorder. When I saw his actions and the symptoms that were being described I immediately thought about how it related so much to me. I kind of disregarded the thought, but earlier today, I had this weird happiness kick in and I started to eat and I thought to myself that I wanted a hot cheeto, so I spent $10 on doordash to get literally a bag of hot cheetos and I immediately lost that thrill and suddenly started questioning myself.. like why did I just spend $10 on a bag of hot cheetos? For awhile now, my moods have been coming almost like I’m being injected by something. I get a random spike of happiness and I won’t have any particular reason behind it. But, it would get me enough to start wanting to talk or do things. But, then there are days where I start tearing up. 

Now just like you, I thought to myself.. everyone has those days..right? No one is always 100% happy. But, I noticed how unsettling it was to suddenly get a random adrenaline and to have it be washed away so quickly. I started searching up symptoms on bipolar disorder because it just came into mind and I know. I know you’re not suppose to self-diagnose yourself. But it is just too accurate. This issue hasn’t just suddenly appeared, you see, I always had issues with my emotions at a young age. And of course, my asian parents reminded me that everyday. 

I was and am the problematic, irrational, attitude-y child of my family. For the longest time, I remembered my parents getting upset with me on how I would get mad so quickly and happy so fast. I remember every person I’ve met tell me I was acting differently when I was happy. I always thought it was weird how hyper I got when I was happy and how low I fell when I was sad. My parents would always advise me to not make decisions when I was happy or sad. Apparently to other people, I acted so differently when I was happy, to the point of my own mother asking me if I was on something every time I was happy. 

I literally started bawling my eyes out reading the symptoms because I felt like maybe I’ve found the issue to my problems..? My entire life, I felt like I had an issue. I feel like my emotions ruined every opportunity, every relationship. There are days were I feel like ending things with my friends for no reason or falling in a really depressive state over a joke my friend says. I feel so depressed I want to cut them out, but in a couple of days I feel fine and I know I’ll regret doing things when I’m sad. 

I’ve had to constantly tell myself to keep my emotions neutral, to not love something too much because I’ll end up hating it. This applies to people and things, events, etc. At work, I’ll come in all moody one day, not wanting to speak to anyone and then the next day I’ll want to share my entire life story with someone. 

Sometimes I’ll be really social at parties but other days I won’t even want to talk to anyone at all or even go out. There are days were I cry for no reason and I thought it was so weird because I have nothing to be sad about. And I know this all sounds normal, but I just can’t explain in words how hard it is for me. 

My entire life I’ve been told the exact same thing from multiple people and I feel like it’s not a coincidence anymore. I’m going to get help and I almost feel relieved if I knew what I had? Because I’ll know how to solve my issue and maybe better my relationship with everything. But also I hope to not have a mental disorder because I’ve seen my mom struggle with it and it’s hard for her."
1124,I (17F) dont know who i am.,"I've been exposed to toxic people all my life, first through my family. Now that im 17 I've never really had a good understanding of myself. I try not to talk about my problems cause I always contradict myself on if my problems are actually problems. That and I dont want to spread all that negativity to other people. People don't deserve to hear what i've been through knowing that they've probably been through more. 

Its just hard, having the people closest to you (friends and family and all) always setting expectations for you. Its overwhelming and tiring. I've always been taught to just sit down, listen, and do what I was told but I'm tired of doing what everyone wants me to. Its getting to the point where i just want to be alone but I can't cause I'll be abandoning the very same people I love and as much as they've hurt me, I care. I hate caring but I do. Everytime something happens I always lose a peice of myself but to be honest I never felt like there was anything to lose in the first place. I've always felt like a husk or a shell of something I could've been. Thats why I've always been a try-hard and a people pleaser. That's why I let people who I thought were close to me get away with a lot. A lot of the relationships I've been have taken advantage of me and idk if its cause I keep letting this happen to myself or if I just have a bad habit of letting shitty people constantly enter my life.

I feel like I ""help"" people but all I'm really doing is just enabling them. Idk, I guess this was more of a brief rant. For whoever read this, thank you and i hope you have the most wonderful day/night 💕🌄🌌"
1125,Lots of issues and not sure how to address them,"Long story short over the past few years I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI, OCD, Tourettes, Depression and Anxiety. I've seen several therapists and neurology experts and tried all kinds of medications but everything just makes it worse. Ended up taking a career break for a few years as I just couldn't manage at work but I just don't even know where to start with how to improve myself. Each of the conditions aren't that bad on their own but together it's just a cycle if things that feed off each other. Stimulants make me more twitchy which also brings out my OCD more and so I feel more aware about it which then makes me feel more anxious and so on.

Not really sure what I'm hoping for here but any replies would be appreciated.

FYI I'm male, 32, married and have 2 kids ages 6 and 1."
1126,I don't know anything,"I don't know shit. I don't know how to help anyone. I don't know how to help myself. I don't know if I need help. I don't know what I'm feeling half the time, or if I'm feeling half the time. 

I can't tell if everything I think and say is a lie that I'm telling myself bc ""I just want a mental illness"" (but I don't want one I never have but I still think I have one but that just seems like me trying to have one but I don't WANT one).

I can't tell if I'm exaggerating or if I'm downplaying what Im feeling. I should know but I don't. 

I wish I could look back on my childhood and think ""I was happier or less anxious back then"" but I can't even do that. I don't remember much of my childhood. But I remember always feeling like this. The amount of intensity have shifted over the years. And the ways I expressed or Didn't express how I was feeling have changed as well. 

But at the end of the day I don't know how normal is supposed to feel. So idk if something has changed, nothing is wrong, or if something has always been wrong. 

I hate it. I'm always fighting with myself bc I just don't know anything about myself or others. I just wish someone could look into my brain and tell me what I'm feeling, tell me if something was wrong or if I'm fine. I hate this so much."
1127,I don't know how to get better,My girlfriend and I have been together for 8months but i struggle so much with jealousy. It's made me cut myself its made my bruise myself and even push me away from her. I want to stop I really do but when i get into these jealous stages i just dont care im just full of anger and hatred towards myself. How can i help myself stop feeling jealous. I want to be okay with her having guy friends or talking to other guys but its so hard. Especially when i find it hard to talk to other people I dont know i dont know what to do
1128,How do I get over her?,"Hi, whoever is reading this you may already know what this is about by the title of my post but it's really hard. So to explain what happened me and my ex were in a long-distance relationship about 131 miles away from each other and we'd see each other twice a month. Everything was going well until corona hit and it started weighing on us mentally because we couldn't see each other besides through a screen. It went up to about three months of not seeing each other than we finally got the time we wanted but we were both mentally diminished I guess you could say. We spent about two weeks together after the three months which was really nice but after those two weeks, things started going downhill fast. I was already going through mental problems and still am to this day. A moment happened where I went to kill myself but never went through with anything. It's hard bringing it back up I don't remember much from it but she was there through it all and that hurts the most. I feel like I failed her and failed everyone around me. After that incident, she was okay not the best but she was okay and she was still pushing and wanting the relationship which I was really happy with because I didn't want my personal problems that I can't mentally control to get between me and her. But about a week passes by and we get into an argument about her guy best friend. The argument was about their talking and how much of it was going on and how close they were getting. I told her that it was making me uncomfortable and I wanted it to die down a bit but not fully stop them from talking to each other because that's too controlling. But just die down a bit and I wanted her to talk to him about it and she said okay. All was okay I guess My thought was she was for sure going to break up with me and I was really low. Then Sunday came around and I went up to visit her for the day and everything seemed fine and happy but she seemed distant and not herself. On my way back home I texted her about the whole situation with the friend and she didn't talk to him yet. When she did the guy got mad and disagreed after he told me he doesn't want to do anything that'd make me uncomfortable which just further fueled her train to be upset about it. Then when I got back home she called me and said we should break up. I was fighting that night for our relationship to keep going and the next day she called for just a break, not a breakup. I know now it was just a nicer way of telling me she didn't want anything anymore and was lying to my face about everything. But that break only lasted about 4 days and I couldn't take the stress of it anymore and I just said to her either take it seriously or I don't want anything anymore and she came back with I think we should just be friends. But now that you have a little bit of context, she was my world, my everything. She was literally the only thing keeping me going in this world. She came into my life at a low spot and made it high so seeing her leave because of my problems because of what they were doing to her hurt me a lot. Overall made me feel like a failure to her and my family. It's been about 3 months now and I'm still hurting. I've talked about it with a lot of friends but it hasn't really helped. But about a week after the break up I found out she liked the guy best friend that I mentioned earlier. It was just a huge gut punch to my mental state and me thinking I'm a failure. It also turned out that he liked her back. They aren't dating or at least what I think I don't know what the truth is anymore. But I know her parents won't let her date for a while unless she got back with me. I wouldn't be up for that seeing what she did right after the breakup. Trust wouldn't be the same. So I just don't know it just hurts a lot that it was only a week after the break up telling me there was more stuff behind the scenes that I wasn't seeing. That I was being lied to and manipulated to think nothing was going on. But it's whatever I'm just happy she's happy I guess. It's been a fair bit since everything went down and I haven't made any progress to feeling better just worse and my life around me isn't good either. I lost my dog that was literally the only thing I had left. Then I lost my grandma about a week and a half later. On top of that my home life isn't the best with problems with my stepmom. So I just really don't have any more left in me. I've been through a lot in this life and this year just added the cherry on top of the long list of mental crap that I've been through. I'm sorry for this being so long. I just got a lot on my mind and I'm really torn. My questions are now that you have context. Is what she did wrong? After it only being a week after everything instantly liking this dude. Why does half of me still hold a false hope for something between us that isn't there? and my last question is how do I get over her and be happy alone?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this being so long I'd be surprised to see anyone read it or comment I know when people see long things like this they don't like sitting through but I hope someone reads this. Thank you if you are reading this I appreciate it. I hope you have a great day/night."

1130,My friend is very negative.,"I have a good friend who I train at the gym with. He, unfortunately, has depression and is open about this to me. The issue is, and I don't think even he is aware of this he is incredibly negative about everything. Everything he talks/ complains about, from his outlook on life, the entertainment he enjoys to even his humor is based on negativity.  I always leave our interactions feeling drained and negative myself. I don't really know what to do as he's not a bad person and I enjoy training with him in the gym he's a good gym buddy. How do I approach/do about this?"
1131,My girlfriend wants to hurt small animals,"I'm  an American that is wrapping up a PhD in Germany. I have about a year  left. I've done a horrible job of assimilating for various unrelated  reasons. I think I've only met the worst people this country has to  offer and that's made it difficult.

My  girlfriend, also working on a PhD, of the past 2.5 years has been a bit  of a rock for me. She appears to have it together. She speaks four  languages. We used to travel before CoViD and I think that helped us  both a lot. We moved in together a couple months ago and now she's  really starting to worry me. She keeps talking about getting a rabbit so  she can kill it. I explained to her that these aren't normal feelings  and these kinds of talks slowed down. She says she would like to get a  therapist for herself but wants to wait until after she has gotten a  job. She is worried that it may negatively impact her ability to get a  job otherwise. But now she is trying to compromise by saying she found  some dead birds and would it be alright if she brought them home so she  can 'stab them with a knife'.

Outside  of movies, I've never heard a person talk like this. I've seen and  heard so things in Germany that made me very uncomfortable and I've  chalked a lot up to cultural differences. But this has to be something  else.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or personal experiences...  What do I do? Run? Get her help?"

When lockdown started we had assignments to submit ,i hardly did anything just managed to scrape by which i hated but, still i didnt do anything.
When my college announced online classes ,i joined for the first 10 then just left it ,i dont know why i just didnt made any effort for it.
I had my internship ,which i lost because i am dumb and didnt took help from my friends who were readily available to help me.
I have about 50 assignments piled up from online classes ,which i dont know anything about because of low attendance


I tried reasoning that i am addicted to mobile games and social media but i haven't opened instagram for a month ,twitter is like everthing is depressing and any mobile games which i downloaded ,i play it for a day and uninstall it right after
And i searched a ton of porn sites but i cant even stand to look at for 5 mins
I watch anime ,but I've dropped many a series only after the first ep ,not because it didn't interested me ,but I couldn't bring myself to watch further i dont know why
And then i go on to youtube and watch some channels and creators i like .
Everyday i repeat this cycle
One anomaly in this is when i downloaded runescape ,i managed to sink all of my time into it ,it managed to distract me from my problems,which i cant even figure out what they are .


And the thing which does not help is my family,
A cheating and drunkard dad,a tired and hardworking  but a little egotistical mother(and i get why shes like that)
An old senile grandma(who i cant leave because she has basically raised my ass)
And my egotistical little brother who thinks hes better than everyone else(maybe better than me but still).
Everyone's is at each other throats each and everyday and in trying to solve their everyday problems, which have no end it it,my patience level (or rather my sloth level )is tested to the max.Everyday i get torn apart by this. Somedays i burst and just do a shiva tandav on them ,other day i try to reason but its same sandwich everyday in a different packing.
And i haven't even reached to my dad 
A drunkard, cheater and gambler who a failure in life and leeched of my mum ,his mistress so much that both of them have debts (his debts aside) and the fact that he doesn't own up to his mistakes makes my blood boil but i cant do anything about it.
Its not my call to do it ,its my mom's and i dont get why shes still hesitant to just move out .
And the mistress is in the same situatuon as my mum,ive met her and shes a very strong women ,both of them are and i dont get why they're still with this asshole i call my dad .
I was 11 when i realised that my family has problems and i am incapable of solving them 
For years ive realised this ,and i still believe im incapable of doing anything productive or anything in order to improve my situation

Ive repeated two years of my academic life because i pretend it was because i have a skin condition but i was lazy and im about to do it again,but i dont know why im not scared of this,i should be scared of this ,but i am not , i'm just tired ,not of existing because i know that wont do any good ,but of just drifting in an unknown limbo and when i try to get out i cant do it 


This is such an incel-like post, i know that ,but  i just dont feel like i have anything i can achive,anything that i can do other than being a freeloader in this world .
I dont look forward to anything in life ,because even if i tried ,other influences in my life make me stop

1134,Depression sucks a lot :(.,"I didn’t understand the severity of my situation until I attempted multiple times at hurting myself and going out my way to look for ways to end myself. 

Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have a supportive family but outside of my family, I struggle to differentiate who’s supporting me or who’s just there to be part of my life for that time. Throughout middle school, I hanged with mostly my brother’s friend the first year and honestly, they were a good bunch of people. I enjoy being around them and when they graduated to high school, I hanged out with a different group of friends. Funny thing in middle school was whenever a friend made me cry, I would cry for a minute but then afterwords, try to make sure I laugh or smile because I felt bad crying and didn’t want them to feel bad, especially when stuff I know were accident but I couldn’t control my emotion cause I was a emotional middle schooler. Anyways, with these group of my friends, I also felt that I enjoyed a good portion of the time with them. But at times I felt like I didn’t fit in because of money. A lot of times, my friends would spend money on food and clothes. Unfortunately, I didn’t really have money or income at that time, and I start to feel myself distancing because of it. We would hang at a quickly or food place after school to get food. Most of the time, I just sat there chilling with them while they eat. They didn’t really share most of the time because I wouldn’t have anything to give back. But I was always super hungry because I didn’t eat lunch cause I didn’t have money for it. My parents didn’t know because I didn’t tell them about it. Funny thing is that I think watching them eat while I starve made me want share more and put others before me now. 

Anyways, going into high school, things were about to same but I started to hang out with a different group of friends because my friends would always go outside to eat. So I found a new spot in the computer lab with a bunch of people that I knew from class. I ended up meeting a lot of people that I am close with now. Freshman year went by and sophomore year went by. Then junior came, when I start to catch feeling for this person. I would say aside from elementary school shananigans, I didn’t really care about relationship up until this and even then when I first started noticing, I didn’t really do anything. As time went by, I started to notice her more and more. And pretty much I was a high school boy in love. Eventually with the support of my friends, I decide I would make a move maybe in senior year. I got closer to her during the summer and I wanted to hang out with her more but she was always on a trip. But we would hang a couple of times and honestly, the chase process was probably one of the funnest times of my life.  Keep in mind, I didn’t really care about none of this love stuff till now. I was pretty socially awkward up to this point because I use to just play games all the time instead of socializing. Often times, whenever I’m in her presence, I would pay a lot of attention to her but I find it hard to talk to her because I was just so awkward and I was in love. I wanted to improve so I tried to improve by talking to more people. I thought about her everyday. Senior year came and I felt like this was the last year to really get to know her just in case we might go to different colleges afterwards and I felt like I would spend less time. I started to talk to my friends more and more about her. I really really liked her and decided I want to make a move. And I did and asked her to movies. She said maybe and that answer made me super happy. But by nighttime, I ask if she was down, she said she needed to do some essay and maybe in the future we can. I sorta got the hint but I was still in love so I was pretty sad then. Then I think weeks went by and I was just thinking, maybe it isn’t the right move. I thought about it and I wanted to see if I can just be friends with her but since I know I had feelings I needed to slowly adjust. In my head, I just wanted to spend more time with her even if things don’t work out. Days went by and my friend would update hanging out with her. I think at one point I got pretty jealous because I wanted to hang out with her more. And so came the day, when I was at the movies with my other friends. My friend hanging with her said they were going to an extra credit event. I was in the middle of watching don’t breathe, and I felt like I couldn’t watch and jsut wanted to hang with her. Me being the selfish me, (very selfish) left my friends and went to meet up with them. When we met up, i already felt like I mess up cause I felt like they didn’t want me to be there. We got on the bus and we were sitting in the back. It got pretty quiet and pretty soon they were on their phone. Moments went by and they were giggling, me being awkward me just look over and just sat there and I had a sense that they were probably texting to each other. At that point I didn’t really wanna be there but I still did. We ended up going to the event and I made my mind up that, probably staying friends would be for the best for both of us. So after the event, my friend and I drop her off at her place and since my friend and I live close by each other, we would take the same bus. This friend knew I had feelings for her because I would tell him about it. On the bus, i ask if he was texting to her while we were on the bus at first and he said he would only tell me if I say I wouldn’t chase her anymore, and i did because I probably think it would be better if we were just friends. And so i said he and he read me what she wrote. I don’t really remember anything but one thing stood out to me was that he said she text him to talking about other guys in front of me. I think I personally felt disconnected from everything and super heart broken. Afterwards my friend said not to tell her that I know what they texted and so I said yes. Heartbroken, while walking home, the more I thought about it the more mad and upset I got. When I got home sorta went off on her, and she called me a snake for reading the messages when I really just asked the friend and he read it to me. I never really read the message. I don’t know but at the time I felt that if I were to cut her off, I didn’t really want her to have bad tension with the friend so I sorta just admitting to snakely reading the message when I didn’t. I was mad for a couple of days but by day three I cool off. I felt that I went overboard and decided to see if she can forgive me and we can just be friends. She said no. I ended up trying to apologize almost every few weeks to her about the things I said. And pretty much was ignored. At that time I thought it was one of the darkest times. Over time, I built up a lot of regret and just felt super sad. I would often times walk to a bus stop rather than taking the bus with my friends. I walked a lot of times alone with my AirPods, and I just felt a lot of regret and sadness. By February, I think she pretty much cool off too or something, idk, but she pulled me aside to talk to me after class. She did most of the talking and basically said we can still be friends. I sat there staring at her because I felt like finally some of the burden I had shifted off. I knew it was gonna be awkward at first so I kept trying to repair that friendship. By that time, prom proposal were happening and I was in the middle of seeing what I can do so we can be friends. And my friend message me one day that she got asked to prom. I thought I would be happy for her because she wasn’t going alone, but I think it brought me the second shot that I wasn’t really over her yet. I know it’s kinda bad but I message her again because I just wanted to talk to her about things. She ended up blocking me and I understand why. I went into depression again. I think with all the regret and build up, I just felt that there was too much on my shoulder. I begin doing alcohol to see if it took the burden off. I pretty much rely on it having a few drinks few times a week. I decided on day I couldn’t handle it so I took some tylenol pills, a good plenty of it, but nothing really happen. The following week, I went up to the bridge, and decided I wanted to jump off and that is probably the quickest way. At the time my parents was on vacation in China so I decided that maybe I would do it later cause I felt super bad for them. And so I didn’t do it that day. Weeks go by and I started to cut myself because I felt that maybe the pain from inside can be put somewhere else and I would numb it. Pretty much scar my arms and I was bleeding. Then one day it got super bad, and i was thinking about fully committing to ending my life. I was messaging my friend and my friend probably told her that I was doing harm to myself. So she messaged me and call but I ignore because I couldn’t handle what I was going through. By the time I made my mind to text her back, the cops were at the door. I opened it thinking that it would be my friend there to comfort me but it was the cops, they put me in handcuff. And with all the noise, my parents came down and notice cops at the door. They were super confuse and my family was super confuse because they didn’t know I was trying to end my life the whole time. What was coincidence was the cop that put me in cuff to take me to the hospital was my brothers old counselor at his school. So I guess the cop updated and before I was put in the car, I took a glance at my parents and looked away because they were so confused and worried. In the police car, it was the first time I was in and it was raining that night. So when we go out, my shoes was wet from the pouring rain. At the hospital, the doctors were asking me what was wrong and I didn’t wanna speak. They said they were going to put me on a psychiatric hold for three days if I dont speak, so I just said I was stress. I sat laying in the hospital for few hours and the nurses there said I can go home when I was ready and so I did. (That few hours of stay costed thousands of dollars. Luckily the insurance paid). On the car back, it was pretty quiet and I didn’t wanna say anything. From that day, my parents treated me differently and while it was good, I didn’t enjoy putting my parents through that and it just feels different even till this day. Pretty much the next few hours was school, so I pretty much stayed up in the hospital and went to school next day. I saw her in the computer lab and she was pretty much worried and I felt like I was the worst person in the world to put her through that. Later on the day, my friend pretty much told me that she was crying and I just felt super bad and just message her telling I was sorry. At that time I was still suicidal and basically I told her that I would go see a therapist and so I did. Well it was a school therapist but she was licensed. I never knew there was one in the school. Basically I didn’t really tell her anything and just cried the whole time. My grades at that point was the lowest. The g.p.a for that semester was 1.87 and the lowest I ever got was 3.00. Pretty much senior year ended and I made my mind that I would not contact her anymore because I didn’t want to bother her anymore. In reality, I really miss her and want to see her grow. 

College went by and I decided I would go to community college because I needed to be close to my family. Depression grew on me even more and I started to talk to my friends even less and less and at one point I didn’t talk to anyone anymore. I felt that school was pretty useless and I felt derailed on my life. I didn’t really have a goal and with all the uncertainty and depression, I started to feel super sad. I dropped a lot of classes in first two years. I missed her a lot during that time. Just last year, I started to pick myself back up alittle, and figure out my plan. I decided I would just transfer it four year university and just do whatever from there. But the feeling of wasting two year at the community college haunted me because I was not going to transfer to the university I wanted. Pretty much, I felt a lot of regrets and depression was still lingering on. My close friends still sometimes hang out with her and on those day I would feel lonely because I really want to see her again and ask how she is doing. Probably for the best that it didn’t happen. At times I would go into depression and it got so bad that I ended up hurting myself again. This time the causes of depression was myself. I felt like I couldn’t pick myself back up and it just put so much fatigue on me. I ended up cutting my entire arm right before the trip to Lake Tahoe this year. I wrapped my arms in bandage and wore a long sleeve so no one would know. The wound healed . Months went by and I felt like i was recovering from it because I had certain goals for myself but it just went crashing down again like another episode of depression. I ended up cutting myself again because I couldn’t handle it.

I started to pay more closely attention to my mental state and realize how bad it was. On times, I felt that there were another voice inside of me trying to bring myself down. On good days I was myself, on bad days, I was a different person. I still question sometimes why I’m alive. I still miss her a lot and I sometimes wish there’s a miracle somewhere that maybe we can start talking again some day. Maybe it’s too late or maybe it’s just pure delusion and false hope. Depression really sucks. I would not wish it among my words enemy. 

There are days where I just look up at my ceiling. There are days where it’s just tiring to do anything. They say time will heal everything but I don’t know when that time will come."
1135,Everything is falling apart and I want to take the easy way out,"My whole life is falling apart. I have two jobs, go to university which sounds good. But I'm trying to look for another part time job that I can't find no matter what, im struggling with university and the future. I feel like I'll never be good enough or find a job in the field I want. I feel like im going to fuck everything up and everyday im living in anxiety and sadness. 

I have nothing to look forward to, no hope. I'll never be good enough for anything. I'll just be stuck in a minimum wage fast food job for the rest of my life because im worthless. I just want to kill myself, I have nothing"
1136,My friend is transitioning next year and I'm ashamed at how scared I am of it.,"So for the past few weeks I've been a constant wreck over something so needlessly specific. And I think it needs some backstory. Sorry if I'm not making much sense I'm really bad at typing my thoughts out. I'll try to answer any questions if you have any once I'm done rambling.

At some point during the time I spent in isolation, for some reason my mind just up and decided it wanted to learn more about transgender matters. Not because I'm a trans person, I'm the most cis straight person you could possibly think of, but because next year once this covid stuff hopefully ends, my best friend plans transitioning from MtF and I wanted to be prepared for how to treat her when the time comes.

But the more I learned about the various  stories from subs and discord servers I began to develop this fear.

I keep worrying that if she transitions, she'll change into a person I don't recognize. Like. The friend who saved me from jumping off a bridge in high-school, the friend who rode in the back of a pickup truck to comfort me after i just lost my father. I worry that once they transition, that person will be gone.

I know this seems like something I should bring up with her, but the thing is, I haven't told her this because I want her to be happy. I know for a fact if I told her about how I was feeling, she'd drop the plan altogether and risk being trapped in a body she doesn't want to be in. She was there for me both times when I needed her and the least I can do is show my support back and be there for her during a monumental as fuck decision to become the person she wants to be.

But at the same time...I'm scared.

I'm scared of losing an important piece of my best friend, some sort of trait or quirk or thing that made her the person I remember being stripped away.

I feel incredibly awful for having this mentality and I constantly beat myself up about it, but I can't help it.

I love her as much as a family member, and I plan on being there for her as long as she'll tolerate me. But I can't seem to come to grips with this horrible way of thinking.

I tried looking more into matters like this but for the life of me I can't actually absorb the info. I still feel a bit scared. And I don't know how to calm myself down. 

And I don't have any other trans friends to ask for advice so I'm just stuck with this shitty mentality that I know is bad.

Can someone please tell me if I'm going psychotic or not because it honestly feels like I am"
1137,For Those of You Suffering From Psychosis,"If you know of anyone who is suffering from any form of psychotic episode or disorder feel free to pass my information on to them.

To anyone out there suffering from Severe Depression, Mania or any form of Psychosis Trust in me that There is A Way Out.

I Spent two years of my life in full blown Psychosis that manifested itself in delusional thinking (""knowing"" my mind was being read constantly to the point that I could not speak to even my closest friends as I was afraid that they already knew what I was going to say which would only further the delusional thinking and inhibit communication resulting in isolation. I believed Freemasons (who by majority are not blood sucking vampires as many will have you believe) were trying to trick me into joining a local lodge for the purposes of some form of occult enslavement. I also began to believe fully that I had alter egos that were slowly taking control of my actions and mind...etc...etc).

This type of thinking accompanied by auditory and visual hallucinations both inside and outside my mind drove me towards what should have been a breaking point resulting in arrest or much worse. If it was not for making the choice to begin Practicing Mindfulness, meditation and a Strict, Healthy Diet of logical thinking, fighting paranoia in slow, methodical steps along with making an effort to socialize with those close to me I would still be in a very difficult state of psychosis that sadly some of my friends did not get the chance to get out of in time before they became a slave to their Psychotic, Deluded state of mind permanently.

With all of these steps combined I was able to make my way out slowly but surely. It was not easy and took many years to completely get my life back on track and I'm not sure if after the experiences I have had whether or not I am completely who I knew myself to be prior to my initial psychotic break. However, I can honestly say I have since become a stronger person... It was most definitely a learning experience to say the least.

If you or a loved one is currently suffering from Psychosis you can contact me here on Reddit or text (217)-417-9020.

If you are not suffering from a mental disorder or seeking advice for a loved one with a Mental Disorder please do not contact me asking for more information about my life. For those of you who are and choose not to contact me I have this to tell you;

The voices in and around your head are not your friends, the friendly ones turn mean and the mean ones get angry and aggressive. Disengage in communication with them completely. God Speaks in Revelations, the Devil Speaks in Whispers that turn to screams. You have the power to tune them out and you have ultimate control over them, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

No one is reading your thoughts. In Short Your mind has become fragmented and the voices you are hearing are in fact your subconscious augmenting other peoples voices you have heard throughout your daily life that would otherwise appear as your own thoughts. Bare in mind that we think at a rate of 1200 words per minute and on average only speak at 120 words per minute, this is to help you understand that all of these voices are merely your subconscious gone haywire. Due to how fast we think we all have voices in our heads, however most people interpret them as their own internal voice.

If you are hearing things coming from the air conditioner, the toilet, drains, rain drops, sewers, fans or other things around your house this is relatively normal and is known as Auditory Apophenia. Apophenia is a Psychological phenomenon and only becomes part of a Mental Disorder when you let it take over your life. The Faces you are seeing in various textures on walls, in food and other everyday objects are examples of Visual Apophenia. As for other hallucinations you may be experiencing we will need to chat one on one to sort them out.

A simple tool I have used from the Silva Method in order to combat negative thinking or intrusive thoughts is using the simple phrase, ""Cancel Cancel"" anytime you have an intrusive or negative thought that you feel is a part of your illness. Even if it's just little things you want to change about your thinking, this is a good method to utilize. Your internal/ external voices may laugh at this or shout back at you or at the very least try to reason with you at first but again the best way to keep voices away from you is to simply ignore them and that goes for ALL OF THEM until you can fully regain your own inner voice.

I find it best to think of these voices as bullies or online trolls (especially the ones that are pretending to be nice to you) the only way they can get anything out of you is if you give them something to use against you. Most importantly, do not give particular voices names. This only empowers the thought pattern and engraves this type of thinking deeper into your mind as both normal and acceptable.

If you are to utilize these tools correctly in your daily life you will be able to take the fragmented pieces of your mind and slowly but surely mend them back together. Again, do not fear to contact me. If you are suffering from psychosis I have been where you are. There is a way out. There is always a way out.

1138,I feel like I'm useless and screw everything up,"Lately I've been recalling things I've done/am doing in life and have realised that in most things I screw up one way or another, every time that it happens I always feel like I'm trying my best and every time I screw things up one way or another, and I've beginning to think that I should just give up in general, cause it seems like no matter how hard I try or what I do, I always just screw things up and have been thinking that even if I go away, that nothing will change, things would just continue going on as they are, the only thing keeping me for ending it all is my cat, but I'm scared to think what might happen if I lose him for any reason.

Can anyone suggest something that my help or give me advice so that I can try and turn things around?"
1139,Has someone ever experienced not feeling real?," Sometimes when look at myself on the mirror I just don't feel myself, I like nothing is really real and I'm just hallucinating. This also happens when I'm alone or when I'm really sad with someone, this also happens when I'm at nature all by myself. It's a uncomfortable sensation, it's like im a parasite in someone else's body.
Have you ever had a similar experience?"
1140,I was venting and was told to suck it up buttercup. I thought this was a pretty callous response.,What do you think?
1141,I started a podcast called 'My First Panic Attack',"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

Please delete if not allowed but I started a mental health podcast called 'My First Panic Attack' back in July which focuses on an individual’s unique personal story, highlighting their initial experiences with their mental health and their journey from then to now. Being that the stigma surrounding mental health is still extremely prominent, the series intends to break down the barriers by providing genuine, authentic and candid conversations, introducing a variety of different guests that can speak about these issues openly.

&amp;#x200B;

Although it's only really circulated amongst my close group of friends, I was recently recommended to post it on this sub in order to try and help anyone going through issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

The theme of the podcast isn't just about panic attacks, but about having an open conversation about mental health, with my next goal focusing on removing the stigma surrounding men and mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

All the episodes can be found via this link:

I hope it helps someone here.

1142,Feeling pretty rough today,"Do you ever feel like you’re going down a bad path and instead of doing something to help yourself you kind of just lean into it?

Everything’s a bit of a mess for me at the moment. I’m not eating well, my room is a mess, I’m not seeing any of my friends.
I only have a handful of friends as it is and it literally only just occurred to me that I can’t remember the last time I saw one of them. 

I know I have to fix it but I don’t have the energy. 

I don’t know what to do, I just want to lay here and do nothing. I checked into a hotel for the next couple of nights because I just wanted to be alone. 

I don’t even know why I made this post really. I’m just feeling sad."
1143,My step-sister has had a mental break two days ago and is mentally insane,"She was fine, playing with me on my PlayStation and her tablet. Her dad (my step dad) took her out to eat and then brought her back she locked herself in her room, started yelling at the wall then went outside and climbed on top of our vehicle. A lot of her issues are apparent. SHhe kept saying she has to kill the wicked witch (my mother) and that it'll just be her, her biological sister and her father. (She also wants our baby brother). The hostile-ness stopped but she keeps saying her name is Malivore (and keeps repeating Mal (evil)) she said that she (malivore) told sakeenah (that's her name) not to cry and that her father doesn't love her. She was really happy when my mom bathed her and gave her hugs and kisses though. We talked to her and she started hitting her face and repeatedly saying ""don't cry"" and then she started to. It's as if she's developed a fragment personality to hold herself ""sakeenah"" down. We asked her about certain things. We played Qur'an recitation (one of sakeenah's favorite verses too) and she said ""she likes it and I say no"". And my mom asked if she cleaned herself in the bathroom and she said "" She tried to but I said no"". She spoke to her dad but he's at work. I feel like we can pull her out of it but I need to know tips on how."
1144,People Taking Fluoxetine (Prozac). What side effects do you experience?,"So I’m getting started on fluoxetine for Anxiety, depression and a sprinkle of OCD ( I’m 19 if that makes any difference) and I was just wondering if anyone that takes it could let me know what side effects if any they feel. Thanks in advance hope you all have a great day 😁"
1145,how do i get help,"i have hit the worst state of depression of my life in the past month, and no one is listening to me. no one is trying to understand me, no one sees my opinions as valid. im tired. im barely eating, ive had occasional night terrors, i can only sleep 5 hours every night, my mind constantly goes black, i feel like hitting my head against a wall, i feel trapped, and im vomitting bile and acid every morning because of my hunger. i live in the uk, ive tried to get referred to a therapist many times and im tired of waiting. i feel like i am dying, both inside and out. i spent 5 hours out in the pouring rain the other day because i was too scared to go back home and face reality. my own bedroom is very dark. how can i get help, please reply if you know"
1146,"My girlfriend suffers from Depersonalisation disorder and depression, we've been together for 6 months but the last few days she's been getting panic attacks daily and is questioning her whole existence. This makes her hate herself because she thinks she's a terrible girlfriend. Any advice?","She hasn't gotten any help for her Depersonalisation disorder but has had medication for depression for many years.

We talk a lot about her symptoms and overall health so we know that i know what sort of person I'm dating.

She is angry and feels hopeless because she hasn't been getting the help she's wanted or needed. Her current psychologist is terrible."
1147,I think I had a panic attack,"Ok so this happened a couple months ago but basically I (17 F) was hanging with a group of friends when I was forced to kiss a guy (I’m physically incapable of saying no when it comes to situations like this. But that’s a whole other issue) but you could tell I was visibly uncomfortable and I did not seem like I wanted to do it. But one of the guys there, who I liked at the time, had just kissed me on a dare which I didn’t mind because I liked him, then he kissed me again like 2 minutes later which was fine, but then he started trying to convince me to kiss his friend and I kept making excuses but he wouldn’t listen so I just did it. Safe to say i was incredibly uncomfortable and I felt like shit. I’m relatively inexperienced when it comes to this type of stuff. The guy that kissed me on a dare was actually my first (serious) kiss. Or to put it simply, my first kiss with a guy. (I’ve kissed my female friends before as jokes). So it was significant for me but I felt like I was just being passed around. Ok so now for the part you’re here for: I started having trouble breathing so I went to the bathroom. I realized my heart rate was 150 bpm (my watch was measuring it) and i started sobbing. I called my best friend because I didn’t know what else to do. She took a while to answer but when she did, I just kept crying really hard and repeating “I think I’m gonna die” she was freaked out because imagine being in her shoes and your best friend is crying and saying that they’re dying. I’ve read about people’s experiences with panic/anxiety attacks but I could never imagine myself having one. I genuinely thought I was gonna die. You know how when you have plans to do something so you think about what’s gonna happen later? I couldn’t even do that. It’s like I saw no future beyond this intense fear I was having. All I saw were the walls of the bathroom I was in and I couldn’t imagine the rest of my day. I couldn’t breathe at all and I was freezing even though it was hot as hell and I don’t get cold easily. My chest felt tight and I felt dizzy. Later in the day I fainted in the bathroom. It was just for a few minutes I think, I don’t even remember. It was a pretty hazy day for me. All the while the first guy (the one I liked) kept taking advantage of me and made out with me another 3 times, one of which I was sitting on the floor crying because I was alone in the room at which point he comes in, closes the door behind him and sits in front of me. He lifted my head up to look me in the eyes and kissed me, then told me not to tell anyone (?????) as soon as he left the room I went back to crying but harder. We then went out to like this outdoor hangout spot and I just spent the entire time walking around by myself crying. My heart rate stayed at 150 bpm the entire time (4 hours up until I got home at around 8 pm)

Going to a doctor or psychiatrist isn’t an option because my parents don’t believe in mental health issues. I’m like 87% sure I have depression but I can’t get diagnosed. So I’ve resorted to asking on here because a lot of you have probably experienced this before. So my question is was it a panic or anxiety attack and what’s the probability that it’ll happen again? Like was it a one time thing or worse? 

TLDR; had a horrible day where I was forced to do something I didn’t want to and ended up having a panic/anxiety attack but I can’t be sure because I can’t go to a professional for help."
1148,Distressing others how to deal with the guilt?,"So I would always tell my friends, gf and parents that I was going to kill myself when I felt that way and they would get extremely worried and Ive only now realised how horrible that is to do to somebody I've apologised to them all since and they have forgiven me for it but I'm still having a very hard time dealing with the guilt. Could anyone give me some advice or tips please?"
1149,Anxiety/Depression,"Okay so I’ve been dealing with this for a few years, I’ve only recently come to accept it because I’ve always associated these kind of things with people that have experienced significant trauma. I never have, I have parents that give me everything and a potentially bright future ahead of me. I’ve done my own research and I’ve come to find out that I have very frequent panic attacks and I think I’m depressed but it’s nothing like I see people on social media talking about. I feel nothing, the world is there for my taking just sitting right in front of me but I can’t make myself just go and get it. I use alcohol to numb the anxiety that I feel knowing that I have a better opportunity than most to make something of myself but I continue continue to squander it and just slowly watch my potential for a happy life walk out the door . But I have a question, what do I do? What kind of doctor do I get in contact with to get help? I called one but I didn’t know what I was supposed to be looking for and I felt very idiotic so I gave up on it but I know that I need some kind of professional help, I just don’t know who or where to go to. Does anyone have any recommendations as to what I should do? Nobody really gets what I’m dealing with because I don’t have a reason to be going through it but it’s getting unbearable. So if anyone has any suggestions I’d be more than happy to listen."
1150,I'm so tired of my family,"I wasn't sure about posting, but at this point I just need to vent somewhere and there's no good places other than this. I don't even care if you read this, because is a long vent. I just needed a place to put this where my parents would't find it.   
English is not my first language, so if you actually read this, please keep it in mind. 

I'm sick of my parents. They constantly belittle me, tell me I'm not enough, I don't do enough. They tell me I'm a lazy waste of money because I don't get up at 6 and do productive stuff every second of my day; I have two weeks of full free time every five and a half months because of university, during which I just want to rest before going back to my routine, but they don't care.   
Free time and sleeping in for for weeks a *year* is not something a responsible person that doesn't waste their parents' money would do in their opinion.

Every single day, while I'm sleeping, even if it's somewhat early (like 8 in the morning or so, I normally get up at 8:30 when not on my - short - break) I have to hear my mother slam my bedroom door open and complain about me, complain about how I don't give a shit about being ad adult, complain about how I don't do enough compare to other people my age, complain about how I don't care that she's spending money for my education.   
This has been going on for years. Years of hearing how awful I am as a person every day, with no break and no mercy.   
When confronted about it, my mother laughs at me and shrug it off, telling me it's normal for a mother to act like that. That, or she offends me straight away. 

I get free insults with every word I speak, and god forbid if I try to defend myself from constant psychological abuse. I'm always the one that's wrong, always the useless daughter that's worse than any other person in my family or in my entire town. 

University-wise, my parents forced me to choose something I didn't want to do, belittling the university I *really* wanted to go to, and, since I *had* to choose one myself, now they use this reason as something against me. If I ever try to complain about how I don't like what I'm doing (can't drop out either), they guilt-trip me by telling me I was the one that chose it.   
Even worse, they yell at me for whatever grade I get at exams. My mother went as far as telling me she was disappointed in a 30/30 grade. There's nothing higher than that. This led me to be absolutely scared of getting a bad grade, which subsequently triggers my anxiety disorder through the roof. Because of them, I can never go to an exam feeling somewhat sure of what I know, because I always think about how mad they'll be if something goes wrong; and because of this state of mind, I can't feel comfortable during an exam and I screw things up every single time. 

If I forget something, because I'm stressed or because they tell me something too early, I'm irresponsible and useless. If they forget something, it's my fault for not reminding them.   
Every time something happens in my house, either something breaks or things go missing, it's my fault.   
I get yelled at for being stressed, they don't believe me when I tell them I feel sick, and they don't have the slightest bit of respect for me and for my stuff. 

They barge into my room without asking first, my mother throws things around when something is not in the place she decided was right. She broke my stuff more than once and blamed me for her breaking it, and when she doesn't like something I own (even if I bought it with my own money) she throws it away or hides it so I can't find it anymore. And then tell me I'm an idiot that loses her stuff because I'm irresponsible. 

I don't have any kind of privacy, not even on social media. I'm almost 23 years old, and my mother still demands me to give her every single password I have on my social media so she can log in to check what I do. I managed to get away with a couple socials just because she doesn't know of their existence on the internet. If I try to complain, she takes away my stuff an guilt-trips me into believing I'm the awful one.   
When I'm studying or attending classes (online), she enters my room without permission to check if I'm actually working, and if I'm on a break she yells at me for wasting her money. 

I got to the point of getting physically ill because I study 10 to 12 hours every day, I had to do medical exams and followed a therapy for three months, and my parents still tell me I don't study enough for the money they're spending.   
I have severe anxiety, to the point of having breakdown and breathing problems, and they just shrug it off because ""we're anxious as well"" and ""just don't think about it, grow up"".   
They get mad at me for not telling them every single detail about my life, and shame me when I actually try to get advice from them. 

My mother told me, to my face, I am a disturbed person with many problems because I don't like going out and I'm not interested in a relationship (I'm aro/ace, even worse because she's homophobic). She insulted me more than once on this topic, and keeps making remarks about sex and relationships every time she sees me talking to a boy even though I told her to stop many many times over five years.   
I literally cannot bring up my male friends in a conversation because she straight up harasses me on the topic. And I can't bring up my female friends in a conversation, because she starts ""accusing"" me of being a lesbian.   
And she shames me for not having friends in my town. Despite knowing said people in my town bullied me for 10 years and made me develop anxiety and some form of rejection sensitive dysphoria. She doesn't even want me to hang out with some of my friends, because they're of other nationalities and/or religions (yeah, she's pretty racist as well, though she denies it). 

My father... he acts nice sometimes, but will yell at me for the slightest errors and scream at the top of his lungs if I appear upset in front of him because of whatever is stressing me out. I literally had him screaming at me for 30 minutes the other day because I had a breakdown over the huge load of work I have to do for university. 

To end it all, they're control freaks. They HAVE to control everything I do, know everywhere I go. I constantly have to text them and call them, even if I'm with friends, or even if I'm at home, because they need to know what I'm doing and where I'm going and who I'm with.   
They have people spying on me, to know if I go to my classes or not (I go to university in another city). One time I was feeling sick and I didn't go, didn't tell them because they wouldn't believe me, and got a call from a very angry father yelling at me that I was wasting his money.   
One other time I was tired as hell after an entire day of classes and fell asleep; didn't hear the phone ringing 'cause I was sleeping. Woke up to 17 missed calls from my mother, 10 from my father, my three roommates told me my parents wouldn't stop calling them (yes, they demanded their phone number), and my landlord (a man from the same town as me) called me to tell me my parents wanted me to leave the apartment because I didn't answer the phone. 

All in all, I live in hell and I can't leave. And I can't even explain how much I *cannot* do anything that would make me feel better. Because there's no way of me letting you understand the entire situation without making you live it. 

I'm sorry for the loooong rant, but I needed it."
1151,So embarrassed by the years depression has claimed in my life,"Hello everyone. This is so.... silly. I know it is and I shouldn't feel shame for this. But I do. I've been having issues with mental illness since I was a young teen. My brain doesn't quite know how to make the good chemicals so many years have come and gone without much happening in my life.   
This comes down to comparison, I know that. But I'm so ashamed. 

When I think about potentially dating someone or become friends with a new person I feel this dread because SO many years have just been shit for me. I have no fun travel pictures to share, I don't have a craft, I don't have a career or let alone a steady job, I don't have a group of friends that I hang out with, I don't have my own place either which feels like I ""should"" in my late 20s? I rarely leave my house due to social anxiety in general and my family is quite broken so nothing to ""show off"" there either.   


Does anyone else feel this way? I look at myself from someone elses eyes and I see this person that hasn't done really anything in their life. Which is fine when I think about it. I don't judge other people based on this. Just myself. 

But when people ask ""So what do you do?"" or ""What have you been up to"" I just want to curl into a ball and scurry away. This shame is truly awful. It all just ends up with me building walls around me and not letting anyone in. Because all I see is a person who didn't do what they could with their time. Time just slipped by in darkness and I have nothing to show for it.  


TL;DR  
Do you feel ashamed or embarrassed over the years your mental illness has claimed?"
1152,An issue I’m suffering with,"I have been chewing my nails and the skin around them for as long as I can remember, I think it’s a way that I vent stress. 

However recently it has made me feel quite isolated as I sometimes chew my fingers to extreme degrees, I know I should stop, but I’m finding it hard to.

Any advice on how to stop this kind of addiction

Thanks I’m advance"
1153,I need to vent.,"I feel defeated. The advice from older people given to me is to go out and do what I love and find someone in the same passion, and to stop trying to look. But it’s all I can think about is wanting someone to hug and cry too and give sweet kisses too. 

Like everyone else, I’m completely stressed from school and needing to pass everything I take because there’s no room for failure. My roommates cat he got was supposed to also kinda be my ESA, but the cat doesn’t sleep with me he sleeps with him. The cat isn’t warming up to me like he is to him.

I’m just a depressed selfish little shit. Who says she wants to just make everyone happy but is slowly realizing how manipulative she can fuckin be. 

Why do I want a relationship so badly? Whats broken in me? I like to know how the broken parts of me became broke, but I don’t understand and therefore don’t know how to better myself in this situation and it’s making me frustrated."
1154,Is having breakdowns normal for people without mental health issues or do I need to get help?," So, is having a breakdown and just blanking in the middle of a no-pressure and chill class normal? 

 The teacher (who is just a sweet angel) gave all of us assignments. We start doing them and my math doesn't match with the others. At this point I'm already panicking and shivering a little. So I ask my friends for help through WhatsApp. They try to help but they also have their own shit to do and I start not even understanding things I did just a few minutes before. With each minute it gets worse and I'm sweating, having difficulty breathing, with the symptoms from before still present. 
  Then it happens. Teacher asks me to explain one of the questions (which was an easy one but it didn't feel like that at that moment). I say sorry as best as I can and close my cam&amp;mic. I text the teacher and tell her what's going on. Thankfully she was okay with it and asked if she could help in any way. But it still takes me a few hours to calm down to the point I can finish my assignment as much as possible and upload it.

 I'm wondering what this could be. I had similar things happen since the start of university (and some at the end of highschool) but I've never really seen a health professional about this. I'm looking into ADHD, anxiety and other panic related mental things but the symptoms seem a lot more than what I have. So I need some insight until the quarantine is over and I can see a psychiatrist. Any help would be appreciated. 
  
Good week to everyone."
1155,Mental health tools needed,"Trigger warning for abuse, violence, anxiety, drug use, sexual abuse. 
I have a counselor that I see about 2/per month. She's very nice. however, I don't think she is able to offer me assistance in larger problem areas in my mind. 
I have gone through mental stuff growing up. It has caused some issues in my head. 

 I am constantly worried and afraid of everything. 
Absolutely everything is my fault. I will sit and think of every way I could have been responsible and then beat myself up over it. When my mom calls me while she is upset then I feel really horrible. I've grown up being responsible for her and trying to keep her happy and loved. I think failing to keep HER happy is what hurts most. 
I still allow my mom/grandma to manipulate and control me with guilt until the stance (trying to live my own life and not feel responsible for others) I had previously taken was completely gone. Then I crumble into pathetic tears and apologize repeatedly.

 I love my mom and I dont want her to hurt. Shes a very sensitive being and I know how easily she can go from happy and silly to psychotic screaming meltdown.
When i discuss my past with my longtime bf or bff then my mom/grandma say that I'm playing the victim card and looking for sympathy and that I dont know what real abuse and trauma is. So now I really dont like discussing my past with my bf/bff cuz sometimes I wonder if my mom/grandma are right; that I dont know what real abuse is and I should be grateful it was only that. My mom raised her brother cuz my grandma was an alcoholic. My mom lost a daughter before me and was raped on her grave. She then started a life of drugs. Insert me. Growing up with a single mom, she loved me and bought me everything I wanted. we would play constantly. My dad was either working or too drunk. She even helped me raise a daughter of my own as a teen mom and helped w/so much more. As a kid I'd sit with her at drug houses all night, or sit in a van all night. Eventually it got to the point of leaving me alone all night with our dog. I'd turn all the lights on and huddle beside her fat furry self.
Mom would come home crying and tired. I have to cheer her up and make sure she was still breathing after she fell asleep. I was always and still am her emotional crutch. I just dont want to be anymore.

I was also molested twice as a child by a family friend. As an adult, I told my family. They didnt really believe me. I guess they kind of do now and just dont take it seriously cuz they still associate with him. 

I also care about what absolutely everyone thinks of me. I want everyone to like me or just not see me in a negative light even if they dont know I exist. That's fine too. Seeing me in a negative light means I've done something to upset them or irritate them. I dont want to upset or hurt anybody. Believe me, I will think about that dumb sentence or action that irritated u or hurt u when I'm 50, 70, etc.

I get extreme anxiety. For example, I become paralyzed with fear when going to new places. I cannot go to a new dr or new shop without someone with me.

Sorry I ranted a bit. So those are my issues and backstory for the most part. Do any of you know of any mental tools, tips, or tricks to help with any of these things?"
1156,yesterday (pls help i need advice!!),"idk what this is but yesterday out of all days I’ve been crying a damn lot again. but the thing is that I haven’t cried properly for MONTHS. and now suddenly all my emotions just happen to pile up together and it seems like they all have a desire to conspire against me... fr i didn’t fucking cry properly for months and 💥 BOOM 💥
yesterday just happened to be where i had to have a mental breakdown all over again. like i don’t understand? anyways,

as i was saying, when i got suddenly the urge to cry and more i became all of a sudden upset out of fucking nowhere ?!! then i relapsed and self-harmed myself again by head-banging multiple times at my wall until it eventually hurt and i got strong headaches from it. guess i did that just to feel something idk what the fuck???? is wrong here!??

and then i happened to take my last antidepressants that i had even in a larger dosage than prescribed because idk i was just so upset and irritated at everything and everyone... all of a sudden... and now since this is from yesterday, I’m still dealing with the aftermath that is i still have strong ass headaches and my whole body is strongly trembling and shivering right now, because of the antidepressants that i took after a long time and actually didn’t take them for a short time.

idk why I’m acting so impulsively out like that... i hate all of this so fucking much i could literally just fucking puke

everything hurts"
1157,Feelings of guilt and problems with family,"Hi I’ve struggled a lot with mental health from a young age which is always caused by stress and anxiety. I’ve made many mistakes over my laugh with friendships and partners which have made me so confused and worried about hurting people I end inevitably hurting them causing em to loss them.

I keep having days where I am extremely sad and hate myself for not realising sooner my manipulative ex and how my self isolating behaviour would effect friendships and hike life.

Each week it seems to be a new memory and I can’t get out of the past and move on. 

I live a home with my family who have always supported me and I do appreciate all that they do but they won’t listen to my feelings or accept that I have mental illness. I was told by my mum that I don’t have depression and get told that I am selfish and horrible and lazy when I have my days where I am extremely down. I really struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts which I haven’t told them about and it’s been nearly two yrs ago.

Basically I don’t know how to stop thinking about the past and just get on with my life and accept that o was a shitty person. I was shitty and I admit that but I never wanted to intended to hurt anyone I just didn’t know how to work when I was having all these feelings and thoughts. My family never wanted to hear about it and my friend was very dismissive of me when I tried to speak with her. 

I thought I was getting better but as soon as uni started again I’ve fallen back down a rabbit hole. And it doesn’t help living at home when I don’t have peace and quiet to get on with work because I’m constantly being told to do things and told I am lazy- I wake up early to feed all the animals, clean them and the house and help make dinner at night. 

I keep being told I am selfish and self absorbed (which I admit I am and hate myself for it) and it just makes me more pissed off and sad.

Basically I don’t know what to do to make it better at home. I keep losing my temper and shouting back when they are yelling at me. I want to stop and I am tying to. How can I stop spiralling on past thoughts and how can I stop my temper. I get so angry because no one will listen to how I feel and everything feels like so much weight on top of me. I’m struggling with past relationship and sexual assault 

They do try and help me but there solution is just to buy things when I don’t need material goods I just need them to listen.

This then make sit worse because they think I’m selfish  and unappreciative but I am not I’m just frustrated they won’t listen to me.

They are also bad at bringing up the past and one example is when I got fringe boots as a surprise and I was super excited and happy about hem but I was so tired from bullshit at school I didn’t physically show it. I loved them and I was cautious about wearing them not to ruin them and when I did wear them I got made fun of so I stopped and I still hate myself for doing that. My parents bring these sort of things up to guilt me saying I was unappreciative when I was but they wouldn’t  understand  why I’d don’t wear them all the time. Same with a yellow rain coat I was n love with but I got completely ripped to shreds at school for it and never wore it at school. I still regret letting people’s opinions effect em because I loved those boots and that jacket now they don’t fit. I do feel guilty because it does come across as me being unappreciative but it wasn’t that at all.

Sorry I realised this went off into some many directions and there is so much more I get upset about I just need some advice on how to make my relationship with my family better and how to move on from my mistakes instead of dwelling on them. 
 
I have spoken to councillors and a mental health nurse but I keep getting better then I just get one day that shatters me and I’m back at the start. I’m definitely much better than whee I was last year where I was self harming and suicidal but it just really knocks me that I can’t move on."
1158,Good to talk and Reddit,"
Feelings don't try to kill you, even the painful ones. Anxiety is a feeling grown too large. A feeling grown aggressive and dangerous. You're responsible for its consequences, you're responsible for treating it. But...you're not responsible for causing it. You're not morally at fault for it. No more than you would be for a tumor."
1159,Does anyone find Howard Stern’s wack pack offensive?,It seems like it’s just a way to make fun of people.  What are your thoughts?
1160,I'm actually thinking of doing suicide,"I made a post on this subreddit about my mental health, ended up getting little replies.

Things just got worse is such a short time, its like falling from the top of a erupting volcano into a pool of flaming lava.

Online classes are seriously making my life a total shithole and when my mother had a talk to me about my grades, things didn't end well.

I once held a large kitchen knife right next to my neck trying to get myself to just stab the side of my neck.

I thought that if i were to cut through the lower right or left of my neck, i would be able to cut some kind of nerve that would kill me instantly.

I ended up not doing it.

I know that I'm a moron, and i accept that I'm an absolute failure, but i always thought of the world from a very different point of view.

A way that i cannot describe.

I'm just an animal, just like 7 billion of you, my worth is like that of a grain of sand on the beach, sand is what makes a beach a beach, thus all are important, but if all people are bent on living a happy life even when death can just take away their pain, then perhaps my death wouldn't lead to much of a loss.

Sure my mother would cry, my family would cry and mourn my death.

But everyday thousands of people die, but yet we cry over one.

The lost of my life is a selfish act, and it would lead to great suffering to those who loved me.

But I accepted the fact that i was selfish, they will die one day too, making more people cry, if I don't die, ill cry over their deaths, at least i think i will.

My mother ended up blaming the internet for my depression, it was ironic, i love the internet because it makes me feel happy, and yet her foolish ignorant mind says the source of a large fire was a bucket of water people used to quench their thirst.

I'm sorry if you didn't understand what i meant there.

I'm an animal, no more than a pig or a cow.

I thought of trying to kill myself with a knife again last night, but i was afraid that it would hurt.

But why should i care? once im dead im dead, i become a corpse whos body is fed on by worms and roaches.

Once im dead, my eyes wont have to look at this cruel generous world.

I never talked to my friends for a while, they are good people, were good people.

I never thought of death as punishment, i would much rather die than be tortured for eternity.

I cant hang myself because there is no rope in my house, i cant just jump off a building, i cant just shoot myself with a gun since we dont have one.

I'll have to use a knife.

I hate it whenever someone post about their mental health only for some ignorant fools to call them 'emos' or desperate for attention.

But it seems that i may seem that way to most people.

I'm just not doing so good."
1161,I don't even know how to start to fix myself.,"I've been ignoring and downplaying my mental health issues for a very VERY long time. I've felt like a loser for the vast majority of my life, I'm 32 and back living at home with my parents. I've spent the last 14 years working retail hoping to move up at the company work for and that's turned into a huge dead end.

Last night I got drunk off what little beer and wine I have left (I'm trying to stop consuming thc and alcohol) and got into an argument with my mom about politics. I'm a bit hazy on how the argument got off politics and onto this, but I wound up breaking down and telling her that my brother sexually abused me when were both young. This has been eating away at me for decades now, and I just don't know how to even start to deal with it. Every time I look into seeing a therapist I distract myself or don't follow through. I hate myself for getting to this point.

I've been fighting off crying all morning at work, all I can think about is that I've hurt my mom on a level I can't begin to understand and I don't know how to make any of this better.

I live in Mass, US. If anyone knows of some resources I can draw on to try and pick up the broken pieces and get better, please let me know. If there's a better subreddit to post something like this to, please let me know."
1162,Study Shows Self-Harm May Be Contagious Among Teenagers,A new study published in the journal Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavia suggests that [self-harm could be contagious among](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27571/20201004/study-shows-self-harm-contagious-teenagers.htm) teenagers especially those who were exposed to that behavior.
1163,I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me,"To be honest I barely have any friends. I generally can't hold down friendships for longer than a year or so.


I know that I kind of default to negativity when I'm talking so that might factor into it, I can be a little too honest sometimes, I genuinely try not to be one of those ""im not mean, you just can't handle the truth"" people, but I'm scared that I come across as really mean.


I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

Sometimes I feel like I might have been toxic because I sometimes default to sadness when I wanted attention from others. I put myself down a lot, now I realize I do that so people would lift me up and I would feel good (sometimes people would agree with me tho lmao). I hate that i did that and some people might potentially see me as a manipulator, even if I hate that and wouldn't consciously seek to do that...


I want to change, and I hope I have, but I'm scared I'll always be a shitty, negative person who sucks the energy out of the room and casts a shadow on everything.


How can you change your nature as a negative person and be better? Have you done this?

Thanks for listening!"
1164,What is wrong with me.,"Hey everyone...uh I'd like to talk to you about problems I've had since I was a kid.I have massive anxiety first off. When one of my relatives were asking me about my gaming life,There was a bowl of peanuts on the table.I ate it all while he asked me even tho I never ate peanuts a lot. I also run around the room like crazy when I think about something cool like riding a motorcycle. My attention span is very low. I get harrassed by my peers at school because of my height,weight,how skinny I am,my facial hair. I lash out at innocents when they ask my questions.  I only want to know what's wrong with me and nothing else. I'm also just a 13 year old and at my age this stuff is going to affect me very badly in my future."
1165,My classes cause me depression,
1166,Does anyone understand what my problem may be?,"Hey reddit, 
This is my first post so sorry for any mistakes in how I'm supposed to do this, I just needed opinions if anyone knows what it's happening with me. 

So basically, whenever I meet people, even friends, after they leave me for the evening or whenever we part ways I cant help but replay all our conversations and worry about what I might of said or if I have said something that will make them think badly of me or bored them or I worry about how I looked etc. If I don't know them very well it's even worse, I even feel a sensation of not really being able to breathe freely I'm so anxious about our time together. 

Our conversations can be nothing but positive but I still get it, it just takes less time to finally have the feeling subside but if there was even a moment of silence or awkwardness with people or a slight disagreement (not an argument or anything) I replay it over and over and continue to feel anxious whenever I think of them until it's been weeks later. It's also explained better in how I dont mind public speaking in the moment but afterwards I replay everything and feel anxious about it even though I wasnt anxious coming up to or doing the speech. 

I dont feel that anxious or really anxious at all meeting new people or meeting up with friends, it all just happens afterwards when I go home and scrutinise my every word and movement from the whole day. I wait anxiously to see if they invite somewhere else again or send me a message or meme to start relaxing that our friendship wasnt affected. It's really strange and I dont really understand what it is since social anxiety is usually also before meeting etc. So I'm not sure what is wrong with me. 

Any help if anyone recognizes this is very much appreciated!"
1167,For the professionals and entrepreneurs here,What is the main cause of stress in your life?
1168,finding positivity in a hopeless situation,"So I’m 26 and a few days ago I meant a guy (34) we connected right away on this dating sight threw out all of my issues with anxiety I craved a connection with someone I felt lonely. 

That’s when I went on plenty of fish and though majority fo the time I’m hesitant with dating sights period I can honestly say I don’t regret it at all 

I shared my last experince with my sexual abuse a a child and my struggles threw out my teenage years and he listened and showed so much empathy and compassion 

I honestly think I’m starting to fall for him he’s opened so many doors for me for my future and makes me see my potential and though we aren’t at the moment in a committed relationship right at the moment I’m happy to say for once that my future is looking bright 


If you ever feel hopeless there’s always some out there for you wether that’s romantic or not we all need someone to connected with it’s so much harder to do it alone"
1169,Life is a lie,"I am unsure of everything at this point. Life just feels meaningless. And before anyone goes and say that life's meaning is what you give to it, i want to share my POV on life or our existence.

There seems to be no point in living on, doing what we do everyday, hanging out, having fun [etc.](https://etc.It)

It all feels so artificial, so fake, the goals and dreams we set for ourselves in life, maybe being a teacher, a top athlete, a great son so on and so forth. It is all just a lie we feed ourselves, to make us feel like there is a purpose in the first place. We often used the word FIND when we find something we want to do in life, like travelling the world, making the world a better place, or achieving our personal goals and dreams, as though the purpose was there all this time, and we just didn't look hard or far enough. But to me, it feels like a lie we have created for ourselves, to make us forget about that there is no point in life.

To go more in depth on what i mean by no point in life, everything we do will eventually cease to exist, we can be an inventor, a world record breaking athlete, someone who has killed millions someone who has helped change the life of billions for the better, no matter how big or small our achievements, it will eventually be forgotten. Our names may live on for a while after our death, like how great people from the past are still remembered for their poetry, philosophy or their inventions and contributions to mankind, but can the same be said a few hundred billion years later, when even our universe may cease to exist, and if the answer is yes, does it even matter at the point, they are already dead. It feels pointless to even try, when nothing will matter at the end. This view in life is quite similar  to a post another redditor u/Finsternis made 5 years ago

[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cmzzf/cmv\_life\_is\_meaningless\_there\_is\_no\_point\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cmzzf/cmv_life_is_meaningless_there_is_no_point_in/)

At this point in time most people will provide a solution or answer to my statement above where there is no point ultimately. And that is to either  
1)be happy in the moment  
2) create goals for yourself  
3)everything done on earth is just a test, the creator,  jesus christ, god or any other holy being has a greater purpose for you , you just gotta believe(personally i do not like religious answers as it feels like more lies they tell themselves to distract them from the big question )

4) (INSERT other motivational stuff)

which all falls back to the start of the post. All these ways of coping with meaningless in our life is to lie to ourselves , to keep us distracted, so we will spend so much of our time achieving our goals that we completely forget about the meaning in life in the first place. 

And i'm not saying that is a bad thing, lying to ourselves is a great way to forget about the big question in life, allowing us to have something to work towards, making us feel like there is a reason in everything. But that can only be said for those who can lie well enough to themselves and personally, the lie i have created for myself feels like it is falling apart. 

I have tried to give my own life a false sense of meaning by having dreams and goals as well, but at some point i just cannot push myself anymore, i cannot motivate myself to achieve the goal knowing that it is all just a lie i created. I've tried surrounding myself with great people and getting negative people out of my life, i created a dream for myself to keep myself distracted and i give it my all. But at the end of the day, no matter how much progress i make , no matter how much effort, the feeling of fulfillment only lasts for a while before i start thinking about purpose in life again. And it feels like the only way to truly stop this train of thought is to end life itself so that we wouldn't have to ponder over our existence anymore.(i do not believe in afterlife after death nor do i believe in any creator or god so i assume death is the end my life).And the only reason that i have yet to end my life is cause i am a coward, someone who is afraid of ending it all, unless there was a truly painless way for me to go i would not mind, i am willing to leave everything behind. I just can't live this lie much longer, its driving me insane the more and more i think about it.

The reason i am writing this is to vent and hopefully make myself feel better by distracting myself from the purpose in life and my existential in the current moment as well as try to get some thoughts from others who may or may not be experiencing the same thing .And for those that have a meaning they give to their own lives(a lie,distraction)Do share with me  what meaning you have given to your life and how it has helped distract you from existential crisis."
1170,Back to the same position again-almost,"A few years ago I was made redundant which made me breakdown mentally. I was suicidal for a few weeks and generally being in my own version of hell. Luckily I found a great job that allowed me to recover. 
Last month I was made redundant again, this time round I am not suicidal, just feeling down. I guess working on my mental health through mindfulness helped me realise that I can cope. Still it’s not a good feeling that I have and it is difficult to get used to the new reality of being unemployed during COVID period."
1171,My dear friend is in a downward spiral,"Hello guys, my neighbour and dear friend (24 y/o) has been having substance abuse issues for a long time and now things have reached a very very serious level. He's become a danger to himself and to others, telling me about his various self inflicted cuts, midnight tattoings, knife threats to others and more... This destructive version of him came up in the last 5 months before that he was half a year sober and on medication (having been emergency hospitalised because of a drunken suicidal episode in December, 2019). 
Just yesterday I've heard from his cousin that he attacked his dad with a knife, high on cocaine. Luckily his dad tackled him to the ground and took the knife away, but then my friend went to his room and punched a hole through the wall, before repeatedly hitting his face. I was also told that the next morning he felt utter regret upon sobering up, that's why I still have hope. 
At this phase I'm to scared to meet him, having felt threathened the last time we've met just a few weeks ago. But I want to help, he's my best friend since childhood after all and I cry knowing that I'm scarred of even metting him in person... 
I feel like I should do something before it's too late, I talked to his cousin about contacting the police but were both to unsure about that idea. Bringing ourselves and the police into this might trigger my friend. I'm scarred guys, please help me with your answers, thank you!

My teacher asked us: I wonder why the students from 2 years ago, had a straight A result, anyone mind guessing?
I was thinking: ""We are entirely different people, you don't compare stuff like that.""
The straight A student of the class said: ""Because my classmates don't care for if they get through school or not!!""
With that annoying slightly mocking tone of voice. It made me so mad. I do care for my education. I need to be at this school to go to university. I need to go to university to become a therapist. It's my goal. I want to help people who are suffering. And I don't care?!
I'm loosing my head over this!
I've been busy and we've been writing atleast 2 tests a week for the past month or two. I'm moving out of my room into my brother's old one the past week. I don't have as much time to study as before. So I couldn't study for math as much. I was actually good at the topic but the test had no similarities to the practice exercises we were given that our teacher said are ""exactly like the test"". I'm furious. I'm sad. I'm confused.

1175,"I think I have some kind of anxiety problem, but I don't know what it is and why I came to develop it. How should I tell my parents I need help?","First, I want to apologize because English is not my first language, so there might be typos and grammar errors.

I'm 17 years old. For a long time now I've had many, many emotional breakdowns for many reasons and I'm pretty sure I had mild depression during my middle school years, and I also have had suicidal thoughts and self-harming urges, although the only thing I've ever done to self-harm is beating myself with words and scratching my arms, never anything that could leave marks or serious injuries. But, I've never had any kind of diagnosis.

I have always been an emotional and shy person for as long as I can remember. I have always taken many things to heart, I vividly remember every single moment that makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed, even when it's about normal things that, for example, a child would do, and I've always felt anxious around strangers, specially uncomfortable when I have to talk with them.

During my middle school years, I told my mom I was feeling depressed many times. But I could never explain my reasons, because the moment I started crying I couldn't talk. This happened a lot, and in the end she started to tell me it was my fault because I didn't put enough effort to feel better.

I have also broke down crying in front of my whole family for small reasons, like not knowing if I had classes the next day, or being watched while I tried to serve something on a glass. It just feels like they don't even bat an eye to it anymore, like they don't even care or just think I'm exaggerating.

I had a laptop that accidentaly broke because of my dog, and that day I cried hard and had a hard time breathing because my parents and brother told me it was all my fault and they were angry. It didn't help that my mom stayed in my room for a long time without even saying anything.

And today, the new laptop they bought second hand for me to take my online classes turned off on its own, twice. I haven't even moved it from the desk they left it in when they bought it. And the moment this happened, I started crying again because I just know they are going to be mad and it's going to be my fault even if I didn't do anything if this one breaks too.

So today I finally realized I'm definitely not okay, but since I've never had any diagnosis I'm not sure if I can call any of this anxiety or depression. And I don't know how can I ask for help when that's clearly never worked when I tried before.

Has anyone gone through something similar?"

I recently lost my boyfriend to suicide and I am not handling it well. He had been acting weird the days leading up to it but it was really unexpected and happened out of no where. The day before it happened we even came up with a list of all these plans and goals, like no self harm and reconnecting with people he cared for. I don't know what to do. I'm at work right now because I can't really get more time off but I can't focus and I keep having panic attacks. I feel like I failed him. I should have just stayed awake with him, or made him come to bed with me. We had been living together and he was the only saving grace in my day to day life. The only thing to look forward to after a long day of working a shitty, underpaid, sexist job. I feel like I have no drive or motivation any more. I feel like it's never going to get better and everyone keeps saying it will, but he was the sunshine in my day and now it's just dark. I don't know how to work through this."

Situation: 
1) (The main reason and trigger why I am sad and acutally want to die..) The guy I was seeing for 2 months doesn’t wanna see me anymore. He said that he can’t imagine being in a relationship with me. I think I am unloveable, so no wonder why he said that! But I am still in love with him and wished that he was too. I can’t even see other men because I am way too shy! I will never have a boyfriend and no one will ever love me back because I am ugly and complicated and just unloveable. 
2) Also I am in a fight with two friends because they won’t believe me. They hate me now. You see, not even my friends like me.
3) I can’t begin to study this year so I have to look for a job.

1181,OCD tendencies and anxiety while dating,"Hi everyone!

I struggle with a trifecta of anxiety, OCD, and depression. I find that all of these are heightened when dating because of the unknown and all of the insecurities you have in the early stages of developing feelings and getting to know someone. I’ve been dating someone for a month, so it’s still early days, but I’m getting attached. 

Lately I have found myself entering spirals of panic that lead to me constantly reading relationship advice articles, asking questions on reddit, or seeking reassurance from friends. Anything he does or doesn’t do sets my mind off. I constantly check his profiles to see if he’s updating them. When he doesn’t text me, I assume he’s out with someone else. I’ve deleted my dating apps so I can’t check his profile, but then I just go ahead and redownload them.

I can usually level with myself to a certain degree and get back to a logical POV, but I’m tired of having to spend hours reassuring myself. How do I stop these habits? I have a lot of hobbies to keep me busy, but living alone and working alone during COVID makes it worse."
1182,"I think I need help, but don't know how to ask for it?","So this may sound dumb or stupid to some people but I've been struggling with recurring mental health issues for some time and just need to get this off my chest, and some advice too I guess. May get a bit ranty and long but please bear with me.

I've struggled with depression and social anxiety during my teenage years. I ended up getting help (in spite of my parents insistence that mental illnesses aren't a thing) and after two years of treatment and me graduating from highschool I felt better and discontinued treatment. Things were great for about a year and a half. I moved to a new city for university, but I made friends easily, joined a local sports team, and did decently well in university.

But all that changed. I started feeling depressed again, but at first I thought that I would be fine going through this by myself, that it was just a rough patch, and I didn't want to ""bother"" anyone. But slowly I started regressing, and eventually had what I would describe as ""severe episodes"" where I stopped going to university, I stopped going to sports, stopped hanging out with my friends, and in extreme cases couldn't even get out of bed to eat, take a shower, basically I didn't function. I dropped out of uni, haven't gone to sports in over a year (before I used to go 6 days a week, sometimes twice a day) only eat enough as to not pass out during the day, and struggled through minimum wage jobs to keep a roof over my head, and got fired twice. Right now I'm living off of my savings. I started feeling a bit better since this May, enough for me to realize that if I continue on like this Is probably end up out on the street, killing myself, or both . I reenrolled for Uni and my semester is starting in Novemeber (due to covid they moved the starting date). I managed to get a part time job that I push myself to go to, and forced myself to go back to the gym and try to stay active (but going twice a week at most currently). However a part of me knows or is at least afraid that I will get worse again, and I don't think I can pull myself out of this again if it happens, I'm barely able to do so right now as it is.

Yet I can't seem to bring myself to get help. Every time I go to look for a therapist or consider going to the doctor I freeze up before I can do so. A part of it is because I can't seem to formulate exactly what to say to them(I mean look at this amount of text that I needed here), another is that I'm afraid that even if I do get my point across they won't believe me or just wave me off. And another part is that voice in my head that, like my parents before, believes that I'm just lazy and/or lacking discipline. But I also know that I can't keep going like this, and that if I don't get help or change anything I will just waste another year like this, or worse.

So I guess what I'm asking is, what should I do, and how do I overcome my fears and ask for the help that I need? I'm stuck, and I need help getting unstuck."
1183,"I had my first manic episode, does that mean I have a bipolar disorder even if it's just a one-off instance of mania?","About a month ago I started taking medication for adhd/depression for the first time in my life. My psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin. He chose this because I told him I get very anxious throughout the week and he didn't want to prescribe me any sort of stimulant because he thought it might worsen my anxiety. Last week I had my first manic episode and it was intense. I never knew much about mania aside from a few instances my friends have told me they experienced, so I didn't really know what was happening at the time until mid-episode where I called a friend and they explained to me what a manic episode is and everything fit me to a T.   


Since then I've been doing research on mania and found out it's linked to bipolar disorder. My question is do one-off manic episodes happen which means it's nothing to stress about or does it mean that I may have bipolar disorder and should I get diagnosed for it?  Maybe medicated?"
1184,Too Self Aware,"With all of the isolation and quarantine policies becoming too self-aware may be more common than I think.  Personally, what my ears are hearing from my environment, interactions, tv, radio, etc, is having a negative effect on my life.  I have read a few articles about joining groups, or sitting alone in a dark room to become less self-aware, but I feel that it isn't enough.  Anyone have any suggestions for decreasing self-awareness?"
1185,Does Anyone Know of a Website or App That Can help Me With Depression?," I feel depressed. Enough to negatively affect my life but not enough to go as far as wanting suicide. It is honestly something I can't afford to deal with anymore, and frankly I don't want to deal with it anyway. I just want this feeling to end, so is there anything you guys can recommend?"
1186,(rant)Sometimes I wake up and I just wanna die,"Sometimes I wake up and I just wanna die like not die die but like completely vanish from existence, I've had enough. I mean, I just wanna be at peace is that too much to ask for? 
Anyone?"
1187,Mental health,"Why is it ? Why does having a mental illness sometimes make you feel trapped and so alone . Even in a room crowded with people . It doesn’t change how lonely and alone you feel . You put on a smile acting like everything is just ok . But when your by yourself with your own thoughts. That when everything comes back .

I’ve been struggling with mental health for a very long time . Was diagnosed with bi polar and ptsd so far until they can get me evaluated. I guess substance abuse goes hand and hand with bi polar or any mental disorder it seems . 

Some days are better then others I’ll be honest . Others are like I’m fatigued don’t wanna get out of bed . But I force myself to get up and get active. Usually it works it clears my mind . But there is no magic pill to fix everything for everyone.

Was wonder why does mental health cause people to feel like that for ."
1188,i feel like my life up until now is a dream,"dont know if i need to add a tw but just incase-tw for sexual assualt and abuse mentions
im not sure if this belongs here and i made this account just to ask about this but; i feel like my life right now is a dream . i had a pretty bad childhood , my mom would leave me alone for days at a time and one of her boyfriends ended up sexual assaulting me sometime between the age of 4-7 (im sorry i cant remember) . my grandparents would yell at me and sometimes hit me too . after a while all of it kind of just stopped once my mom decided she needed to be in my life more . i no longer live with her but instead live with my grandparents who i argue with every now and then but it doesnt bother me as much because i know a majority of the things they tell me is just them trying to get under my skin . ive been like this for a while but i feel like everything from the period where things calmed down until now is just a dream and im going to wake up still as a child . any reason why? also sorry if this came off as me just rambling about trauma for attention lol."
1189,How to Cope Positively with Failure/Perfectionism?,"Hi everyone,

I have always been an overachiever in an academic context. I graduated with near perfect grades in both high school and college (I graduated this past spring with a biochemistry degree). I decided to attend dental school, particularly an accelerated program in which I will finish a year early. I just finished by first quarter, and I got a 2.7 GPA, my grades have never been this low in my life. 

We take both lecture and preclinical courses (drilling plastic teeth and sculpting teeth out of wax). I got a C in the waxing/indirect vision course (the main focus of this course is to work on crowns). I got a D in the drilling course (fillings). The reason I got a D was because I failed the last practical, which was worth a majority of the grade this quarter. Aside from these poor grades, I got As and Bs in the lectures. Lab is definitely tough because it's a new skill, and one factor to consider about these grades: they are all interim. I can improve my grades until the end of the academic year, which is when everything is finalized. So, if I bust my butt, I can pull my lab grades up to As, or Bs in the worst case scenario. Some of the battle is just developing the skills, and I have been practicing diligently over the break we just had last week, and I think I improved a lot even in that short span of time.

I was just seeking advice on how to keep pushing forward and not give up, I've always aspired to enter the dental field. Dental school is hard, and I sort of felt I wasn't cut out for the field based on my performance in the beginning. I would like to improve, but I feel somewhat discouraged because I have some steep learning curves to overcome. I forgot to mention, I will be remediating the lab I got a D in, which is basically extra practice time (this is a bonus because we have limited lab time during the week b/c of COVID). 

My back-up career is to be a PhD in biochemistry since I love research, but this is a longer schooling and does not guarantee the financial stability dental school does. Those are two factors that are holding me back from leaving dental school. 

Anyone have any words of wisdom/advice? Thank you so much!"
1190,Rants,"Really don't see the point in anything anymore, I don't enjoy the things I used to and everything is just grey, used to fantasise about suicide then puss out but now it doesnt phase me. I feel like I don't sleep even when I do, I can't trust people because I've been fucked too many times by people I trusted and although I want to I can't. Tried to talk to friends but they've said for years that life will get better but it just doesn't, half of my friends don't feel real and the other half are too wrapped up in their own lives to listen. I can't even escape into the things I loved because I don't enjoy them anymore, I don't really enjoy anything other than nothing. The best part of the day for me that split second waking up not realising who you are what day it is and feeling OK. Can't wait till my parents die so I can kill myself so my death doesn't hurt them. I have and am nothing and no one understands what it's like to be empty. I wish I had motivation but I don't and even though I try I just can't feel motivated, I feel trapped and there's nothing I can do about it. I just want this all to end but I don't want anyone to feel the way that I do now.

I'm sorry if this Isnt allowed I have no one i can talk to about this and need to get this off my chest"
1191,Should I admit?,"I'm 22. I'm married. I'm a mother to a beautiful, sweet little girl. 
I'm also a compulsive liar. I feel like if I tell people the truth, I'll get in trouble. It's like a fight or flight system in me, it's never anything big, little white lies all of the time. And I'm always on the verge of fighting. Everything my husband does, EVEN IF I APPRECIATE IT, I start an argument. It isn't because I'm unhappy. I can't tell if it's just anxiety. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, OCD and anxiety. That was around 2014. I haven't been to a psychiatrist/psychologist since. And now I'm seeing things. And it feels like the entire world is against me. I moved in with my roommates a month or so ago, and I genuinely think they hate me. Like, I panic as soon as we're in the same room. I get nauseous and I just, gotta go. And my moods are constantly shifting. I missed two days of work last week because I was panicking and couldn't control my crying. I can't have a normal day if I'm not smoking weed (at least once a day, sometimes two) and even then, I cry WHILE I smoke. It's a reliever for me, it doesn't cause anxiety. But it doesnt take away from it anymore. I think about killing myself all of the time, and it's been that way for years. I picture myself running into brick walls until I'm having to peel myself off to do it again. I have hallucinations. I see things like dead people on the side of the road, there's a very gnarly old man that wants me to take a bite of his sandwich and it's always got mold and bugs crawling around it, it's caused a major food diversion. I've only told my husband about that man one time, but I see him more frequently than I like to admit. I started seeing things post pregnancy, so for about a year now.

Is it time for me to admit? I want to be the best person I can be for them. The anger I feel towards people can't be normal. It's to the point where sometimes I feel like I'm the normal one, and everybody else is out to tell me I'm stupid and wrong. So, please. An unbiased opinion from anybody would mean the world right now."
1192,Incredibly low self-esteem,"I've been suffering from depression for around 5 years but will say I've always had self-confidence through all of this. I was the person who was brought to chat with strangers and do new daring stuff. My lack of confidence started this year when I was made redundant. I considered myself good in my trade but for whatever reason I was chosen as the least valuable from the 6 people who all did the same job. Now I'm getting rejection after rejection for other jobs, but this has started to affect my social skills also. 

I keep trying new things but with my lack of confidence, I seem to always fail which leads to my confidence being hit more. This has lead me to extreme anxiety as its now at the point where social situations feel off. I feel like compliments or laughter is out of pity. Insults are 1 thing they chose to say out of hundreds they held back and scenarios unrelated to me are twisted in my head to be against me or my fault... This includes the way strangers I walk in the street act making me not want to leave the house. This is ruining my relationships with people making people not want to hang out anymore. 

I try to be very proactive with my mental health, but every attempt is leading to failure with me beating myself down even further with it. Therapy and medication aren't really having any positive effect, and I'd say opening up to my support network has made it worse as they've either become overly mothering or tried making it into a joke which feels malicious but due to my anxiety I don't even know if its in my head or not.... This makes me question if every negative social situation is in my head or not and what do I do. Do I just accept that people naturally dislike me for no reason, or if I feel like they dislike me do I carry on attempting with them and possibly suffer a bigger confidence hit when they confirm my suspicions? (I used to have such good social skills)

Couple all this with my depression and its leading to very frequent suicidal thoughts as I feel like that's where this pit ends but I don't want to go there yet but I would rather that than live feeling like I do now"
1193,Any tips on how to calm down/ de-stress quickly?,I work a lot. I work in marketing I only have about two hours out of the entire day that aren’t devoted to working commuting or sleeping. I’m stress but having a large work load is part of the job. I try deep breathing but with so much on my plate it gets really loud in my head and it becomes hard to get anything done. If I could just calm down a little I know I’d be able to tackle everything in time. But having a self love day or meditating isn’t really an option at the moment and the guilt of doing anything other than work makes relaxing impossible.
1194,People who married/dated people with anxiety how hard it was to be with them and how you dealt with their anxiety?,I never dealt with other people anxiety just mine.. i just wondering how hard it was to help them and  how hard it was to clam them when their were really anxious
1195,Someone I was close to killed themself and I don’t know how I feel,"I miss them, a lot. I want them back and it’s only been a few days. I have so many questions I’ll never get answers too and it’s infuriating. I don’t want them to be gone, I want them back. They deserve life. Other than that, there’s just. Nothing. I’m blank and empty and I hate it. I want to be angry at the world and to be sad but I just can’t. Is something wrong with me? Did I do something? Can I do something?"
1196,Depression is a hell,"I just want to say that a depression is such a hell. Until I became depressed myself I never thought it would be this hard. And I'm not even been depressed for a very long time.
A lot of respect for people who have to deal with these feelings for a long time"

1199,Why do people have a problem with me?,"I got my problems with racism and disrespectful people. I admit that, I can become really angry when someone talks bad about someone with another background and when people talk bad about cultures. I just wanted to start over again in this new class I started in and be the kind guy I always wanted to be. Well guess how that turned out, people don't like me for no reason. Previously this girl I am sitting with in french class did I hear talking about how much she hates me. All I did was being nice and I mean it. I helped her on her homework test for a better grade and I were geniunly nice to her. So I heard her friend ask her why she didn't like me and she told her she don't know. This also happend in english class were I just talked to get a better grade, as soon as I got the wrong answer on a question. Everybody was laughing at me and calling me how stupid I am. The worst part is that they don't want to be near me because I can get really angry when things are so unfair as I told before, when people are being racists and such. So when I am letting the things out all of them looks at me like I am the biggest weird guy in the entire world who can't control his anger and right after class they hang around the guy who got anger issues. Who is known for destroying doors because he didn't get the right answer on a test. It's like the famous meme I wish I had someone like you but you are you. I got everything they are looking for, I helped people with studying and I even bought people food when they forgot their lunch money. I helped people more than I helped myself but it was all for nothing."
1200,On the verge of a mental break down - just need a pep talk.,[removed]
1201,Sometimes I just can’t support my friend,"My best friend is super insecure, has anxiety problems and constantly thinks she’s gonna fail even though she’s smart( she doesn’t think she is). I’m always there for her and I always calm her down and comfort her. I think most of the time I manage to make her actually have more confidence in herself and feel like she’s not gonna fail, but sometimes I just can’t do it. Sometimes I feel like I can’t argue and convince her, I just don’t have the mental energy sometimes and at other times I’m not in the right mental space to be able to help her.I’ve talked to her so many times about it, I just can’t anymore. It’s not just her either. I’m always there for my friends to vent to and stuff. I reassure and support and do everything I can. I can’t do it anymore. I  feel like a piece of shit for it, but I just can’t be positive and reassuring. I feel like I’m being a shitty person and a bad friend."
1202,I think I might be depressed,"I’ve always struggled with anxiety and insecurity, and when I was younger— around like 13/15— I was in a very dark place mentally. But I improved over the years, I think.

I mean, when I was around 17 I really rose up out of the hole I was in. (I didn’t do it on my own, I had support at the time.) But I don’t feel the way I did then. (I’m 19 now) Now I don’t know... when I feel any negative sort of way, I push it down and try to pretend I’m not feeling it. And it’s not that I hide it, it’s just that I don’t see a reason for mentioning it and no one ever asks if I’m okay, if I’m really okay. 

So I just put on a smile and say that I’m okay, but I don’t think I am anymore and I don’t think I have been for awhile. Because every day as soon as I wake up it begins, all my overwhelming thoughts and bad feelings, and I try to distract myself and sometimes that works but usually it doesn’t, I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why I can’t just have one good day anymore. 

If it wasn’t for my boyfriend and my best friend I probably wouldn’t even get out of bed or get on my phone. I just want to lay in bed and tune out the world, but I can’t. So I get up, and I go through the motions. I shower even though I don’t want to. I eat even though I don’t want to. I smile and say I’m okay, even though I don’t think it’s true anymore. 

And it’s just getting to the point where I feel like I can’t breathe. But I don’t know what to do.  

Am I depressed? Is this just in my head?"
1203,Mental Health Classes,Do you think schools should focus on educating children with regards to mental health at a young age along with P.E classes?
1204,Why do I cry with confrontation?,"Basically, it's like I can't be angry or look angry. Everytime I face confrontation/fighting I end up crying, even when I'm the one initiating it. I feel so bad because I don't want to cry AT ALL but I can't help it, I hold it until I can't do it anymore and then it's like I can't stop. Sometimes I can be super mad and angry, but since I cry it's just looks like I'm sad and my anger is not taken upon in a serious way.

 But most of the times it's like I don't even feel angry, I just feel sad, and I cry, but it's not that big of a deal, I don't feel that profundily sad, but I can't help it to cry it out. It makes me feel bad because then the other person with whom I'm having a discussion with thinks that I'm suddenly deeply affected by it, but that's usually not the case, it's just that I can't handle confrontation for a long time and my natural response is to cry, specially if it's with a close person like a family member or my partner, specially my partner. 

I really avoid confrontation as long as I can, not just because of this, but mostly because of it, because my emotional response to it in the outside is bigger than the inside. I know there are people that ""fake"" the cry and force themselves to cry on this situations to end the fighting, but I have the opposite problem, I try to hold it as much as I can so I can have an actual productive confrontation but then it just goes out like the fucking Niagara falls and it just doesn't stop, and then I just keep talking in a normal tone of voice while crying and people get very confuse. Maybe it's just the zodiac and we can blame it on my Pisces Sun/Venus who knows. I'd like to know if there are more people like this and what might be the cause for this kind of response..."
1205,Anybody feeling down with online classes?,"They are really difficult and I feel there is not much support from schools behind the computer. I just got a job which has been great for social interaction but that is only 3 days a week. I hope you are all doing well, feel free to share your tips to cheer spirts with online classes!"
1206,I’m sick of being viewed as the “unstable” one in my family.,"The most defining aspect of my existence — to my family — seems to be my mental health. Everyone knows that I have been unwell (not by choice, I just had stopped showing up to family gatherings due to social anxiety and so my mom explained my situation to them), and it seems to be the only thing that anyone knows about me, which is partly my fault, but they also seem to believe that struggling with mental health makes you some kind of defected spectacle which they feel the need to steer away from, or worse, begin to monitor my every move because I’m “unpredictable” despite never doing anything to suggest that I am. I understand that they don’t know enough about me or the topic of mental illness / health to even begin to view it without bias, or ever realize how nuanced it is, but it still is frustrating. I brought it up to my mom and she told me to just accept it and that “everyone has to deal with it”. I feel like I’m not allowed to be frustrated. But I don’t know how not to be. I’m just tired; tired of being the odd one out, tired of being viewed as inferior, tired of being ignored, invalidated, called “dramatic”, and god I am tired of being accused of being attention seeking; especially when I have panic attacks. I don’t force myself into them, but I have been accused of making them up for attention. I hate attention, I have social anxiety for god-sake. Just because you don’t understand something does not give you the right to invalidate it. It feels so isolating and I don’t know how to explain how I feel without them viewing me as crazy in some sense. I’m exhausted."
1207,I think I might be depressed,"I’ve always struggled with anxiety and insecurity, and when I was younger— around like 13/15— I was in a very dark place mentally. But I improved over the years, I think.

1208,What is your response when a person says that you're living in your own world and don't have any connection to reality?,"There's a high chance my mother will say this to me whenever we have an argument. Thing is: She doesn't refer to my mental illness. According to her, I am out of touch with reality because of my special interests, which she claims have nothing to do with real life. My love for a dead man is another reason for her to say I'm living in my own world, although I barely even talk about him and she doesn't even understand what I truly feel. None of this is preventing me from living my life. In fact, my special interests and the love I feel, despite of all the hate I've experienced, are what makes me happy.

So, my question is: What is your response when a person says that you're living in your own world and don't have any connection to reality?"

1210,Did you see Freddie Flintoff's documentary 'Living With Bulimia'?,"Did any of you see Freddie Flintoff's documentary 'Living With Bulimia'?

I recorded my 5min reaction here: [https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho](https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho)

For non-UK people: Andrew (Freddie) Flintoff is a very famous ex-England cricket captain who has recently opened about his struggles with Bulimia throughout his career.

He is a real down-to-earth masculine bloke which is why his Bulimia is so shocking, as it fundamentally tests our stereotypes of the condition.

There were 3 main areas which especially resonated with me, because I saw strong parallels with my own experience:

1. **Aversion to getting outside** **help** e.g. getting help means accepting being vulnerability
2. **Exercise as an obsession** e.g. Freddie trains 9-10 per week, I used to train 12 times per week
3. **Low body confidence** e.g we both do a lot of ""body checking"" via repeatedly pinching parts of the body

Did any of you watch it and have other things which resonated?

Sending support to you all."
1211,Anxiety medication,Hi! I'm thinking of taking some kind of vitamins/pills for anxiety but also for concentration because with the accumulation of anxiety that I have I can not concentrate / pay attention on things ... You take something for anxiety? what is you advise?
1212,Growing up with a schizophrenic mother,"I was recently told, 2 days ago, that my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'm a 39 year old male, and it's pretty frustrating that her obvious symptoms growing up weren't taken seriously. I'm not really venting for attention, but being the oldest I was always the whipping boy when she frequently flew off the handle, so trying to process and understand this diagnosis has been tough. 

My father didn't tell us because of fear of shame, which I've been reading is pretty common and I now forgive him for. But it's very frustrating, because I've also read that the chances that offspring of someone with schizophrenia having a mental disease themselves are very high. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in junior high, but they decided to look the other way for the same exact reasons: the public persona that comes with your wife or child having schizophrenia.

Still, it's nice to know that, in 2020, maybe we've come a long way in terms of mental health awareness, and how important it is to take symptoms and diagnoses seriously. Since I've been on my own, I've managed my ADHD through medication, and I take it very seriously. But if my mom got help and was diagnosed when I was younger, I just feel like I would have been more equipped and more likely to function in my academics, in life, in relationships, and with resolving basic conflicts.  I would have been a better athlete, went to a better college, took my studies more seriously.

Instead, we all continue to tolerate my mother's constant mood swings, and she's made everyone's life around her a living hell for the last 40+ years.

Mental illness is nothing to take lightly. Why do we care so much about what other people think, instead of taking the time to think about how a mental illness can affect family members and friends? Hopefully someone reading this can relate, or understand. I don't have kids, I'm not married. I try to take time to process things and deal with my ""shit"", so that it doesn't get worse. So that I don't just sweep it under the rug. 

But why is it that, when you try to address it with some people, they just emotionally shut down and play the ""tough guy"" role? It's just really frustrating, but hopefully in 2020 future generations will learn from our mistakes."
1213,I feel lonely,I live in a small city and the few friends I have don't live here and I don't have a lot of money and can't always take the train to the next city. Covid is making it hard to meet new people and even though uni is starting again soon I feel like I won't meet many people because our classes will be online.
1214,I dont know how many more shits i have left to give.,"For the first time in my life I want to run away from everything and everyone. Every day seems harder than the last. Finding happy thoughts isn't working when all your happy thoughts get drowned out by everything else. I can't control certain threads of thought. One simple thing turns into an avalanche of thoughts that control my day. 

No friends
Can't talk with wife
I know I need therapy but I have a hard time talking to people. Conversation do not come naturally to me.

How do I go about opening up to a therapist because something needs to change."
1215,What happens when I tell my doctor about my mental health?,"I’m scheduled for an regular checkup but I know that I’ve spiraled too far with some of my behavior and that I need professional help. I’m really worried about what will happen though. I want to tell my doctor about how shitty and unhappy I feel, about having suicidal thoughts, and about binging and purging every other day. I’m don’t want to self-diagnose here, but I’m pretty sure I’ve had some kind of eating disorder since I was about 11 or 12 ish? That’s definitely one thing I want to bring up for sure. I’m 17 now and it’s way out of control. Does being a minor affect treatment? Will my parents have to know all the details? Since they’re paying for it, they’ll have to know the diagnosis but not other details, right? Also, can I be forced to accept treatment? I’m especially worried about the financial side of things. Any insight helps. Thanks :)"
1216,OCD is hard to overcome,"It is so hard to overcome OCD for me the fear of no do the compulsions is a hard thing to do but I know that I can do it and that you can do it the person that is reading this and is going through something like this to, but that is all I have to say have a great day."
1217,I pace a lot,"I can pace for hours in total in a day. I know it is linked to mental illness and I am being treated for my anxiety and depression in general.  


Is it okay to try to pace less? Will it make my anxiety worse or anything? Are there things I could do that will help anxiety instead of pacing that i could try doing when i have the need to pace? it interferes with work because it's strong urges to get up and pace.  


Thanks for any advice. As far back as I can remember it's a thing I've done. I am 23 now. I remember being 5 or so and still doing it. I think when I do it and I imagine things/worlds/scenarios that aren't ever REALLY important ya know? So it doesn't matter if I don't think about them. idk."
1218,How can I (28F) overcome erotomania?,"I have a small history of some phobias and dissociation. From, my childhood onwards I used to have this erotomania, when I used to strongly imagine that some person is secretly in love with me. Sometimes my delusion were very strong.

Now I have a crush on my supervisor (32M). The hard part is that I'm partly convinced that he has a special affection towards me as well. But this thought is not at all good for a healthy relationship with my supervisor. A logical part of me knows that, all these thoughts are unreal. But at the same time, my poor heart craving for attention strongly believes in the love and find indirect clues of my supervisor's affection. What can I do to clear my mind off these thoughts?

TLDR; I have an erotomania on my supervisor, which is not good for our relationship. How can I overcome that?"
1219,I keep getting flashes of moments in my life that I miss. They’re usually sparked by smells but sometimes by nothing at all.,"It’s fairly new, I’m not sure what to think of it. I’m at a stage in my life where I know what I want, but only very generally... I think, probably in some ways due to covid, I’m just experiencing very, very little right now. 

The most vivid ‘flash’ I had was when I was walking home from work one day and for a second I thought I smelled weed. At university I studied in Humboldt County, CA for a semester. Although I’m very aware of how much I miss that period of my life, when I thought I smelled weed that night it really brought me back very vividly to being with flatmates that I got on so well with, and being far happier than I realised at the time, and I felt like crying. 

I dunno, I keep having moments like this. Like a kind of pleasant deja vu? But I don’t know."
1220,How can I get over my feeling of self worthlessness,"For the past few months life has just seemed empty for me. As if there's no point in anything. I find no joy from anything and I have no motivation to do anything. Life just seems so pointless currently. I'd recently started talking to a girl and things were going great. I started to have motivation to improve myself and try to excel at things such as school because of her. It seemed like we were actually going to have a relationship; things were going so well. Then all of a sudden she just stops talking to me and has lost all interest. I now feel way worse than I was before and this sort of thing happens every time I start to like someone. I try to tell myself it isn't my fault and ""they're just not right for me"" but I'm clearly the one common denominator in all these cases so I can't help but have this feeling of self loathing/hatred."
1221,I’m so so confused and scared.,"I’m so confused, everything is wrong. The people around me are them but not the real them. They’ve been replaced I’m really scared. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to sleep but I don’t want to be awake either. Everything is really blurry but clear and I can see but it’s just not right. I have no help. No support. What is calling a crisis line going to do? Something needs to be done but what? I need to go somewhere but where? What the hell is my next step. How am I supposed to help myself when I don’t know what’s wrong."
1222,Is there any other form of “help” that isn’t therapy? (UK),"I doubt anyone will read but whatever I don’t have anyone else to ask anymore. Someone I was close friends with constantly told me that I need to go to speak to a therapist but I really do not think it sounds like a good thing. I accept that something needs to be done about how shit I feel all of the time and stuff like that but everything that people say is good about therapy just sounds very bad to me and I don’t think it would help at all. I tried just a couple of meetings with a wellbeing practitioner as that was all my university provided as it was end of term, but it just seemed like pretending that everything is fine but it’s just not? Like how does just imagining your thoughts as different things make any progress in solving the actual problem? 
We’re not really friends anymore because I constantly went to him with my problems so this was sort of a push to get some sort of help but that’s not therapy, if there’s other options?"
1223,Is anyone else a little distressed that so many Americans are medicated?,"About 1 in 6 Americans take some type of psychiatric medication, for ADHD, anxiety, depression, etc. Doesn't this seem a little high? I'm worried we're being massively overmedicated and what the affects these medicines will have on people who don't truly need them."
1224,A distraction I didn't know I needed,"So I dont really know where else to put this?? Kinda feel weird putting it here but I feel like it fits somewhat due to the message I want to send. 

I was having a pretty bad mental health moment this morning and literally all I wanted to do was lay in my bed and disappear. Literally went from a high, intense angry state towards myself with intrusive thoughts and urges of self-harm sprinkled in to a looooow drop from that that I'm still somewhat recovering from. Then eventually, there was a knock on my bedroom door. Enter my little sister, in tears and pain because she accidentally ripped one of her dip-powder nails off and some of her natural nail in the process. 

Welp, that was the last thing I expected but ok. It's all good. It took me a moment to switch from what I was feeling to then thinking of what to do for her, but I did it with the help of google. 

I grabbed nail clippers and slowly chipped at the fake nail bit by bit until I got to the natural nail. I then only clipped off any stray parts that were still sticking out to decrease likelihood of it getting caught on anything. Then I rinsed it with warm water and soap and topped it off with Neosporin and a bandaid. (Wish I had gauze instead honestly, but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes) I also gave her some play dough our mom made her the other day to hold in her other hand during the whole thing. That way she had something to squeeze onto whenever she got nervous or scared and put all the tension into something else. (Its also scented as our mom added essential oils to it) Managed to do all that in time before her next zoom class started, hahaha. 

I wanted to share this to show that while my day started out...quite badly, I got to shift my focus to something like that for a bit and took care of someone else in that sense. I'm no pro at nails or anything, but I did my best at taking good care of her and that in turn helped me feel better once she verbalized feeling much better after everything. 

She has no idea how much this helped me forcefully get out of my head and how much this means to me overall. I didn't feel useless for once and I helped her during one of those every day moments she needed me most (especially since I was the only one home)."
1225,grew up overly pampered by my toxic mother. im 26 now and cant get on with my life because of my ducked up childhood. (LONG),"I just want to let this out because i feel like nowadays most people think that you need to start with your life goals immediately after a certain age or you need to have your life together before you're 30, but most dont realize that some of us cant because of mental health issues that are holding us back and delaying our life goals.

I grew up with an extremely toxic mother that always felt the need to do things for me when i was young and even as i got older. If i ever wanted to do anything on my own she always thought that i couldnt do it with out her. I feel like i was overly pampered. she always wanted me under her control and she always hated the idea of me standing up for myself aswell as with my siblings.

so far i am the only sibling left in the family that hasnt stood up to her. even my younger brother has stood up to her, i know that it was easy for my two youngest siblings because they were her favorites growing up and she was always easier on them because of the fact that they came from a father she loved and she hated my father.

I was raised through fear along with my oldest brother. my brother who is three years younger than me managed to face his fears and tell her that he was leaving because he knew he couldnt live his life if he continued to live with her. i havent reached that point yet and its making me sink deeper. im 26 and i havent accomplished any goals i made for myself back in high school because i always let myself listen to her. 

i went back to college late. my mental health doesnt let me get through college faster or even work and study at the same time. all i think about on a daily is suicide. i still have three years of college left and i can only handle two classes per semester. im struggling to find a job now because she keeps lecturing me about helping her pay bills and pushing me to quit college. shes the reason i started so late. im nearly 30 and cant get my life together. i want to run away from her but too broke to even do that.

i wanted to move out when i was 18, but as soon as i brought it up she started shouting at me calling me ungrateful and gaslighting me. ever since then i never brought up the subject again, but ironically enough once i turned 25 she wouldnt stop talking about how i should have moved out by now. even though she made me feel guilty for telling her prior that i wanted to move out. i dont know whats right or wrong anymore. this is not a way to live.

she comes from a long lineage of toxicity and now she is trying to pass it down to us. talking about my entire family and why its so ducked up will make this post longer, but to make it short basically my grandparents raised my mom and aunts/uncles through violence and manipulation and they tried to engrave in their heads that children are meant to serve their parents forever and not live a life of their own. my aunt and uncles realized this was wrong and left but my mother is the only one that defends my grandparents even though she also left for the exact same reasons im trying to leave her now.

i dont want to live with her anymore, but i fear telling her i want to leave again. she didnt let me go when i said i wanted to the first time so when i returned to college i stopped helping her with bills and now i didnt want to help her anymore because i feel like at this point im forced to be in a place i dont even want to live in just because she makes bad life choices and wants me to make her life easier.

she got married with a man after only meeting him on facebook for a short time and now he lives with us and even though this man works overtime every day and gets paid more than minimum wage he still cant help my mom pay for rent. we were 300+ dollars short for rent this time.

im tired of feeling guilty for her life choices. im tired of being made to feel like im at fault for anything. im tired of her wanting to choose my life choices. and im tired of living everyday considering suicide. 

sometimes i wish god could just take me already because this is not living."
1226,Is it normal for your doctor to just give you numbers/links to other organizations when you phone up and talk about issues?,"After 6 years I finally had the courage to phone my GP (General Practice) and booked an appointment and got a call back from my doctor since well, COVID doesn’t let us do face-to-face.

So I opened up. I’ve never told an adult any of my problems partly because when I was under 16 my parents would end up getting told, I’m 16 now by the way.

So long story short I told my doctor about everything. How my issues started and how I think I “mentally matured” before everyone else because I started self harming when I was like 11 and I said my theory is that I’ve gotten worst because I took too long to seek for help. 

I described the usual things you would hear from someone who’s depressed and suicidal but then I went on to talk about how I’m really concerned about bipolar in particular and I’ve monitored my behavior and I tend to have more longer manic episodes (so, energetic and just really hopeful for the future and all that jazz) and then everything comes crashing down for about 2 weeks for no actual reason then it’s back to manic episodes. Of course I can’t diagnose myself hence why I had to call someone because I want my mind to be at ease.

One more thing I mentioned is how I’m the exact definition of Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy) which ties in with narcissism. I’m the literal definition of both of those and I’ve said about how I manipulate, how I put up a facade to suit others so I can get what I want and also how I take my anger out on others and blame them and I said I show no empathy for that or anything else at all. **Although I understand I can’t get diagnosed as an under 18 for that.**

After all of that I got told that I’ve to wait until I’m 18 and she just gave me two numbers to two different organizations that deal with children. I wanted to put my mind to rest and see if there was anything up for me. I feel as though she just brushed it all off after I said I don’t have intentions to kill myself when I cut.

Soooo, is this what usually happens?"
1227,I can feel something wrong but I can't pinpoint it,"Hey yall. I suffer from seasonal depression and ADHD. The last few weeks have been really hard. I don't know why. I just don't feel like myself. I feel like I'm dissociating in a way, in that my body is kind of going through the motions. I'm still laughing at the things i normally do, smiling, hugging, whatever, but I don't feel it. The most positive emotion I've been able to experience is calm and I'm getting really upset because of this.

On top of all that I've been getting self-sabotaging intrusive thoughts, for example to break up with my partner and that I dont love them anymore. I know this isnt true, I know I love them, I know I want to be with them, but due to the aforementioned apathy I can't FEEL IT, and that lack of feeling is perpetuating these thoughts. I've had similar thoughts about ditching friends and quitting school.

I'm usually really good at managing my symptoms but I can't recall it ever feeling this empty before. That might just be anxiety though, cause I've definitely been through worse. This time around I just have the most to lose.

I have an appointment with the on campus counseling, hopefully that will do something."

1229,how do i stop feeling the need to justify my food choices to other people,"for the last three years or so i've had a pretty rocky relationship with food and diet. I've gone through periods of overeating and also at the other extreme i've had periods where i've suffered with undereating. I feel like for some reason i can never find a healthy grey zone when it comes to food it's all or nothing for me. As of now, i dont really see any major concerns with my diet. I'm eating about 3 pieces of fruit a day, and ill make sure i have some fruit juice, along with just kind of average meals, in that i mean not super healthy but not super unhealthy either. However despite this i still almost always feel the need to justify my food choices to other people. For example if i go to the supermarket to buy some snacks which might not necessarily be particularly nutritious I always feel scared/anxious that if im with someone else that they'll judge me or criticise what food i choose to buy. I get so annoyed at myself because in my mind i dont care wether im a size 6 or a size 16, when i see other people i don't care about their size/body shape as long as they're a nice person. but the problem is that even if they say they dont care, to a lot of people dress size is important."
1230,I am not able of proud being of myself,"Hello there. So I am 18 years old and I am struggling with Depression and Anxiety for 4-5 years now. I recently made my high school degree (Abitur in Germany) with a good score. I fought myself out of holes I never thought I would get out of. I went into a clinic on my own. I tried to kill myself twice and self harmed, however I haven’t done or tried it in the last year. I ended toxic relationships. I started to look out for me. I started Fitness with great results being admired by some.

But I am not proud of myself. I don’t know why but it seems like I am not capable of being proud of myself. I know I achieved so much but it seems like everyone is expecting me to achieve more. My therapist is able to make me feel somewhat proud but it doesn’t last long."
1231,I feel like shitt,"
I’ve been talking to this girl since august. We’ve known each other since we were kids and recently we’ve been reconnecting. She’s always texting me good morninggg and we text 24/7. She seemed to really like me 

We hungout the other night and everything was going great until she dropped a bomb  she’s in this long distance relationship with a guy she met online. She was complaining saying how he’s a douche and she’s not sure how to cut things off and was even saying stuff like “I just don’t connect with him how I connect with you” 


So I texted her saying we can’t talk anymore and she hasn’t texted back since thankfully

But I still feel like shit. I feel so stupid for being lead on. I had no idea she was talking to someone else this entire time. Apparently texting someone “good morninggg” everyday and talking for the last months doesn’t mean anything."
1232,"How do you recover when literally everything you tried to do in a day went absolutely, bizarrely, completely, entirely, totally and utterly wrong? Like, it didn't just go bad, it was full-blown worst-case scenario, one after the other?","So that was my day. I guess it was the appropriate punishment for feeling genuinely happy for an hour in the morning, lol.

Now I'm just mentally-done, and it's only flaming Monday. How the hell am I supposed to face the rest of the week when I'm already at 100% Frustration?"
1233,really alone,"Disclaimer: I made this account for a different throwaway post for a different sub. 

I’m so lost I feel so alone. I have three friends who I don’t think are even my friends. They only need me for when they’re going through stuff or need help or whatever. I have such bad social anxiety I can’t make any, I have no energy to want to be all excited and fake to talk to people to match their levels. When I try to talk to my friends they ignore me and talk about their own issues which I usually put my heart and soul into. 

I’m just so depressed I can’t even do my job properly and I’m so anxiety ridden one day they’ll just realize I’m a shit employee and get rid of me. I have no one to talk to I have no direction in my life. I’ve been in and out of  going to therapy most of my life because of depression and I just can’t go anymore. I’ve been on meds (years ago) and they made me all cloudy. But now I’m just a different type of cloudy. I can’t think straight, I’m so irritable and feel so discouraged from everything and anything. My family is useless. I have no direction, no hobbies. Only guilt, anxiety and just nothing. I really don’t know what to do"
1234,welp last try,"well its october 6th or something and its another terrible day
idk why everyday is so terrible, i wake up sad and in pain with my shoulder and neck. i just sit up go to the bathroom and lay back down and just be so sad. i dont know why. this isnt what i expected to turn out as. i hate myself so much im just to lazy to do anything about it and too scared to kill myself. i want to do both everyday but im just dont do either. i want to die soon but not suicide. i wish somebody just hit me with a bus or get shot or something. life is terrible. terrible friends, terrible family, terrible future i just cant bare to even think. all i can do to keep me from thinking like that is watch youtube or play fifa. imagine how sad of a life you must have where literally fifa 20 career mode is literally keeping you alive idek. im just a waste of life and a waste of money to the people who support me. worst part about it is im only 17. my moms dead and my dads addicted to heroin and probably gonna die soon. i attepmted a few days ago and didnt tell anyone and the next day i had my grandma bring me to the doctor for like a last attempt at life but they dont give a shit. they want me to see a phyciatrist or something in december but thats too long. its probably over and i will be forgotten. nobody probably even read this. maybe they will and maybe someone will care but probs not. goodbye world and goodbye joey. i love you so much. you made my stay on earth a couple months longer. ill aways love u for that."
1235,i feel depressed when the sun is out,"I'm a filmmaker who is currently doing some extensive creative work for a portfolio I'm submitting in two months and I've just noticed how brutal my aversion to the sun is for my productivity. I feel so down when the sun is out, it is so hard for me to do anything. 

It feels like my entire life I have struggle with mood during the day. I think it probably has something to do with how most of my trauma has occurred in broad daylight or perfect weather. Could be a reach, but also, I genuinely don't remember a time I haven't hated the sun.

Sometimes I am fine with it if it is windy or snowy outside. But when it's just sunny, bright, and still... I feel terrible. 

I am always more energetic, productive, motivated, and excited during the early morning or the evening. For all of my life, it's sort've just been a matter of trying my best to survive the daylight until it eventually goes down and I feel like myself again.

I get that everyone has their parts of their day when theyre not as productive--but I'm not just unproductive, I feel very sad, very unmotivated. I feel like giving up on whatever I need to work on that day.

Using blinds doesn't help, either. It's weird. I hate the sun, but if my windows stay closed for too long I feel claustrophobic.

I want to see if you guys have any tips for me. Currently I am on thyroid meds, anti-depressants, and I just started anxiety medications. I go to a therapist and I will talk to her about this, just wondering if anyone has experience with this."
1236,Any advice for fighting suicidal urges?,"Hey all, so firstly I'm safe. I grew up in a difficult situation and have been experiencing anxiety and depression all of my life. However in 2018 it got really bad and I had to quit uni and go on meds. After CBT in 2019 I relapsed? at the begining of this year and went in meds again. Now I'm starting to feel myself slipping again. 

I am thinking about suicide more, I'm really fatigued and have trouble doing daily tasks like showering. Almost all of my energy is going into work (I work in an office 3 days a week, 2 days from home) but I'm getting sick again as a result. I get pins and needles a lot, headaches, dizziness, I cry and I have panic attacks that are seemingly sudden random and involve hyperventilating until I'm strong enough to string a thought together and go through grounding techniques. Today I barely got through work I was so exhausted. 

I am starting to ""fantasize"" again and I feel like the next step down is my worst point- catatonic, barely hiding my pain in the office, feeling suicidal all day everyday. I'm really scared of it happening again. 

Has anyone else been like this? What are your coping mechanisms? I cant really reach out to anyone but my partner, and I did call a hotline today. My dream is to get off my meds and live a normal life, with a family. I'm not expecting a panacea but I really just want to function on a daily basis and manage my symptoms. 

I feel better now but I also feel weary and hopeless about it all. It's been three years of this severe depression/anxiety spiral and I'd rather go back to how I used to be- suicidal around once a month and normal for the most part, I think I can fight that level but right now I feel like I'm drowning a bit and I'm scared of getting as bad as I've been before."
1237,I feel like everything I do is a failure,"I live with the constant fear that everything I do is somehow an error/failure.

I come from an *incredibly* toxic family where for years I've been emotionally and (for a period) even physically abused simply because I was an easy scapegoat on which people could vent their own frustrations.

I was called ""mentally disabled"" (the actual words were far worse...) for the most random reasons: being too shy, doing stuff at my own pace, reading books, etc, and if I DARED to talk back I was the one ""ruining other's peace"" (their literal words). It was MY FAULT that I preferred to stay in my room  just to escape their abuse!

Years of abuse have gotten me where I am now... I just feel like I can't do anything right and every time I have to do certain tasks I get extreme anxiety simply because I remember all the times I was criticized for the smallest things, and I feel like whatever I do will end up in failure.

Every time I try to learn a new skill I give up because ""I'm an incapable idiot"" 

I've reached a point where I can't even enjoy the things I once loved doing: when I play videogames I feel like a ""failure"" because I'm not a better player, and when I try to read I feel like ""I'm wasting time"".

I'm interested in reading books about similar experiences to mine because I want to escape this vicious cycle and finally ""understand"" that not everything is my fault."
1238,How to reach out for help???,"I don’t even know if this is the right page to post on but basically,

Recently (and especially with COVID) I’ve been stuck in the house with my family (mum, dad, older brother, and grandparents) 

I’ve always been treated pretty shit by my family, it was getting better before COVID but now almost 6 months into lockdown (I’m in Australia) things have gotten really bad with my family. And I just feel like shit, my mental health is non existent and I can’t even explain how I feel it’s so bad. 

My university offers free counselling (over the phone right now until we’re allowed back on campus) and I was looking into that, but I’m really scared to talk to someone. I’m super emotional and will literally cry trying to explain anything that is going on. 

Can anyone offer any advice on getting professional help (therapist, psychologist,etc) because I’m so terrified of talking to someone but also really need help and someone to talk to."
1239,I'm terrified of recovery,"Right now, I'm at the lowest point in my life. My mental health has been bad for a long time, but this is my current rock bottom. But despite how terrible I feel and how much pain im in, I'm also terrified of getting better. 

Which is stupid, I should want to be happier and have a better life. But so much of my life has become consumed by mental illness that it's just what feels familiar now. It's become a large part of my personality too, and by this point it's all I know. 

I often find myself wanting to go out and have relationships and experiences like everybody else my age. I don't have many friends at at 21 I've never had a relationship, been out on a date or even held hands romantically. And I want a partner but at the same time it terrifies me. I want these new experiences but I also don't. 

It feels like if I get better I'm going to lose a big part of my current self- and even if logically I know it would be for the better, I'm still reluctant for that much change. 

Has anybody else dealt with something like this? Overcome it? Sometimes I feel like it's just too late for me to change or start living so I often want to die"
1240,Just need to vent.,"So where do I start? I got so many thoughts in my head.   


The near past hasn't been easy. I have depression and there's a lot going on. What bothers me the most are my thoughts on it.

It's like the problems I'm facing aren't that big. But they came so close in time and I can't even handle ""Normal"" life at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved out 3 years ago, started a job I hate and had few social contacts in the new city. From there on, I couldn't finish my university (as I am currently procrastinating since about 1,5 years), the few contacs moved out and I am constantly confronted with my failures. 

One of my frineds has a loving relationship, another one is married, another one will be father soon. I'm seeing happiness in the people around me if I go to work. My flatmate will move out and with him I will loose my flat. 

It's like, all that comes to my mind is a cluster of thoughts. I can't keep on following one thought to an end. I can't order the things. And the worst is, every problem seems so small, but weights so much. 

Even if I look at my depression. I can't really accept it, but on the other hand I'm craving for it. Do I want to feel this way? Or is it the illnes itself, that makes me think that way?   
If I'm ill, then why do I even fail to keep up symptoms? I can sleep, but not everyday. I have no energy, but still manage to meet friends and go to work. I cut myself, but wouldn't call it selfharm because the wounds can't be called so.   
I feel like a mess. I want to sleep, because it seems easier then keep on discussing thoughts with myself and drifting away. 

Thanks for reading. Stay well, watch yourself!"
1241,Telehealth Question - Location?,"I am stumped. What's the protocol/restrictions with teleheatlth and the location of the prescribing doctor and the patient, when done virtually specifically for mental health?

I just moved to South Carolina for 5 months due to family/COVID/job (til end of Feb 2021.) So I'm (informally) subleasing down here, but I'm not changing my residency for any purposes. However, my apartment in DC was month-to-month, so I put it all in storage for now. So...if I'm trying to make a new virtual patient appointment with potential for medication, are there restrictions? Does it hinge more on the doctor's prescribing ability (in-state v. out-of-state) or my technical residency?"
1242,Drugs and Mental health,"Has drugs ever ruined anyone elses mental health? I have many friends who have been on a similar path to me and seem absolutely fine. I was a heavy cannabis user since the age of about 13 and stopped last year (aged 23), i now drink a lot about 4-5 times a week and can't say no if a spliff or cocaine is passed around, i can only handle about 2 tokes or it will completely f\*\*\* me and give me a massive panic attack but i still take it. I have all sorts of tics and twitches, extremely anxious, have random urges to do all sorts of crazy things e.g say racist things out loud, slam on brakes, lick chargers. It has taken over my life and i have stopped going to CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) .

Is there an underlying mental health problem here? Why arent my friends feeling or acting like this?"
1243,I don’t feel alive,"Last night when I was all alone in my room, I decided to smoke a joint to ease my thoughts as I couldn’t stop thinking about my ex girlfriend. I’m not a big stoner, and I rarely smoked but I was really stressed and needed to take the edge off. I’m only 18 and pretty skinny and like I said I don’t smoke much so I got really high

I started having these horrible panic attacks and couldn’t stop thinking about memories from when I was a kid and really happy. I came to the realization that my whole life is a lie, I literally lie to myself and somehow make myself believe it. I started thinking how I wasn’t even in control of my body and it freaked me out. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about my ex. We broke up a few months ago and no matter how much I try my mind constantly thinks about missing her. I can’t get over her and feel like a prisoner of my own imagination.

I can’t even control my own thoughts, I don’t even know who I am, last night I think I came to this realization and now I haven’t been the same since. I feel like I’m losing my mind."
1244,"I stopped taking my antidepressants for 2 days, is that okay?","For more context, I've just recently begun seeing a psychiatrist so I'm still not sure how to approach taking the medicine (?) I've been taking it once a day after lunch and it's been going well. My mom said that it would be better if I didn't rely on it a lot, so I decided to stop for about 2 days. Probably wasn't the best idea though. I just took it again and now I feel quite nauseous. I know it's common for side effects to appear at first, although this time the nausea feels worse. Is this normal or is it something more serious? The type of antidepressant I'm taking is vortioxetine (or uh brintellix) if that helps."
1245,"I feel like a monster, a great danger for others while remaining hidden","I think I always suffered with mental health problems. I now feel like a big complicated monster who is a danger for people, but who is able to hide himself and appear as good.  


I was grown in a particular family, my father was kind of absent in our lives, and my mother was suffucating with me. She projected all of her insecurities on my brother, being treated like rubbish, and her omnipotence on me, being treated like the biggest genius on planet earth. As the years passed, all of my teachers enforced in me this idea of being an extremely rare genius, when my only merit was to study for all of my time, thus enforcing the genius appearance. At the university I began to realize how all of this was not only fake, but dangerous, for me and the people around me.  And now at my job I'm really reaping the effects of my education.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 I isolated from all of my friends, because the closest friend I had was very invasive and asked me to have sex with my girlfriend, it seems absurd, but this really happened. Since 2016 my main emotions are fear and shame, fear of being caught like I'm some kind of criminal, and shame for who I am. Whatever action I do, I immediately perceive it as mean, and I feel shame about myself, who I am, and also guilt for what I do. This has expanded to all the aspects of my life, there is no one single action I do which I do not analyze and conclude that I'm a piece of shit.

1251,Why don’t I want to take my meds??,"Hi all! I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 6 years ago, which has been managed well (intermittently) with therapy and medication. I’ve been taking my meds (sertraline) for 4 years now with no real problems. 

I’m experiencing a bit of a mental health blip at the moment (a relatively large blip, if I’m honest), and have found that I just don’t want to take my meds. I take them anyway but whenever I look at them I have this feeling of disgust and just literally cannot be bothered to take them. Occasionally i skip them but this has only been once or twice. 

Why do I suddenly have this feeling of not wanting to comply with my meds? Especially as I know they work. Is this a self destructive behaviour or something else? Has anyone felt this way too?"

1254,How believing in a specific heaven makes us miserable,"The concept of heaven and hell is centuries old. We may or may not have studied it in school, but we saw cartoons. A magical place floating in the skies, where the harp is playing, a world where you can touch the clouds, and no evil can touch you. A utopia, where you have everything you want.

The idea is that people who do good go to heaven after they die, and the rest go to hell. This was probably a powerful motivation for potentially millions of people to do good deeds, and perhaps it still is, though no proof exists of such a place.

Today we live in a different world that has more respect for science than our ancestors. Or does it?

The average person I meet today does not believe in God. If I ask you whether you believe in Heaven, you are likely to laugh at me. It sounds ludicrous. But instead, let me ask you this: do you believe in a happy place? Do you have goals? Dreams? Consider a couple of popular examples.

I want to lose weight and look great

Somehow this generation is simultaneously the most unfit as well as the most obsessed with fitness. I don’t remember ever going a week without hearing someone complaining about gaining weight (including myself). The worst part however is over-quantification of fitness. From counting steps to calories to wearables that remind you to drink water and get up, and the biggest one of all: weight itself. I miss the times when standing on the weighing machine cost 1 rupee at railway stations, seeing the colours light up and the little slip coming out, and excitedly sharing the number with others.

Now it is an anxiety creating machine you have at your gym, at your clinic, and even your homes. A tiny LCD screen and a couple of digits can bring your whole life come crashing down.

I know people who go their entire day and week feeling like this. Why though? Nobody can dispute the rewards of exercise, but is there any merit in measuring our success every second we get? The goal becomes a milestone to reach: and we huff and puff to get to that point, because that’s where we think the magic happens. Yes, at 9.4% body fat, 22 BMI, I shall rejoice. But you usually don’t. Because two seconds and a scroll on Instagram later you set a new goal, or your fitness app sets a new one for you.

The people unhappiest with their fitness are not the most unfit, they are the ones who believe that hitting a certain combination of numbers will change their life. It becomes an elusive heaven that seems to slip farther away every time they think they’ve reached it.

The dream job

During placement season, one is usually expected to walk into interviews expecting this question: what is your dream company (or three)? When you are conditioned to think this way, sooner or later you really begin to believe there is a dream company out there. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon - it doesn’t matter which, but you start to believe that when you land a job here, it would be a big deal, and you would be happier/more successful.

The dream job has other forms as well. It could be as simple as reaching a certain stage: the ability to afford a sports car, having fifty people report to you, a certain role such as a brand manager, or just an esteemed designation.

We all know people who buy into this, including ourselves. You like those posts on LinkedIn, those success stories, those surveys of best places to work. You start believing that the moment any of your little dreams become a reality, and like a final screw that was missing falls into place, a satisfying click sound will be heard, and life will be better. Broadly there are two possible outcomes:

You don’t get what you want: this makes you resent the place you are in, the people around you, your boss, and your work. The jigsaw of your life is missing key pieces, and until those pieces start falling into place, the others don’t hold any value.

You get what you want: That’s great, now all you need to do is wait for the dark curtains to lift and watch your wonderful life unfold. But when life continues to stay more or less the same, you either try to look for more missing pieces, or if you’re wise, create a new picture with the same pieces.

If the achievement of these dreams becomes a yardstick to measure quality of life, how are they any different from the notion of heaven? They become checkboxes to tick. Like those travellers who count the number of countries they’ve visited. Sunset point check. Walking tour check. Museum check. Portrait of ice cream cone check.

The point isn’t that goals are inherently bad. Get a new job, new role, make more money, get slimmer, do more reps and clock more steps. But, firstly, if you are constantly measuring your life every second like heart monitoring on an ICU patient, life will be miserable regardless of the results.

Secondly, there is no point waiting for your heaven. This space where you are, this second when you are, this is it. You cannot stand in line for happiness, or wait for a cab to take you there. It has no other coordinates besides where you are. Don’t wait for that perfect job, perfect shape, perfect partner, or perfect destination. Fuck happiness, not being miserable is good enough as well. It may sound impossible to believe sometimes, that you can have joy in life with the way you look right now, the money you make right now, the work you do right now, and the people around you right now. But it is, otherwise we’d all sulk forever.

I think this is a definition of self-love and acceptance I can get onboard with. It’s not about telling yourself you are amazing and wonderful the way you are. That never really resonated with me. We can aspire to be better and be better, without hating our current selves. Life is not a single jigsaw, but a kaleidoscope that you can keep on spinning to see it in newer, healthier ways.

There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart’s desire. The other is to gain it .

1255,"Just got off Prozac, feel horrible, don’t know what’s wrong with me.","Hi everyone, I’m new here. I’m a 25 yo F. I just need to vent/maybe find someone who might relate...

I got prescribed Prozac in February (2020) because I was going through a lot - I’d never wanted to take antidepressants but I was feeling so down and irritable I thought I’d give it a try. I was never diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but mild depression and anxiety that manifested as irritability more than anything. 

I took them for 6 months and I felt better, more clear headed, not as irritable but the side effects outweighed the positives and I got off about a month ago. I gained about 25lbs. 

Now I’m just SO irritable, angry, I feel this horrible rage that takes over me it’s completely illogical, there’s nothing to actually be upset about. I feel a heaviness/tightness in my chest, I feel a sense of dread, so much fatigue and general heaviness... I don’t even know how to describe it. I don’t feel sad necessarily. 

I’m sorry, my explanation sucks. I’m seeing a psychologist. I just got back from what was supposed to be a mini vacation and I feel drained, stressed, frustrated. I just don’t know what to do. 

I don’t even care about feeling happy at this point, I just don’t want to feel like this. I understand and accept happiness isn’t a fixed state, but I wish I could extract this little rage monster that’s made itself at home inside of me.

1256,feeling ugly rn,"i’m getting so bored of feeling the same way. i’ve never felt happy with who i am cause i’m just not that admirable. Guys don’t look at me and think wow or girls look at me and wish they looked like me. i see all my friends who are beautiful, funny and confident have it so easy. guys always want them and everyday there’s a new older guy that wants them. 

i just can’t imagine looking at a video or picture of myself and thinking wow i’m not that bad yk? 

i was speaking to the guy i like today and he was saying stuff like she needs to have a fat ass and how he thinks he likes this girl. this girl is really pretty and sweet so it’s not like i can compete or be rude about it cause i see the appeal. 

just the thought of being perceived by people, them being able to see what i look like when i can only do that if i go to a mirror really makes me anxious. 

it’s all just getting to me rn and it’s not like i want to talk to anyone about it cause i hate it when people say stuff like omg ur so pretty why would u say that, because it’s soooo not helpful it just makes me feel bad for thinking the way i do. 

i’ve attempted to starve myself recently, hasn’t been incredibly successful but i feel like it’s the only way im ever going to be happy with myself so then i get angry at myself for giving into temptations. 

i just feel very dissatisfied. i’m 17 years old and half the people i know are in cute happy relationships that are acc serious and healthy. the fact that i’m not that appealing makes me feel like i’m gonna miss out on that experience. really adds on when u hear the guy you’ve liked for months starts saying he’s smiling at messages from a gorgeous girl."
1257,Multiple of friends were triggered by me... and developed eating disorders.,"I'm a 22f. I've been told to be blessed/lucky to have a body like mine, because I've never changed in size and physical features. I am here telling my story because I am feeling guilty and it's led to me becoming extremely depressed. Just 3 weeks ago, a best friend of mine came out about her ""frequently throwing up"" and ""binge-eating""... I literally just told her to stop right there and seek help. She would talk me about it just shortly afterwards and showed no interests or have any intentions to take steps to stop the bulimia and binge eating. She was acting as if it wasn't a big deal and that I PERSONALLY ""should be eating more because I'm so skinny"". Weird and irritating response from her, imo. 


Background info: 

At 12yrs old, I was 5'3 and 110lb. Presently I'm 5'5 and still the same size. I literally still wear clothes from middle school because they still fit. 


Main story:

As me and these friends entered high school, weight was becoming an insecurity that no one talked about it. People that used to be close to me started bad mouthing me for any reason they could find and I just stopped talking to them. 

Fast-foward to the end of senior year of high school, I get a typed out 9-page essay given to me by one of those many friends. She confessed to missing the good days and that she was suffering from a bulimia. Guess what? I was her trigger, because she considered me to be the ideal body size she wanted. She was desperate to  be my size, because of a  guy she had a crush on...he liked me and not her. 

High school ended, but it did not end there... some more friends came out and confessed that I made them question their eating because I didn't seem to be any bigger despite eating together frequently. 

In the gap between graduating high school to present, I have been crippled with guilt, despite understanding that none of it is my fault. I'd mend broken friendships, but that eventually led to them belittling me for my size and acusing me of having a eating disorder. (*link to acusation of it happening to me in July*) 

So far, 2 people confessed to starving themselves, 2 turned bulimic at some point, and about 4 told me they can't stop binge-eating after periods of barely eating anything (duh, crash dieting???). Some of them said they wanted to either be my size or they felt fat because they couldn't fit my clothes. I'd clear out my closet once in a blue moon, and I did not think passing down my old clothes would cause anyone problems. 

So, I told this most recent person off 3 weeks ago and I feel extremely depressed. She was one of my best friend, but I needed to step away from the topic. I'm don't think I'd normally feel this deeply about this and I believe covid's influence has made it much more difficult right now. This situation makes me feel as if I cannot talk about the burden I feel, or the self-blame. I can't bring myself to talk to anyone about this, especially with my girlfriends and it seems trivial to anyone who cannot relate. I feel somewhat betrayed and currently this situation is making me feel even more isolated now."
1258,my life is like a dream,"i’ve had a terrible brain fog for about a year now. no one will understand or listen to me because i’m “a normal lad” and i’m “constantly trying to find things wrong with me”.  i’ve struggled with people socially all of my life, and i’ve never had a proper friendship. i’ve tried to understand my position, and according to many online articles, i show many symptoms of depression, autism and adhd. 
my mom will not even consider an autism test and will not help me when i tell her i feel numb and hopeless
i’ve never self harmed before, but lately i’ve been considering it. death now does not seem so scary, it seems like a way out of this life shaped nightmare and i hate the fact it seems so trivial 
it’s my exam year this year, and in class i cannot concentrate or even force myself to listen. i’m falling behind with work and homework, and i look like an angsty teenager with laziness issues and i look compulsively defiant. does anyone have any advice.. my parents will not help me

sorry if this was short but i’m not sure exactly how to express this"
1259,I'm trapped in my life,"So, where to begin.

It all started with my eating disorder. I wasn't obese or anything, but I wanted to lose weight. Then I stopped being in control. I wasn't eating, weighing myself constantly. I ended up gaining a lot of weight.

And that is how my anxiety started. I was an anxious person before, but this was even worse. I stopped going out, going to the shops and even bus rides were a nightmare. 

Then it wasn't just anxiety, I started being sad all the time, stopped enjoying things and procrastinating all day. Thoughts of killing myself started to occur. It wasn't a new thing to me, first time I remember thinking about it was when I was 8. My brother is autistic and I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, because he needs more care. But this time, the thoughts got more intense and occurred more often. It got to the point when I wanted to die constantly. And I started planning. 

I almost jumped of a high building, almost jumped under a train, but never something planned out weeks before I wanted to do it. Then I started researching yew. It seemed like a good way to go, doesn't take very long, you'll be unconscious in a few minutes, maybe hours, I read about a girl that accidentally killed herself by ingesting yew tea. And the best thing is, there's no antidote for yew poison... At that time I thought this was the lowest point in my life, but boy was I wrong.

So, I brew the tea and I got scared. I called a helpline and told them what happened. They told me to go to a therapist and I thought ""Yay, I'll get better!"" But I didn't go. I don't know why, maybe I was scared, but I didn't. A few days later I tried to drink the tea. It was really bitter, so I didn't drink enough, or maybe I made the tea the wrong way but I survived. 

I wasn't glad I woke up that morning, but I wasn't angry either, I just went on with my life. When that didn't work out, I planned jumping under a train. So, I got to the rails and let 2 trains pass by. And right as I was picking myself up to go home, a man asked me if I was okay and I just burst into tears. He lead me to a friend and told me he was a teacher, we talked a little and it was fine.

But the problem was he contacted my school and the principal contacted my mom and that's how I ended up in therapy. At first it was getting better, my relationship with my parents improved. But then it got really bad really fast. I stopped being able to do homework. Then I was either in a panic attack, shaking and having tics, or I was so tired I could barely move. And of course, I was crying all the time.  My mom thought it was going to get better with some rest and sport and she didn't allow me to take even a day off, saying I'm not a wuss and I can deal with it. I just want to stop for a while and go to a psychiatrist, that would give me some pills. I planned on committing suicide tonight, but I'm too tired and scared.

But I know one day I'll have enough courage to do it.
And this time I'll be successful."
1260,Can I refuse a medication and still keep psychiatrist?,"Hello I am tapering off clonazapam and taking gabapentin for anxiety. I got a new psychiatrist who is helping me with this. I also have bi polar and I told them I may want to go back on lithium and I have an appointment tomorrow to discuss. 

Today my primary doctor told me I need a thyroid ultra sound and my kidneys checked because labs were slightly high.
So now I will be afraid to take lithium until I am done with test. I took lithium ion the past.

I am not doing great but do not want to go back on lithium but I want to tell my psychiatrist the truth that I have not been doing great when it comes to bi polar.  If I tell my psychiatrist tomorrow I am not doing great but still want to not take a mood stabilizer can they stop seeing me? 

I can't take depokote either because liver issues.

I need to tell my psychiatrist how I am doing but I am afraid what they will say when I refuse to go back on a mood stabilizer for now."
1261,I overthink way too much!,"So to give you useful information about me, I like boxing, (as in the combat sport)  that's what you need to know in this story.

Yesterday I started overthinking, and I tried to watch boxing videos, I was overthinking it telling myself ""Why don't I like this, yeah I definitely am not enjoying this as much"" getting in my head, i head contemplating whether I really was enjoying it, I couldn't watch it, I just was overthinking. I woke up today, watching videos, this time, like everyday, like normal me, I was enjoying watching fights. But then I thought ""you sure you like this"", I told myself ""yes"", and I went on with my day, And i'll be watching videos about boxing, enjoying as usual. Then as kind of like a trigger word, or a code word, I thought ""you enjoying this?"" How do I get rid of this constant overthinking that ruins my passion for the sport of boxing, I enjoy and I could watch some guy fighting until I think ""you better be liking this"". Any tips on how to get past overthinking?"
1262,Preventing SAD?,"Need advice.. My partners appears to be showing signs of SAD. I'm saying SAD because over the 4 years we've been together, every winter (particularly at the beginning) he gets severely depressed. He is a person that I consider ""woke"" as he sees a lot of the toxicity that pollutes our world and feels it very deeply. Therefore how he's feeling is a normal way to feel considering what he sees.
But it's ruining his life and mine too. As patient as I am, I am struggling to cope with the irrationally and the constant negativity that'll probably last until spring.. Obviously it's not all about me but it's so painful to see him like this. I too struggle with mental health and when I was struggling he gave me a lot of tough love so it's hard to be as patient this year, I believe he too needs tougher love off me.
Any advice on preventing SAD?"
1263,How do I know if I’m having a negative reaction to Zoloft. I feel horrible.,"I took my first ever dose of Zoloft or sertraline last night at 10. Fell asleep. Slept for like 10 hours. 
Now I have horrible anxiety. I’m dizzy, dissociative. I have shakes but I think that’s from the anxiety. My pupils seem bigger? It kind of feels like I’m sitting on top of waves. My tongue feels weird and I’m having shortness of breath. Though I have a heart condition so I always have shortness of breath I’m just really not happy with it today. I don’t have any fever or any other symptoms that would make me think covid besides throat/tongue and shaking or twitches. 

Idk I feel so fucking weird. I absolutely hate this. It kind of comes in waves. I am superrrrr paranoid. Could you even have a reaction like 11 hours after taking the medication? Is this normal with this medication???? 
I’ve heard covid causes weird symptoms so I’m just trying to figure out what’s wrong with me while praying I don’t have covid."
1264,"How can I try and bring myself back to normal when my depression peaks? (24,M)","So I'm in the process of sorting my doctor's out to get officially diagnosed with my depression and anxiety and have to wait until the 15th for my appointment. Currently I've been at the stage where with my depression, I don't have the motivation to cook food so my family have been cooking more often for me, just to help me until it gets to my doctor's appointment. 
Ever since I knew my ""one that got away"", I've been having times where (since I know most of my depression is coming from my love life), I don't have the motivation to watch TV/a film, play on my games, watch anything on YouTube, etc and all I want to do is hold my ""one that got away"", but she's long gone, can anybody help me on how to avoid reaching the stage where I'm just lying in my bed in the dark trying to sleep but ending up thinking about her in these times? Ideally keeping my family from knowing when I'm having one of my dark times because I know a lot of people would probably say ""go downstairs and tell my family how I'm feeling"" but I'd preferably not want to have to do that."
1265,I can’t think positive,"I just can’t think good like ok there is one second where I think about something positive but then there comes my negativity I can’t feel the “happiness” or whatever emotion I just feel empty 

And FAAAR BEHIND EVERYBODY 

I feel like I’m the last one so why should I even try to?

I fail even if I try to 

I’m afraid to fail again after trying 

I lost some many times and made so many mistakes and I’m afraid that it happens again.

I see my old classmates from 10th grade and I just feel ugly (sorry if I sound in mature) but I just feel ugly 


They always made fun about how I look etc and I’m still as ugly as ever and I just Idk 

I even felt ok or just empty I don’t even know anymore..but I didn’t think or heard these voices in my head but then as fast as I’ve thought I’m ok everything just came back like HARD PUNCH in my face."
1266,Suicide attempts,So I’m 14 old and I’ve been attempting to kill my self for three yrs know. I didn’t sleep at all last night cause I was cuddling with a pillow thinking about what to do with my life. I don’t think anyone will ever love me
1267,I feel like killing myself is the only option i have left,"I know this probably sounds whiny as hell but i need someone to talk about this. So i got social anxiety, severe depression, extreme self-hatred and the worst possible self confidence issues. I thought i had it under control until the grades and school started again. I am supposed to graduate in one and a half years and the pressure is just killing me. The topics are so complex and i can't catch up at all. My grades are the worst you can get. 

In german school system it's from 1st  grade (lowest) to 12th grade (highest) i am in 11th grade. But if i fail i'll have to repeat 10th and 11th again. So being in a class with people one year younger than me and doing better will just totally kill my mental health. It would be hell on earth. But i can't help it.

So i feel like killing myself is the only way out of this hell. My big dream was to graduate and show my boyfriend my graduation papers then go to university and become a movie director. I don't wanna die but it's probably easier for me. Help"
1268,Do you know what might be the cause of this?,"I (sometimes) love hugs from the people im closest to, and I can be really affectionate at times. 

But sometimes I hate being touched. And I can get really anxious and irritated when I’m touched. I have no problem touching others, and I have no problem with people touching me if I’m prepared to be touched. But sometimes when people touch me, I’ll feel like screaming and crying and I get these muscle spasms in my fingers. 

I don’t think it’s Haphephobia as this seems rather severe, and it’s not allodynia as I don’t feel pain when being touched. 

The thing I don’t get is that my fear isn’t consistant. Sometimes I’m good sometimes it’s affecting me a lot. 

Like one day I’m fine with my mother caressing me or something, while the next day I can get extremely anxious about her trying to caress me. 

Do you know what might be the cause of this? 

Thanks in advance:)

 (sorry for spelling mistakes, English isn’t my first language)"
1269,Feeling like everything is going too fast?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this or if this is just something that happens to everyone, but I haven't found much information on it, but I think that's because it's such an unusual sensation that I have a lot of trouble describing. The closest thing I could find is slow-motion anxiety, but the opposite of that.

I don't know when it started, but for years I've had these strange episodes that last around 10 minutes, 15 if you count the leading up and the end. Before these episodes begin, I used to think I would hear a voice in my head but that never really 'felt' like the right way to describe it, and I think instead it's my own voice that has been distorted. 

I'll have these extreme feelings of something close to deja-vu as though I'm hearing the same voice from a long time ago, and it's really strange. The best way I can describe this is just that everything feels sped up, and I don't know if I'm included. It makes trying to focus extremely difficult and reading is nearly impossible. Listening to music or even my own voice or other voices when they speak sounds sped up but not artificially. I know that nothing is sped up, it just feels that way, but maybe that's not what I'm feeling. 

These episodes happen randomly for no reason, no matter what I'm doing. I always know when they're about to start because everything begins to feel distorted and weird and my voice in my head sounds weird but I have no means to stop it. 

I have no idea if anybody will be able to help me with this because it is really something I have no idea how to describe and I don't have the proper words for how to relay what happens to me, but maybe someone has an idea as to what I'm experiencing."
1270,Family Issues,"Basically just looking to vent into the void tbh but, well, but nothing.

It's not about me so much, although I am feeling the weight of it, more about a young relative of mine (12). Their parents separated about a year ago and I'm close to their mother (related to me). At first it was nothing more than it was - a separation. Tough, but these things happen and while her and her sibling both were struggling with it we were all doing what we could to lighten their load and let them know they had support.

As time's gone by though their father has grown increasingly manipulative and controlling. Rather than let the split be amicable he's gone out of his way to argue every point, initially refusing to leave the house and subsequently being obstructive at every turn. The worst aspect of which has been him trying to force his kids to take sides, something no one else wanted for obvious reasons. He's consistently lied and tried to push his kids to turn on their mother, to the point where the eldest of them, the one I'm most concerned about, took to lying herself (telling him what he wanted to hear) to feed his behaviour. Their behaviour has also grown worse and worse as they've taken his side and become more and more abusive to their mother.

Recently his behaviour has taken a new direction too when he violently abused his daughter, coming to the house without telling anyone and beating her for bad behaviour. Police and social services have become involved and limits have been placed on his allowed interaction with the kids, as well as his ability to go to their home. Basically for a year now it's been a pretty shitty situation and those closest have had the hardest time of it. 

I'm not immediately involved but I do a fair bit of child care and, up until now, felt that I was a good semi-outside influence. I could offer a bit of an escape from the routine and my relationship with the kids was such that, while they would misbehave towards me a bit, I was far enough away from their day to day lives that they wouldn't go too far. 

Now, in the aftermath of the whole assault ordeal, I'm feeling more or less completely lost. The 12 year old, with whom I previously had a good, friendly relationship, has started lashing out at me. Her abusiveness and bad behaviour doesn't seem to be moderated any more and she seems as set on pushing me away as she does everyone else. And I can't say I don't understand the reasons for it, she's had a horrific year with everything that's happened plus the lockdown on top but I honestly don't know how to deal with it. When she sets out to get a reaction I'm finding it hard not to give her one and while I'd certainly never do anything to hurt her it does just become an argument with me trying to tell her off and her trying to push me further. It's a pattern that she's already played out with other family members and I know I've had it easy in that respect, but being confronted with it now I'm just feeling lost.

My stress, relative to everyone else's, has been minimal. Not being immediately in the room all the time has been hard in parts, especially because I knew that my anger towards the father had no where to go. I knew my role was to help out where I could though, listen and otherwise live with it. Now though I feel that there's nothing I can do. The 12 year old won't listen, that's for sure, and while even around the arguments we still have a seemingly good relationship I just feel like I can offer nothing by way of real help. When she misbehaves I can either rise to it or ignore it and neither way seems positive. 

Logically I know it's incredibly hard for them and I suppose even my being there as a slightly lighter presence is good but in the moment, when she lashes out, I just wish that there was something helpful I could offer. I wish there was a conversation we could have, or some way I could give them a real escape from the situation, but it increasingly feels like their is no escape.

This is venting, ultimately. I know that the only thing I can do is be there and not allow myself to be dragged into arguments. But it breaks my heart to see them becoming so lost and refusing to take any help offered to her. That's a stress I'm not entirely sure I know how to deal with. On top of that is the lying which is still ongoing. I know that everything I or anyone says or does is inflated, distorted and shared as ammunition for the father who, despite it all, is still in contact and playing the same manipulative games. With that I struggle to see things in a positive light.

As I say though, a venting, long essay which doesn't really lead anywhere, just wanted to get some stuff out."
1271,Anxiety is worsening and I am not sure if my Lexapro prescription helps anymore...,"Hi there. This is a little long, but I really like using Reddit to get my thoughts out to strangers to see if there is someone out there who might have the ""right thing to say""...

So, I am learning that my anxiety has taken on a whole new form. I was placed into working from home orders at a new job I was 3 months into in March and for my job, I am required to cold call about 3-4 hours every day to try and secure appointments for potential customers. I also work on commission.

These past six months have been incredibly challenging for me to feel successful at my job for reasons of simply still feeling like I am still learning and was whisked away from the office setting with veterans and my manager just desks away. On top of that, my depression (that I have dealt with for as long as I can remember) doesn't help my ability to work efficiently every day since I am working from home and not actually getting up, getting dressed, and going to the office. I usually feel like just sleeping in (because I can get away with that) then I am overcome with guilt, then I feel exhausted, or unmotivated to even complete tasks and get in my own head about doing the cold calling (which is the scariest part of my job) so I just don't do it. Then that leads to negative conversations with my boss, as expected.

So all of that has kind of been the ongoing challenge these past 6 months, but over the past several weeks, I have noticed myself having more severe anxiety attacks. They will happen at night when I am thinking about the next work day, in the morning when I know I have a one on one touch base conversation with my manager coming up in the afternoon, and today I actually couldn't even edge the attack and I hyperventilated and cried through the first 10 minutes of my Zoom call with my manager until I had to hang up and try again through a phone call. I explained to her that I am really struggling with my anxiety more than ever before, and working from home is a terrible fit for me because I cannot beat my poor habits I have started due to my depression. It was such a horrible feeling having this very vulnerable conversation with my boss and talking through tears while trying to calm my breathing. It sucks. I don't want to be that employee. I don't want them to think about replacing me because I am not able to perform my tasks of my job at home. 

As far as my medication, I have taken Lexapro 20mg for years. I do feel like it has done it's job but I think now that I am dealing with almost a new form of anxiety and having very severe and frequent panic attacks, that I don't know if 20mg of Lexapro daily is cutting it anymore. I have scheduled myself an appointment with a provider on Wednesday and I will obviously have this conversation with her but I am just nervous she will just keep me on the Lexapro and I won't feel better. I don't know how to talk about changes in medication as a patient when it comes to SSRI's or something that helps with anxiety attacks specifically. 

I really feel defeated by my anxiety and my depression, that it is holding me back from being the great employee I know I can be. I don't want to lose my job, or feel like I need to search for a different one that would be easier for me to do that I know my anxiety or depression wont interfere with. I just want to fix my mental health :("
1272,I had a dream about hurting my brother and I'm really worried about it.,"I have a younger brother who is on the autism spectrum. In the dream, he broke something of mine and I was furious so I hit him multiple times with a badminton racket until he bled in some areas. I later felt bad about it so I got some wet paper towels and tried to wipe the blood and ease the pain until I woke up. He really doesn't know any better. Even in the dream when I hit him I think he would react the same way in real life. He visibly looks frightened but he doesn't cry like most kids and just tries to hold it in. 

I really can't imagine myself hurting him and I never want to do that. I dont know why I had a dream about it.  Just yesterday I was even wondering if any of my families were actually even real or if they were just my hallucinations. I wondered why I would hallucinate him to have ASD. Then I wondered why God or some higher being made him the way he is. I felt extremely guilty after that thought and I feel terrible after having had that dream. I slept right next to him when the dream happened. Im really worried about him and about myself."
1273,I’m just gonna keep everything to myself,"My best friend is willing to listen to my problems but I know he’s getting tired of it, I’m gonna avoid venting to him or anyone because that just brings problems, I can handle it all myself I don’t need anyone to help me stand up I can do it all on my own"
1274,I'm feel drained and mentally tired despite having everything most people in my country could only dreamed of.,"A little bit of background. I am from a 3rd world country located in Sout East Asia. So the when it come to social status there is a huge gap between the low income and the high income people. And I was lucky enough to be born into a high income family. 

My family had their ups and down financially but never true poverty. My parents have alway kept me fulfilled and get whatever I want. So what I'm trying to say is I had a great child hood getting almost everything I ever want going to the best private school and such. 

Then I went abroad for a great future education which landed me a higher than average paying job for a free graduate. Im earning double or triple the majority of the people mt age are earning. Even if I waste through my salary I always have my parents supporting me financially. Even now as an adult j never have to worry about rent or bill or any of those since I live with my parents. (In Asia its a normal thing for a non married person to live with their parents). 

I live in a great house that most could only dream about, I have a roof over my head, loving family, awesome bosses that are empowering and a job that pays really well. I have friends that care for me and loves me. 

My love life needs some work but other than that its almost perfect. 

This may seem like im flexing. But here is my point. Mentally I feel so tired of everything. Sick of this life. Tired of living. I feel so burnt out. Looking at what I've stated above I have nothing to worry about. I have a perfect life. But I feel so burnt out from everything. I distract myself with games, Netflix, always smiling and look happy all the time but all I want to do is curl up in bed and not move anywhere.  

I know I sound so entitled but idk where to vent about this anymore so I'm posting it here. Im tired of living, im tired of trying to meet my parent's and my own expectations to do great things. I have a whole time line set for myself. And I'm tired of it. I'm so drained from trying to chase my own dream. My motivation is slowly leaving me and there is a part of my anxiety that I'll get too comfortable with a 9-5 job that I wouldn't want to take risks for my dream anymore. 

I want to see a therapist but thanks to Covit I can't and its hard to find a therapist in a country that haven't widely recognised mental health is a huge issue. People think if you are seeing a mental health professional then you are a crazy person that is unable to take care of themselves. So talking about my mental health to my parents is a new thing for them. My mom doesn't understands it so she thinks I'm being dramatic and is seeking attention. My dad also doesn't understand it but tries his best to understand my thought process. But I'm feeling tired of this. I already feel bad that I'm putting this burden on my dad. I dont want to be a burden anymore. I don't want to be one of the problems for my parents anymore. I want to give them the luxurious live that they have given me. I fell like a failure because I cant fully support for them yet. Im still depending on them for everything despite me having a higher than average paying job. I want to be self sufficient and is able to give the luxurious care free life they deserves. 

Sorry for any typos. Im on mobile."
1275,Just unraveled a knitting project I started a few days ago. Hate my perfectionism.,"Been knitting some slippers for a few days now, but they were not 100% accurate to the instructions. I was using yarn and crochet hook smaller than what was recommended by the instructions. I think it would've taken more yarn the way I was doing it, so it was probably not economical either. I'll start doing new ones with better fitting instructions, but it's still a little sad, those slippers were coming out nice enough and I wasted some time on them already. I have a strong urge to unravel a different unfinished knitting project I spent a month on, because it's also not 100% accurate to the instructions and doesn't come out exactly the way I wanted. I probably sound like a spoiled child. But my perfectionism is getting to my head bad lately, it feels like my brain is actively self harming and punishing itself for small things being imperfect."
1276,Its okay,"If you feel like you aren't going anywhere, please just remember how far you have come and not how far you have to go. Remember you might not be where you want to be but you aren't where you used to be.

Its okay to not be perfect and to not have a reason for feeling the way you do, no reason is ever to small. And if you can't look on the bright side we will happily sit with you in the dark. And when you do find the light, no matter how long it takes, there is no need to be ashamed. Because you story will inspire others and they will think no smile is more beautiful than one that has struggled through tears ❤"
1277,I blame others for my own issues,"Hi all. So as the title suggests I out a lot of blame in the actions of others to excuse my own negative behaviour.

For instance, if I accidentally offend someone by, for instance, implying they eat too much. I then blame that person for being offended because I did not mean to upset them. But this just perpetuates and intensifies the problem.

Another example. My wife has sometimes taken exception to my hobbies (I often get sucked way too far into things and I rely on her input to ground me. I have ADHD and struggle to pull away) and has resorted to asking me to stop for a while to let myself settle. Instead of seeing it as help, I can fly off the handle, accuse her of controlling me, accuse her of punishing me. Tell her she hates me etc.

And a last point. Of any of these situations happens at home I increasingly more often find myself unable to deal with the situation in a healthy way. I get stressed very quickly and usually have to leave. And what follows is hours of emotional upheaval. My wife feels abandoned and I feel like the whole world is better off without somebody as useless, worthless and as uncaring as me.

What is troublesome is that if you were to ask anyone that knows me, my wife included. They would tell you that I am one of the most hard working, loving, caring and diplomatic people they know. These behaviours are truly a 'Jekyl and Hyde' situation. I am tired of letting Hyde out. I am in the waiting list for intensive CBT. I have been diagnosed with Anxious Avoidant Personality Disorder, though I debate the accuracy of this. I do not take medication currently as most make me feel worse.

I have reached a state where my marriage is nearing its end. I am struggling to rationalise my reasons not to die when I cause everyone to suffer. And I guess I want some advice on how I can deal with the problems I have and be a better friend and husband.

Thanks friends."
1278,Seeing a psychologist for the first time,"Hi everyone. I am turning 18 soon and i have felt depressed for most of my life mostly due to many things that were done by my alcoholic parents. But i am done feeling this way. I want to go to a psychologist but it is hard to force myself to do that, especially right now because lately i feel pretty bad mentally, i haven’t gotten out of bed in days. So honestly i just need some encouragment to get the help that i need, because the moment i start feeling a little better i start thinking ‘i can deal with this on my own, i don’t need help, i am getting better’ but obviously it’s not true. I am also anxious about it because i have no idea how it goes talking with a psychologist and it scares me opening up to others about very personal things. 
I have spent days in bed now and i am barely eating. Any advice would be very appreciated, i just want to feel normal again, but how can i force myself to get out of bed and go see a psychologist?"
1279,Why do mental health people stop taking theyre medications?,"I swear its like its portrayed in every single movie where the person with mental health issues demands that theyre fine and they dont need medicine and the medicine is making them worse!?.. Why is this?.. 

And it almost always is actually making them better! Im referring to like schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and those kinds of diseases.. And referring to the medications that help.. And it always seems that these medications have no recreational value.. Like lithium for perfect example.. 

And to continue the example.. Not just the movies.. I actually experienced this with my friend with bipolar disorder. He constantly stops taking his lithium and says he dosnt need it.. And then always gets worse!.. Because they really were helping him!.. 

So what the heck are the reasons that cause this reaction they have to be so constant throughout people with mental health diseases.. Thanks!"
1280,Just found out I have DID/PTSD and am not sure how to go on through life knowing there’s multiple versions of myself,As the title says me and a doctor have recently finically figures out what plagues me and it’s a form of PTSD mixed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. I learned that for long periods of time I become someone else (with one self being abusive) and it was difficult to diagnose due to the prolonged periods of amnesia. How do I continue on when there’s multiple versions of myself vying for control and hurting those I care about? How do I go on knowing I really am about as crazy as you can be?
1281,What happens if I tell my doctor about suicidal thoughts?,"I’m scheduled for an regular checkup but I know that I’ve spiraled too far with some of my behavior and that I need professional help. I’m really worried about what will happen though. I want to tell my doctor about how shitty and unhappy I feel, about having suicidal thoughts, and about binging and purging every other day. I’m don’t want to self-diagnose here, but I’m pretty sure I’ve had some kind of eating disorder since I was about 11 or 12 ish? That’s definitely one thing I want to bring up for sure. I’m 17 now and it’s way out of control. Does being a minor affect treatment? Will my parents have to know all the details? Since they’re paying for it, they’ll have to know the diagnosis but not other details, right? Also, can I be forced to accept treatment? I’m especially worried about the financial side of things. Any insight helps. Thanks :) I live in Washington state btw"
1282,Improvement!!,"hi!!

so i’ve been working really hard on my mental health for the past few months, and things have been going really well! i’m doing really well in university, and i’m making new friends, but more importantly, i’m in a really healthy and happy relationship. 

we both have ptsd and are sexual assault survivors, and it’s really nice to be able to connect with someone who genuinely understands what i’ve been through. 

overall, i’m just feeling really great, and i’m taking the next big steps to getting better!"
1283,I don’t know if live is worth living anymore,"I turned 18 october first and it honestly never thought I would get to turn 18. I have never felt truly happy in my life. I thought I was the reason of my brother almost dying for 12 years. At school I was very badly bullied. School never worked out and I was diagnosed at 16 with really bad dyslexia, which caused me to way underperform incomparingson to my peers. 

But it also turns out I have BPD, anxiety, depression and i show symptoms of other personality disorders such as theatrical personality disorder and narcissism.

I can’t handle the mood swings. intense sadness. the self loathing. the constant feeling of wanting to hurt myself or be dead. i can’t stop crying and having panic attacks. 

Life doesn’t feel worth living anymore. I don’t think anyone can love me because I lash out at everyone all the time. I need constant reassurance and attention, i feel impossible to keep up with. I’m insanely stubborn which also doesnt help my case. 

I just want to stop hurting and i want to feel like I can live my life. When I go to therapy i don’t feel better because they recommend me all these things but they never help. I feel so insanely misunderstood and terrible.

Sorry for all the spelling and grammar mistakes, I feel like I don’t know what to do anymore."
1284,Help with trying to support my brother,"My brother is in his early 20's, and i believe he may have issues with severe anxiety and/or depression and/or self esteem, however doesnt quite tick all the boxes to be obviously suffering from one of them and im not sure what to do

He had friends at school, very shy but a normal sized group of friends and he occasionally went to small house parties and stuff they had.

However once leaving for university, i dont think he made any new friends, and since graduating i dont think he's left the house (still living with parents) socially for a couple of years now.

So he spends all his time in his room on his computer, and refuses to say what he's doing. I'm fairly 'nerdy' myself, and been active on the internet for almost 15 years, so i am able to identify with gaming and general internet culture. However i don't think he is playing a specific game, or even regularly getting 'absorbed' into a game at all. I get the impression he occasionally tries new games and loses interest fairly quickly. I've also been trying to see if i can figure out if he's spending a lot of time on reddit, or within certain fandoms, but theres no indication of such.

I genuinely dont know if he has any serious interests or motivations at all. He doesnt say as much, but its almost like he's just been constantly watching the mindless crap on the youtube frontpage for the last 4 years. The kind you watch for an hour and realise you didnt really care about any of it, he doesnt seem invested or interested in anything. But whatever he's doing it's always been a very direct 'No' whenever anyone asks him about how he spends his time, and he seems to close everything quickly whenever someone knocks and walks into his room.

He seems unwilling to talk about what he wants in life, no goals or motivations. He works a part time job but only because my parents made him, he doesnt spend any money. Things like asking for time off for a holiday, or applying for new jobs seem to terrify him although he doesnt vocalise that. Everything new is usually an immidiate 'no' unless you try and foreshadow/warm him up to it first, then once he's done whatever it is a few times it's suddenly the new normal and was never an issue in the first place.

He's not stupid, but i think always froze during exams so didnt end up with the best grades - he generally did loads better on coursework when there wasnt the time pressure. 

My concern is that he's just terrified of everything; of saying the wrong thing, of being rejected by potential friends, of not living up to parent's expectations, of making mistakes. So much so that he's just given up on friends, ambitions, goals, hobbies, etc to the extent where he doesnt even think about it anymore. If any of us ask him if he's ok, in various ways, he always says he's fine and doesnt want to talk about it. This has been going on for several years now.

I just really dont want him to be struggling through life just because we didnt do enough to help him. But he is so unbelievably stubborn and blunt i dont know what to do. Over the year's he's gotten unbelievably good at just shutting down conversations he doesnt want to continue, no matter how awkward it gets.

He's never had panic attacks, sleeps perfectly fine with a normal routine, he just seems a shell of a person... He has no interests or hobbies, no friends or seeming desire for friends, his emotions generally seem to be limited to 3 states; either happy but reserved, patronising &amp; grumpy, or 'no'/silent.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
1285,happy for the first time in weeks,"After 16 years of bottling up my emotions and resentment, I finally snapped at my mother and told her how much she's failed me growing up. And after weeks and weeks of misery (mostly bc of COVID fuckin my life up, but still), I'm finally feeling like I have an ounce of control over my life. Although I'm a bit sick to my stomach with nerves since she has a history of depression as well."
1286,I need help.,"I'm 15 and pretty mature for my age as I've been told but I've never experienced anything like this before. For the past month I've just not felt happy at all, my friends and family are making jokes about me being ""depressed"" when in reality, I tick every damn box for depression. I have a therapist but she just doesn't help and my mum, she doesn't help either. I have no friends, no social life besides 1 friend and my twin is trying me crazy. If anyone has any advice, please, I really need it. (Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland)"
1287,I’m so tired,"
I’m not quite sure where to begin. I had just about the worst day today, took any little self esteem that I had and just shattered to. To preface, I’ve always been very insecure about my face, and not only that but I’ve had people straight up tell me to my face what they thought of my face (aka, ugly). This was in elementary and middle school. Now I’m a senior and today we were taking a test in a class where the teacher required us to turn on the camera. It was all fine until I turned mine on and I saw these three guys just start snickering. Needless to say, it wrecked me. At this point I should know that I am ugly (and there’s nothing wrong with self awareness or at least knowing that not everyone looks pretty) but idk, I’m a girl and it sucks soo much. The funny thing is it also made me realize something. I’ve probably had maybe 6 people in my entire life tell me I could model cause I think I have pretty strong features, but now I look back at it, after what happened today, what’s been happening my whole life, I now know they meant I could model like those “unique” models which is just a nice way to say unattractive. It’s a big contradiction in how I can be complimented as a model but then be evidently ugly. I always try to find some kind of comfort with this compliment cause let’s face it if someone calls you a model, they probably are just thinking of a general attractive person and not necessarily those “unique models” so in general models are thought of as highly attractive. But how can that apply to me when a a majority of the people I’ve known have made it clear what they think of me? How can I even entertain the idea of being on the same level as a model when I can’t even take a picture (even with a filter?) or look in the mirror. I’m a literal waking troll. So the only logical conclusion is that the model “compliment” was a lie or at least very disingenuous and does not apply in anyway to me. And I know it may sound like I’m exaggerating but I’ve been called ugly so many times by so many people that it’s literally the first word I think about when I think of myself. I’ve known for a while that I am ugly (in fact I barely look in mirrors, I don’t take pictures and it’s even worse when filters don’t even make you look better), but before I used to take some kind of comfort in thinking that maybe it was just all in my head or my past bullies coming back to haunt me, except now it’s confirmed. I always knew but it sucks that it’s very evident to others. I know I’m probably gonna read “beauty is subjective” “don’t worry what others think” etc, and these are true but I’m a girl living in a society where no matter how smart a woman is she always boils down to her looks and I don’t have any of that. I don’t even have a question, I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. The word ugly has plagued my life and it’s ruined me and I can’t escape it and I’m just tired."
1288,Sorry if someone else asked this at some point...,"I was at Program recently and the counselor was doing a one on one with me because I was really really down that day. My past came up and she asked me if I had been sexually assaulted at all...(I don't remember what the context for asking me that was, but it was appropriate because I am not offended or taken aback by that question). Well, I HAD been raped when I was a teenager by a neighborhood boy (friend), and basically he slipped Valium into the liquor we were sharing and when I almost passed out, he...well...did what he did. My mom told me that it didn't happen, even though she was the one who called the ambulance when I was so out of it when I had gotten home. I nearly died. They had to pump my stomach (charcoal REALLY sucks). My question is that why don't I feel ""victimized"" by this. I don't have nightmares about it...I just feel like ""ok, that happened...wow..."" and that is it. No emotions at all when I think about it.   


Is this because I have totally blocked out this event? I will talk to a therapist soon, I HOPE. There is a snafu with getting a therapist now because of COVID-19 and because I can't have a therapist from the same counseling center where I am going to Partial Program. That is fucking stupid as fuck...but whatever. Any thoughts on this?"

1290,I have just taken a fatal amount of paracetamol,This might be it
1291,I'm tired of feeling lazy for doing anything,"I'll try to keep this brief. I am a Masters student, GTA, and I'm also trying to learn to program. This consumes a good amount of my time, but not literally all of it. With that being said, I feel a pit in stomach and genuinely sick when I don't work literally every second of every day. I mean that actually literally. Even taking breaks to bathe, eat, and sleep make me feel so guilty that it's hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This isn't new, either. I had a job for 3 years after my undergrad, and even after coming home, I felt like I was in the wrong for wanting to play a game or do anything. It was like I hadn't accomplished enough to warrant doing something that could make me happy. I haven't felt genuinely, truly happy in I don't know how long. Maybe 8 years? I have other, diagnosed issues, but I feel like it all stems from this. Nothing I do helps and I can't really self-care effectively, since, as described above, I feel guilt doing just the bare essentials of living. Does anyone else feel this way ever?

1293,Anything inspirational?,"Sometimes, I want to be left alone. Other times, I want to be surrounded by people. It all comes in at random spurts. Now, I want someone to tell me that the 10 years that I've been depressed can amount to something..... Every time I feel like things are improving for me, that I'm getting a little bit better, I'm working towards a degree, doing okay in classes, feeling motivated, my depression comes back to haunt me at my most critical times and takes everything away from me. It doesn't help that my health hasn't been really that good and that I might be suffering from something other than severe depression. I want someone who went through something similar to tell me that even if it continues to take, take, and take away from me, some things can be saved, some things that can be gained... 

God, I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point. I want to feel hope, that I can just continue to get up even if I fall, and it'll be okay at some point. It'll all mean something somewhere down the line. 

Maybe I want someone to tell me, ""Hey, I've had depression for x years, but look at me now. I'm still suffering but making it. I'm still struggling, but I have a career, people who I love, things to look forward to...""

In such depressing times, a little bit of inspiration can go a long way..."

It started off with my girlfriend breaking up with me. Then I realized I wasn't over my other ex/close friend and still have feelings for her. She is dating another close friend and might be pregnant. Oh, then my friend died in a car accident last Thursday. I should also add I have recently started suspecting that I was molested when I was young.

I've had drug problems in the past, I've been sober for 7 months, but it's hard right now. Not even just the temptation to numb the pain, I just feel too young to be sober. I'm 17, I want to just be able to smoke a joint with friends or take some shots, I'm not even really wanting to do pills again. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything to numb the pain, I can live with the pain, I just want to be able to be like that with my friends again, unwind in that way. I'm just scared of it becoming a coping mechanism again."
1296,Ruthless Ratched Remedy,
1297,I feel like someone is watching me when I shower. Could this be a genuine fear or is it anxiety/paranoia?,"I just moved into university accommodation. This building is a block of flats, and bedrooms are connected by bathrooms. It's one bathroom between 2 people. There are 6 bedrooms per flat.


In my flat there is only me and two guys when there's meant to be 6 people. One guy left due to there being a local lockdown. I have a bathroom to myself as my flatmates share a bathroom, and the bedroom next to mine is empty. But when I shower I am scared that there is someone watching me. I've showered three times since I got here (been here a week) and all times I've been anxious that someone is watching me. Every time I get out, I open the security app on my phone so I can call the police if someone is there. I feel shaky when I get out. 


The door that connects the other bedroom and the bathroom is locked, I locked it when I was sure my neighbour wasn't moving in yet. I've checked with my flatmates whether anyone's moved in and they say no.


Obviously there's about 50 students in the building, so lots of noise. But I keep thinking I hear noises from the room next to me, maybe even the door rattling. There's no one that lives above me, I'm on the top floor.


I just want to know what you think. I think it could be anxiety as I have clinical social anxiety, but this is different. I can't get it out my head that someone's watching me. It's specific to the shower as well so it's not just constant paranoia. Should I be worried? Should I check for cameras etc? If you think it's all in my head, how do I beat the anxiety?


TL;DR: I think someone is watching me when showering from the bedroom next to my bathroom. No one has moved into that room. Should I be worried?"

They're  making me feel like I cant improve or I'm not suitable for the job.

Some nights you get some,
Some days you're feeling buzzing,
But others you feel numb,
Sometimes you feel normal,
It's really quite deceiving,
But you'll always remember,
By those marks that you've been leaving,
That confidence is back,
You're flying like an eagle,
But it's a really weird feeling,
Being lonely in a room of people,
People start to notice,
You take it the wrong way,
You think it over and over,
And it ruins your whole day,
You put up that barrier,
And lock yourself away,
Loved ones walk on eggshells,
Cos they don't know what to say,
You tell them your alright,
And that you just need space,
But they can see that sadness,
Cos it's written on your face,
You think you're over the worst,
You're confidence is growing,
But then it finally catches you,
And the darkness starts showing,
What the hell is wrong with me,
How do I change these ways,
I was the soul of the party,
In the good old day,
That's it I've had enough,
I need to talk this through,
Luckily the ones you pushed away,
Are always there for you,
You get things off your chest,
Things don't seem so blurry,
But it's just the first step,
In a really long journey,
It's really good to talk,
About your dark feelings,
About all the pain inside,
And all those ugly demons,
If you're in this sort of place,
Please don't have a doubt,
There'll always be a loved one,
Waiting to help out."
1301,Dad was abusive my whole childhood and adolescence...he’s turned a new leaf but I’m not ready to move on,"My (22f) parents (both in their 40s) were verbally/emotionally abusive to my siblings and I for as long as I can remember, up until I was about 17 years old. Even beyond that our relationships were toxic but they mellowed out with the abuse after my older sister moved out and sort of denounced them for their actions. It was a wake up call for them. 

My parents got divorced when I was 7, currently my mom lives in Oregon and I live with my dad and stepmom in SoCal. 

My stepmom was never really a problem, she’s been a victim of my dad’s abuse also. My mom is sort of out of the picture now anyway since she moved. Over the past few years my dad has really put in a conscious effort to be a better dad. He’s kinder, more in control of his anger (though still has his moments), and attempts to be there for us emotionally like he never was before. He even volunteers with the crisis hotline and at-risk youth. He cares about mental health now, even though he used to always be so invalidating. He’s apologized too for how he’s treated us. I am genuinely very proud of him. 

But...I don’t want to be close with him. I want out of his house. I’m glad that he’s doing better and I hope someday we can have a great relationship but I don’t feel ready. I feel like I’m still dealing with so many issues and wounds that he caused. Just being around him is triggering sometimes. 

I’m not sure what to do. I feel really guilty shutting him out and pushing him away, but at the same time I don’t feel safe letting my guard down yet. I feel guilty because I know he’s trying so hard and he does love me...but there’s just so much damage that’s been done already that it feels better for me to turn down his efforts. My boyfriend is understanding of my pain but thinks because he’s my dad I should try to make things work. I’ve also had a therapist tell me to accept his love, but I’m just so scared and hurt.

Should I continue with my plan to move out and give myself space from him, or should I try to let him into my life and have a closer relationship? 

TL;DR my dad was emotionally/verbally abusive all my life until a few years ago. He’s a much better person and tries to have a closer relationship with me but I’m still so damaged from the past that I don’t want to be close. Am I in the wrong here for wanting space?"
1302,First mental health job; struggling with not taking hostile behavior personally,"Hi! Using a throwaway account to eliminate any identifying information from my main one. (Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of content, so mods please feel free to remove.)

I just got my first mental health job after earning my Bachelor's degree -- yay! I don't work directly with clients, but do enforce rules and provide various kinds of emotional support for them. 

Anyway I'll get straight to it. One of the clients has been acting hostile to me from the start -- in a way that's really triggering for me as someone who used to get bullied by ""mean girls"" in middle/high school. (e.g. being super sugary sweet/affectionate and friendly with everyone else in the room while throwing me pointed dirty looks, rolling her eyes when I try to communicate anything to her, or just saying ""UGH she's a fucking bitch"" to anyone else who may be around, but refusing to speak to me.) 

I know this behavior isn't about me, but damn it's rough to just absorb it and I'm having a really awful time:( so I'm curious if people on her, especially mental health workers, have some useful strategies for separating your own personal self &amp; past from random hostility (from clients or anyone). Thanks so much in advance!"
1303,Thank you.,"To the man who saved me from throwing my medical career down the drain for someone I can't save, thank you. 

Here's the story. I am a medical student. I just started two months ago. Almost two months ago, I also got diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I am still working with my psychiatrist to figure out what medications I can be on long-term to make me better. Right before I got my own diagnosis, I met a guy on a dating app, who happened to be bipolar, unmedicated. I just happened to become more manic than I've been in my life a few days into meeting him and ended up hallucinating a bit and checked myself into the ER to be evaluated and medicated. I hadn't been eating or sleeping, barely attending the one or two mandatory lectures remotely each day. 

He was stable when I met him and got progressively worse as the weeks went on. He is now at the point where he sees and hears things, thinks he's a god, thinks I'm a god, thinks the world is both heaven and hell at the same time, etc. 

Anyways, today he finally called me and asked me to take him to the ER. I had a mandatory session and told him I would come by as soon as it's over. Well, by the time I got there, he was in his head again about everything and couldn't see reality. I convinced him to get in the car and drove him to the hospital. He got out of the car at red lights while I was driving periodically--thank god the drive was just a couple miles. You can probably guess where this is going, but it took about an hour to get him into the door of the ER, and he stayed for about two minutes before panicking and running out. I burst into tears and managed to walk out and just sat there on the ground sobbing for several minutes. I didn't know where he was, nor did I have the mental energy to go looking for him in that moment. 

About two minutes into sitting on the floor, I heard a voice say ""miss!"" a couple times. He was yelling at me. It was the security guard at the front of the ER. I had shown him my med school badge and said that my friend needed help when we walked in. He gave me a long talk about how this man was not my responsibility and that by sitting here crying in front of the hospital, I was throwing away my career. He basically said 'go the f\*\*\*\* home and study or write whatever paper you have to write.' I kept saying he was suicidal and threatening me and other people. He said, ""I don't care! You can't save everybody! He has to want to help himself. You have a life to live."" In response to me telling him I just got diagnosed with bipolar, he said, ""so then you have your own shit going on! Leave him!"" Soon, I was hyperventilating trying to catch my breath as I cried, nodded, and said ""yes, sir"" under my breath. I thanked him and walked away. 

That was the reality check I needed to be selfish for once in my life and realize my own limitations. I do have my own shit going on. I deserve to care about myself first. I deserve to follow my dream. I deserve to become a doctor. I've worked so hard to get to where I am, and I can't throw it away on someone who doesn't want to be saved. I can't save him just because I want to. I can't save him just because I care. I can't save him just because I understand what he's going through. It's on him. 

So I called his friend as I walked away from there and told him what's going on, still in tears. His friend agreed that I should just go home and let him figure his own shit out, so I blocked him on everything. I scream-cried on the five minute drive home and in the ten minutes I was home showering and changing to get back to school to study. I don't know yet if what I did was the right thing, but what I do know is that I have to save myself first. I can't kill myself trying to save someone who won't let me save them. 

No one is reading this far, and that's okay. I'm sitting here at school now, minutes after this all happened, writing down my thoughts for my own sanity, so I can move on and study for my exam this week. I just can't tell anyone but internet strangers right now, so here I am. I hope this is appropriate to post here, but if not, I apologize."

1305,How to mentally recover from daily trauma caused by toxic colleagues and work place,"I originally posted my question and comment on a AMA earlier today but I think I missed the time the specialist was on and taking questions.

I really would like to help my friend who is struggling mentally, emotionally, and I would say physically as well.

The original post of mine: ""How can I help a friend get through traumatic memories of her toxic colleague and work place (she works in a school) she experienced two years ago? She let me know she has been having terrible flashbacks for about a year now and is thinking of quitting teaching all together. She can't stand how hostile, aggressive, and toxic her thinking and responses have been at work and with family. She has withdrawn a lot from friends and family and covid is not helping the situation. A lot of times, she doesn't go into a ton of detail because none of us are teachers and she feels like we don't fully understand what it is like. Also she doesn't want to burden me and friends with her problems. What can I do to let her know me and my friends are there for her?""

That toxic colleague has been living the best life after that school year and I really want my friend to do the same. Instead, she has been her own self-depriver and sees everything in a lose-lose perspective. The once optimistic, bubbly, lovely human being who is one of my best friend has become someone else almost. I feel like it's useless to say just forget about it...be positive...it's in the past...etc. How can I help my friend through this?"
1306,Over it,"I'm honestly just so over it. Sometimes it feels like the world is just one sick experiment that was created to see how much people can suffer.

I look at my peers and see how free they are to be themselves, how they can hold their partners' hands without thinking twice, how they can kiss them on the streets, how free they are to talk about them at work, school... And it just makes me so angry that I'll probably never experience that type of freedom."

I haven't cleaned my room in weeks, the depression mess has piled up so high that I'm not even sure what's in it anymore. I haven't changed my bedding in 3 weeks, usually I change it every week.

All I do is eat thanks to my meds, the past few days I've barely eaten a thing though. Then today I ate a big bag of crisps, a large bag of malteasers, 4 cereal bars, 2 chocolate bars, an actual meal with chicken and noodles and half a pack of custard cream biscuits. I feel sick, I feel disguising and all I want to do is throw up.

My birthday is on Friday, it's never been a great time and the threat of Christmas is getting closer. This year will be the first that my step dad is in prison, the first my half brother is without his dad. I hate that child but I can't be here. I just can't handle that.

The urge to harm myself is getting worse and worse... I had to stop therapy because I started a course to help me get into work. I just don't know what to do with my life. I never thought I'd make it past 18 but here I am, about to be 23. I don't remember my life due to trauma. So 16 and above is where most of my memories lie. So what am I supposed to do? Because I'm totally lost in depression right now. I'm scared that I won't be able to pull myself out this time."

1318,Seeking Advice on Depression and Anxiety,"Hi guys, apologies if I post this wrongly, I've never used Reddit before but I've been looking for help online and found this page so I was hoping someone could shed some light on my situation. For some context; I am 21 and I live in the UK, my girlfriend is also 21, and by character she is outgoing, can light up a room in seconds and is able to make friends with anyone. However, in the past few months I've noticed a drastic decline in her mental health and I'm getting really worried about her. On the outside looking in, you would assume everything about her life is perfect; she is high achieving at university, she does modelling work for brands such as Nike, Adidas and North Face and she has been a competitive swimmer for most of her life. However last year she started getting small shoulder pains which meant she had to stop swimming, and which soon developed into chronic back pain which has left her unable to even sit down in a lecture without being in agony. She struggled sleeping, exercising and even doing small things like wearing a backpack which is what I think started her anxiety. It started off with her mentioning that she would get really anxious about little things and now it has got to the point where the anxiety is just constant which tires her out even more. Day to day she says she just feels completely numb to everything and even though she laughs and smiles around our friends, she says this is just like a mask that she wears and inside she feels totally empty. she's expressed countless times to me that she wishes the ground would swallow her up or a bus would hit her so that she doesn't have to live another day in her current state and most days end up with her just curled up in bed silently crying. She has also become very pessimistic in her outlook to life which is completely opposite to how she normally views the world and she also views herself in such low regard; constantly saying she's fat which leads to extreme dieting and then binge eating, even though she is already so slim. She is convinced that it is all just to do with the back pain and that once that is fixed everything else will go away too but the problem is no doctor or osteopath seems to be able to do anything to help and I'm worried that unless she addresses these underlying mental health issues it's going to completely destroy her. She has also currently started taking over the counter sleeping pills to help her pass out in the evenings when she's feeling low but I think this is just ignoring the problems rather than addressing them. I'm so worried about her and I still try to help in any way I can but it's got to the point where I feel like I'm failing her because I can't make it go away :( There are some amazing campaigns online about opening up about mental health but I can't really find anyone or anywhere that can help tell us exactly what it is she's going through or how we can try to address it so I was just hoping someone here could maybe offer some advice. Again I'm sorry if I've posted this in the wrong place or if it's too long I just feel so lost and would appreciate any help, thank you to anyone reading this"
1319,I have successfully detached from every person/thing in existence. It's quite surreal.,"I broke things off with my girlfriend - who I wasn't really attached to, but I did like the comfort. I no longer desire to have a relationship with my mother because of how she's treated me. I was never close to my father or sister. 

The things keeping me down were my dogs, but now that I've gone to uni I don't even see them anymore, and out of sight out of mind seems to be how my brain works. 

I'm stuck now, because I would like someone to lean on. I had a FWB that I'd cuddle with, but honestly she was toxic as hell. The kicker is that I don't want a girlfriend yet, because I want to explore my options. 

It looks like I'll be staying detached for a long time, and it's very surreal to think about. It's something that I suppose I'd subconsciously strived to achieve for a long time, but now that it's happened its just quite empty really."

She isn't hot, in fact, a lot of people have told me that she's ugly, she's a bit taller and older than me, but IDK, I just like her for her personality. I know, shocking. So last year, I was having a conversation with a very popular girl in my school about crushes (My school is itty-bitty so everybody talks to almost everybody) and I let it slip that I have a crush on, let's call her Lilly. So, this human scum goes and tells everybody that I like her, and eventually, Lilly knows. Then that thing happened and I didn't see anyone until a couple weeks ago when school started again and I've been uncontrollably simping on her ever since. Everytime I do that, I put myself in her shoes and realize that, oh yeah, nobody wants to get simped on by an ugly, obese, short, looser with no friends whatsoever. On top of that, I've been watching way too much porn and now I really feel like the worst person on Earth. This story has a good ending, though. Recently I've been working out a lot, pushing myself to be better, and even though I know that my chances with Lilly are 6 feet under, I'm more than fine with being friends."
1324,I beat the shit out of myself. I want help so desperately,"My family has no where for me to stay. Im in a place im not safe. I cant handle the situation well. Im lost. This isnt me. I cant handle being talked over not heard accused of things im not doing. I have many coping mechanisms but I am overwhelmed. I am swollen and cut up my forehead and i have a black eye. Im so embarrassed. Im so ashamed. I have dreams and goals and ambition. I wont survive much longer I fear and i dont think anyone is understanding and I dont want to stress my family more plus They dont really make me feel better or supported. Im im pain. I was sexually assaulted and i havent coped with my problems im trying to. My significant other was calling me psycho when hitting myself instead of trying to use anything ive told her to help. I dont feel loved. I dont want to die. I feel so scared and have no where to go. 
Im on pua and ebt. Hotels are out of the question because I only get $171 right now. Maybe I should admit myself but im afraid my stuff isnt safe too."
1325,Delusion? False memory? Help..,Let me start off by saying i have anxiety and ocd. I have this rumination that I'm hurting my daughter in my sleep. I have memories of this but I'm pretty sure they're false/ocd related. Any ideas? Thank you.
1326,"I feel kind of dead unhealthy, honestly i felt unhealthy for ten years.","after 6th grade after i was bullied by my entire class i got a developing PTSD i felt so unstable so unwell about me, when i got in 7th grade i felt dead but at the same time i felt like ""i can fix it"" i tried to make a new friends (because i lacked of social experience after third grade because of the bullying) later they started to join my bullies, winter of 8th grade i stopped going to school and hated to going outside i had a fear of my classmates would find me or see, my parents couldn't take me out of the house so they tried to contact a psychiatrist before contacting they tried to drag me outside of my house even violently - abusively, after all their tries they got me out to the psychiatrist i took my psychology hobbyist took a chance to learn from psychiatrist and i made out that have schizophrenia (saying that i hear voices)  she gave me seroquel and recommended my mom send me to mental health center and she did it, played with the mental health center psychiatrist  and i agreed to it (yeah when i was 13 i was a wild kiddo) also i had no way, if i didn't agree for it i would be a retarded as i was when i was 13 in the same dark room not agreeing to study left with paranoia and repeatable bad memories (that still i have lmao) so this mental health center kinda saved my ass even if the diagnosis was false, i got out after four months dropping the stupid medication that made my sleep schedule to suffer came to school for the mentally ill (not for me, hated it) stayed for a year, moved to private school (that almost didn't want me there) little bit improved (logic improved lol) met a more stable people to be around, i didn't study much in 10th grade and 11th but now i'm in 12th and i need my education. before getting to this school i met a psychologist she saw that i had a high ptsd signs and i need a social skills improvements (they were low) she helped me to get to the private school by convincing them, later my school got closed because of the municipality in my city hated private schools so this school basically moved to another city it was very hard at first but it got normative, coronavirus saved me because i have a problem being everyday in school so the online classes are amazing for me.

ok so here is my problems lately:

\- social anxiety (diagnosed, 7+) - because of the low social experience i have no normal social life, even if i have two friends but we don't talk much even if we try they have different hobbies interests (even if i try to get into this). the social anxiety made me really get in anxiety for years ""holy shit, are they talking about me"" ""they know my name... probably there are some rumors about me (school)"" (something like that). because of it i can't interact normally because of it i don't have a normal social life because of that i appear rude around others.

\- remembering my past a lot (month), i don't want it, remembering my bully and everything it was like... 5 years ago..

\- needing attention, i always wanted this as a child i always lacked it but now i also sometimes want it but also i don't want it, it's a high dilemma.

\- feeling just dead, i'm dead but still walking (two months), no one understands me no one hears me.

ok so i know some of you will say, 

""contact a health counselor"" -   i was sent two years ago and the psychiatrist stated my mental health as normal and as ""teenage angst"", can't drag my parents into this again i don't want to disappoint them, again. i'll wait till 18 which only four months left and try to go.

""Wtf"" - yep.

&amp;#x200B;

   please reply idk, just say ""wth"" lol."
1327,"I need to learn to have better patience, does anyone have any tricks?","Self reflection has shown me I need to learn not to be triggered so easily. While I'm fairly easy going I think I could be a better person by learning how to just move past a crappy moment, a crappy person etc. 

Anyone have any tricks that have worked for them? Forced thought that processes to help change?"
1328,"I don’t think I can continue down my current path, please read at least the TL;DR","TL;DR - 19 year old student with severe mental health issues surrounding attachment and friendships, i feel too far behind in my degree to continue with the weight of my depression and delusions crushing me, i need advice 

A little about me, i’m a 19 year old uni student and am suffering from severe depression that is very likely to be borderline personality disorder according to my doctor, for the last few years i have suffered uncontrollably by getting attached to people who just don’t feel the same about me, i’m not even talking romantic attraction, my friends just don’t to want to see me as much or care for me as much as i do them. I now have only three friends left from home, who all go to different universities than myself, but even when not at uni i felt i hardly saw them.

Last year from around August to December i went through the roughest period of my life, i had just started uni, i had trouble making friends, and all my friends from home were not contacting me, that was back when i had friends, as I said i only have three now (three girls, i am a guy) the rest have decided they don’t like me. A group of these old ‘friends’ sometimes talk to me and make me feel falsely included, all while telling me how i have no friends, how i am an outcast, and talking shit behind my back. I recently decided enough was enough when i caught them insulting each other by saying they were my friend. Yes, they actually saw being labelled as my friends as embarrassing, as an insult. I decided that night to blank them all, i don’t want to hear from them again.

Back to my first uni term, my dissociation from the people i cared about had me suicidal, i stopped going to my lectures because i thought i would be dead long before any of the knowledge would be useful. Instead i spent my days in bed, slowly gaining weight and losing money due to all the take outs i had been eating to distract myself from how painful my life was. 

Skip forward to my summer, coronavirus lockdown is well in force, i passed my exams only because they were online so i could cheat my way through them with teacher’s notes. The previous months had seen some of my worst days, my birthday on which the love i received from my friends was next to nothing, the feeling of being suicidal on my own birthday is not one i think ill be able to get through again. 

If anything, the lockdown did my mental health good, theres no real way to feel left out if nobody is even allowed to meet up, but once it was over everything was back to normal. I saw the three friends more than i used to, but still not a lot at all, ive spoken to the two of them i am closer with about my mental health, they are supportive and seem to care for me, thought one told me that although she cared it was starting to affect her and that she felt i was her responsibility. Since then i do not often speak about my mental health with them.

I tried therapy, which i was given by the NHS as i was classed as someone who needed it, but the limited sessions i had did not help. 

I am now in my second year living with friends at university who get along with, however i was an outcast to them at the time housing was decided, them only taking me in through feeling sorry for me. My degree is too difficult with the weight of my depression and the work i have to catch up on from last year. I just have no motivation, and part of me wants to drop out as at this rate i will fail.

Thank you for reading, if there is any advice you can give it would be much appreciated"

1330,We do not give enough credit or enough mention towards dogs..,"Of course cats are great as well.

But dogs are just incredible..I cannot tell you how many times I have gone from an incredibly dark place to laughing and feeling relief by just being with my dogs. 

I cannot say this enough if you are struggling (especially with anxiety and depression) *get a dog* it could be a therapy dog or just a puppy from the shelter but get one. It’ll help you so much. Yes they can be a lot of work but (of course everyone will be different) imho the work is so worth it. 

There’s so many options of breeds with different temperaments, hair lengths, sizes etc. that you can find one that fits your personality and lifestyle."
1331,What is this called or is it nothing?,"Every week or so I'll get really stressed out for almost no reason and I have a hard time not thinking about suicide or self harming, and then I can't focus on homework for the life of me so by the time I can start it I barely get any sleep by the next day.  Sometimes I get audible hallucinations when it happens and it makes me more stressed out.    I want to put a name to it without accidently saying its something that its not but im not sure what to call it?"
1332,When is it appropriate to consider a PTSD service animal?,"So I’ve been having an extremely rough go of things for the last year, but most especially in the last 6 months. 

Today, I experienced my 5th panic attack at work in a month and it’s really leaving me physically and mentally drained each time I have one. It’s also impacting my ability to feel confident in doing my job. 

At what point should consider a PTSD service animal?

This would be different from an ESA, but rather a service animal with public access that would help me to 1. Reduce the severity of my panic attacks when they do happen and 2. Help me to remain grounded and lessen the disorienting effects of these panic attacks. 

For some background: Not a veteran, have been diagnosed with MDD, BPD, PTSD, GAD, and ADHD. 

Has anyone here had experience with this sort of service animal that provides assistance directly related to a hidden disability in this way?

I know this wouldn’t be just any animal adopted from the pound, but a service animal specifically trained to pick up signs of mental distress and provide grounding so to speak on cue in public. I also understand the controversy around this and having to establish that said animal provides a service that is clearly distinct from an ESA that requires training to meet the definition of a service animal under the ADA. 

At what point should I say enough is enough and start seriously considering this? What are your thoughts on this?"
1333,Bit of a vent,"This time in my life is important. I'm supposed to be forming my future. Working hard to get the grades i need to do whatever i want to do in Uni. I have that capability. These are the formative years of my life. But instead,  whatever cruel God, or force of the universe stripped away any will or motivation to do anything. Correction: stripped implies that i had any in the first place. I am wasting my own potential, and i feel as if there's nothing i can do about it. I have no will to do anything,  even the things i enjoy doing. 

Do i want to kill myself? It's a question i haven't had to seriously ask myself in a long while.  But i now realise that yes, I do. I have no will to live. I just want everything to stop. I want my life to stop. Am i actually going to do it? No. Or at least not at this present moment in time.  I hate myself. Because of this lack of will to do anything.  Because of this eating disorder that i was so sure was more or less gone for good, but now seems to be back to spiralling out of control. Because of my constant flashbacks to past anxious events,  causing me even more anxiety.  

I used to seek a label, a diagnosis for my problems, maybe because if it's an actual problem then maybe there's a solution. But the mental health recources in my local area are shit and I'm under 18. Depression, possibly ADD, definite anxiety. But God fucking knows.  I'm so sick and tired of me wasting my life. I just want it to stop."
1334,"my ex wrecked my mental health, this is my closure","So I had this hot popular boyfriend that I've known since my childhood that I saw through rose colored glasses, that at the time I thought was way to good for me I also knew he was going to hurt me for I feel like deep down that's what I thought deserved, but nothing that bad would ever happen to me right? As the mouths went passed I wondered why I got so nerves and felt sick after seeing him and how stupid I was being that I was wasn't ready for the fun things he wanted to do. 

Well he cheated on me then preceded to ignore me for 8 mouths so I eventually I broke up with him, mind you we had a secret relationship this while time so I couldn't tell anyone for a long time because I didn't want to hurt him even though I was the only one who cared about that in the relationship. Because I'm being sensitive, I'm being weak, I'm making things up you know its only when I told someone that I realized that I was sexually assaulted on many accounts. I now had a word for it. At lest now I know why I felt like that it would stop hurting, right? wrong. I always see posts and articles on women who survived sexual assault and I say to myself ''there so strong' but I don't feel strong at all for I wore shorts, for I lead him on, for I must of given him a look, for he was my boyfriend so consent doesn't matter, right? wrong once more. I know he'll never say sorry he might be a mix of my self destructive nature and his cluelessness.

With the trauma its left me I cant do anything sexual wise anymore with that being by myself, videos or with others, leading to a full swing panic attack and its suffocating. I wish I could just get over it. when people getting close to me didn't make me want to push them away, when people saying something similar to him didn't make me upset and when I didn't lie awake at night thinking how things could be different. 

On off days I feel myself missing him. 

I can tell all people want me to do is move on and just get another boyfriend or have fun without panicking, trust me I want that as well. This whole using words thing is very new to me you see I'm an artist with a bad habit of shoving down feelings and I cant really tell people my full story because I don't want people to see him in a bad light, I not want the pity either, I don't want people to feel bad for me. I try and help people with there relationships because I prefer for me to be hurt and prevent it for others then me seeing someone sit in silence. My best friend is really good with words and she helps people every day and I might just be hear to let go of one my story but they might help someone else with there own. And I know its not intense or some would say even worth getting worked up about. I'm always doing my best to help others and listen but I think I need this closure even if no one sees this its out there now and that might help me go on.

1335,Wife won't accept or seek help,"I'm posting this because I really need some insight. Im a married man with a 10 year old girl and 8 month old boy. I myself have been in and out of therapy for years now and have finally found a medication that really does help. My wife on the other hand has not. Her outlook on therapy and medications are positive, unless it has to do with her. She's depressed with highs and lows every week for years now. I try to be supportive and talk to her. I tell her to talk about what's bothering her and she does every now and then and it does seem to help....for a little while. No matter if I'm nice and calm or if I get completely frustrated the outcome is always that I'm saying mean things to her and making her feel worse. I always try to let it go and see if she will make appointments on her own but theres always an exucse as to why she didnt. Im at a loss because there is literally nothing that I say to her that can be misconstrued in the slightest. Im worried because her family has a history of suicide and coping with substances. I know I can't make her do anything or force it on her but she just won't go get help. Im just lost and feel hopeless because I can't do anything to help. Any insight or previous experiences with something like this would help. Thank you"
1336,Just said goodbye to a loved one,"It hasn’t even phased me, I didn’t even cry when I said my goodbye to her. What is wrong with me why don’t I care? This yea  has been total shit and I get more and more negative news put on me day by day, I cut to feel better. I know I know, I’m trying to stop for good and I’m passively suicidal. I don’t know if that could be a factor or something like that"
1337,I don't want to die but I don't want to continue living either because life feels incredibly hard. Am I depressed?,"I think that I am depressed.  There are times where I feel empty, I dont want to do anything, and I feel alone. I dont find anything interesting or fun when this happens.  I don't have the energy to deal with anyone and I feel like I'm cut off from everybody else.  I don't feel like I can go to a professional for it because I'm a guy.  I don't feel like I can ask for help from people I know."
1338,How did i just stop caring for a person?,"English is not my first language and im a fist time poster.

So there is this family member that i used to adore. This person was my favorite in the entire world and i would light up when they sendt me a text. Now i have to say that i come from a broken family and this probably has something to do with it.  This person did something which did hurt me but it wasnt intentional. I know that they seek attantion from theyre mother and i told them something about my father. well they told their mother and word came to my father. he got angry and after i realised what happend i suddenly stopped caring about this person. Now when their name pops up on my screen i just get annoyed and i cant find out why. So i was wondering if reddit knew?"
1339,How to stop feeling tired when anxious,"When my mental health was at its worst, I would sleep pretty much all day, everyday. It got to the point where my school put me on medical leave thinking there was something physically wrong with me since I was missing so many classes.

It's been a couple years since then and somehow through pure willpower I was able to stop sleeping whenever I experienced stress, anxiety, depression, etc. However, I still have moments when I have to really ""push through"" those tiring sensations. For example, I might yawn a lot during a job interview or my brain will get sleepy-fuzzy when working under a deadline. 

For those who also use or used sleep as a coping mechanism, what are some skills you used to to combat those tired feelings? I have experience with CBT, DBT, meditating, mindfulness, etc so really anything goes."
1340,I feel like a failure and I want to just sleep forever,"2020 has been rough in general. I’ve grown a lot this year but I’ve also struggled a lot mental health-wise.

The summer was the one thing I had left to be excited about this year (high-paying internship at a big company). Now that it’s over and I’m sitting and waiting to see if I’ll get a return offer, nothing really excites me anymore.

My last year of my grad program started a week ago and I’m already behind because I’ve barely opened any material related to my work. I started my on-campus job again (I left temporarily to pursue the internship) and I feel like a failure. I had a coworker who I looked to for guidance, but she graduated and was replaced with an undergrad. Now I’m supposed to provide guidance and I feel I’ve just...not done that. I find it so hard to motivate myself to get out of bed and do work, she probably thinks I’m lazy whenever we meet up and I’m so far behind on everything.

A classmate reached out to me because she wants advice on career stuff. Because in 2019 and early 2020, I was the talk of the town. Winning international competitions, getting prestigious internships, producing impressive side projects. Now I just feel like a huge phony. Like I have no idea what I’m doing.

I can barely understand anything people are saying to me during meetings. I can’t focus in class.

I just want to quit. I’m tired of disappointing people and I’m tired of having to try.

Everything feels so hard now."
1341,I hope you'll all feel better soon.,Thats it. Take care!
1342,My (14m) girlfriend (14f) has started to engage in self harm.,"She has admitted to most likely having BDD, and lately has cut herself on 3 separate occasions. She helped me out of clinical suicidal depression and I don’t know how to help her. I really want to and need to help her but I have no clue how to."
1343,Why does my wife do what she does?,"I've been married 8 years, and the marriage feels like it has been a roller coaster the whole time. When we first started dating she told me that she had drug problems, and an eating disorder. I even helped her throw away coke in a needle once. Us getting married was probably a big mix of infatuation, youth, wanting and believing she was putting her life together and I was going to help her, and actual love.

Right after we got married she spent 5 months in the same eating disorder treatment she had been to twice already. She came home for a month, and went back a month later. Over the years, she has almost died of malnutrition at least 3 times. On top of that, I would frequently learn about hidden drinking, cigarettes, marajuana, and pain pill abuse on top of the disordered eating, sometimes I would catch her, other times you would admit it years later (usually after I caught her doing something and wondered why). I know that most of these aren't illegal most of the time, but I've been clear with her that I don't want that in my life, and being that has alcoholic tendencies and has been a past drug abuser, I didn't think complete sobriety was a bad idea. Instead she would always hide it, and I don't think she would ever tell me until I caught her or her therapist or doctor forced her. 

In the same spirit, a few days ago our neighbor pounded on our door at 1230AM and exposed my wife's (at least) emotional affair with her husband. She, being understandably upset, waved her husband's phone in my face, and I went through the last month and a half's texts as best I could sitting outside in the cold for an hour, while our neighbor interrogated my wife (when she would come out). My wife had deleted the texts immediately, so I knew what I what I would learn would have to be then and there, and while I didn't see proof of a sexual relationship, it was obvious that she had been drinking with him, giving her marajuana, and discussing harder drugs with her (at least LSD and mushrooms). She admitted to the neighbor that it had been going on for about 6 months, and that they kissed twice. 

Honestly I was probably so dumbstruck I was numb by the time I went in. My wife had practically been begging me not to read the texts, and I knew that there was so much information that I didn't have. Two nights later, the police knocked on our door at around 1230AM, and took her to the hospital because she had a suicide plan and had contacted a crisis line. I've been sad and anxious out of my mind, and confused this time because I thought our marriage had been the best it had ever been. After the last bought of marriage counseling, I was told that I'd need to let myself be vulnerable and trusting to make the marriage work, and I did it, and thought I was seeing the benefits, and then this.

I'm sorry I'm writing so much... I feel like I need to provide context I guess. The last thing I'll mention is that I asked my wife if I could see her phone last night, and she consented, but got really anxious when I left with it and followed me. I could tell that she had deleted so much. For example, text conversations where all short, and various apps I'd seen before were gone. In particular, I wanted to see her Venmo history, which is the one account she has that I've never had access to. It was gone as well, but emails from transactions where in her history, and I found out that she had been buying alcohol for almost a year with money she had been taking out of her paycheck before putting it in a shared account. Probably lied to me about all the times direct deposit wasn't working to do it... She has maybe spent a few months clean.

I'm sad to say I'm omitting a lot, but to my question, my wife has at one time or another told me that she has been diagnosed with 

* Anxiety
* Depression
* Panic Disorder
* Anorexia
* Bulimia
* Bipolar Disorder
* Borderline Personality Disorder

The BPD was forever ago, and I read a fair amount about and was skeptical she really had it. Right now she is claiming her actions are due to her bipolar, that she ""didn't feel in control of herself"" when she was doing these things. She started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago and immediately started bipolar meds, so I guess that was being proactive? The thing is, while I've seen the depression and anxiety, I don't feel like I see the while swings so much, this seems more constant to me. Oh, and while she hasn't been disordered eating for over a year (at least anorexia), now it seems like it gaining a lot of steam, if not full blown already. 

Do any of these diagnoses fit? Or is she just manipulative and doesn't like being clear minded?

To her credit, we have two kids, and I believe she is a good mom when not under the influence, and she seems to have done mostly well at her first job after being a stay-at-home mom for 5 years. 

Again, sorry for the length, I venting as well I suppose..."
1344,Self-care,"Taking care of myself is always so hard. Whether its cleaning my room, taking a shower, brushing my teeth, or even remembering to take my medicine. I feel like its just because I'm lazy but I was wondering if my depression had anything to do with it? I don't see why I wouldn't want to take care of myself, it's just a weird tendency to do nothing rather than something, and I hate it. But at the same time, I'm taking lexapro, should I even be experiencing any affects from depression?"
1345,I've hit a rut in life (16M),"Hey lads I just need to vent a bit but I want to hear from you guys too. I am the textbook definition of  a nerd, short and fat. I have been bullied for sometime and have been suffering from both depression and anxiety. Most of my friends have drifted apart or have found themselves in relationships. I have been able to seek treatment and see a therapist and psychologist which has helped me make great strides compared to how I used to be. For some reason I now find myself quickly disinterested in things I once enjoyed like videogames and other activities. Has this happened to anyone else and if so, what helped you through it? Even if you cannot relate have you had any experiences similar that you managed to overcome?"
1346,How am I not an asshole for reaching out?,"Every time I reach out to my friends, I feel horrible, like a burden. My therapist is encouraging me to reach out, but I already ask for enough help from them already. Am I an asshole?"
1347,Pain.,"I’ve got a group of 4 friends. One of them is a girl I’m into. Us 5 aren’t insanely close and we haven’t been a group of friends for super long either, but for whatever reason they are essentially all that makes me feel happy anymore. I keep opening and closing our group chat and I constantly check for notifications from any of them. It’s terrible. I feel like I need them way more than they need me, and I feel like it’s impossible that that girl would be into me too. Idk what to do because at this point my last good group of friends is being overrun by the negative thoughts I always have and can’t stop having."
1348,I think I might have some form of depression and I don’t know what to do.,"I’m a 19yo part-time college student, part-time drive-thru worker at a Panera. I’m sorry that this is a lot to read, but I don’t know any other way to explain it. About a year ago I started seeing a councilor at the church that my parents go to, but came away with little other than “no stop having negative thoughts, you’re better than that” and “read this bible verse”. I’m not the most religious person, but I still do have some beliefs that probably don’t matter that much to whoever’s reading this. 

At first, I thought the counseling would help, because it gave me someone that I could be 100% open with and have them remember the things I told them. My councilor tended to forget about things that we talked about, leading to me reliving and re-explaining a lot of really difficult things in my life. Unless my day starts with a very positive note, my constant feelings of self hate, loneliness and sadness just overwhelm me. When I try to talk with friends, they reason with me and hear me out but seem to forget about the things we talk about. This only makes me feel even more unimportant in their lives while they’re some of the most important in mine. 

It feels like I give so much but receive little in return. It isn’t some kind of thing where I don’t get paid or rewarded enough, I only expect the same level of respect and love that I give but I don’t get it. Especially lately, I’ve been really struggling with these feelings. I went to a wedding of someone who I saw as an older brother and mentor throughout my years in high school. He gave me the resources I needed for a lot of projects, even going on to basically organize a documentary for me. At the wedding, he felt so distant. I understand, it’s his day, not mine, but as someone he personally planned and contacted to be his videographer, I felt like I was treated like a pest. My friend, who was another wedding guest and student of the guy, was a groomsman and treated like his best friend. I felt alienated and unwanted.

While I sat at a table during the reception and waited for my camera’s batteries to finish recharging, I couldn’t help but get overwhelmed with thoughts of loneliness as I watched friends, family and couples dance and have what might be one of the best nights of their lives. I fell into my deep pit of wanting to be loved by someone and just wanting to be treated like so many other guests were only to get nothing. I found myself disappearing to the bathroom for half an hour, puking my guts out and ruining my pretty cool Darth Vader tie. 

Over the last few months, with being stuck at home with a controlling and sometimes abusive father, I’ve had a lot of suicidal thoughts. Almost daily. Sometimes I even go so far as to plan how I’d do it and imagine how people would react. When driving home from the wedding, I seriously considered veering into the three-foot thick concrete wall of the highway as I was going well over 90mph. The ride after that was a blur as I sat a bit confused with myself. 

This mixed with a lot of confusing feelings I’ve had with the relationships of who I seem to think are my closest friends have just been incredibly overwhelming and I’ve found myself crying myself to sleep at 2 in the morning. Usually I hold my dog as long as I can before she gets annoyed and moves away from me. Because of these thoughts, I feel like I may be dealing with depression that simple “think positive!” messages will not fix. I feel like I am in dire need of professional help and maybe even medical help."
1349,SO Doesn’t Respect my Wishes.,"I was raised by addicts, ya know the drill horribly abused and abandoned. For the most part I grew up well (learned to manage my mental health etc). 

Fast forward- I meet this guy. Things are great. We move in together. Then I find him passed out in the bathroom behind a locked door from drinking too much. This was a major trigger for me. I have never been a drinker (when living by myself I just didn’t have alcohol in the house). After this I freak, he says he gets it and is cool banning alcohol from the house. A few months later I can tell something is off (as I think all children of addicts can tell) so I go searching and find a hidden bottle of whiskey in a back junk closet. Once again I freak he apologizes we move on. This happened 3 more times. 

At this point I don’t want to break up with him and I realize I could be maybe a little too controlling with alcohol. I cave a little bit and decide we can have alcohol in the house for nights he wants to play video games with friends. Obviously he isn’t drinking while playing games with friends he is just somehow drinking. 

This weekend he had to work over the weekend (working from home) I left to run errands. Came back with lunch and once again just knew something was off. Well home slice had been drinking at work while I was gone. He has yet to offer any sort of apology. Frankly I am tried and could use any advice. 

Aside from this issue he is a great guy. 

Haaaaaaalp."
1350,My poem about my mental health.,
1351,I feel nothing and i am afraid of the future,"Lattely i (M27) have feeling down. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I feel like i wanted to fall a sleep and never wake up, or wake up in a few years. I don't like my job and my boss is pretty toxic. All i just want is to go to university and try to be a nurse. But what is the catch? I am very afraid that i will fail miserably. And i need to work to pay university. I am kinda lost and scared. I think i feel like i am too old, and i think i am not ready for the age i have. I don't know how to explain better. I too have afraid of destroing my relationship with my beloved girlfriend. She is the best but i feel i am hurting her. I know she supports me on whatever my decision is, but i am always thinking, what if...
Sorry to bother you all. And thnks for listening to me."
1352,Time to reconsider SSRIs?,"Hi,

Over the past few months things have been really rough. I'm diagnosed with MDD, GAD and ADHD. I see a psychiatrist and he's aware that I want to be on as little medication as possible. This is because two years ago I was seeing a different psychiatrist who put me on medications that really didn't improve my mental health, including 10mg of escitalopram and 2mg of clonazepam daily. I quit both cold turkey after a few hospitalisations and found that being on no medication actually made things a lot better. Now, things aren't so good anymore and my psychiatrist has suggested multiple times that I go on SSRIs again. (I don't remember which one in particular - but I know it wasn't escitalopram) I've really wanted to try and avoid this because all I can think about is how horrible the side effects were but things are just becoming so unbearable I'm wondering if it's worth a shot. Also, if it makes any difference I'm only 15 so these dosages probably affect me more than they would for an adult."
1353,I think I have a binge eating disorder and don't know where to go for help,"I am an 18 year old and just moved away from home for the first time for college. I binged a lot when  I was home, but it was a little easier because I still had somewhat healthy stuff for lunch and dinner and had some sort of meal schedule, but since I moved out, I literally have nothing to keep me somewhat on track. I want to lose weight, but it's hard because I find myself overeating to deal with stress, overeating to deal with loneliness, and just overeating because I overeat. I don't know what to do. In the past, I have tried dieting, working out, drinking more water, going to meetings like Overeaters Anonymous, but it just doesn't seem to work. I know I should just have more self control, but it's easier said than done. I don't want to talk to my parents about it because I don't like to cost them money and it's super embarrassing. I just feel super alone right now. And then school and life has been pretty stressful as well which has made it worse. I got a UTI my first week of college, then I had bacterial vaginosis from the antibiotics for the UTI, and when I went to the student health center for that, I took an STI test too and as it turns out, I had chlamydia. On top of that, it's mid-terms and I have three essays due this week with two more exams and a quiz. I also lack the motivation to do my work which makes everything 1000 times worse. So I'm really struggling here and it's just making me want to eat more.

Any advice?"
1354,How do I help a loved one who refuses help but needs it,"I don’t know how to start this or explain it... but I need advice or some sort of sign showing light at the end of the never ending tunnel.. I come from a pretty normal family with two other siblings - myself (26), middle (24) and youngest (20). We all bickered often growing up but we were still your typical siblings - played sports, participated in extracurriculars and equally hated school. We never got personal with one another but that was normal for us. We all secretly loved each other in our own ways. 

Anyways, since 2012 we have had ongoing battles. The youngest has been through a lot and to this day, we truly don’t think we even know the half of anything.  We have had hundreds of arguments due to the youngest blowing up on anything and everything possible since about the age of 11. You speak in a tone they don’t like? Goodluck. You bring up a topic they secretly get triggered by? Goodluck. You ask a question they don’t like? You’re in for a rude awakening. But we still try to be there for them as some of the hardships have greatly affected us personally as well. Basically we’re all in it together to some extent. We have gotten closer since an incident back in 2014 and we now make sure to show how much we love each other. But lately (since I moved back home with my parents) I have seen the affects it has had on my parents and unfortunately it’s still happening but at much larger scale. The youngest has been diagnosed with various issues, seen therapists and overall is just very scatter brained. The youngest refuses help and refuses to take anything for her said diagnosed issues but when you speak to them, it’s like walking on egg shells. You literally are just sitting there waiting for the bomb to go off, you just never know when it will.. Said sibling simply cannot do day to day functions anymore and they rely heavily on medicinal remedies to “calm” them yet that still cannot control the never ending tantrums and issues that arise. I truly and honestly think they believe everyone is out to get them and that the world somehow revolves around them. They go off on a person at least once, if not twice a week. Whoever it is, it could be a stranger, store clerk, family member or their significant other but it happens WEEKLY. Almost like they look for issues or problems. Said sibling actually got fired from their first job in well over a year today because they simply didn’t care to listen to the manager and left early after being told if they didn’t stay until 4PM, they would fire em. And yes, said sibling hasn’t been able to hold a job for more than 2 months due to the ongoing issues of whatever it might be.. Whether it’s someone looked at them funny or they don’t have enough gas to get from their house to said job or they said some bizarre thing to said sibling and they stormed out and quit. Truly the most bizarre incidents happen with them and I just don’t understand anymore...

My parents break down because they simply cannot help said sibling at all.. But they do everything in their power to provide what they can. It is so hard to watch my family unravel in such a way that I simply cannot control or imagine. Said sibling needs help but we struggle bringing it up continuously might trigger something that would not be in our favor. But if we don’t say anything, we might be in this never ending cycle for life. I just want them to get the help they need and be happy for once.. but I truly have no idea what more any of us can do.."

1356,It was just wine.,"I’d like to preface this with I’m klutzy...extremely.  I trip I drop thing etc. Well I bought a bottle of wine and some beer as my fiancé just started a new job after 13 years with his prior company. Me being me i somehow managed to pinch my thumb in the wine open and pulling my thumb away it feels off the counter. Not a big deal I call for help as I’m barefoot so he can bring my flip flops and I can clean it up. 

Another thing to mention before getting more into this is my ex husband if I ever broke or spilled something would scream at me call me names or make me feel stupid. The most expensive thing I ever dropped in our marriage/relationship was orange juice. 

While I trying to sweat the pieces so I can Moo he’s making jokes. Which is fine he’s a sarcastic guy, but they start making me feel worse so I simply say okay I’m done please don’t keep making fun of me. He doesn’t stop so I’m getting upset. I ask him for help because he keeps telling me there’s more glass but doesn’t get it or point it out. He tell me he doesn’t want to get another broom sticky because HES the one who will have to spray it off (I was actually and it took less than 2 minutes.) I’m getting more upset so I finally tell him to just leave me a alone and go play a game or something. He then starts to get upset and ends up calling me a bitch because I’m actually like a bitch. 

The floors clean and physically speaking the world didn’t end but not all I can think about is how my ex used to treat me and all I really want to do is cut. I used to cut a lot but haven’t but it’s my fall back when I feel like this. It’s seems so silly but I’m so immensely hurt right now and just want it to stop but I’m trying not to revert to a knife and other self harm."
1357,Am I being selfish by having a POC therapist?," Hey out there!

I have a question and I think I'm overthinking it but idk where else to bring it so here I am. 

I recently started seeing anew therapist and I really really like her. But I am white and she is POC. I feel some guilt in this as I feel like I am taking away a valuable resource that other POC clients might benefit from more than I do...what do I do? Does it matter? Am I being too weird?"
1358,I’m confused and would like others opinions on what to do please,Ok so Sunday afternoon was very weird I was at my moms house because my parents are divorced s and have been since I was 2 now my mom has married some and they’ve been together since around 2014 although most of their relationship was spent long distance because my step dad was in jail but now he’s out again and has been for a while but this Sunday I had a weird encounter with him while my mom was at work ok so it all started when my step dad brought a blanket to my room apparently he saw something I really don’t think he did though I was laying in bed in an oversized t shirt with my dog and the door open the dog was laying in the way of him seeing anything plus I had a comforter in the way too after that I felt a little uncomfortable and decided to sit up so I could make sure everything was covered so I sat there for awhile petting the dog and scrolling through instagram and then asked an inappropriate question about my relationship with my girlfriend related to sexual things which makes no sense to me considering I’m a very young minor I thought it was weird but I just kinda laughed it off then he left me alone for awhile but walked into my room later I don’t remember exactly what he said because he wasn’t making that much sense to me and this kept happening he would try to talk about something then go to the living room and come back he hugged me a few times such was weird and then it got weird by the end of this mess I figured out the point he was trying to make was that he was basically aroused by my body and that I needed to put pants on or shorts what I was wearing was literally giving me the same amount of coverage as I would have even wearing shorts so I didn’t quite get it at some point he lifted my shirt a little and I still don’t know what he was trying to do and made comments like I should clothes on or not wear any or lift up my shirt this entire situation made me feel gross and uncomfortable so after he went back to the living room I just sat in my room for a while and texted my girlfriend about it I was stuck between feeling like it’s my fault and wanting to throw up and cry I had to go get my clothes from the dryer to take back to my dads house and I was pretty happy to find out he fell asleep in the living room so I could get my clothes and leave when my mom got back from work to take me to my dads house I told my mom what happened on the way back and all she said is I should wear shorts idk if she’s going to say anything to Him about it or not but I just wanna know if it’s my fault this happened or how to feel about this and what should do when I go back to my moms this week
1359,Screaming from the Front Row as My Parents Make the Same Mistakes With My Younger Sister,"I (21)F had a really difficult time with my parents and mental health growing up. At the beginning of high school I started spiraling into depression which made me not want to do anything and... my parents let me. All I wanted to do was sleep and eat so I would cry or just refuse to do most things and they still feel like there was nothing they could have done for me.

Because of this, I have tried my very best to be a supplemental ""parent"" to my sister when it comes to mental health but she's regressed to the point where she doesn't want to do anything and... again my parents are letting her. My influence is starting to slip and she's hiding behind them to make some really bad decisions. She just started a new boarding school and today was her second day. She called my parents and asked to come home and they agreed to let her come home this weekend and go back to her old school.

I don't know anyone who would let their child come home from an amazing opportunity that they were so excited about because they had a hard first day. WHO FUCKING DOESN'T? But my parents won't listen. They say they can't make her stay. Just an absolute refusal to parent which set me up for absolute failure. I've really advocated for therapy for my family and my sister has gone irregularly. My mom and I just went for our first session where the therapist emphasized knowing when to treat your child (me) like an adult and when to treat them like your child. Apparently it didn't sink in or she doesn't know where to apply it. It's just ridiculously frustrating and affecting my own mental health but I can't just stop because she's my sister and I really can't stand the thought of her regressing to the point I did."
1360,"If you just disappeared, socially, how many people would reach out to you?","I'd say mine, is probably 2."
1361,I'm on a self destructive path and idk where it will end only how....,"I'm gonna start by saying I'm a 26 (m) and I have no idea if this is the right place for this if not please somebody help me find the right one. And buckle up this may be long.


So I'm 26 now and have a 7 year old boy and 1 year old daughter. Both by the same woman whom I love more than anything. 

So let's start back a bit. When I was around 5 or 6 my parents split and I ended up going to my gparents while my siblingss stayed with mom. Mom moved around a lot with a lot of different guys. She remarried one who already had kids so we had 2 new brothers and then they had one together. My mom was always a partier but I never knew how bad it was. Mom is also a master manipulator and compulsive liar. Like literally about anything.


Grandpa was a hardworking unemotional construction worker from the south. Grandmas the only one who ever loved and cared for us but she got sick and had bad back and leg problems and ended up n in a wheel chair addicted to her pain meds and vodka from living in constant pain.  In 26 years I never heard my GPA say ""I love you""  , ""I'm proud of you"" , or anything along those lines.


After a few years mom got divorced again and ended up with the next guy eventually and he became a father figure to me. 

My dad saw us on like holidays and that was it. He just gave up amd started a new family. Well when I was in high-school and wanted to party and hang out my mom and bf would sell us weed and around 16 I met the woman im still with. But i started hanging put with my mom a lot because she had been absent most of my life.


But mom was a drug addict. Slowly but surely you ended up giving me my first everything and I ended up addictted to opiates and meth and crack and anything else.


By 18 I had my first kid and his mom never did anything but drink and smoke (not while pregnant she's an amazing mom) well we got out own place amd things were good for a while but I hid my addiction from her. At some point  it got way out of hand and I was spending everything I had on dope and she broke things off with me. 


I promised I would get off it for her and I did for a while but relapsed more times than I care to count. After a few years of me fucking up we split for good. My son was around 3 then. I spent the next few years head deep in drugs and alcohol of any kind and almost died many many times, and OD'd a couple. 

By Jan 2017 I was arrested for felony drug possession and went to jail for a while. Withdrawal was terrible and my son was around 5 or so at this time so I called him from jail and honestly mostly spoke to his mom cause he was nervous. I got out and was sober and in a drug court program.

 I was released from jail in March and by October 31st she had broke up with her fiamce and we started talking. I was sober and back to the man she loved. Well i fucked up after about 2 years and spent 9 months or so in the worst of the worst places, mentally, emotionally, and physically and that was after we had just had our daughter. I don't know what's wrong with me.


 I went to inpatient rehab and she let me come back one last time. I've been dealing with adjusting to a sober life which I have literally never done, dealing with severe ADHD, anxiety, depression. And an unfathomable self-loathing with negative confidence in my self.. and i relapsed again. I dont think I can stop i almost died 4x in 24 hours last week and I just couldn't stop and try to go home. I don't know whats wrong with me but I'm going to lose everything and kill myself. I've been suicidal for about a year and often think about intentionally going to OD. Nobody can help me and I am going to die and lose my children but maybe then they can move on. I'm not calling some stupid helpline either.  We are drowning in debt and don't have next month's rent so maybe if I just do it now they can't get an extension and have my gparents help with bills.


I've tried and fought for so long. I just don't jave it in me anymore"
1362,😞sometimes I wish I could just selfishly cry into someone’s arm &amp; not talk about anything.,"Never wanted to cry into someone’s arms before 😞I must have gotten even weaker. 

Dealing with more than I can handle as always. Just keeps getting worse and worse &amp; more problems keep tackling on. Don’t want to talk. Idk why I post. I don’t want to selfishly vent to someone emotionally involved in my life. Im fighting for other people literally. My mom just came back from the hospital cause she has a bad case of COVID and it’s been really exhausting. I’m so drained from people venting to me ontop of this and other stuff etc... my baby niece just called me that her dad lost his temper and is yelling at her today :( and then a “friend” who really takes advantage of me called to vent to me cause her friend died etc... I feel so awful for her and I am trying to help everyone.

I’ve been just not ok this entire year and been getting worse and this week has been incredibly difficult. I’m sure people have it worse. I guess just venting and don’t expect anyone to message back. I have so many problems myself. So so many more popped up &amp; my problems just keep piling up and I’ve been trying to ignore them and I can’t 😞so sick to my stomach. Just so sick myself physically and mentally and being stuck in quarantine with my messed up family and drama has really killed me even more.

Just venting 😭 no worries about responding to my nonsense &amp; other people definitely have it worse. I’m sure I’ll be fine by the morning 😔just crying it out again tonight. At least I can cry again."
1363,media &amp; intrusive thoughts,"so i've been having intrusive thoughts for a while now and i'm pretty much used to them and they don't affect my life much anymore BUT recently i've noticed after watching a bloody/gorey movie, tv show or playing a game my intrusive thoughts seem to get slightly worse for a few days after.  does anyone else experience this? pls let me know!"
1364,What is wrong with me?,"I went to a work meeting this morning. There are only four of us working for a small company. Boss and 3 employees, all ladies. I’ve worked here a couple years, but COVID has thrust me into a new position and working more closely with these people. 

I was so excited for the meeting today, we don’t have the time to socialize much during work and I genuinely like these woman and want to be their friend, not just coworkers. I got up early and made scones for everyone from scratch, I put on makeup for the first time in months, but the meeting was terrible. The suggestions and concerns I raised were dismissed or outright rejected. Every. Single. One. No discussion. At one point my boss specifically praised the suggestions of the other two employees and left me out entirely. It was not the first time I have felt like I’m out of the inner circle (the other two employees have worked their much longer than I have), but it was the first time I felt that I literally didn’t matter. And I genuinely believe they don’t even know what they did. I understand if my suggestions weren’t good, that’s fine. But the outright dismissal of my concerns really hurt, and the whole ordeal made me feel small and stupid. 

This has been a theme in my life. People like me and say wonderful things about me, but they don’t try to be my friend or seem to have interest in spending time with me. Some of it stems perhaps from my own social anxiety, but when efforts get rejected so completely, it’s hard to not wonder what is wrong with me. 

I came home feeling so low and defeated. I called my insurance and found out what therapists are covered under my plan. There were 100+ in my area, which was overwhelming. I spent hours researching the names and found one that seemed like they could be a good fit. I left a message, but they haven’t called me back. 

This is mostly a rant, but kind advice is welcome, too. If you read all of this and can relate or understand even a little bit, thank you."
1365,I just want to vent.,"Preface Im 13m. Lets get to the point.

My parents can be awful. Really. Everything is never their fault its always mine. The computer breaks? Oh well Im a fluent programmer therefore its my fault. My schoolwork dosent get done? My fault for being so fucking dumb. Im overweight? Because Im a fat ass. None of this has anything to do with the constant torture that is them and their ‘Helping and criticism’ which consists of slapping and kicking me until I collapse and just satisfy there feelings. Rather than help me they want to complain. And besides this they do nothing to help me see my friends. A lot of my friends have moved on from Minecraft and on to games like valorant. Our family PC cant run valorant. Because of this I havent played with some of my friends for months. There has been no attempt by my parents to help me go and see these people in person. I have four good friends I can rely on. The rest vanished over the past few months. I just want to die. It wouldn’t be the first time either. Ive brought a knife to my wrist twice now but apparently thats made up as an excuse to get out of school now. Thanks for reading this mess I guess."
1366,"Hello everyone, if anyone sees this (I know it's late here in the north eastern U.S.) and needs to talk about anything feel free to DM me.

Good vibes y'all.","I posted something on here a few days ago about me finding the strength I learned from depression and a suicide attempt a few years ago to get through my current breakup.

1368,I'm Too Anxious to Function and I Can't do This Anymore.,"I feel like tonight, after what seems like years of buildup, I've reached a breaking point with my anxiety and I dont know how much longer I can keep up.

I've always been an overthinker, and I've always been mildly stressed or anxious at admittedly small things, but tonight, I feel like I've hit a new low.  

In short, im afraid of failure. Im so afraid to fail myself and those I care about that I'm starting to lose sleep, and I'm starting to lose my composure. A big part of this comes from my time in college.

My grades in college are starting to suffer. Instead of taking the L and improving from it, I cant help but overthink my failures and let them consume me, becoming so stressed about my performance that I don't even improve, I just continue to make mistakes in my work and continue to stress about my failures and watch as my grade lowers. 

Part of it, I believe, is the online environment. I cant properly learn this way, no matter how I try. I always come up short in my performance and the stress from that is killing me. 

I'm so fucking afraid of failure that I can't focus on success. I feel like such an utter failure when my grades aren't A's and B's, and I get so anxious because of that, I just sort of...shut down. 

This type of anxiety hasn't happened to me before. I've always been able to bounce back and learn from my failures, but now, I just can't. I cant focus, I cant motivate myself, I cant even make myself happy anymore. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. I dont know if ill be able to pass this semester, or if I'll get fired from my job for lack of performance, or if I'll just shut down and lose my will to continue. I just know that, for some reason, I wanted to vent. And I'm sorry if this seems trivial to some people, i know there's pain much greater than this i have never experienced, but i really don't know what else to do. 

Thank you for listening."

1370,My mental health has been getting worse for almost the whole year. I still have no idea what to do.,"Around the end of the February I woke up one day and just felt completely off. I felt as if my thoughts and I had a block in the middle. Remembering was hard, concentrating was hard, literally every mental thing in my life felt harder. Google told me that it was just hormones but after a week I felt exactly the same so I started to worry but not act on it, I just ignored the feeling for months. Than in July I asked my dad to take me to the doctor and I told my family everything. The doctor simply told me that it was quarantine even thought it started a few weeks before quarantine. He also told me I should eat healthier sleep more and exercise for about a month and I would feel better. After following his schedule for a month nothing changed. I’m back to ignoring it and now it’s October. I have no clue what happened to me that night in February while I was sleeping but it’s gotten so annoying, because of it I have a harder time in school and literally anything that involves me using my brain which is everything. I don’t know what to do anymore, please someone just help me."

1372,My DP/DR and anxiety is making me feel like this is now a life or death situation.,"I get no relief. For 2 months 24/7 I feel stressed, exhausted, emotionally miserable, and mentally in hell.

I’m convinced this is permanent. I’m so tired, I’ve accepted that I’m most likely going to give up soon. I really don’t want to die, I want to live as long as I can, but NOT like this. This isn’t living. I lost my appetite, forgetting what it’s like to smile, no libido, I just feel pain. I can’t even work. I feel disabled. 

I try accepting the way I feel and hopefully feel better soon, but I’ve done everything! I do everything I can everyday to be positive but it’s doing nothing. 

AKA everyday is just another day to work up ending it all. Everyday is torture and I want to end the pain. Not trying to sound emo."
1373,Anyone? Please state your diagnosis as well,
1374,i’m getting cut out of my friends life,i recently confronted my friend for the way they’ve been mistreating me. i told them i was tired of them making insensitive comments on my eating habits and forcing me to do stuff i physically cant do. they are fully aware i have both an eating disorder and a limiting spinal injury. i have even had to wait in their room while they get high for half an hour before. so just recently i snapped and told them i can’t handle getting treated like this anymore.  i thought it went okay bc they apologized but since then they simply stopped talking to me entirely. what should i do? this is one of my only three friends and i don’t want to lose them even if they treated me like shit.
1375,Personality Copying?,"Spoiler for this is us season 4!


Not sure where to ask this. I’ve asked a couple people and they have no idea why this is a thing
So I’m a black male. Grew up in a traumatic family, with a single parent, with history of mental health problems and I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, ADHD, and MDD. I also grew up Mormon in a very heavily white population.

After the Episode where Randell and his anxiety start to get explored I started to relate way to much. I started to have nightmares a few weeks after I finished the season 4 on Netflix about things I’m just anxious about (Not related to the actual show). And I’ve been getting really bad Panic Attacks about the show. Do you guys copy personalities? I know it’s extremely alike of a story for those who have watched it but that how I feel. And I can’t shake the feeling that I just copied his struggle/personality"
1376,What happened?,"(On mobile sorry for bad formatting)

     I don't know what happened to me(M14).
     One day I guess I just lost the ability to cry and it makes me feel guilty that I barely seemed to show any emotion when multiple relatives and pets died (4 in total for 2020 plus no funerals). It sucks when you can feel it well up in you and can feel prickles behind your eyes but nothing comes out.
    I distract myself with music always playing through my earbud that still works, games and finding new hobbies I seem to ditch in a week. Now can't distract myself as much because I broke my left hand. 
    I hate receiving any kind of praise or compliment because I feel I don't deserve it. Even if I have a good accomplishment I feel as if I didn't do good enough or that the accomplishment was somehow caused by someone's pity for me. If people compliment me I get very uncomfortable, or will deflect the compliment. If I get a high grade in school I'll feel like I didn't do good enough and could've done better.
    I'm always looking for reassurance and I don't trust myself because I'm anxious I'll do it wrong and look like an idiot. That or I won't say anything. Like if I don't understand something in a subject at school I won't raise my hand to get help. I'll have to ask a couple times if something is safe or I just won't do it because I feel like I'll endanger myself on something that couldn't possibly endanger me.
    I feel like my dad is disappointed in me when I can't do something by myself and I can see him looking frustrated when I don't understand something he says.
    I feel like my mom thinks way too highly of me and thinks that nothing bad could really come out of me and I feel like I'm disappointing her when I fail at things.
    I never told my mom about when I first had a panic attack at a Scout Jamboree in 2019 until months later. My dad still doesn't know (to my knowledge). 
   I get really uncomfortable during health class or an assembly about mental health and anxiety and depression. I feel like all eyes are on me and I hate it. I feel my lungs seize to function and feel the cold sweats go through my body.
   I barely go to the school counsellor and I usually don't get much out of it because I'll be completely silent and waste their time. 
   I don't know if there is any mental illness that I have and don't want to assume. I just don't know why I changed since I was like 10 from being happy and no problems to being like this. Anyway, that is the end of my vent."
1377,I don’t know how to describe the emptiness I feel,"It’s not even an empty pain, it’s just there. Like I’m a wall just existing. I just want to do nothing and lie down. But at the same time I just want to scream and just go run, run anywhere. I don’t know what to do about it. The only time I don’t feel like this is when I smoke weed, and I ran out recently and I’ve just been pulled back into my empty reality. I don’t know what to do"
1378,Is it normal to feel alright one day and absolutely pathetic the next day?,"After going through an emotional rollercoaster while I was in a relationship with a person who drained me of my mental peace, sometimes I feel I'll be able to get through this. While other times I don't think I will be able to last the night. It's been 2 months I've gone"" no contact"". Yes, things do seem better but sometimes I feel I've reached rock bottom."
1379,Dissociation disorder?,"
Most of my daily actions are not mine. It feels like I am not in control and I am simply in the driver seat watching my body do things while I am stuck to experience and think. This is pretty much constant. I have blackout periods as well. These blackouts occur usually when I am thinking intensely/ walking my dog. These blackouts are complete sensory blockage. I definitely “see” as whatever is controlling my body and movements doesn’t fall flat on my face and knows where to go. But for whatever reason I do not see, hear (even with headphones on max volume), taste, feel, etc. Entering this state feels like being pulled backward into darkness like a blackhole. When I am “in” it’s hard to remember/conceptualize what it's like. Coming out feels like rising fast to the surface of water and gasping for breath (but not like a desperate/painful way?). It’s usually coupled with feelings of confusion and disorientation and it takes a second to regain my visual focus. Usually these episodes are very short and last between a couple seconds to a couple minutes. There doesn’t seem to be a “cooldown” on it and I usually chain them together, making me have shorter rapid episodes instead of long drawn out ones.. What usually brings me out of it is things that are out of the ordinary like cars or people passing. My memory of daily events is usually pretty foggy and I am pretty forgetful. I almost always have no memory of what happens during my blackout periods.

I feel like my general detached state has me split into two parts. One part is the physical aspect of my witch I am quite detached from (appearance, doing stuff, etc.). The other part is more me, like my mind and thoughts and feelings. I feel like they are two different entities. My detached physical aspect is better at sports and music than “I” am. My physical aspect can even mouth lyrics to songs I don’t know the lyrics to. On the other hand, the part I feel closer to is better at doing school work and thinking. 

I pretty much constantly have music in my head, but it is not necessarily music of my choice though. It can be literally anything, even music I don’t know the lyrics to (but still somehow have in my head). Something that can usually stop this is listening to music or other audio like YouTube. I usually listen to music and such at max volume as it is better at blocking it out. Although sometimes I don’t like having both ears in cause **anxiety**, even though it sometimes doesn’t completely block everything out. Sometimes it's more so in the background and others it's so clear I can actually vibe to it. 

So like, what is this? I know about dissociation but is there something I can call this or explain what it is? 

I do have some childhood trauma. I am almost legal adult age and am male. I am probably gonna delete this bc I'm big cringe but I appreciate any comments you guys leave. Feel free to ask questions. I'm going to bed rn but I'll answer any questions when I get up. Thanks."
1380,Does somebody have a word/explanation for this?,"Ever since I was a kid I’ve had trouble sleeping. Recently I’ve been getting better at controlling it but I still experience what I’ve experienced back then too. 
I always feel like someone is looking at the back of my head when I’m trying to sleep. I always feel like if I remove the blanket from my head there’s going to be someone standing there, or see someone’s reflection in my mirror. I can’t sleep without a nightlight on and say a prayer so many times a night I’ve stopped counting. (Could this maybe be a compulsion or something? I also knock 3 times in the air and when I don’t I get extremely anxious and have thoughts that something is behind me, either in words or in flashing images in my head). This has caused me years of insomnia since I’m literally so scared I can’t sleep, and I’d either eventually get so tired I would just not be able to stay awake anymore or I’d hold myself awake the entire night and go to sleep in the morning. However, this doesn’t only happen to me when I go to sleep, this is my first example of this. 
I get this feeling pretty much everywhere I go. I can barely function when I’m alone at home cause I’m scared to go to the bathroom because I always think something is gonna appear behind the curtain or in the hallway when I go out of the room. In the kitchen I always feel like something is going to show up behind me. If I need to pass the hallway to go to my room I’d get a mini anxiety attack while doing it and my heart would be racing for several minutes. 
This doesn’t only happen to me in my own house. It happens almost everywhere I go. 
I’m an extremely anxious person, could this be my anxiety (although this is something that caused me to develop anxiety over the years along other things) or could it be something else? 
I’ve mentioned it to several psychiatrists/psychologists and they all just asked me if I see or hear something. I don’t, I just have this intense feeling something is always watching me or going to appear behind me. 
Thank you for your help and have a nice day &lt;3"
1381,I Don't Know If I Can Do This Anymore,"This is kind of late at night, so I'm probably going to feel better in the morning after I sleep. I made a Reddit post a few hours ago in the r/advice subreddit detailing how I'm really unsatisfied with the relationship I have with one of my friends. Someone replied with a very long response to that post and I felt ""attacked"" by some of it because some of it was just very blunt. I don't want to reply defending myself a little bit because I feel they'll just tell me to ""move on"" or insist that I'm wrong. I was planning on talking to my friend about how I feel one last time to see if she'll change or if she'll understand (since she doesn't necessarily realize what she's doing), but now I just feel like I'm completely in the wrong and that I don't deserve someone like her even though she also did stuff wrong. I feel like the people who will read this will just roll their eyes since this isn't even that serious, I'm just afraid of getting hurt and people's opinion of me worsening on the internet. I do think the person who replied took thought that I had unreasonable expectations (all I want from her is to maybe text me every once in a while and to try to respond to something I say after 24 hours). I used to feel really angry at the situation but now I feel really sad and that I'm just being stupid bringing crap up again. I'm really weird. I'm only a teenager so that might be it but my mom and brother are telling me that she isn't my friend. I'm probably going to regret posting this and delete it later. Idk, I'm just feeling really depressed with everything in my life right now and I don't know how much longer I can do this."
1382,Need advice,"I (19) have had social anxiety my whole life. I live in constant fear of people and being judged by them. It's constantly in my thoughts to the point where I don't notice it half the time. This makes me socially inept because I'm so afraid people will judge me that I pretty much just shut down. I stutter when I have to speak to a lot of people and I'm so emotionally shut down that I can't connect with people. I've developed some pretty unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with being so lonely but they don't even really work. Every few days or weeks it hits me how alone I am and I'm just kind of disgusted with myself and filled with self loathing. I've gone multiple points in my life without a single close friend. Currently I'm going on 2+ years. I genuinely can't tell if there are people that have tried to become friends that I just couldn't tell because my assumption is always that people don't want to be around me. I've tried therapy but in all honesty I had some pretty bad experiences with therapists pushing me too hard and not being very understanding and that's made me shut down in that area even more. It's also extremely difficult to have to open up that much to someone. I know none of these feelings are rational but I can't shake them. I'm genuinely afraid I'll spend my whole life alone.

So I desperately need some advice. How do I work on this, at least to the point where I can get therapy? How can at least start to overcome this?"
1383,when does talking to yourself become too much?,"so I've always talked to myself. as far back as I can remember I've sat in my room and daydreamed out loud. when I was a kid I often used toys and whatnot to express those thoughts as they were often stories, but now as an adult I'll often just sit in my room and talk things out. I like to talk as if I'm on a talk show or podcast of some kind about things I want to discuss--my mental health, my interests, etc. I don't believe anyone else is there because I know they aren't, but sometimes I legit cannot help it. I've caught myself trying to talk to myself while, let's say, getting a drink or making lunch. 

a lot of the time I do it with my mouth closed to muffle the noise, but I've had family members (I'm 23 but I live with my family right now during the pandemic) approach me and ask why I'm talking so much in my room. It's kinda embarassing because it's often almost an unconscious thing--I just do it when I have something on my mind and need a way to express it. 

I think where it gets weird is I also have a passion for writing stories, and I will find myself speaking for characters I'm writing about. not speaking as myself, but speaking as that character talking to another character. I haven't actually concretely written anything in months but I'll still have characters in my brain and speak for them as a sort of distraction--I find the stories I construct in my head are way more interesting than my boring life at the moment. 

I'm really only asking because as of late I've struggled more with disassociation and while I'm going to bring this up to my therapist I wanted to ask when this stems into maladaptive daydreaming and other issues. I'm genuinely at a point where I'm starting to actually not enjoy reality and I'm wanting to disassociate more and more so I don't have to experience it. the thought of not having my fantasies to go to actually kind of makes me want to cry when I think about it. 

has anyone else dealt with this?"
1384,Letter to my wrongdoers,"
You've made me grow quicker than the rate of my small body could handle. So, I wanted to quit when I was not even a teen. My mind grew old in such a young frame. Why is it that I'm being hit with this so late in life where I over indulge and cut my wrists so suddenly. I think I'm too old for this but I need some outlet. It hurts to breathe because of my made up guilt. I'm on a downward spiral and reaching my end. I'm tired of lying to myself and saying it'll get better when I know it won't. From the outside looking in, it's easy to say that it'll get better because you haven't experienced it. The days grow longer and my heart grows heavier. I'm just a nobody who wants to be forgotten, just like a bad joke. When I'm gone, I know that no one will cry and I'm fine with that. All I can say is ""you've won""




Not expecting a response. Just wanted to post this somewhere."
1385,Daily reminder that you are not defined by your demons and your bad days,"Everyone has shit days. Some of us are better at hiding it than others. 

It's just important to remember that what you're feeling right now is temporary, the clouds will clear. Remember that the bad times don't reside within you and are simply passing through for a little while. Acknowledge they're there and hope it's only for a short stay and the next time you're feeling good try to cherish it."
1386,Venting,"I’ve had a lot of stress and fear lately. I feel like I won’t be validated by my friends and family, family specially. If friends don’t accept me for who I am, then I can just call the friendship quits. If your family doesn’t accept you, you can’t just end a family, you are stuck with them forever. I feel like nobody in my life will validate me and I’ve started self harming again. This is not okie dokie. I need help, but I hate talking about how I feel, because the way I see it, if me hurting hurts you, why even talk about anything at all? I know that this isn’t a good mindset, but that’s the way I see it, I’ve always hated asking people for help, “I can do this on my own” I always think, “If I ask for help, I will be nothing but a burden on them, me and me alone.” That’s just the way I’ve always seen things, and I’ve tried therapy, and I despise it. I know it’s supposed to make you ‘feel better’ and ‘it’s the best for you’ but I don’t care. I hate talking about how I feel, and that’s it. Most days, I feel like I’d be better off dead, no one being bothered by my stupid shit, a waste of space on this planet. I’m fat and I know it. My mother tries to convince me that I’m not, but I know she’s just trying to make me feel better. I’ve decided that I’d I eat a lot less, then it will help and will be the main helper in the weight loss process."
1387,Yesterday I prevented a suicide on a discord server and got banned for it,"So I was in this discord server where people openly ask for help and someone helps them kinda like this subreddit. There was this girl age 15 who was about to slit her wrists open but I managed to calm her down. the main reason for this was her getting bullied at school. so I told her if she wants to not get bullied she has to fight for herself. Her bullies where older girls who would grope her. She said she can't fight so instead she came up with the idea to aggressively make out with the girls that bully her if they decide to touch her again and then report them for rape (she is into other girls). I said to her ""whatever fixes your problem goes"". Then she left the server and a minute after I got banned, the reason wasn't even clear.

I'm sharing this so those who like to help with this stuff know what to expect.

Also I would like to know if I'm in the wrong here or did I do everything right?"
1388,Why won't anyone help me?,.
1389,Eating Issues,"\*Note: sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, IDK where it should go\*

Hello,

I'm nearing the end of high school and have always wanted to join the Air Force. I'm definitely mentally capable of it but where I'm lacking is in the physical aspect. As in, I'm pretty overweight (about 210 lbs at 6'0""). I've been slowly losing weight since COVID (I went down from about 245-250 since the beginning of April) but I still have a lot to go.

I've been trying to keep my food intake as low as possible (my target is 500 calories per day but I'm nowhere near that). The problem is that when I eat very little, I'm very tired and in a bad mood all the time and I always have the urge to eat. It's gotten to the point where for the past few days I've had an immense craving for food of any kind and it's a daily struggle to fight it.

I feel almost sick (which is ironic since there is very little to throw up) and lethargic and combined with the stress of school, it's taking its toll. Does anyone have any advice for me? Any ways to reduce my appetite? I feel like my life would be a lot better if I didn't get so hungry. I sometimes cave in and eat when my hunger is too much but then I feel like shit afterwards knowing that it will hinder my weight loss. My goal is to get down to 180 but that's proving to be very difficult."
1390,HELP PLEASE,I found this one redditer saying they were going to end it all and jump so i messaged them and got them on the line with 911 via reporting them i just found there newest account turns out they ignored the calls but didn't jump i'm already dealling with my own shit but am to scared to ignore them and focus on my self what do i do i'm waiting on an answer from them right now what should i do!?!
1391,What do I even do?,"I was recently hospitalized for an attempt and then  held for 72 hours in a youth ward ( Sept 16), the time in the ward was detrimental to me, while yea it took my mind off everything once I got out it seemed everything was worse, there was no support in that ward, they locked you inside and held you there only watching TV and having the therapists get angry when you get emotional about your past and threatening to hold you longer. Currently I have intensive therapy once a week but I have frequent episodes(what I’m suspecting to be manic and depressive following one another) I’m only 16 so my parents have to approve meds but they don’t want to, it seems as every passing day goes on everything seems to crumble around me. It feels like I’m suffocating in a meat prison of my own flesh. I have nobody to talk to, If I tell anyone what’s really going on I will be sent back to that ward as it’s the only one that holds kids my age. I’m at a standstill, what is next? Does it go on until I succeed? I’ve done everything under the sun during an episode, nothing stops it’s wrath... it feels like you’re spiraling out of control, like you aren’t even you. I just wish everything would stop, that I could be a normal teenager..."
1392,I feel alone(16f),"I’m not sad per say, I’ve just always had this feeling of detachment from everything, like I can’t grasp my mind around things, or I have the wrong way of thinking, I feel like I’m missing something important that is required to socialize properly, I find it frustrating seeing everyone else talk so effortlessly 
,even when I try I guess I’m to quiet or awkward because I always find myself in the end quietly listening in the background. I do have a few friends, but I struggle to maintain friendships over texting and social media, I get bored of it and pull away, I find it easier to talk to people on discord.
  I never have motivation to do my school work, I’m not dumb, I could do well in my classes if I choose; laziness perhaps. but I just can’t bring myself to finish assignments. 
        I don’t really know what the present is, I see a beautiful sunset i don’t feel moved, I feel numb.
      I can’t relate with my friends when they talk about relationships because I don’t understand how they feel, I don’t really feel attraction towards men I guess.

I don’t know why I can’t just feel real. I tired of looking out the same window every night, I just want to leave(my family situation is good btw)."
1393,Is it possible that taking a small dose of trazadone caused symptoms of depression?,"I don’t know if this belongs here, so lmk if not. 

But I have a lot of stress in my life currently and having been feeling extremely bad. Not sad, not suicidal, just bad.

I feel like I can’t get anything done, overwhelmed, tired, little motivation, like I’m doing things wrong sometimes, feel like crying at things that don’t usually make me cry, among other things. 

I recently started to take trazadone as needed to sleep (to counter-act other meds that make it hard to sleep) but I don’t know if it has anything to do with it or if it’s the place I am in my life right now."
1394,I can't take care of myself,.
1395,My friends are acting completely different,Recently me and my gf broke up and my friends are saying it’s my fault and I changed because of a different group of friends I was hanging out with that they don’t like. They get angry at me all the time and one of them is trying to drop me out of the friend group I feel like there trying to make me choose between them and my other friends.They never acted this way in the past and I’m scared of loosing them but I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I’ve known them for so long that I don’t want to loose them but they bring me so much pain. What do I do?
1396,my partner dumped me after my suicide attempt (24/enby),"This is somewhat of a long one but I just need to rant. I met my partner about a year and half ago through a mutual friend and we hadn’t officially started dating until late June this year. I’m a non-monogamist and I made that very clear to them before anything progressed. Even still, they constantly wanted to spend time with me and would get upset when I would mention that I was still speaking to other people. I did it out of respect because we were progressing fast and I just wanted to make sure they were aware of what I was doing.

I would trek 40 minutes to go spend time with them and their family because they felt comfortable enough with me. I appreciated them opening up to me and so in turn I opened back up to them. I told them I take medication and that I am currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and they said they understood mental health is very difficult to navigate through. Well to be honest they never really were a good partner because my love language is touch and quality time (two things they definitely do not like). 

They invited me to their birthday party where I was going to meet their friends for the first time. I was really anxious so I had a few drinks (I hadn’t been drinking since I started my meds back in February). I got drunker as the night progressed and started to develop sadness I hadn’t felt in a very long time. I started to cry in the bathroom and they came in and started getting upset with me because I was drunk and being a nuisance. A friend of ours tried to help me get it together but it only made it worse and I got even more sad because my partner refused to talk to me at their party. 

So I decided to do some more reckless things to get their attention and tried c*ke for the first time and got extremely erratic and irrational. I could feel them getting even more upset with me to where my friend came up to me and basically told me I was being selfish because I wanted my partners attention. I got upset and decided to drive myself home and make my attempt. I called them several times before I got to my house and I never got an answer. So I proceeded and in my drunken drugged state I sent videos of me slurring. (No I don’t agree with what I did and I do feel guilty to subjecting my partner to my behavior but I was so hurt and all I wanted was then to comfort me). The morning after they called me numerous times but I never answered because I was having withdrawals from all of the medicine I took and had to drive myself to the ER. 

They sent me a long text about how they needed to be away from me and that I needed to get help. They also said I was wrong for sending those videos to them and my other friends and I should apologize to them. I only replied “okay” because I honestly almost died had I not taken myself to the hospital. I spend a whole month in the hospital/psych ward and during that whole time my partner blocked me on everything and hasn’t talked to since. I honestly do feel extremely guilty for putting all of them in such a traumatic situation but literally no one was trying to care for me or calm me down. Everyone just kept gaslighting me and telling me I was crazy or selfish or that my attempt better work because of all of the trouble I went to.

After I was released I texted all of my friends that were there at the party that I was removing myself from their friend group and that I would never speak to any of them again. Most responded positively but none of them apologized for treating me the way they did. One friend went as far as making my attempt about themselves and told me that I blame her for what I did. I responded with “I only blame myself” and called it a day. After that whole scenario I’m too scared to even think about dating anyone because of the trauma I put my last partner through. I really do want a companion/someone to love but I’m honestly so scared of hurting myself again.

I know I’m responsible for myself and my own actions but is it wrong for me to dislike my partner for refusing to be there for me??"
1397,Is self harm to pick out nails?,"Warning: gross

I hate the feeling of my toenails and really want to just take them off. Anytime I touch them I want to throw up not because I’m grossed out I just get nauseous for no reason. I tape them down tightly to limit the weird sensation I get anytime they touch anything. I feel like something is wrong with them and kind of wish I didn’t have toes.

Don’t worry I’m not going to cut of my toes. I’m not quite there yet. My question is if I could just cut the nails out would that be self harm.

Taking them out wouldn’t be for pain or anything I just want them gone. I really don’t care if they don’t grow back I’ll wear socks for the rest of my life I just hate the sensation I have in my toes all the time."
1398,Explaining Severe Mental Illness to a kid,"I have 2 daughters, one 17 (C) and the other 8 (D). For that big of an age gap, I’m surprised at how close they are. C is incredible at including her sister in her *teen activities*, and D loves spending time with her. They’re amazing, I couldn’t have asked for better kids.

C suffers from bipolar disorder, and recently she stopped taking her meds, became manic, and had a psychotic episode. D was gone to my aunt’s house (she lives down the street) for the day, so she didn’t see anything happen. Since it was C’s first psychotic episode, she was sent to the hospital. It’s been about a day or so, and D knows she’s at the hospital, is vaguely aware of why, but doesn’t fully understand. C is likely going to be admitted for a while, so I definitely need to explain to D why C is gone. 

The problem is- I don’t know where to start. How do I explain psychosis to an 8 year old? How do I explain bipolar disorder? In the event that another episode happens (and D is present), I want her to have a sense of what’s happening.

Any help?"
1399,Y’all... ice cream.,"So today has been shitty. I woke up at 8 and was like fuck yeah let’s start the day. I just laid around just enjoying my bed and my man being next to me. At 9:30 I woke him up and he was like nah I’m sleepy. Ok cool. But also I didn’t want to go out by myself- I always shop by myself and I’m tired of it plus I wanted to buy birthday decorations and who wants to buy their own decor... ha. Anyway, I got bored while waiting for him to wake up so I fell asleep until, like, 1. Anyway I woke up pissed off. No reason whatsoever. Just a pissy ass bitch - that’s me. All day long until I got chipotle. But around 7 I was like what the shit- I have to do my homework due at 12 tonight. So I hop on that. It’s an exam prep worth grades. I took it 1 time not rlly trying and got a 6%. This time I spent 2 hours trying to teach myself stuff and writing everything down so I can learn and guess what- I got 12%. You read it- TWELVE. I had to rlly keep my cool. I spent so much time trying. At least it brought my grade up to a 61%... anyway, there was a study guide that I thought was worth points so I spent another hour and a half working on it. It wasn’t worth points. So here I am- down in the dumps. Wanting to eat an edible but it’s 12 and I have to be up at 9 and it’ll keep me awake until 3. I’m like damn how can I reward myself? Sonic is closed... can’t get their ice cream. But WAIT! I went shopping y’all!!! for my bday party! I bought Not ONE but TWO kinds of ice cream. I shit my pants when I remembered that. A good end to a bad-ish day. 

Also yes I know-66% is not a good grade. I’ve been struggling with my mental. I’m usually a solid B student... anyhoooooo just thought I’d post this and share my amazing time.."
1400,For the first time in my life I am taking my mental health into my own hands,"I’m using this throwaway because I have people who know of my main account that could cause issues if they know about this. 


For my whole life my health was never my own decision. I had some traumatic events happen that left severe emotional and mental scars, but I had to keep them secret because of the intense judgement I would receive from my parents and family. I don’t mean to be political, but due to the pandemic I lost my apartment at my university and had to move into my very conservative parents home, and I am very much not conservative. Just being in their environment are away every day, and that’s exactly how it was growing up. Well. I’m older now, and I decided to take matters into my own hands. This pandemic has no been easy on any of us, and being a university student has had its major tolls. I finally stood up for myself and went to my doctor without telling anyone, and opened up about everything I’ve been dealing with for the last 20+ years. My doctor was so amazing, and I felt so comforted and like I finally could get the help I have been needing for so long. 

I started my first dose of anti anxiety/depression medication, and I know it’ll be a journey to find what works best for me, but I’m excited to have my old self back again. I’m looking forward to doing things I love, and haven’t done in years. And I’m so eager to get the energy I need to actually function like a normal adult should, or at least have the energy to get up and get going. I know if my family finds out that I’m taking this medication there will be major hell to pay, but I don’t care. They are a big reason why I need it, and mental health is just as important as physical health."

I have really lost a lot of interest in academics and lost
confidence to such an extent that I cannot do literally
anything without self doubt.. How do I get back my

1402,Psychosomatic pain any advice on managing it??,My muscles ache so bad especially in my back is there anyone who has dealt with this and have further knowledge on it on how to combat it? I just had chest X-rays done it’s turned me into a complete hypochondriac
1403,Schizophrenia (genetic or drug side effect? ),"My boyfriend is currently hearing voices and believes in conspiracy theories Involving the government and cia. 

Im having trouble figuring out the root of the problem with my boyfriend I’m not sure if he has schizophrenia and if it’s due to genetics or because of his drug abuse. 

Background:
Ive been with my boyfriend for 3years. About a year ago he went through a bad breakdown he did crystal meth for 3months. 
It was so bad he went into psychosis and was acting so erratic, he believed I was cheated and that the guy was after him, that he was being chased and followed, he thought the police was after him and wanted to hurt him, he mentioned seeing flashing lights in the dark and that their were cameras everywhere, it was so awful awful to the point where he ended up at a detention center bc he called the cops on himself because he thought he was going to cause harm so it helped him for a couple of days to recover and once he got out he truly got an awakening and stopped and confessed what he had done. 

So now that it’s been about a year he has stayed clean but still believes government theories and that the cia is spying on everyone and ultra mk stuff etc. He also mentions hearing voices that started ever since he did that. He says some are good and bad but that it’s the government who is messing with him. 
His bad behavior stopped completely it’s just the voices and theories he mentions sometimes that throw me off. 


Also I would like the mention. Before the meth he was abusing alcohol and weed. I learned with time growing up his dad and brother were pretty hard on him especially his dad. He would punish them to harsh and my bf had it the worse or the short end of the stick. I thought at first he might have been exaggerating like if he was just rebellious and that’s why his dad was rough but he mentioned how growing up his dad would hit him hard and he wouldn’t understand at times why and that during kinder he remembers his dad hit him so hard with the belt that the teacher saw and they called the police and filed a report. Also his brother would act bad and blame him so he wouldn’t get in trouble so his dad would punch my bf when it wasn’t his fault. So just things like this that I’ve realized maybe he was telling the truth about how hard it was growing up. His dad seems to me like he even has some type of ocd. He was like a perfectionist. They had to eat a certain way, sit a certain way, I think the manners were taken way to far that he was more like a Sargent to them growing up and tough love type of thing. I did hear from his aunts the same that his dad was tough. So I believe my bf suffers from trauma that led to drug abuse to help cope. But I’m so exhausted emotionally and mentally. 

Idk how to get him off the conspiracy’s and to seek professional help! 

I wanna know if he’s had mental health issues before the drugs or if the drug caused this. He says no but I don’t know. 

I read of schizophrenia and it said meth gives you psychosis but it tends to go away with time and that if you suffer from schizophrenia and do drugs then it triggers your episode not so much that meth creates the schizophrenia (if that makes sense). So now it left me wondering is this a genetic thing ? I can totally see if from the dad maybe do to his behavior and how tough he is but idk."

1405,I got some questions,"Hello all of you.
About the past 2/3 weeks i don't  feel good. I feel this dread inside and i don't know how to lose it.
I have been more emotional, down, isolating and overthinking everything.
 I had a week off work so i can relax and come to senses. Today i start again and i really dont want to.. i don't want to see people and leave my house.

 I have had depression before and im kind of worried that i am going the wrong way again but i doubt myself cause sometimes i feel fine , i know i need to be in contact and i need to exsercise.
But deep in side i just want nothing.. really just waiting life out. Do you know that feeling and can a person function with that??

Sorry if its hard to read, english isn't my first language. Thanks in advance"
1406,Nocturnal Panic Attacks,"Everytime I try to sleep when I'm home, I wake up with feelings of dread and fear. It's only when I'm in my home though, as I just came back from a field exercise (Military) and I was able to sleep just fine. 

Idk what's causing it and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel fine and happy throughout the day and I enjoy my life. But something about laying down for bed scares the fuck out of me. I become hyper vigilant. I thought I was having an irrational fear of the dark so I started sleeping with lights on but now I catch myself looking for shadows because I'm paranoid of someone else being inside my house besides me and my wife. 

It only gets better when I'm drunk and I feel like I'm slowly becoming an alcoholic just so I can sleep.  This started shortly after coming back from deployment. I didn't see any combat and besides being on guard all the time because of the chance of IDF I was pretty okay. I feel like I'm about to cry because I'm so tired of this bullshit. Its something about the silence and I'm really scared and I dont know what the fuck to do anymore."
1407,My sister,"So we grew up in a pretty messed up place as kids and i kind of came to terms with it in my own way i found great people like alan watts and i started reading and i found outlets like friends and sports. Even though i was affected by it i can kinda handle myself and get out into the real world. Because of it my entire family is kinda socially awkward and very quiet and anti social i wont go into detail but it was just a very bad young life. 

My sister tho she couldnt go into sports or videogames she only had YouTube and stuff. So she basically spends all her time locked up. I got mad at my mom for making it seem like something is wrong with her because she got her tested and went to therapy. But when she went to therapy she lied. She told the therapist about what all of her friends and stuff do and what not and how they socialize. If you open her phone the only numbers she has is us. Her immediate family and thats it. She has a YouTube and stuff but she doesn’t actually talk or go out or have friends. 

We all dealt with this very hard to deal with part of life. I used to have people talk to me and i wouldnt speak. I would just stare. If people did something i didnt like i couldnt speak. And if someone talked to me i couldn’t respond. Idk how to explain it but i found a way out of that somehow. Through sports and what not even though i got kicked off a few times for not responding when the coaches were yelling at me. It affects me a lot to this day but now im just kind of socially awkward and not crippled when people come around me. 

Ive started playing some of the talks that helped me around her in the car and she seems interested asking me who he is and what not. Or if it was an audio book or ted talk what ever. I hear her talk on the phone and she sounds fine so its not like there is something wrong with her. And i get some people dont want a lot of friends. But my mom tells me a story of when she was younger and a girl was picking on her. And my mom saw and asked why she didnt tell her to stop. And my sister said that if she told her to stop she wouldnt have any friends. And the next day she stood up for herself ig and she hasnt had any friends since then. She was like 7 and is now 19. She hasnt done anything but come home and watch youtube and anime everyday. Which is fine because i do too i like to be alone. But she doesn’t understand how the real world works. And how to build relationships. 

I get we need to get out of the comfort zone but i dont want to force people onto her trying to force friendships. She loves videogames anime YouTube all that stuff. So i was thinking of getting her something to play videogames with me and meet new people maybe connect online and form friendships but even that can be bad. So i just dont know honestly. Shes a good person but i can see how our childhood effects her everyday and ik it does because it effects me as well. 

If its too long

Ig i just want to know how to help her with the past trauma without forcing her into an area where she is too uncomfortable and she can actually adjust and be happy."
1408,"I (18M) can't stop thinking of my ex (17F), who I broke up with a year ago","I ended my first real, intimate relationship almost exactly a year ago, but I'm still struggling to move on. 

I started dating this girl (we'll call her Abby) in December 2018. She was a sophomore and I was a senior. I had never felt so connected with anyone in my entire life. I had just met her a few months prior, but it felt like we had known each other for years. We told each other things we had never shared with anyone before. She opened up to me about a ton of trauma from her past that had been hurting her for years and years. By talking through it together, taking her to therapy, and encouraging her to try medication, I felt that I was able to help Abby overcome her depression &amp; anxiety and try to find happiness again. I was actually making a permanent, positive difference in her life, which was all I had ever wanted. 

Flash forward to October 2019; I'm about to ship off to Marine Corps Boot Camp in California. Abby had known that I wanted to become a Marine since before we even started dating, and well, we decided to break up. We had talked about this a full month before I shipped, so we had plenty of time to talk it over and enjoy our last few weeks together. I just didn't feel right having to put Abby through the stress of dating someone who was living over half a country away (we live in Iowa), and would only be able to visit her up to twice a year. It was a difficult decision, and the night before I shipped was one of the most sorrowful nights of my life. 

I made it through Boot Camp fine, and came home for block leave in January (they give you ten days with your family before you go back and train some more). Since I was finally allowed to feel emotion again, the full weight of the break-up was starting to set in. Thankfully, Abby and I went out for dinner to talk through why things ended the way they did, and that gave me a some much needed closure. It was still an extremely painful loss, but talking with her helped me immensely. 

Come February, I'm still thinking about Abby constantly. When a slow jam comes onto the radio, I remember slow dancing with her to that song. When I see someone putting on chapstick, I remember Abby's chapstick obsession (and her kisses). I just couldn't get her out of my head. So I figure, ""This is just part of the break-up. It will go away in a month or two."" 

June rolls around, and she's still in my head. My parents introduced me to the show Heartland when they came over to visit me, and I could hardly even watch it because the romantic relationship between the main character and her boyfriend reminded me of Abby too much. So I wrote her a letter. Not to try to get back together, I just wanted to talk to her. In five pages, I told her how thankful I am that we had our relationship. I told her that even though we are now following completely different paths, the time that we shared together was irreplaceable and changed both of us for the better. And how did she respond? She didn't even acknowledge that I had sent her anything. 

I have tried so hard to get Abby out of my head. The scary thing is that virtually every other aspect of my life is great. I have an extremely loving family (who flew out to visit me on multiple occasions), I'm making a living doing what I love straight out of high school (I'm in the Marine band), I have an awesome roommate, and I work with some pretty incredible people. I keep trying to distract myself and be happy, and sometimes it kind of works. I was even in a month long relationship with another Marine from July—August. But it seems nothing I do can ever rid me of the sorrow I feel from losing my relationship with Abby. 

I was the one who broke up with her. She has a boyfriend, who she's been dating for a few months now. I have no right to be feeling the way that I do. 

So why is it that, a year after our relationship ended, I still dream about her almost every night? 

I don't want to go on living like this. I want to believe that I can find this true, passionate love again. 

But it's just so hard to see past the immense and lasting pain that heartbreak leaves behind.

TLDR: I broke up with my gf a year ago to become a Marine, but I still dream about her constantly (even though we haven't talked in months)."

1411,I am in a war with myself and both of us are losing.,"I am hurting.  I feel alone.  I cannot go to my friend's because everything seems to be in doubt and lacking trust.  I see things and hear things that make me question the friendships' authenticity. There are some things as well as on there's.  

In one sentence oh we are family.  Five min later, Christmas is coming up.  Oh we don't have to do anything really this year maybe something quiet dinner and drinks?  What I hear?  I don't want to spend money on you but I will on my real friends and family. 

A laundry list of things that don't add up to me. 

She says she's worried about me and somewhat I can believe but there's this also sense of over the top things to make me feel better about myself that feel manipulating...  

Granted I have relationship trauma via neglect and control and she's not manipulative as some or could be. 

Take these two things for example.  She has a skill set in fitness that is her future career but she's barely straddling that is beneficial to me but  jokes about consistently about me paying her where as family and another friend I feel like it's a given it's free 

Or that I seemingly owe her for the friendship and the benefits thereof where I feel all my gifts are given freely and without expectations.  At least any that I could articulate or see in my side besides wanting authenticity and the truth   

Which based on my history makes it harder for me to know or trust people.  Given the types of people I attract it makes me wonder how much is ME and how much of it is THEM. 

I have fallen into the trap if using her as a therapist.  And just expressing everything without much filter only to feel like that has out me into a position of weakness and manipulation.  

As for the fitness, I have made some progress but if I had her supposed skillset I don't get why with my weaknesses after a year she feels I am sufficient to go my own whereas I consistently feel inadequatecy to know my own workouts and seemingly comes off as either frustrated that I am not doing all the things or a sense of her not really wanting to be there.  

Where as she seems more happy with other people..

Part of me has wanted to leave but another has held on using her to grow but I've been using willpower when my core feels unworthy shamed.

My doubts lead me to do something I shouldnt have done and found out things like they see me as a teenager in a man's body.  Or that there is a whole I have no where else to go and that I am a project all on their own.   

I say they because her best friend got involved and I grew more attached to her. Which was a mistake as my Gut is screaming st me she doesn't want to have anything to do with me most of the time or that I should run.  A feeling I ignored because I doubt my own reads of everything.

My snooping lead me to find out she lied to my face and I can only surmise it has happened a lot.  Her best friend basically told on her recently about how she has seen her lie on a dime and was impressed.  When I was frustrated with her lying to a different friend to get her needs met a different way 

Now all this is my views and I'm struggling because we are supposed to look for a new place and I was talked off the edge. 

Overall I feel stuck between trying to do the right thing which is unclear as I've made commitments and yet I feel like I cannot trust them obviously by snooping and what I've overhead and yet believing they want what's best for me more than I seem to want it. 

Which is true because I have this negative view it myself that I cannot seemingly get away from.

I've been willpowering through a lot and now nothing isn't working as it should and I feel lost.  Meaningless and adrift.  Oddly I am thinking of Suicide but not nearly as bad as I thought I would.  

I just want to run tho.  I feel I cannot tell what is real vs my fears and what to trust vs not to trust. I have no where else I'd be able to go and feel like a betrayer when I'd leave on the eve of a move and new lease 

All the while this gives her incentive to lie. 

Tldr I am a mess and trying to fight this war.  Yet I just want to give up. Not necessarily die just stop feeling this way or fighting  and trying to Everything because I hate where and whom I have. Become.

Fun fact she does tell me I am too hard on myself and just wishes I was happy but how do you be happy when you feel manipulated or lied to about the nature of things.."
1412,I try so hard to be better but it's never good enough.,"I've tried everything to get better and I'm so much farther than I was several years ago but no matter what I do it's never enough, because the core isn't there.  There's nothing that makes me happy.  I've been to the psych ward, I've talked to several therapists, I've taken every medication in the world; Prozac, Welbutrin, Celexa, Ativan, Effexor, Abilify, Lexapro.  I've called the hotlines.  I work a full-time job and I live on my own.  I try so hard to make things work and to constantly improve myself and when I reach out to the people who claim to be my friends about being lonely, all they ever tell me is that ""it takes time"" and ""I just need to work harder.""  I don't know how much more time I really have when I hate everything about myself.  I'm 27 years old and have never had a friend.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I struggle so hard to talk to people and I don't feel like I'm shy but I just can't and no one seems to want to help me or to put forth the same effort I put forth to get to know them.  I try to be supportive and to develop interests and work with people but it never amounts to anything, I'm still working yet another job I hate to go sit at home alone and miserable.   
 I'm sick of putting forth so much effort for so little reward.  I post on r/depression and no one responds.  What is it about me that stands out so much as someone to be ignored?  The people who claim to be my friends will tell me they're lonely too and when I talk to them about hanging out, they're never doing anything, then weeks later they're telling me about how they all went out on vacation to wherever it is over the weekend even though I had told them that I wanted to get away and somehow it's always my fault.  My own therapist tells me, ""is it their problem to make sure you're not lonely?""  As if that's not what friends do for each other, as if whenever they call to talk about their problems, I'm not the first to listen but suddenly when things are bad for me, they don't have anything to say.  I've been alone my entire life; no friends, an abusive mom and dad, countless jobs in different fields, none of which make me feel anything and I hate this idea that I'm just supposed to ""keep improving"", ""work harder"" and commit my entire life to just trying to be this ideal person that everyone expects me to be even though the people I'm around are just as messed up as I am. but the reason I'm alone is because I'm just not good enough and I don't know if I ever will be, like I'm expected to just continuously put forth effort that no one else wants to match to be even worth talking to at the end of the day.  I'm sick of believing in something that now I know will never come to me."
1413,I can't do this anymore,"About a week ago my partner suggested we go on a break for both of us to get our health back on track. He's bipolar and I've got depression and anxiety. Since then everything keeps going wrong. Then last night he suggests that we see other people, more importantly that he wants to see other people. Now full disclosure, this break has been a long time coming due to my dwindling mental health and my utter terror around trying to get it sorted. There's so much going on in my head that all I wanna do is sleep, but I can't even get that right at the moment. I spent most of last night lying next to him, wondering if its for the last time. I can't bring myself to do anything out of guilt because my family don't have a clue just how unhappy I am. I can't do that to them, but I can't carry on like this. I don't think I'm gonna last however long it is for me to get better."

1415,Ha (I guess kinda a vent?),"For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been the outcast. The person no likes. Half of it’s my fault, half of it is others faults. School is the primary example. From preschool, to all the way up to the 5th grade, I was severely bullied, both physically &amp; emotionally. I would come to teachers for help, and would be immediately told that “they couldn’t do anything”, or something like I don’t really remember exactly what they would say. I recall there being a particular group of kids who would beat me up, for hell knows whatever. They’d take turns punching me and kicking me until they were satisfied, I never fought back, that was of course until one particular day, but I’ll tell about it a bit later. Every person in my grade would talk behind my back, whispering, &amp; whispering, I myself catching the most hurtful words in their conversations. I never said anything, I let it not bother me, even though it did, I got over it eventually. One day, it was early morning the lot of kids decided they’d beat me up that morning, unlike after school as per usual. They forced me into the bathroom, it was 5th grade I recall, they started trash-talking. Once that was over, the first person stepped up to give me a beating...and then...I can’t remember anything after that. I woke up, I had been lying on the bathroom floor, I was in a complete daze, very confused. I look around... The whole group of kids who would beat me up, all passed out on the floor, in extremely rough shape, (but not like lethality just very beat up, even bloodied). I look down at my hands, there were both covered in blood, not of my own, &amp; my knuckles were bruised to shit. I check myself over for any more wounds, nothing. I was the only unscathed it seemed, only thing I noticed was that my clothes were roughed up. Extremely confused, I just decide to clean myself up, and leave the restroom. I wash the blood off my hands, and straighten up my clothes, leaving without telling anyone about the kids passed out in there. To this day, I don’t know how I didn’t get in trouble. Let’s just say, I was never bothered after that, even in middle school, apart from people still talking behind my back which never stopped. I believe I was bullied for a reason. You see, I had a mentally abusive father, as well as (I believe but have never been properly diagnosed) have some sort of developmental disability. Due to this, I never have know how to correctly socialize with other people, and I always have come off as very awkward &amp; annoying. So because of that, I say it’s half my fault. But honestly, I don’t really know. I don’t know why I’m sharing this, but thanks for listening to my story."
1416,family suffering from mentally and physically abusive brother,"My family has been dealing with my older brother who we honestly don’t know why he’s created this intense hatred towards us. The triggering event happened when we conversed about him seeking help by a counselor or therapist due to the fact all he’s been doing is smoking weed (everyday). He says it helps him. Ever since that he’s shown complete hatred and anger towards everyone in the family yet still lives at home. Leaves the house when relatives come over. He’s been kicked out multiple times yet comes back refuses to talk to anyone in the household. Parents are so scared of him so they just let him in. We don’t know if it’s mental illness, hatred and resentment, or substance abuse or even manipulation."
1417,I have a very good life but why do I feel like somethings wrong? (vent-ish),"Hi :)

I (15F) live a pretty good life: I have a really good family relationship, good friends, am doing well in school, have many interests, am generally well-liked, and other things. But why do I feel like I'm getting depressed (or something else that's similar)? It's pretty minor but I get so confused because I know that I have so much to be grateful for yet I still get these feelings. I practice gratitude, am considered pretty optimistic, am usually happy with myself, I get some exercise, believe in a higher power, journal, and do many things that are advised for people with depression but for some reason, it keeps coming back. Usually these feelings last for a few days to a week, then go away, only to return a few weeks later. It's like a cycle: I get these feelings, feel really down, take a day to myself, feel better, and restart. The worst part is that I know what will help me (mindfulness, exercising more often, doing things that make me happy, etc) but I can't bring myself to do it. 

That's why I'm not sure whether I have depression or not because I'm not sad all the time. It's more that I can rarely find the motivation to do things that I know will benefit me, or that I simply enjoy or want to do. Of course, I still do the things I love but a lot of the time I end up watching youtube instead, fully aware that doing my passions is way more fulfilling. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that have so many sources of happiness but I still can't bring myself to do the things I want to do. Does anyone know how to fix this or how to ""restore"" motivation? (Or if motivation even is the right answer haha)

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it. (I've never done this before, hopefully I posted this in the right place..)"
1418,I’m done with school and everybody in it.,"My paranoia and anxiety are through the roof. We’ve had our first covid infections, but the headmaster doesn’t even send a fucking message to all the students to tell us. I had to hear it from a friend.

Then there’s a bunch of kids who don’t wear their fucking masks or put them underneath their nose. Don’t be a selfish hoe, we ALL have to wear them.

I’m just borderline panick attacking constantly and I’m so done with it. I want to go home and do online lessons for the rest of the year.

Better even, I’m going to send a mail to my main teacher and tell her about how tons of people wear their mask underneath their noses or not at all during class. I’m just done with it. Nobody seems to care. Nobody disinfects their hands, not even to have meals. I’ve lost all faith in humanity."
1419,Someone tried to drive over me today and no one cares...,"So I was walking to school and I came across a crosswalk. I looked left and right and cars were slowing down for me so I started walking. Then a driver from the left starts speeding up and I hear the engine roar. I reacted and ran so I survived without a scratch but I saw that my leg barely missed the car.

I told about this to my school friends etc and no one takes what I said seriously. Not even my boyfriend. I really want to cry now because I feel like my life has no worth."
1420,Why would a sister still talk to someone on social media who puts you in possible danger? Does she not believe me or not care?,"It really bothers me 😞I have a complicated past and this person makes me unsafe. Long story short this girls sister is best friends with a man who hires private investigators to chase and stalk me when I was like 18. It’s just that this man is crazy &amp; sick and I’m scared of him. I almost got into a serious car accident also cause the car was following me and purposely trying to scare me. He got away with a murder attempt. He thought I was hiding his daughter who ran away from him. He will still harass me when he gets the chance because I was friends with his daughters who didn’t talk to him. I don’t trust this person and my sister still responds to this person as much as I asked her to stop. It makes me feel like my sister doesn’t care and doesn’t trust me about anything. It hurts so much. Why does she lie to me and do this? She said that she blocked her and this girl commented on her Facebook and everything. 

This person on social media possibly stalks to give info to someone who uses to put me in dangerous situations... after 5 years this person has messaged all of my brothers and sisters to ask about me. I asked my sister over and over to keep me out of her social media now, to not tell this person where I live, and I started backing away from my sister now because of this. My sister posted pictures of me still on her social media and she said that she blocked this person but actually didn’t. I had to get into a fight with her to get her to stop and now she did finally 

This is awful of me but I got a secret account cause I don’t trust my sister and she lied. This year has been such a reality check. My heart really broke this year in so many ways and don’t feel like I have any family anymore. It’s just that there’s no respect for anything. It’s really hard when I’m so angry with my family and at the same time love them and have to live with them &amp; take care of them. I don’t understand why my family does what they do. So much went down from 2019-2020. I guess this is why I’m so messed up and will never heal."
1421,PLEASE HOW DO I RESIST,"I’m trying so hard to resist the urges to cut. I’m literally sweating, shaking, and short of breath because the urges are so bad. I ripped up my carpet where I tried to hide the blades and the only thing stopping me is the need to sterilize them. PLEASE IM 2 WEEKS SOBER HOW DO I RESIST THE URGES PLEASE IM GOING INSANE"
1422,I saw child porn a few years ago and I feel absolutely sick about that,"Back when I was about 11 I started to look at porn. Along that, I searched actively for CP, without knowing the consequences of that, searching for girls that were in sexual photos and were my same age at that time. As time passed on, when I was about 13 or so I found ""no-nude"" sites, and satisfied my impulses a lot with them. Then, I think I was 16 or so when I found really obscure sites with actual child porn.i satisfied myself with that too, and with greater pleasure at that moment, but after a while I stopped after realizing that those were illegal sites.

I feel sick of myself. I'm shaking as I write this. I'm 22 years old now, and I've never done anything to a child but to think that i had some kind of pleasure with that sickens me. I don't know what to do, I feel really bad, I don't want to be a pervert. I've never actually harm a child, and I don't want to, but I'm afraid i could lost control over this and get excited of things like lolicon (which I've been in the past). I just want to believe that I did that cos I was a horny and stupid teenager...

I'm in therapy but I'm afraid of saying this cos of legal consequences... I just want to never have done something like that..."
1423,SERIOUS ADVICE IS NEEDED PLEASE,"I am an 18 year old college student. For the past 4 months, I completely lost all motivation and will to do almost anything. I don’t feel pleasure in doing things anymore. The world feels flat and empty. It feels as though the fire in my soul has died. The problem with this is that it’s interfering with my school. Since I have absolutely no motivation, I’m not putting enough effort into school. College is ridiculously expensive and I don’t want my parents to spend their hard-earned money when I can barely finish the work. My intelligence is not the problem, it’s my motivation. It’s gone and I can’t get myself to do anything. I have lost the life inside of me. I feel pathetic and like an absolute failure. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I have even considered joining the military because I thought help to wake me up from this lethargic state of mind. I thought it might help to give some structure, direction, and organization to my life. Maybe, if I have someone yelling at me then I’ll snap out of this. I could really use some good advice right now. I was not like this before. Am I just depressed or is it more than that?"
1424,i feel like my will to live is constantly hanging on threads,"there’s so much difficulty being pushed toward me right now. i’m only 17 and my entire world has been turning upside down over time anyway but these last few days have really been the universe hammering the nail. 

why am I having to worry about the insane amount of debt my dead dad left behind for us?

why am I having to hide who I am from my conservative family?

why have I always struggled to make meaningful connection in life?

I know asking these “why me” sorts of questions do not except drive me further into my abyss of grief, anger, sadness, and self-pity but I just don’t know what to do anymore.

In a comic book series I like, a woman who’s had to give up everything runs away from it all eventually meets a spirit who gives her a new face and takes away all memories of her pain. I really want that right now. I really just want to be erased and start anew. 

I know I have the potential to make something of my life, even as I am right now, but the thoughts of the struggles I’ll inevitably need to face at some point really make me question the point of this journey. I just don’t understand why these bad things have happened to me, in my life specifically. It’s so hard to keep hope and be positive. Some people say the only way to get better is to keep moving forward, but it’s just so much easier said than done.

I’m sick of this all"
1425,rapidly irritated,"idk what this is but yesterday out of all days I’ve been crying a damn lot again. but the thing is that I haven’t cried properly for MONTHS. and now suddenly all my emotions just happened to pile up together and it seems like they all have decided e to conspire against me. fr i didn’t fucking cry properly for months and just out of nowhere yesterday it just happened to be where i had to have a mental breakdown all over again. like i don’t fucking understand? why??

anyways as i was saying when i got suddenly the urge to cry, and more, i became all of a sudden upset out of fucking nowhere ?!! then i relapsed and self-harmed myself again by head-banging multiple times at my wall until it eventually hurt and i got strong headaches from it. guess i did that just to feel something or idk what the fuck???? is wrong here!??

and then i happened to take my last antidepressants that i had even in a larger dosage than prescribed because yep i was just so upset and irritated at everything and everyone, all of a sudden, and now since this is from yesterday, I’m still dealing with the aftermath that is i still have strong ass headaches and my whole body is strongly trembling and shivering right now (prolly because of the antidepressants that i took after a long time and that i actually didn’t take them for a while too).

my headaches still remain even after yesterday shit

idk why i'm acting so impulsively out like that?? i hate all of this so fucking much i could literally just fucking puke

everything hurts right now and i'm still here... trembling the fuck out of myself haha"

1427,'Forcing' Therapy,"I don't think 'forcing' is the best word to use, here. They aren't latching me by the feet and dragging me to therapy-sessions. But they definitely are forcing me to make a choice between our friendship and therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I suffer from severe depression, have chronic insomnia, terrible anxiety and used to have suicidal tendencies. I've been improving myself for the past year. I've adopted clean-eating and daily exercise. And I try to fit in breaks daily. I'm in a much better mental state than I was, before. The improvement is gradual, but it is there. The only thing I struggle with is an adequate sleep-schedule, but I guess that's because of my insomnia and painful academic workload.

I do get spikes in depressive behavior, usually when I struggle with something academically. Afterwards, I'm almost as good as new. And these spikes are less rough than what they were before. 

During these spikes, I often vent to my friends about my feelings, and this consists of me sending intense columns of messages, narrating my current issues with numerous ""I want to kms"" sentences.

It was only until recently did I find out how unappealing my behavior was. And my friends confronted me, saying that I was bad for their mental health because my obsession with my academic record was making them feel bad about themselves. That made sense and I realized how little they actually did respond to my mental breakdowns. They believed that me venting to them about my problems did nothing, when in reality, It felt nice to have someone read my messages and validate my feelings. Also, some things they said really just stuck with me. They called me manipulative, said I was gas-lighting them and their true opinions on me rants just made me feel...lonely? Maybe heart-broken? I guess it's valid, though. 

They initially encouraged me to seek therapy, as a result. And that encouragement eventually turned into, what is to me, an unappealing behavior: I wasn't allowed to talk about anything, bring up any subject, academic or not, without a vulgar, aggressive message saying that I should register for a therapy session. And I understand that they do care for me. But they eventually came to an ultimatum that I either schedule a therapy session, or remain forever blocked by them on our usual messaging-platform. Maybe this would be valid behavior if I never got therapy. But I've been through 5 different therapists, and all of them were of terrible experiences, so much so I felt more unfixable than before. That's why I pursued a different path of mending my mental health. And so far it's been successful, but I still falter sometimes, and that's as it should be: it's not a perfect path. 

After my friends blocked me, I can't but feel like everybody around me is dropping like flies. I feel more isolated than ever, so much so I think I'm digressing. I love my friends, and I never ever intended to hurt them with my rants or venting. But now I just feel extremely anxious. Like I can't tell anyone about how I truly feel, because in reality, they are extremely turned off by it and think I'm just a sack of overbearing stinky shit. I miss talking to my friends. But they really believe therapy to be the absolute solution in my circumstance. And I'm not sure if what they think is best for me is truly best for me. It feels quite rushed; I want to come to terms with it, and they're setting absolute deadlines. I want to avoid medications, too. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks guys.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; friends gave ultimatum: seek therapy or blocked on messages. I went through 5 different therapists before this, didn't help. Tried different methods of mending my mental health, which help. But now feel extremely isolated and conflicted by friends' decision. Don't know what to pursue for my mental health. Also don't know how to properly handle this situation-- they're quite stubborn. And I am, too."
1428,Funeral interrupted as grieving sons told to leave mother's side by crematorium staff,"As you can see from the video, they tried to comfort their mum, then to be told to move the chairs back.

1429,Struggling right now,"  This year has weighed on me mentally. I got kicked out my place, moved in with friends, and had my cars engine go out. I bought a new car only to find my license is expired and since I moved I need a new one. I feel like I keep going backwards and now the landlord wants to evict us over here so I'm thinking I have a dark cloud following me.
  I feel like I need help, but really I wanna be alone. I wanna crawl into a small hole, curl into a ball, and stare into the abyss of darkness until I feel better. I wish I was different right now I'm terrible with people."
1430,Hi! I’m here with my Tip 2 for the week- Procrastination,"
TIP 2
Can you beat your procrastination?
Yes 
With JUST 5 MINUTES RULE 

Try out JUST 5 MINUTES RULE
When you notice you are dreading a task, decide to only do the task for 5 mins.

This is such a small amount of time, so you will feel you can tolerate just 5 mins

At the end of the 5 mins reassess and see if you can spend just another 5 mins on the task, and so on.

The idea being, set just a small amount of time to get started on a task, at the end
of which see if you can go just another small amount of time more. 

You will be surprised at just how much you are able to extend your time working on a task, once you have gotten the ball rolling.

The focus is on “starting” and not “finishing” the task."
1431,I’m really struggling,"I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for over a decade now. The Last two winters have been the most difficult time in my life. Last year I drove over 1500milds each month just to try to escape from my thoughts and impulses. Winters are usually the worst for me and I’m scared because I’ve already started hit rock bottom and it’s not even the winter yet. I had my first major breakdown of the fall tonight and considered calling a “mental hospital”. I’m used to having thought and major stress from my anxiety, but the thoughts are almost constant and the stress is making is affecting my sleep. My energy is fucked, and my motivation is nonexistent; even getting out of bed is a difficult task. My family is a no go for help, especially considering they are the root to most of my issues. I don’t have many friends either because my social skills are fucked, and I have major trust issues with even close friends because almost every “friend” I’ve had has stabbed me in the back or betrayed my trust. Someone please help me"
1432,Want someone to talk to,I'm feeling suicidal and I want to talk to someone.
1433,Talking with partner about mental health,"Talking to partner about past trauma

Me and my Girlfriend of two years have a very loving and positive relationship. She is a very upbeat and positive person, and has good mental health. However, there seems to be some traumatic events which occurred in the past which have been causing us some problems recently. Her emotions seem out of place and it’s causing more problems to arise and she seems to be more closed and moody. About a year ago, she hinted that she had some past trauma. It occurred when I tried to tickle her, and she told me not to do that because something happened in the past that made her feel very negative when that happened. At the time, I didn’t want to bother her about it and make it a bigger deal than it already was, so I simply just continued on and told her that if she ever wanted to talk about it with me she could. Recently her mood and emotions have been very out of place, and she has told me that she thinks she can’t process her emotions the same because of whatever occurred. I don’t know when it occurred or who could’ve done something like that. She refuses to open up about it, and I don’t really know how to confront the situation. I obviously don’t want to recommend a therapist and make her feel like she’s crazy, nor do I want to push her to talk about it and end up pushing her away from me. But I do think it would be beneficial to her mental health to talk about it. Her other friends usually offer poor advice when it comes to stuff like this so I don’t really trust them with it, nor do I think she would talk to them about it. I really do not know how to confront the situation at all. Looking for any suggestions about how to go about this situation, thank you for your time."
1434,Suspected Asperger’s- A Vent,"First off, I’d like to say that I know it does me no good indulging in such unproductive negativity. Wailing about a disorder that I’m not even sure if I have will get me absolutely nowhere, but it’s becoming too prominent in my everyday life. I (14F) suspect myself of having Asperger’s. I’m no psychologist or psychiatrist but once I dug deeper into the syndrome disregarding the stigma around autism I felt a sudden click. Maybe I’m crazy for saying that, but I don’t think I’ve related to anything more in life than this. My mom thinks it’s just my personality but I’ve known for a very long time that I knew I was different- I just couldn’t put my finger on it. I mimicked (like many young children) the behavior of my older sister even though I couldn’t understand why she reacted to certain things in different ways. I’ve always been told that I’m too blunt and ask weird questions since I was a little girl but I never understand how it was a bad thing. I wasn’t the worst at socializing in elementary school but there were a few things I noticed that I did to these friends; I made them do lots of homework I created, I gave them point systems and when they would do something like talk negatively about me to their other friends I would knock a point down and tell them that they couldn’t be my friend after a certain number of points were taken off. I wouldn’t necessarily say I was a people pleaser- I let people know if I thought they were worth my time and when I didn’t care about what they were saying. Over time I’ve learned to suppress my bluntness after being scolded several times, but I still value self respect, etc. I developed an intense interest with crafting and building doll beds with glue guns around the age of 4, but once I was introduced to a computer at 5 I completely moved onto gaming. I started developing depression around age 10 and I believe it was hereditary because of the amount of mentally ill relatives I have. I assume because of this depression, I lost interest in a lot of things I used to love (like art, literature, so on and so forth) so I don’t know if I would consider my obsession over an anime character I relate to as a symptom. (A character with Asperger’s, go figure) I’m going to end this here but I’d be really grateful is someone who is knowledgeable about Asperger’s reached out to me. I’m getting a therapist and I’d really like some extra support for something that has been affecting my life significantly for the past several months. Thank you for reading."
1435,I keep missing work because i just dont feel like i can go in!,"I wake up in the mornings and just cant be asked to go in then i sit at home all day feeling guilty for not going in, tell myself im gonna go in tommorow and then wake up and repeat how can i break this cycle"
1436,I feel like more stuff has been getting me down lately.,"I’m really not sure why, but recently it feels like I’m having more and more times where I just feel very sad and melancholic for no huge reason. I’ve also been reading a lot of manga and I’ll start to feel very anxious if I stop before finishing the entire series. Obviously this is bad because even if all I did was read a ~200 chapter series all day it would still take me about 2-3 days to complete. I’m not sure if this ties in to me having a pretty rough schedule for school at the moment, but I just feel like I’m only fine when I’m completely distracted by something, like messing around in a guitar store. If it’s of any importance I’m 16, male, comfortable, and have a healthy and happy relationship with a partner. 

On an unrelated note I also feel pretty unmotivated to do things like exercise or put all my effort into schoolwork, it’s usually very hard to focus completely."
1437,Do I have a personality disorder?,
1438,I wanted to know what's wrong with me,"I've always been sensitive but used to shut down my emotions, now (I'm 18) I'm being so childish and out of control that sometimes it's scary, I'm afraid I might have borderline or something like that because I'm extremely moody, I'm always feeling bored, empty, feeling like I don't matter to people and arguing with my best friend. Sometimes I wake up so good and hopeful that I feel like I'm in heaven, I say how much I love my loved ones, I'm optimistic and full of energy..then something happens (like idk my mom yelling at me) and I start feeling down or angry, if my bf do something that I don't like I start to hating on her but I'm so fuckin afraid she'll go away bc she didn't deserve this treatment, I'm trying to control myself :/ I'm very impulsive and idk I find people so fascinating then I find them boring af (most of the time rn they are boring to me). I know I'm being self destructive as well, I used to abuse alcohol and some meds, but now I'm regulating that, I'm just self harming for punish myself or sometimes calm down when I'm anxious.
This stuff is ""normal"" to me, I always manage to hide this awful part of me, the thing I don't understand is why I feel so anxious sometimes because I'm bored is agonising, I need to do something or I make drama, dance, talk lots of useless stuff with myself or my brother, I'm very hyperactive in those ""episodes"" but im not having fun, it's so weird, annoying and agonising idk whats wrong with me :( I don't want to hurt myself anymore or hurt others, I can't go to therapy right now cause I'm kinda poor and it's not that easy. Idk, I just needed to say it in some place, if I have bpd I wouldn't be surprised, I present almost all the traits oof but If I have it, does that mean my personality is just a sickness? I feel so weak and shit"
1439,Just decided to leave my toxic boyfriend,
1440,Feeling like there is no where else to turn to,I feel like I can't ignore my mental health anymore. I told my parents I was depressed they didn't do anything. My mom found a noose in my room she didn't do anything. They've found self harm tools and did nothing. I mean what else do I have to do? They straight up don't care. I want to kill myself but I don't wanna go to hell.
1441,Cancer?,"I don't know where to put this, but here might be the best. Lately I have notice that food almost any kind is making me nauseous. Drinking water is doing this to me too. I am concern. Then again the water bottle is refillable so it might be the jug not clean enough after every refill? But none the less the nausea is increasing by day. Idk whats going on, if anyone could tell and have experience similar, I would love to read about it....

Thank you for reading."
1442,My anxiety is breaking me,"My anxiety is just getting too much and i don’t want it anymore. 


I’m just scared of showing emotions in public and stuff. Like i have a massive fear of being judged and laughed at. I have severe anxiety ontop of ADHD and it’s breaking me. But you know who gave me that shit? My dad. He is out of my life now but I can’t do all day without constantly being worried and basically breaking down when i get home i am off school today but crying as of now and just the constant worrying. Yeah i have thought about ending myself alot of times, i don’t say this but i have cut myself. Even if i’m waiting for some friends if i’m meeting up i just feel like i want to cry because i’m scared that they won’t turn up. Also, i recently thought of what it would be like to jump off that big bridge i go to quite alot. I think i’m breaking down.

I’m sorry for this rant and stuff or if it was too long, idk what to put, i guess i need cheering up or something."
1443,I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind,"I stopped taking my bipolar meds sometime in June and I stopped seeing my therapist in July. I was in kind of a lull with not being in school and being stuck in quarantine for months on end. With absolutely nothing to do and no responsibilities, my symptoms kind of subsided. I think, I'm actually not really sure what my state of mind was. But I ended up ghosting my therapist and stopped taking my meds because I felt like I didn't need them. I feel like I don't really have bipolar and I was misdiagnosed.

My first day of school started last week. I got accepted to my dream school so I was really excited, and I still am. But this new workload and having a schedule and responsibilities might have ignited my symptoms again?? It started off slow and now I feel like I'm bouncing off the walls. I don't know what my emotional state is, whether I'm depressed or manic or both or neither. I don't know!

I tried to start doing schoolwork hours ago and I have barely started. I keep getting distracted and doing other things. I didn't have this problem in the past because I would just go to a cafe to do schoolwork but that is not possible with the quarantine. But my entire head and neck feels sore, like it's about to explode. I can't get anything done right now no matter how hard I try but I need to do it.

I keep thinking about how my life is going downhill rapidly and I have nothing to look forward to in the future. This isn't true because I have so much to look forward too but I feel like I'm going to be unhappy forever. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy. Not experiencing the emotion happiness but truly being a happy person. Maybe when I was 12/13 years old. That's about 10 years ago. I also feel like I'm getting uglier and fatter and more unhinged every day and there's nothing I can do about it. Every day I think about a day in the past and think about how at the time I thought I couldn't get worse but now I think about it and I wish I was back in that time because I wasn't as bad as I am now. I feel like I have an infinite amount of thoughts and ideas and things in my head but I can't organize them and it's really frustrating. I feel like I'm thinking about 100 different things at the same time. I feel like I'm not in reality, and the world I am in right now I don't want to be in. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not to say I'm suicidal, I just don't want to be here anymore.

This post makes absolutely no sense and I don't know what I hope to gain from posting this. Maybe some guidance? Some comfort? That's not your responsibility. Thank you for reading this if you did."
1444,Advice!,"If your struggling I can recommend two podcasts. 

1. The happiness podcast with Dr Robert Puff
2. Psykhe mental wellbeing podcast

Both are available on the podcast app and Spotify.  

Also, speak to someone. When you talk to them, listen to them too. They may have good advice. If someone advices you then try it, even if you already have, as you never know it may work the second time. 

If someone takes the time to help you, then be compassionate about there support and time they given. It can be hard to discuss mental health with others but it is also hard to give help - even if you have struggled as everyone is different. 

Reflect on your life. What is the true problem? Did you make a mistake that makes you feel that way or did someone else do something to you? If you are at fault then don’t blame others for your errors but also don’t harshly blame yourself. You can accept fault without harshly criticising yourself. 

Speak to yourself as you would a friend. When I say speak to yourself, I’m referring to your inner monologue. Stop when you’re mean to yourself and ask the question: would I say that to a friend? If you wouldn’t then never say it to yourself again. 

Other people don’t cause you to feel how you do. You are in control your emotions and our own stories we add to situations affect our feelings. A lot of the time it affects us negatively. 
Other people are not out to get you. That is a story you tell yourself. 
Other people want to try and help you. If you think otherwise it is a story you tell yourself. 
Unless they have said specificities so and then you are not the problem, they are. 

Finally, try and be positive. Every time your negative about yourself and skills, say three positives. It sounds silly but after a while (years sometimes, or it could be months) when something bad happens you naturally become inclined to a positive spin. 

I recently lost a job (Friday) I started and felt awful this weekend. When I started thinking negatively about myself, I naturally began to point out positives in my life. It has taken time to arrive at this point (5 years as I was in a really bad way back in 2015). It isn’t easy unfortunately and there is no quick fix. Like everything it will be hard but worth it. I still have times where it gets tough. It never ends. I’m trying to be honest. I don’t want to sugar coat the truth. 

Life is a journey not a goal. 

Best of luck to you all.

1445,"My wife has psychosis, please help","My parter who I have been with for 7 years and known for about 16 years has been going through first episode psychosis for the past three months. My wife worked in a hospital as a nurse for many years and always had a consistent and strong charactor. She was always positive, down to earth and very rational. She is currently 29, up until 3 months ago me and her couldn't possibly be happier with each other which we would discuss all the time.

It all began 3 months ago when she had her wisdom coming out, there were two at the same time! She got an infection called sepsis on one side of her face and from there onwards she became very out of charactor and delusional, she took antibiotics for her infection. during this we were rushing around trying to get her surgery asap but due to waiting list of elective surgerys we were struggling so we had to go private.

Everybody that knew her and communicated to her would realise somethings very wrong with her and would contact me or her parents. She was very intense in the way she acted, had unusual unrealistic beleifs, would lie, and felt like she had been hacked and stalked. She resigned from her job immediately.


She got her surgery done within a week after her first delusion and her infection went away. The surgeon said she had a pretty unusual case and needed extensive work and that may be risk to her taste nerves. Then she was prescribed heavy painkillers like oxycotin and endone.

Her parents and I attributed her out of charactor behaviour to this infection and tooth sitaution so we were releived when we saw her improve within weeks of the surgery. She started being positive again not 100% her self but much better. 

A month goes by and unfourtunetly her psychotic symptoms return only worse. She was threatening me, screaming out loud, had extreme covid phobia, was extremly paranoid, she would only sleep a few hours a day and have full on energy like she was on cocaine or something.

I asked her to go get help and tried to convince her to see sombody but she wouldn't listen and told me to go get f'd. I got extremely concerned and let her parents and siblings know immediately and they all came to my house to help me. She became very aggressive when this happend and she wanted to leave the house and was yelling at everyone very aggressively. 

I could see that she was very distressed and shaking so I took her carkeys so she didnt harm herself or anybody else. She got very mad at this and went to punch me, i then went outside. At this point her family called the ambulance and police and she was taken to the hospital diagnosed  with stress induced psychosis. She was discharged the next day and prescribed anti psychotic meds and would require to attend follow up assessments.

From this day on her hatred for me began, in her mind she feels like everyone is out to get her and that im trying to make her out as crazy for my own benefit.

Not only that but her parents were in complete panic and fear and turned on me. Blaming me for what happend to her, saying that I beat her ( she would tell them this ), saying that I give her ice/meth and that I did not look after her properly. I can understand that its hard to see your daughter in such distress but me and her were literally living a disney movie before any of this and constantly displayed love and kindness to each other. We had relatively healthy lifestyle with some drinks on the weekend.


I continued to look after her for a further 6 weeks as she has been unable to do anything since her first delusion. She slowly but surely was recovering, no more manic episodes and at some point even showed signs of waking up. She realised and admitted that she had a psychotic episode. I was so releived as i felt she was doing so well.


During this time I found out alot about her I never knew. She told me she was emotionally neglected as a child, wasnt fed properly, lived in a disgusting unclean house. Her mum was very negative all the time and mean to her and never supported her or her dad. Her dad became an alcoholic and would beat her mum alot in front of her. 


Even after showing good recovery. She starts again just as intense as she was when she was taken to hospital. She kicked me out of the house and wanted nothing to do with me. I had to leave to another state and live at my brothers 1000km away. She was very aggressive and delusional, she threatend to lie to the cops and tell them I hit her, when I have done no such thing. She made many direct threats so I didnt argue and just left for my own saftey. She thought she was part of anonmumous because she was following a instagram page with like 90 followers. She told me everybodys crazy she is the only one that can think straight. 


Its been 3 months now and i havnt been there with her for 3 weeks now. She talks to me here and there but she is still not doing well. :(  since she kicked me out she told me she had to trick the doctors cause she doesnt want to be on meds anymore she thinks they hold her back. So somehow now she has been cleared by the doctors and is no longer on meds.

 I talked to her yesterday and she was talking alot of crazy stuff saying she has been hacked by 10 different people one including me. Sounding super distressed in her voice and telling me she was panicking badly. Saying that anonmumous got her back so shes safe. Saying she doesnt want to go back to the doctors there evil and only want her harm. The list goes on. At this point pretty much every person in her social group knows shes not ok and has contacted me to find out what's going on.

I cant really do anything to help her as her family doesnt speak to me and she wont listen to anybody. I feel so helpless because I know shes alone in the house and is avoiding everybody because they think shes mentally ill and hates that. She tells me she doesnt speak to her family anymore. I feel like the medication was helping her so much but now shes off it and clearly getting worse.

I cant even go to her state anymore because theres a covid border in her state not letting people from my state come in. Not that she wants me anymore anyway she tells me lots of evil things filled with hatred for things ive never done to her.

I felt like the stress of the infection, intensive surgery, anasthetic, heavy painkillers, intense stress, childhood trauma, social loss of friends and rapid weight loss all got a bit too much for her both mentally and physically and broke her. 

I wanted to beleive that this was truly a brief stressed induced psychosis episode but I feel now that 3 months later that all of those things simply triggered a more serious underlying condition. Ive never felt so hurt and stressed in my life and all i can do is think about her wellbeing. 

I would like to hear some opinions on her recovery at this point is it likley that one day she will be able to reflect on all this as her rational logical self?

Because she has had 3 months like this does this mean she will have relapse in the future for sure?

Is the fact she isnt taking her meds going to make her just get worse and worse?

I feel so hopeless and lost I dont know what to make of this I wish i could do something..One minute i was ready to start my dream life with the woman of my dreams and then it all fell apart. Ive known her for so long I dont even care about us, I just want to know shes getting the best care she can get."
1446,I dont feel happy anymore.,"This year kinda sucks and thats no secret but these been kinda hard you know, im 17 and have no objectives in life, my mom is on great debt and my family cant help, to be honest im kinda useless. I just wished i could do more for them but even if thid fucking decease desapear i wouldnt be able to get a job beacause im dumb."
1447,Does happiness justify the pain?,"One thing I’ve always struggled with is convincing myself that if I do become happy one day, that it will justify the pain I’ve been through. So for those of you who have recovered and gotten better, what do you think? Was it worth fighting for?"
1448,Rough day.,So today would be my nans 85th birthday. She passed a few months ago. Unexpectedly. (So unexpectedly i didn't make it to the hospital before she passed) ive been trying to not think about it all day. But unfortunately irl requirements meant i had to go out and do some grocery shopping. Which is when my brain decided would be the best time to think about this. And now im just trying to hold on till i can get home and break down.
1449,need someone to just hear me out,"I live in a foreign country really far from everyone I know with my partner. but living with my partner has been absolute hell . we have fought so much it made me fall back into a really depressed state and he doesnt seem to take it serious , understand , or maybe even care. I dont know what to do . I cry almost every single day, there was a time where I was cutting myself,, ripping my hair out , punching myself, walls anything really and even though its not that bad anymore I still get the urges. I have tried multiple times ruching out to him to try to explain whats going on , but he just doesnt seem to care. I think its been so much that I think hes numb to it at this point . to the point where he insults me and is really mean to me when I start acting this way . I understand he is tired , becasue so am I . but I have been through so many traumatic situations that I simply cannot control myself .  the moment I hear a certain word, smell, or if I ever feel cornered panic kicks in and I start freaking out which only seems to make the situation between us worse . I dont know what to do . I am so tired of feeling this way . theres days I dont even want to live anymore.  I am all alone with not much to do which I understand takes a huge toll on my depression , but I simply don't have it in me to do anything , so it feels like a never-ending circle. even when my partner is mean to me I tend to just try to forgive and forget because at the end of the day I just want and need someone . I begged him today not to go to work becasue I didnt want to be alone , of course he couldn't , I understand . but I crave someone to talk to , someone that understands, sometimes I just need to let everything out to someone other Than my dog . I cannot talk about a lot of traumatic experiences to anyone except for him , but he usually takes it to heart and sees it as me ""bitching"" or ""accusing"" him which leads to him telling me to leave him alone . not asking for pity or anything really . just needed to let it out , thanks if you made it this far"
1450,Anyone in their 30s that can talk about life?,"It seems there are only teenagers in this group, which, fine, glad they have somewhere to go.  But it's a little different when a 16 year old doesn't like her mom, and then there's me, going on 40, who has no support system and is worried about his entire world collapsing.  

I have recently made a decision in a bout of overwhelming emotions which has jeopardized ... almost everything.  And I also find myself in a country I don't live where COVID is look like Italy in its worst days, except no one here takes any precautions, like complete fucking idiots.  I am practically immobilized with anxiety and depression at this point.  Or at least some rather uneasy feelings about my whole life.  It is not easy right now to keep my wits about me.  I don't want to roll down the hill of doing more damage.....  I am alone.  No support system.  Could really use someone to lean on a bit..."
1451,Getting help in a world with Covid-19,"I’m dealing with a lot (a LOT) of anxiety and in turn that is making me depressed. College is quickly becoming too difficult to keep up with (I work in college and take classes from 7:30am to 5:00pm every day)

I was prepared to get some help this year if things didn’t improve (I think it’s gotten worse lol), but then the world went into lockdown. I’m terrified of seeing a doctor as it is, my entire body shakes every time I see anybody and it’s just a very big ordeal for me. But now everything is different, and personally that’s just an added layer of The Unknown that’s making it very difficult for me to seek help.

I’m scared of how I’ll interpret people over the phone, I’m scared the doctor will think I’m lying because she won’t be able to see my body physically shake, I’ll have no way of knowing how she’s reacting to the things I tell her because I can’t see her body language.... I’m also scared she’ll refer me to therapy, where once again nothing is face to face anymore and I’ll have to deal with that on TOP of my regular old anxiety !

It seems like such a small problem, hence why I’m here and not talking to family and friends. I’m constantly just told “well, that’s the world! better just get on with it”, and I understand the intentions but it’s seldom helpful and I end up just feeling bad about myself because I can’t do anything lol.

Just hoping for some advice, or even if you guys are struggling with the same problem. Covid has made it a lot harder for me to get help, when it already felt like a gargantuan task..."
1452,Unsure about calling my local mental health clinic,"During the last few months I sometimes had suicidal thoughts, was hitting myself and had days were i didn't want to leave my bed at all. The last two weeks have been especially bad, I even started cutting myself and have been feeling more and more anxious and hopeless. I told my student councillor about this yesterday and she advised me to call my local mental health clinic. I didn't do it so far because yesterday was extremely emotionally draining. I know this is gonna sound stupid, but should I do it today even though I feel better right now? Part of me thinks I am blowing this whole thing out of proportion and faking it."

1454,Better coping mechanisms for stress,"I’ve just started uni and have a shit load of work on my plate. Unfortunately when I get stressed and overwhelmed my brain immediately goes to suicide and how I’m ugly and stupid and maybe as well kill myself. As you can imagine, this isn’t a very healthy artistries when you have lectures to do notes on an assignments to do. Any advice?"
1455,{TW: gore} How to cope with things I’ve done,"The first time I killed an animal was when I was... 5? 6? Somewhere around there. It was an 8 day old lamb for a sacrifice. I didn’t want to do it, but was made to. I messed it up. So badly. I know the lamb suffered because I didn’t know how to cut its throat correctly. So much blood.

I have had so much blood on my hands. My arms, my face and body. I don’t think there’s any part of me that hasn’t had blood on it at some point. It was normal. Taught to play in entrails as a kid. My lack of disgust or inhibition around it all was a point of pride for my parents. Part of growing up happy and healthy on a farm.

I first started thinking about suicide when I was 11. But was too scared. Of the pain. Of the consequences. Of the consequences if I failed. Everything got harder after that. I guess the blood started weighing on me.

When I was 13 or 14 maybe my mom decided I was going to start a dog breeding business. And bought me 30-some-odd dogs. Two different breeds. Pedigree blood lines. And just gave them to me, without asking, and I was suddenly expected to care for all of these dogs all by myself.

I didn’t know what to do. I could barely get out of bed in the morning. I couldn’t sleep at night. I still had all my other chores and work I was expected to do. And no one would help me take care of them. They were mine. It was my business and my responsibility.

They all died. It must have been terrible for them. And I’m responsible. I should have taken better care.

All the death and pain and suffering I’ve caused. It doesn’t matter that I’m a pacifist now. I hate it when I remember it all. I hate myself for not remembering it more. I hate myself for every time I think maybe I’m a good person.

I have so much blood on my hands. And there’s nothing I can do to wash it away."

1457,"I'm randomly getting sad without a reason and then getting frustrated over it, what is this?","It has been happening more and more, I once considered going to a therapist but I was too afraid to ask my mom about it.
Today in school I had a really weird phase of several feelings happening after each other: that included staring at something for a minute, getting really depressed without a reason to the point that I almost started to cry, hating myself, etc.
I couldn't pay attention to class and I had to ask someone about it."
1458,Is Paltalk good or bad for mental health?,I see it as toxic
1459,What is a mania episode like?,"Okay so I haven’t been sleeping very well the past few day, going to sleep at around 4 or 5? But I REALLY can’t sleep tonight, so it’s 7 am and I’m still awake and wondering around, or at least I was. 

Okay so at around 5 I got a boost of inspiration and I want outside to write a song and make a painting, which I did neither of... fully, I started on the painting and was singing while I did it.

So then I came inside because I heard leaves rustling. And I’ve been inside for about an hour, but here’s the kicker... I feel almost repulsed by the idea of sitting down, so I’ve been pacing the whole time.

I keep thinking I hear footsteps but that can’t be because the only people here are all asleep...

Anyways, all of this is very strange behavior for me, so I was frankly kinda concerned.

But not enough to wake up my mom. I hopped on my phone in a hope to find something to distract me, but somewhere in my mind a voice said I would die if I moved from this spot, so I’ve  been standing here for about 30 minutes?

I just keep thinking and thinking and I think I’m freaking myself out?

What if my mom thinks I’m overreacting and gets mad at me?

What if there IS something in my house and my intuition is right?

And I meant to ask, what is a hallucination like? I thought they were very realistic things you thought were real, but could they also be things your brain knows is fake but is still very scared and anxious about..?

God I’m so tense and I keep looking around, but I’m staying in the same spot. 

Did I already say I was pacing earlier? I can’t remember... anyways, my mom should be up soon and I’ll talk to her, if she believes me..."
1460,If you need to talk/vent I'm open for how long you need bc mental health is super important,If you need to talk/vent i'm a good listener and noting is too big or too small
1461,I dont know what the best option for me is,"I have been debating getting mental health help for the past two years but I have heard that where I am they are very unhelpful and that alone makes me not even want to try. but everything has felt like it has been falling apart more than usual and I cant handle it anymore . I dont know whats wrong with me , I think I might be depressed and maybe have ptsd but I really dont know. I have been through pretty ""traumatic"" events starting back at about two years. and although my situation isnt as bad as it was it still happens. things have been so bad certain places bring back these kind of flashbacks where I zone out and before I know it my whole body is panicking, im crying and sweating even though nothing is happening . this happens with places, certain smells, certain words or tones, if im grabbed or touched a certain way, I have been choked and smothered so even being in bed and pressing too hard against my pillow , if im getting even slightly warm air or feel a little suffocated  my mind and body completely lose it. it makes me sad, everything that has happened to me makes sad. I know living with me has been hard, especially with my mental health plummeting downhill but I never thought I deserved such mental physical verbal abuse.  I guess my question within all of this is will seeing someone help. will medication help. will anything regarding going to see a mental health specialist help. I amterriified of being judged or being told im being dramatic or anything like that. but I know I cannot live like this , for my own sake and for everyone else around me"

1463,excessive laughter with hallucinations,"I am diagnosed with bipolar, but didn’t get far into that. I ended up moving when finally dealing with it at a psychiatrist and my current insurance doesn’t work for my area. 

I mostly just want to record a moment. Tonight I’ve been feeling heightened. The peak was hallucinations of flies, then not a hallucination but started seeing a blanket in my closet as someone staring at me. This made me laugh to the point of tears and choking. Everything is funny for dumb reasons. It freaks my boyfriend out and idek what happens. I feel in my own reality away from the world when it does. The peak can last minutes to hours, so not long at all. It doesn’t happen often either, every 3-4 months. No what it is but it’s weird. I still feel really off so I hope this makes sense."
1464,Being extremely rude to my SO,"I [22F] live with my fiancé [22M] and I really love him a lot. He’s definitely my favorite person in the world. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder and he is very supportive and never makes me feel different. He also helped me get rid of my abusive ex who wouldn’t leave me alone. 
 
However sometimes when he tells me to do something or when he’s explaining something to me I just flip at him. I get irritated at him for no reason. It’s the same feeling as when you’re tired of someone, but as soon as he turns his back to me (I am a bitch indeed so he just leaves sometimes) I feel bad for screaming at him and immediately want to hug him and kissing but my stupid pride doesn’t let me until a few but usually it’s always him that comes to me afterwards. 

What makes me feel even worse about this is that this man treats me like a queen. I’ve never been treated with so much love, passion, trust and respect in my life. My ex lied to me, cheated and even abused me physically but I never flipped on him except for when we broke up. 

Can this whole thing of treating badly those who love you and treating good those who hurt you be part of bpd? Or could it be something else? And what are your tips to just like... chill? I’m constantly in anger and stress and always ready to scream at someone that wants good for me and I’m tired of it. My doctors abandoned me so I can’t have professional help anymore."
1465,I would give everything that I have to be healthy again,[removed]
1466,A simple trick but it's working for me,"I'm very quick to feel an emotion: anxiety, anger, embarrassment, defensiveness, etc. It convolutes what the other person was trying to say, and I wind up just spiraling down into a panic attack, shutting down, self hate, or dissociation many of the times. 

To counter this strong, immediate reaction I have to things, I've started to do a simple trick and I guess it's working for myself. 

I say to myself ""it's okay to feel these emotions but they are not welcome here"" as I take a deep breath to help relax and give myself a chance to think for a moment first. 

I'm easily embarrassed or made anxious, but doing this I've found I can kinda nip some of it in the bud right away, and I won't feel that embarrassment so intensely, it often drives me down into a very dark place of self hatred. Any time I feel these kinds of emotions coming on, I just say my phrase as much as I need and take deep breaths, then reflect on why I'm feeling that way. It's actually helpful for me."
1467,How do I think empowered thoughts? I’ve emerged from narc parents and friends since adolescence and now starting to rebuild my life.,Now I’m starting to think the stupidity of them and what they did and still do. And start to think that it was me all along who helped them and can withdraw my help or redefine who I am and know what I want as a result. What other such thoughts are there and are there any books for this too?
1468,Ghosted nearly all of my friends. It has been years for some. What do I do?,"Since 2018 I have gone through endless bouts of cyclical depression and when that has happened, I have withdrawn so severely that I've ignored repeated attempts at contact with many, many friends and close family members. The prospect of explaining what happened after the fact makes me so ashamed that I have basically never done it.

Every time I have made an earnest effort, I've begun making a list of people to reconnect with, and the list gets so long that it fills me with dread and I shame spiral all over again. What makes it harder is that many of these lost friends are part of a larger community, and I feel as though I have to reconnect with the entire extended friend group at the same time.

I also feel immense pressure to explain everything, all the ugliness, which makes me feel guilty for burdening someone else with my problems. Past therapists have encouraged me to go easy on myself, but to me, if I don't explain everything I'm being dishonest, and if I do, it'll come off like I'm making excuses for ghosting.

Where do I start with this? How do I admit to several dozen people that I was a shitty friend because of depression? What do I say?"

I have had panic attacks recently but I just do not understand. I always had a feeling that this whole thing is in my head, that I am a lazy escapist and nothing more. The first session just cemented that feeling. And no, the therapist didn't say anything I just did not feel like she is saying anything helpful. Am I being prematurely judgemental?"

1474,I was bullied online trying to help someone and now I want to cry,"First time posting 

Ok, so I wa searching a drama video yesterday and someone in the comment was attacking everyone and was also being attack. I commented on of his (I don't know if it's a his, her or it, but I'm French and it's more natural for me to use his in that context) post and also added that the whole comment section was becoming a little to toxic for them and that they should take a break. I went to sleep and woke up to find that they called me a ""four eyes"" since I have glasses In my profile picture. 

Now I fell like trash and I'm shaking. How can people be so mean?? I was just trying to help someone mental help. Did I do the right thing. I reply back insulting then with some slang. Should I delete my comment?? I fell bad and sad and I have a class on 15 minutes but this ruined my day. Should I fell bad about my glasses??

I stared Lamotrigine as a Mood stabilizer a few weeks ago and I'm more sensitive since then. I'm I being rational?? I also took some Seroquel last night and fell like a blob.

Love you all 💗💗💗"
1475,Anxiety. True hell.,"I have bipolar, ADHD, OCD and an severe anxiety disorder. 
I don’t dislike my bipolar disorder because my hypomanias all throughout my life even as a kid shaped me and made me popular. Even though I would switch to depressive/ no pleasure statesI could still talk and act the same even though I was completely faking it but it was just a cycle. Whenever the hypomanias came it made me the one that’s making everyone laugh and feel happy and it would just come back into me and I would feel waves of pleasure. Bipolar isn’t all bad. But the depressive episodes are way to gnarly... that’s when bipolar disorder is the worst.

I don’t dislike my severe ADHD disorder cause it almost made the world a bit mystical. I was always drifting off and in my childhood I felt really disconnected from reality. I definitely saw the world a lot different but I have come to really love the world I see with ADHD. School was extremely hard that was the downside but I managed to graduate college. 

I don’t dislike my OCD disorder because it keeps me in check. I use to drink lots of fizzy drinks and bad food as a kid but never got fat. Until I was about 16 and my OCD took control after I went to the dentist and had fillings in my back teeth from fizzy drink addiction. My teeth had almost turned yellow. I quit fizzy drinks and bad food for good and for 2 years have been eating healthy food. Very strict no junk food if I do I feel weird. Only water. Workout everyday or I feel fucked. Have to clean house or I feel fucked. Makes me look good. Dress good. I look really good not gonna lie, I have a nice glowing face, 5’10 69 kg about 9% body fat. Extremely lean... it’s pretty crazy but it’s an obsession that everyone gives me love for. It’s kinda the only thing I have because my personality is fucked from...

Anxiety...
The thing that has done absolutely no good in my life. Being really shy... going to high school I was so shy but still I was really good looking and had so many girls fall in love with me over Facebook in grade 7 but once they got to know me in real life I would just barely talk I was so fucking anxious. When I would see a girl I was talking to in real life I would get a rush of panic and terror and It would switch me into a bipolar depressive state and I really could barely speak. My brain would race. I would get laughed at and stuff. I was just a little grade 7 only about 5 foot lol and would get all these girls coming up to me and see these other 6 foot tall grade 7s jealous I would feel real weird. I couldn’t handle it so just wouldn’t date. Rejected over 100 girls. Never dated or kissed one in high school except for 1 girl. After that I just became a loser. High school was rough. I had 1 hot girl tell me “I use to think you were hot but then I realised you don’t talk so yuck”
It never really went away. Made me lose so much friendships. Made me stay at home and just fantasise of me being in public because I just can’t man. It’s my brain and I can’t do a single thing about anxiety. Fuck."
1476,Just found out that my best friend attempted suicide,"she always vents her problems to me and she always says that she can't do it anymore. I always say that I'll always be there for her when things are rough and as I said, I was there for her. She said that she won't do it because she is strong. Right now I can't find the right words to say to her. I only thought that maybe its my fault because i am not enough to save her."
1477,How do I handle childhood trauma?,"I was mentally and emotionally abused a few years back (7-12 years old) and I feel like it messed with me mentally because I now suffer from self harm and I have depression symptoms (not diagnosed) along with anxiety symptoms (again not diagnosed) and panic attacks occasionally, how do I deal with this? I don’t feel like I can live like this anymore, it feels like I’m just surviving not living, the only times I’m happy for a long period of time is when I completely forget about reality (like hanging out with my friend) and even then there’s plenty of reality that loves to remind me it exists"
1478,How do I fix a friendship that I am extremely dependent/reliant on to a healthy one?,"Won't go into too much detail, but this guy who was my best friend growing up, we used to tell each other everything, but as we got older it became more of a me talking to him and him listening and giving advice. 

It stopped being a give and take for both of us and transformed into me taking and him giving. I want to help him, but every time I ask how he's doing he asks how I'm doing and says I don't need to worry about him and this makes me feel extremely guilty because I know this is wrong and I feel guilty because a part of me feels like he feels like he has to help me and doesn't want to stop because he thinks he'll destroy me if we stop being friends or stop talking about everything that's going wrong in my life.

Which is and isn't true. If we stop being friends completely, yes I will be totally crushed, but I just want to fix this back to normal. Even if it means not talking about the heavy stuff for a while.

And I've tried to do that, but once I stop talking about that he doesn't talk to me at all. Doesn't reach out, nothing. And when I try to have a casual conversation it's like nothing comes to mind of what to talk about because he doesn't keep up the conversation. I'm like how's your life bla bla bla, but there's a clear disconnect between our casual conversations now and what they used to be. We used to FaceTime for Horus talking about the most random shit making each other laugh, but now it's like dry conversations about ""so how's your life?"" ""good"" I mean there are some inside jokes shared and humor  bounced off one another, but definitely not like it used to be.

And the only times we talk have these conversations is over FaceTime since he moved schools. over text it's like talking to a brick because I can't think of anything to text about because he won't talk about himself, and I don't even mean the heavy stuff, I'll ask a question and then be like ""but how are you?"" and he completely avoids the question and only answers mine about myself.

I've tried to not ask another and just say how are you, or start a conversation trying to ask how are you, but then he just goes no how are you?

and I can't think of anything else to talk to him about that doesn't relate to him helping me with my problems.

I really don't want to lose this friend, what can I do to fix this?"
1479,Any supplementments that improve speaking?,Im on risperdone and it makes it difficult to speak. I thought CBD oil would help.. Im not sure... if there is anything you have tried that works for you Let.me know
1480,What does one do if you realize you are objectively getting worse at stuff no matter how much you try to get better?,"So this might seem like a silly question and i know many would answer this with something along the lines of ""change what you do, maybe you are incompatible with the task"" or ""maybe you just feel like it, but you actually achieve a lot"", i can tell you straight away that is not the case.

Throughout these last couple of weeks i have been told by my workplace that projects i have been handling have come back with errors, requiring a full redo or leading to serious issues down the line that my co-workers have to correct.

I have previously always been slower than the other employee's, but now suddenly after 2 and a half years i start making mistakes that i previously would never have made and i don't know of anything that has changed.

Very important to know is that, my workplace has never treated me badly, and has throughout this whole thing and previously always taken the stance of ""maybe you just need a refresh of training"" optimistically, but even having done so i am now going 3 weeks with continously having to discover that i have made weekly mistakes i previously would not have done.

I always knew i was slower than most with simple tasks while also paradoxically getting praise from people claiming im smart, so I don't really know what to make of this whole thing.

This lack of something has followed me a long time in life, with less serious stuff like being worse than most of my friends at video games i have played for many more hours, up to stuff like having hard times with common sense stuff, but this time around it is seriously getting bad and i don't really know what i have done differently or what i could do differently to solve this. 

Is this relateable to anyone? What could i do to solve it? There is much more to this too, but if feel like discussing all roots of my problems is better suited for dms or something, i just sorta need some help with a direction here."

1482,I became more closed and it concerns me,"

Ever since my senior year at high school started i became abnormally introverted. I was pretty opened before, i could easily talk to people, but now i've lost interest in it. I gave up on meeting new people, i just have 3-4 people with who i talk to and it's enough. I don't have the strength for small talks, or anything like that. I do it only when i need something. It just happened suddenly. Like someone snapped something in my head and made me this person. Deep down i care about what people are saying, sometimes it scares me, if i do something ridiculous: what would they think. And i'm afraid of they learning my past. Not like i made something awful, but i'm afraid of them learning that i used to make mistakes and how
 they characterize me as a person. I've built an image of an introverted person but i wasn't like that before, i liked socializing, but now i don't.

Should i worry? Or it's okay to switch to a different personality type?"

1484,I could be on the spectrum.,"I used to be really good with people as a teen as i could talk to anyone but from some trauma
.I think i lost that. Basically I was almost kicked out of military because of own faults and me and supervisor were very different. In college(after I got out of the military) I was sat down and told my a teacher that I was being awkward going up to people and trying to join them in conversation to make friends. I had to learn personal space as a child. Yet I also won friendliest in high school and fairly popular. I have a above average I.Q but I am very lazy. I hate odd numbers and will work my schedule to end tasks at a hour or half hour points. I just always thought different then others especially when it comes to my immediate family,my mother and brother think the same but I think completely different. I excel at art as well as grades and generally have a hard time getting angry or expressing negative feelings. I know you guys aren't web md. But I just wanted to know what you think. I have been tested as a child in the 90s but I wasn't diagnosed with anything. Could It have developed later? Anything would be appreciated thank you."

1487,I have symptoms of depression and anxiety and need help to better myself.,"Hey Guys I'm a guy from Switzerland and I am 21 years old. 

I want to better my mental health but I'm sure I can't do it by myself. I never talked to anyone irl about my problems that I have, cause I'm kinda afraid to tell anyone. My childhood was pretty nice and I was a normal happy and active boy. But since I was a teenager my overall mood and my happiness just went downhill.

 I got fired at my last job because I couldn't keep up with the Quality and Quantity that the other workers provided by far. I think I was just to depressed to keep up with work. When I do produtive things it is very hard for me to concentrate and I would get overwhelmed pretty fast.

 I'm searching for a job now and my overall mood and how I see the world went downhill fast since then. I lost a lot of weight. Because most of the time I dont have any appetite. I started to self-medicate with 1-3 joints per night because I can't cope with the world right now and I started having suicide thoughts more regularly. It is very hard for me to start and keep hobbies like doing sports and other healthy stuff like meditation or something like that and I would just give up.

 I think I need just a little guidance and support just start talking to a professional about this whole mess. I think I need to go to my doctor and tell him about my symptoms, so that he can send me to an counselor or something. But It is very hard for me to tell people about this. So how should I approach this?

 I know something is off with me but I can't tell anyone because I'm so ashamed of myself and I don't even know why. Sometimes I just think I deserve all of this."
1488,"Getting Motivated - blog by Th!nk Mental Health, a non-profit app run by students.","One of the most challenging battles that anyone will face in their life is getting into a strong, motivated mindset. There is very little in this world that can not be acheived with a strong, motivated mindset, and yet so few people are able to obtain it. Too often, we are left feeling laxy, discarded, uncertain about what our place in this world is. Only the most philosophical thinkers are able to manipulate their own mindset through thinking and reflection alone, the rest of us mere mortals need external inspiration or guidance. The reason I am writing this blog is to share with you some sources of inspiration which can help build that mindset that will unlock the success in life you crave and deserve.

The first source is one I recently discovered, not a novel ground-breaking technique, but simply something I'd never considered doing. Listening to Motivational Speeches. The premise sounds cheesy and I too, at first, was apprehensive. On platforms such as Spotify, you can find playlists full of motivational content (link at bottom of page). The ideas and concepts expressed in these particular tracks are phenomenal, no matter who you are and what environment you find yourself in, you can relate to the story they tell. Actively listening and processing the advice these speeches give can have a profound effect on your self-worth, the way you interact with others, your attitude towards the life you are in, the life you have had, and the life you are yet to build. 

Secondly, and this concept is one I reflect on personally, is to do with words and perceived (im)possibility. Throughout your life, you will come across people who seem to get away with anything or acheive anything they put their mind to, no matter what happens they can talk their way out of it or through it. These people, have a talent with words. The focus of this concept is that no matter what your situation, there is some collection of carefully chosen words, strings of syllables, vibrations in the air,  that can make anything possible. The knowledge that  no matter what the challenge or obstacle, there is in some future a speech or answer or response you can give which grants you access to unbounded success is freeing. There is no task or goal within the limits of science which is impossible. There is a series of choices that stand between you and the end goal, and some people have fewer choices to get through than others, but there is a path to success for every single human being on the planet, and if you take confidence in the fact that for you, anything is acheivable, the possibilities are endless.

1489,How do I deal with thoughts and emotions,"Anytime something bad happens to me the first thing my mind goes to is “I want to die”. I’m not suicidal but whenever something happens like me failing a test or failing a class (I’m in college) I lose all hope and wish I were dead, I don’t want these problems and I don’t want that to be the first thing my mind goes to. I want to go to therapy but I don’t have the time..work and college yay.. and with covid I’m not sure how that would even work. I feel like I’m being stretched to my limits, I’m so close to finishing school but realistically I’m going to fail one class I’m taking (out of two) I feel like a giant failure:/ I’m a girl (19F)  and I feel like people just think I’m being dramatic but when I think of failing I can feel myself being overcome with anxiety, it makes my stomach hurt. I’d just like suggestions of how y’all deal with these thoughts and how to get through it. Thanks!"

1491,My Train of Thought keeps getting Derailed??,"Hello, first time poster, 19F, not sure where exactly to post this as I'm super confused

For the last couple months I keep having these sort of ""ticks"" in my brain. when talking with someone and engaging in a conversation, if I'm too excited or my gears are just turning so much my thoughts get scrambled and it's like my mind gets wiped clean and I forget what on earth were talking about. It's like amnesia but not? I remember who I am and where I am, not what we were just talking about.. 

Its freaking me out, is it Parkinsons? Amnesia?"
1492,"It all started with a dog, how I am now this messed up?","Today I woke up sobbing over a dream of mine. It was a dream that almost wasn't. It felt so real that I had to text the person it was about and have them reassure me that were alive and okay, because nothing felt alright okay, nothing has for years.

 My bestie of mine attempted while I was still in recovery stage of something else that wasn't traumatic, but definitely drove me towardsr the edge emotionally. Her near death dropped me down a cliff where I was no longer sane during her period of being gone. This wasn't my first rodeo, and that's why I was so far gone, but I guess because she is my bestie of two years after a period of recovering, that when it happened it ruined everything for me. 

I had been working on recovering from my previous friends death's and some of them I had, others I was so horribly traumatized by that I can only laugh when I talk about them or break down scream crying over the amount of pain I endured due to their suicides. 

When I was in 5th grade I thought my worst trauma was having my old ""friend"", a 6 year old shih Tzu put down without notice after I was forced away from her two months would be my worst trauma. It eats me up inside and I feel horrible everyday because of that dog, she was my only friend when my mom left and after I began to unlock memories that apperently I was molested as a child. She was everything, she must of felt so abandoned by her only friend. 

I thought that would be the worst, I hoped that would be the worst. I was very wrong. I made online friends just to lose them to suicide and one even too their own mother's hands, I made real friends who I attempted to play therapist for, just to end up at the bottom of the mental tower. And now I am walking with nothing to make me believe that this will end. I want it to end. 

Please God just make it fucken end."

1494,Unexpectedly Personal Story,"I am sitting here alone having just finished a cigarette. I rushed in because it is a foggy morning again in the blue ridge mountains. The fog is beautiful but it also makes my world smaller and right now that might be a dangerous thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the wannabe writer feeling to this post. I write poetry (really shitty and really depressing) when I am sad and feel like I have no other outlet to express my emotions. And I am a very romantic and sentimental person so my writing probably I think reflects that which I know can seem annoying. I have only wrote on the internet a few times and nothing honestly that I can think of right now as substantial as this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways here you go reddit....

&amp;#x200B;

On a million days like this I have plagued my best friend Halie or if I really feel suicidal than my mom or the police. Tonight which is today now I am refusing to annoy my loved ones with my emotions. And I am putting them on display for all of you. I have actually always wanted to let my heart out to a forum and here I go I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

So there is too much back story for this post but I'll just kind of start with last year. I've always dealt with serious depression, locked up kind of depression. Last year though I don't know shit got real bad for me mentally. I am a 25 year old gay guy. My last real job ended in November 2017 when I was in a bad car accident and lost my job moved home to my mom's house and had reconstructive surgery on my face which everyone tells me nowadays they can't tell and I don't think they can but I can and I know it will affect my aging in a weird way... anyways doesn't matter lol. So I have basically been unemployed to now and last year my depression hit a new low. I had been hospitalized like three or four times prior to 2019. For whatever reason my depression just got really fucking bad. Looking back I think it was because I was stuck at my mom’s house and under her control with a severely lessening friend group. In 2019 I was hospitalized I think four or five more times (the last being in February 2020). Anyway the culmination point of all of this depression and the honestly the hardest point in my twenty five years thus far was in September 2019. I had been taking adderall or Focalin most definitely more than prescribed. I honestly can’t remember details because everything has honestly been sort of fuzzy the past 3 years especially. But I know I was on one of my adhd meds that I had been taking too much and I was drunk. Very drunk, as I was most of 2018 and 2019 because my depression got so bad. I had a suicide note already written from months or weeks prior at a point where I cared enough to write a note. That night in September. I just sort of decided “you know what I think I am done”. I had had suicide attempts in the past from light to serious. But this time I honestly didn’t even think too much about it. I just swallowed a whole 3 months worth of my propranolol, a shit ton of my 2mg Klonopin, and a whole bottle of my moms blood pressure meds. I don’t remember much else. I called my best friend Halie and she convinced me to go to the hospital even though she did not know how serious it was at the time (she did not know I had overdosed or even taken a shit ton of pills). My mom told me later that I showed up to the ER in Arlington TX and walked in and said “I need help” and then collapsed and started foaming from my mouth. I just remember waking up in a hospital with my arms and legs restrained and a tube down my throat (which later I found out I was on life-support).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been through a lot of shit in my 25 years and I probably will go through a hell of a lot more but I just feel like I know that this was the singular most saddening moment of my life. Being there restrained with a tube down my throat breathing for me and preventing me from speaking. And seeing my Mom my Dad my brother all standing there above me crying just staring at me. It was like every dark moment in my life, every tear, every cut on my arm as a teenager, every poem written in darkness, every bad mistake and every bad emotion that I had accumulated in my life was there laid out with no where to hide, in front of the people I love the most and the most I never wished to have seen that. It was as if I was completely naked (I had a hospital gown). I couldn’t turn over and shove my face in the pillow, I could not turn away from the teary faces of my hovering family. I could not chug a beer or shot. I could not cover my body in blankets. I could not take a pill. I could not call a friend. I could not think about it later when I was stronger. I could not watch a Netflix show. I could not talk to a boy. I could not put on makeup. I could not write. I COULD NOT! The only thing I could do is lay there completely and truly exposed. Every secret shown. Every regret shown. Every dark sad thing that I curled up to all my life and whispered to in the night was shown. And Everyone (except Halie was not there) I love was there watching it. Watching me. Watching all of me.

&amp;#x200B;

The only dignity and since of escape I still held was the shutting of my eyelids. Which I could barley do. Because how could I look away when they saw the hidden parts of myself. That is my FAMILY! And what they are watching is the pure evil that I have hid from the world and from myself.

&amp;#x200B;

What I did was cry. I screamed. I reeled. I wet those sheets with my eyes. For the first real time in my life, for better or worse my tears mixed with those of my family and loved ones and they became one. For a while there was an understanding. I could not speak and they hardly spoke as well. The communication was real and unwanted and unescapable and raw. To this day I know it was probably relieving and some may say was healthy but I still feel bad having exposed the ones I love to the darkness that carries me.

&amp;#x200B;

SOOOOOOOOO I was totally making a post about my current issues and was just gonna do a brief intro to me. I guess that needed coming out. I really was not planning on ever writing this and have honestly sort of tried not to think about it too much. But now that I reflect on this post I think I had been needing to express my emotions and thoughts surrounding that day.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that day last September, so much has changed because of it. Honestly I feel like most of the changes/transformation/wisdom has been pretty subconscious. I am not at a perfect place in my life AT ALL!!! But I am continually better and better than that September day. I take a shit ton of steps back and honestly sometimes get lost and feel suicidal still but for whatever reason (I said most of the changes seem subconscious) I can always look back to last September and think “Wow I do have something incredible to be proud for”"
1495,"UK, where can I go for immediate help? I'm just so done and fed up of myself. I just want someone to listen to me asking for help.","I am 25F from the UK. I'm currently under the CMHT who have been offering me support over the phone during covid. 

Putting it bluntly I have ADHD but the system is shit and I don't feel like I'm getting much help besides CBT, which is amazing but just not enough on its own. 

I honestly am so sick of myself and sick of feeling so miserable. I just tried calling the CMHT but it's voicemail. I'm too anxious and feel like too much of a bother to leave a message. I feel like too much of a bother to ask for help. I want to ask them for some medication or something just to help me take the edge off so I can work on the CBT and stuff. I need help but I don't know what to do. I just want to die right now, I feel like such a burden to everyone because all I ever do is mess things up. ADHD makes me snappy, makes my impulsiveness bad and I forget things or misunderstand so it looks like I don't care. I just want to be normal and happy. I'm sick of being so upset. 

I don't want to call a fucking helpline, they are useless. I don't want someone to tell me nice things, I want help, I'm so done. I just want help but it seems so impossible to get."
1496,I briefly started stalking my ex yesterday,"Not sure what to take away from this.  I'm really angry at myself and also very scared.

I think I know what made me pull of my normal route to drive through her neighborhood.  I couldn't see her car in the driveway from the main road like usual.  Nine times out of ten I avoid even driving on THAT road and have never before driven down her street.  I think I may secretly want to see her gone or two cars parked there so I can confirm to myself that it doesn't make sense to keep waiting for her to come back.  It's been three months.  I'm so ashamed of myself."
1497,I’m not ok.,"My mental health is not good.  My work hours am have been insane, so have my wife’s.  I’m safety and HR so all the Coronavirus work issues come to me.  I don’t feel like I’m the same person I was 2 years ago.  I feel thin, like I’m barely holding on.  On top of that a major hurricane is about to hit where I live have this feeling of dread that it’s going to be really bad.  I put in for vacation around Thanksgiving I just don’t know how I’ll make it till then.  I’m not going to hurt myself I jut feel like I could snap at any given second.  This year is just too much, no more."
1498,"The feeling of shouting, but not voices","Lately the past few weeks I've occasionally had this feeling in my head, that felt similar to when people are yelling or when you're in a very loud place. Hut I'm not hearing any voices, I've tried searching but I only get examples of people with schizophrenia *actually* hearing screaming voices.

It just appears at random, when I'm sitting in class, when I'm reading a book, or when I'm just relaxing. As I said there are no actual voices. But it the the strange pressing feeling that you get when people are shouting.
Sort of the second half of the shout.

Do any of you wise people know what it can be, or methods to try and get rid of it? It's like a headache but different"
1499,"Need help, suggestions, anything at all","Me and my girlfriend for about a month broke up today. Doesnt seem like much but we were bestfriends for over 2 years. We talked everyday and shared everything. I never thought what I would do without her because that thought never crossed my mind as she was always there whenever I needed help and vice versa. But now I don't think we will talk ever again. I'm very lost. I tried texting a few friends but they dont understand how much it hurts platonically, they just laugh it off and tell me they've had worse relationships which lasted for more than a month. I used to have self harming tendencies and even tried to end it more than once. She always talked me out of it and gave me reasons to hold on. But I'm unsure of what I'll do now. I need help. Suggestions. Anything at all. Please."
1500,"Bogged down, demotivated, and only recently have gained a 'serious' goal how do I move forward?","I (21 old male) have spent the last what's felt like 5 years in therapy with varying medications fighting a back and forth battle with depression, anxiety, self-loathing, self-doubt, and uncertainty about what I even enjoy about living let alone what I intend to strive for. And for the sake of situational clarity, my family and friends that are aware of my issues in this regard have been trying to help in every way I believe they can muster and I love them dearly for it. I have had the same therapist for about 3 maybe 4 years now I think, my sense of time is virtually nonexistent at this point, has recently spitballed a possible goal based on why the only pastime that's stuck around for this was tabletop gaming and the time spent having mutually enjoyable times with the people I play with and it was effectively what seems to be the only thing I still enjoy is helping make other people happy.

Whilst I have a general idea of where to start with that process I fear I'll grow demotivated and gradually lose hope in what feels like my last possible resort for fixing my internal issues short of medicating myself to be content with just breathing and I want to know if anyone here has had a similar struggle that I could take some foreknowledge of and use it to ensure that this path I may go down doesn't loop around back to where I started. Any bit of experience helps even if it's as small as a single concentrated event could help me through this. Thanks in advance for anyone who answers this."
1501,Auto pilot towards abyss,"
I have reached a point where all my senses are numb. Over the past ten years I always had something to look forward to... Finishing education, finding a job, getting promoted, getting married.. Now I have done all of those and have reached a point where I hate my job, don't have the skills to find a new job, stuck in a stale marriage with no emotional connect , don't have time/money to upskill... My days are blending into one big blob of nothingness... Reached a point where doing basic stuff on the job is taking a huge mental effort for eg. Writing a piece of code which I have already designed but typing it out seems too much work. It seems like I am on auto pilot and heading towards abyss.. how do I snap out of it? All the efforts of past ten years have led me to this point, this leads me to the feeling that what is the point in trying to improve my situation; it may just lead to more disappointments. So much so that at times I feel the auto pilot mode will have better outcomes than making a effort"
1502,I [M17] feel like I'm dying,"Over the summer, I had the best time of my life.  I made tons of new friends, I picked up new hobbies, and I had a really great outlook on life.  Now, I'm back to school and I feel the worst I've ever felt.  I can't focus.  I can't relax.  I have so much work and no time to be happy.  Lately, I've been having panic attacks and feeling  really intense 'over-stimulation.'  When I feel 'over-stimulated,' it's usually due to bright lights, loud sounds, too many sounds at once, and unexpected touches.  I get on edge.  I want to put my hands over my ears and cur into a ball.  Last night I felt it worse than ever.  I'm so stressed out right now.  I have so much schoolwork and I'm falling behind.   I don't feel happy anymore.  It just feels like I have three million things going on.  My best friend is addicted to opiods, I'm quitting nicotine, my mom's highschool best friend passed away, I don't have time to skateboard or take photos, and nothing seems to be working out for me.

My mom wants me to go back to therapy, but my first therapist was borderline emotionally abusive and used to tell me that everything that happened to me was my fault.  My second therapist just made me uncomfortable.

I really don't know what to do anymore.  Everything s just too much and I can't meet anyone's expectations.  I'm at my lowest right now.  I don't know what to do."
1503,I need some advice,"So, ok. I’m a minor, and I still live with my parents and all like a normal teenager right? However, I think my family is extremely toxic. Like, very mentally abusive, (no one has ever touched me though or brought me harm, but it’s still extremely difficult to live with). (I’m not going to state specifics right now, because it’s very hard for me to talk about &amp; plus I value my privacy). For one thing, for as long as I can remember my mental health has always been god-awful. I attempted suicide for the second time only two years ago. I have reached out to my sister about my mental health, and she honestly completely disregarded it like it’s nothing. I have also reached out to my mom about it, and she played it off as me “overreacting”. Isn’t that a extremely toxic behavior? I don’t know. But, my mental health has gotten so bad, I’m having suicidal thoughts everyday now with a voice in my head saying “I wanna fucking kill myself”. I feel trapped, I feel like I don’t matter to anyone, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve kinda of narrowed it down to me having only two options. Either I get a job and save up enough money to support myself, cut ties when I move out, and start seeing a therapist/getting help for myself. (My mom has guilt-tripped me into not doing the second option before). Or I gather evidence and report my parents to CPS. What should I do?"
1504,Mental Health during an online semester,"Like many others, my college opted for an an online semester because of the pandemic. Before the pandemic I have had some minor mental health issues, but recently these issues have become more of a problem and are affecting my work/grades. Pretty much everyday or every other day recently, I have been experiencing hours of intense sadness. It rarely lasts all day, but afterwords I can’t focus on anything or feel motivated. I also keep feeling really sad and lonely while doing class work, which makes me want to do it even less. I don’t know what to do, has anyone else dealt with something similar?"
1505,should i file for disability?,"im applying for jobs and it wants me to disclose psychiatric disorders as a disability and man, do i have some disorders. im on 7 psych meds and my mental health is debilitating always. i'm a caregiver now, and my mom set me up for another interview for a different facility because i don't get enough hours and dont make enough. i should not be taking care of someone during a manic episode, and i can barely function during a depressive episode. if i disclose my disorders, i risk not being hired (even if its illegal to discriminate) and if i dont disclose them, i dont have the opportunity to receive accomodations. i could file for disability because i definitely am applicable but dont know how i feel about that. i mentioned it to my mom and she called me pitiful and said i should live off someone else instead of her. she is a narcissist and refuses help. thoughts?"
1506,Does anyone just freak out over little things?,"I don’t know what it is, but sometimes I absolutely lose it over mildly annoying but seemingly insignificant things. Like someone making a repetitive noise or hearing someone talking or the TV through the walls. Sometimes just the sound of my sister’s voice makes me see red, but especially when she whistles. My mom is obsessed with politics and she’s always watching weird conspiracy shit at full volume, and I hear it through the walls and I can’t even hear specifically what’s being said but it drives me crazy. 

Sometimes I’ll shake violently or break down crying, sometimes I even get violent towards myself or objects around me (never other people). I never freak out in front of others, only by myself in my room. I try to distract myself or stop thinking about whatever it is that’s driving me crazy but I become like hyper focused on it and can’t concentrate on anything else. The best thing Ive found to get my mind off of it is to listen to loud music with earbuds, but sometimes that doesn’t even work.

I feel like I’m losing my mind and I also slightly feel like a bitch for even reacting so dramatically over little things. Nobody even knows that I react this way; I’ve never told anyone and like I said, I never freak out in front of anyone.

Does anyone else have a similar problem or know what could be up?"
1507,"Inner dialogue, multiple ""voices"" - is this normal?","I've had an internal ""dialogue"" for a long time. Not just a monologue but multiple ""voices"", sometimes with different accent and style. Sometimes it feels like they are seperate to me - for example when I was very depressed, I would ""hear"" one giving me instructions like ""come on, get up! Eat some food!""

I thought everyone had this! But now I'm reading that maybe not? Any ideas, how common is it to experience this?

I dont feel negative about them, always felt there was a good reason - like what I described above, they were harsh but they were making sure I didnt waste away, which is fair enough and I'm grateful for it!

I've been told I'm ""contradictory"" and felt like it too, because these thoughts are opposite sometimes - but if it's not the same as a normal inner monologue then maybe this all makes a lot more sense?

Thanks for taking the time to read and reply!"
1508,I just got ripped to shreds on Reddit and now I’m having a mental health crisis,"Hi everybody, 

I’m not really the biggest fan of Reddit right now, I’ve realized I’ve made a mistake. I posted to the AITA thread, and I genuinely regret it. I already deleted the post but then I realized that the post might stay up, and even though my identity is anonymous I’m so scared that people will think I’m a terrible person for what I did. Long story short I posted to the AITA thread, and I don’t really want to talk about what I posted, but the general consensus was that I was the asshole. I feel absolutely terrible because I genuinely was not trying to be an asshole to the person I was writing about. I have several mental health issues and posting that and people calling me an asshole really set me off. I’m now in the middle of work, tears in my eyes, and generally feeling like I want to die. My boyfriend has already told me that he was not offended by my words, so I’m not really sure why I’m having a problem here. With my depression, anxiety, autism, and adhd, it is really hard for me to let things go. I have virtually no coping skills AT ALL and I’m so scared of offending people. It consumes me on a daily basis. When I talk to my friends, family, customers at my job, etc, I always am afraid that something I say will offend them. Going on the AITA form and being called an asshole was really the biggest trigger for me. At the same time though I’m glad I went on the thread and people called me out for my behavior. It made me open my eyes in a unique way. All I want to do is stop being so scared of offending people, and to love myself the way I am. Maybe Reddit isn’t the place to find self love. I don’t know"
1509,Military dorm life alone.,I stay in my room all day and basically never leave unless for class. People who I thought where my friends at basic don’t talk to me and I’m left alone basically all day. It’s driving me crazy and I feel alone. People back home don’t talk to me either. Idk if it has to do with them jobs and classes but even at night I don’t get texts or texts back. The one person I talk to day to day is my best friend and she’s probably the one thing keeping me sane but even then it’s only 30-45 minutes a day.
1510,How to help my son?,"My oldest son is 14. He’s always been an underachiever (mostly Cs and Ds in school), but over the past 3 years he has gotten quite a bit worse. This year, I think he’s only turned in a couple of assignments total, for all of his classes combined. He is doing remote learning due to COVID, and will watch YouTube all day while skipping his classes. He attempts to be “half sneaky” about it, by using Chrome incognito, or deleting browser history... even though I’ve told him many times it is pretty obvious what he’s doing.

3 years ago we had a few issues where he sexually abused his younger brother. He was in therapy for around a year, but all we’ve seen since then is a decline in behavior, so we stopped. He has never shown any kind of remorse for what he did. He is incredibly good at convincing everyone there is nothing wrong, including several therapists.

He does not care whatsoever about any consequences for anything. He will tell an obvious lie for no reason at all, get caught, and shrug it off.

He is not withdrawn at all. He will walk around the house joking and laughing immediately after I attempt a serious 1 on 1 convo.

He is never excited or motivated by anything. Doesn’t even care that he’s currently not allowed talking to his girlfriend.

He is extremely careless with everything he touches, and objects will often end up broken on accident, or he will intentionally destroy them. He is also careless with animals (holding them wrong, or throwing them down), but I wouldn’t say he intentionally hurts them.

I’m starting to worry he is heading more and more to becoming a sociopath, despite anything his mom and I do. Is there any way we can intervene to get his life back on track?"
1511,My mom told me that I look like I wanted to get raped 😳,"My parents have always been mean about my appearance. Either I look homeless or I look like a prostitute. There is nothing in between. I aldready have a really low self esteem and my self confidence never existed in the first place. Recently in the last 6 months, I lost about 30 pounds due to stress, removal of medicine and exercise. I also lost weight because I gained so much weight when I was hospitalized for 7 months and when i came back home, I became active and started losing it. 

Since then my dad looks at me with disgust and my mom constantly keeps telling me that I will never be respected in society and college with the way I look and about how I will be severely bullied. My dad was holding a hot compresser the other day for his back pain, and he looked at me with utter disgust in his face and squeezed the compresser until all the gel bursted out while telling me that I was so ugly to even look at. The other day I wore some lipstick and my mom was like what will people think of you and what will people think about our family and besides who are you trying to impress. You aren't a model so stop trying so hard to fit in when you are literally 5'4. And the day we kick you  out of the house and you get raped is the day you will come running and crying back to us and we wont be there for you at the time since, we have had enough of you ruining our lives. On the other hand, if I put in no effort my parents will scream about how i'm acting like i'm from a family that has no money. Again my mom will be like what will people think ? People will look at you and they will think that we don't buy you clothes and that we are poor. 

I have never been complimented on the way I look by my parents. I remember once on my birthday when my dad told me that I looked like a slut, I started crying about how other parents compliment their kids and how I had never recieved any compliments from you guys. After that, my dad was like no, you look beautiful but it's still bad. That was the only time I was complimented. I don't care about them complimenting me. I don't want them to tell me I'm beautiful. I just wish they didn't talk about my appearance in a negative way every single day. I try to rush out of the house when i'm going out coz I know I look good and I know that my parent's comments will make day worse.the minute I step out of my room, I get criticized for the way I look with comments like you look like you have a disability, you walk like you have polio, people are only nice to you because they have realized that you're sick without even us telling them since it's evident by the way you look etc .they constantly keep telling me to come out of my room and talk to them but they can't seem to understand that I don't come out of my room because I don't want to end up getting bullied by my own parents agian. And the comments they make have no humour induced in them, it's them being blatantly serious and honest about my appearance. This kind of thing was never a problem with my brother. Yes he was quite fat when he was a kid, but my parents never bullied him or anything. Everyone would just make fun of his weight in a very light hearted manner like nothing was supposed to be taken seriously. Everyone would keep talking about how cute, chubby and squishy he was. Meanwhile, I was the opposite. I was dark skinned and skinny asf. And people used to ask me and my mom if I was adopted since I look so dark compared to the rest of my family. Or they would just be like you might think that you look good but u actually don't. You look like a kid from a poor nation because of your malnutrition. I know these are first world problems and it does seem like I'm whining about something so little when there are much worse things going on. But they are still problems and I do wanna talk so yeh lol

Nobody's compliments seem to matter or are even worth considering when your own parents who gave birth to you, raised you and watched you grow think you look ugly. This is not me hating my parents. I love them to death even though I don't show it. Yes, what they say hurts , but at the end of the day it's just me venting. I still love my parents and they are the only people who are there for me when no one else is despite how mean they can be but I still felt like ranting about this aspect lol"
1512,I didn't know where else to share this. I believe this needs to be seen.,"[https://youtu.be/4IokFWtWEL0](https://youtu.be/4IokFWtWEL0?list=WL)

Two minutes Reuter's video: hundreds of thousands of men, women and children with mental health conditions are living chained up in roughly 60 countries, the Human Rights Watch has said."
1513,"Ran away from home. Mom called me telling me I'm the ""problem""","I was working in my home city for a few weeks and under my therapists advice, I told my family my feelings and emotions aren't so good and that they should not talk so aggressively. They just responded with ""we're not doing anything'

After being forced to go on a shopping trip instead of seeing my friend, they started arguing in the car due to getting lost and blaming me that I caused it and it's my fault for not being so nice. They just blamed me for everything, I just put on my headphones and ignored them

Got home, trashed my room out of anger, packed my things and left. They kept calling me and I ignored their calls

My mom sends a text saying it's urgent so I pick up. I ask what's the problem and she responded with ""you're the problem"" so I hung up

While I'm not perfect, I don't think I'm at fault here. I never wanted to do anything with my family, I have no interest in buying things, I just want a stable environment and be able to see my friends when I'm depressed"
1514,I feel like I have a disease that prevents me from forming habits or discipline,"I genuinely have been in a rut for the last two-three years since I went to college. I habitually am absent from class, miss homework assignments, sleep in too late, fall asleep to late, can’t motivate to exercise etc. these things came naturally to me for my whole life and now it feels like I’m going to war when I get out of bed to do them. Even little things like taking a shower or brushing my teeth seem like things that I am constantly battling myself to do. I thought it was a short phase, but two years later my gpa has halved, my parents have tried to help and push me but I’m just stuck. I’ve lost all aspirations, my friends have moved and I’ve been unwilling to make the effort to find new ones. And no matter how many books I read, podcasts I listen to, and bootstraps I try to pull myself up by, I am stuck in tar and can’t build discipline. I’m not suicidal or anything like that. I’m just prone to developing absolutely no healthy habits, no matter how much I want to and how disgusted with my own behavior I am. I’ve wondered if maybe antidepressants are necessary or therapy but I’m not sure if I am at that point.

Tl;dr- years of undisciplined behavior, can’t do everyday tasks without large amounts of energy"
1515,Intrusive thoughts,"Hi! I am a 18 year old Female who recently graduated highschool and I am now doing online college. I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder for about a year now, and I have been on an SSRI for a while now (a pretty high dosage). Keep in mind that my therapist is on maternity leave and I have been able to manage my anxiety by myself for a bit now. 

For a while now I have been having intrusive thoughts and the only way for me to suppress them is by “knocking on wood”. Many times a day a random thought like “your parents will die today” pops into my head and if i dont tap my head twice or tap wood twice I feel panicked. And i also only can tap it twice, if i accidently do 3 i have to do it over again. 

I also spaced out in class today and had a vision that I was harming myself. I was so scared I lost my breath when I realized it wasnt real. It felt so real. 

Im scared, I dont know how to bring this up to anyone because I sound crazy. What if i am just superstitious and knocking on wood is just a habit? And I know I am not crazy but I feel like my parents or anyone else would overreact and want to take drastic measures. 

Any advice for what I should do? Also any techniques to suppress these thoughts and to stop myself from spacing out like that? Thank you!"
1516,I feel like I just want to give up [F23],"I am a recent college graduate and I was looking forward to moving abroad for my job and new life in July. I took a temporary job I hated to make money before leaving and live at home which I don’t particularly enjoy. Now it is October and I am so stressed over the uncertainty of my future.

My life seems like a cycle everyday that I hate, but it’s too hard to change because every month my job tells me “it’s looking like next month”. I’ve spent over $1,000 in paperwork to be able to leave with the travel ban but I still have nothing. 

My job is in an office and I am 100% alone for hours and just sit in my own thoughts which seem to get worse each passing day. Being extremely extroverted too its hard because I spend almost all my time everyday alone with only some interactions with family and friends. My job is good money, but it seems not worth the pay but it’s hard to find another job because I don’t know how long I can commit plus with Covid-19 less places are hiring.

I haven’t seen my boyfriend due to the travel ban since December. His country is open and I see him living a full life everyday and it makes my feel so pathetic and feel like I’m wasting the best years of my life just sitting in misery. I know it shouldn’t make me sad he is living a happy life now, but it’s hard because I was moving where he is now so it makes it harder seeing what I’m missing out on.

I reached out to therapists the past few days and I know for myself only in person therapy I would be able to express myself properly, but nowhere near me is offering it.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore, I keep telling myself all this suffering will be worth it once I can start my new life. But I am reaching a point where I don’t know if I can take it any longer and I don’t know what to do. There is no one to blame for all this and every day my life seems to just get harder to keep going. I just don’t know what to do at this point, and I don’t know where to reach out to have anything get better."
1517,THIS MESSAGE IS FOR MEN,"GET OFF OF HERE, YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CANNOT BE DAMAGED BECAUSE YOU CANT FEEL EMOTION AND YOUR LIVES ARE EASY US WOMEN NEED TO BE ON HERE, YOU DONT! AND FOR THE WOMEN THAT FEEL BAD FOR MEN, THEY ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ATTENTION AND YOU ARE UNEDUCATED MEN CANT FEEL PAIN, STOP FEELING BAD FOR THEM THEY JUST WANT YOUR PITTY, men are awful"
1518,I did badly for a test and wanted to kms,"I think I have a severe fear of failure or something, because the moment I screw up on a test (which I actually studied for and thought I was going to do well in), I get really upset and maybe almost depressed. I felt so stunned when I realised I did a lot worse than expected and literally could not focus on anything for the rest of the day because my mood was so low. I was actually contemplating suicide at that point because I don't know why I haven't been doing well in school lately, and I feel like I'm such a failure. But after that moment has passed and I've accepted my terrible grade, I realised how silly it is to consider suicide over something like that.

Has anyone else ever felt this and could someone give me some advice? Would appreciate just anyone to talk to because I don't have many friends I can confide in about things like this (they can be pretty insensitive about it if they themselves did well on the test)."
1519,Today I had a panic attack at work and I didn’t let it stop me (22M),"So, to make it short: we had to unload a container full of really heavy boxes pretty much by hand. I suddenly had a panic attack because of the hight and fear of a box falling on top of me. I went back to the resting area, drank a glass of water, washed my face and went back to work. I plowed through the fear and kept stacking the boxes until it was over, slightly hyperventilating in every small break I could get. Right now I’m more relaxed and feeling pretty good with myself. I cried a little."
1520,Books for letting go/staying present?,"Hey guys, anxiety makes me think about things ALL THE TIME.  Something that might not even be a confrontation to others will stick with me and bother me and just keep lingering in my mind for hours/days.  

I'm not looking for support, I try to meditate and do yoga regularly and see a therapist, I'm just looking for books that help you realize shit like that DOES NOT MATTER! 

Any suggestion is greatly appreciated :) thanks"
1521,Why would a sister still talk to someone on social media who puts you in possible danger? Does she not believe me or not care?,"It really bothers me 😞I have a complicated past and this person makes me unsafe. Long story short this girls sister is best friends with a man who hired private investigators to chase and stalk me when I was like 18. It’s just that this man is crazy and evil and I’m scared of him. He has so much money that he paid people to do criminal stuff. I almost got into a serious car accident also cause the car was following me and purposely trying to scare me. He got away with a murder attempt with his daughter. He thought I was hiding his daughter who ran away from him. He will still harass me when he gets the chance because I was friends with his daughters who didn’t talk to him. I don’t trust this person and my sister still responds to this person as much as I asked her to stop. It makes me feel like my sister doesn’t care and doesn’t trust me about anything. It hurts so much. Why does she lie to me and do this? She said that she blocked her and this girl commented on her Facebook and everything. 

This person on social media possibly stalks to give info to someone who uses to put me in dangerous situations... after 5 years this person has messaged all of my brothers and sisters to ask about me. I asked my sister over and over to keep me out of her social media now, to not tell this person where I live, and I started backing away from my sister now because of this. My sister posted pictures of me still on her social media and she said that she blocked this person but actually didn’t. I had to get into a fight with her to get her to stop and now she did finally 

This is awful of me but I got a secret account cause I don’t trust my sister and she lied. This year has been such a reality check. My heart really broke this year in so many ways and don’t feel like I have any family anymore. It’s just that there’s no respect for anything. It’s really hard when I’m so angry with my family and at the same time love them and have to live with them &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; take care of them. I don’t understand why my family does what they do. So much went down from 2019-2020. I guess this is why I’m so messed up and will never heal.

Am I overreacting? Is it wrong that I want to stay away from these people as much as I can? 

I basically just have more boundaries now but you know it really hurts still :( I thought I was so close and I realized how dysfunctional my family will always be and that I probably will end up being really isolated from my family. Just makes me want to die more.

I wish that I could be free and safe from so much but that’ll never happen."
1522,a person I know seems to have completely forgetten about a mutual friend of ours,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this. 

I need some advice but this is going to take some explaining: a while ago a friend of mine (let's call them B) introduced me to a friend of theirs (who I'm going to refer to as R).

 in the past year me and R have been getting a lot closer and around two months ago they revealed to me that they have a crush on B, R then proceeded to confess to B but was rejected, this clearly caused them a lot of pain and they absolutely did not get over B since this happened.

 Now, this is where the part I don't really understand starts: me and R talk almost daily and up until last week they would talk about B all the time, telling me when they had conversations about something important or if B had showed them any form of affection that made them happy somehow. Today, while I was on a discord call with R, I casually mentioned B and they told me that they had no idea of who I was talking about. I've asked R  multiple times if they really did not remember and I'm 100% sure that this isn't a joke and after I insisted a bit they started acting really defensive and out of character. I wasn't able to make them remember and now I don't know what to do, I want to help but I'm afraid that it might be none of my business and that if I try to I'm gonna end up hurting R. What should I do?"
1523,Getting diagnosed too quickly?,"My friend of about 5 years has recently been coping with stress by claiming to have mental illnesses. This wouldn’t be too big of an issue if he wasn’t diminishing diagnoses to fit his tendencies. For example, he’s said he thinks he has aspergers, anxiety, adhd, ocd, bpd, bipolar disorder and ptsd— all over a couple of months. I don’t doubt that he struggles sometimes, but he seems to not understand the weight of a diagnosis.

I’ve warned him about the negatives of self-diagnosis and told him that if he was really concerned he should see a therapist or some other mental health professional. I figured this would lead to him being able to talk about his issues and realize that not being able to sleep one night doesn’t mean you had a panic attack, or remembering something embarrassing you did a year ago isn’t ptsd. They’re just typical parts of being human that we can learn cope with.

And I guess we both got what he wanted. He went through his university to see a therapist.... who diagnosed him within the FIRST appointment with ocd and Gad. I’m worried about the self-fulfilling prophecy side of getting a diagnosis too soon and how that would affect him.

Am I right to be concerned? Am I gate-keeping or being too harsh? I’m more than happy to explain further if needed, I’m just really worried about him.

tldr: My friend is a serial self-diagnoser and when he went to a therapist, he got diagnosed on the first appointment"
1524,yoooooo! okay peeps on here! i just joined but i used this app to help w self harm,"it’s called “i am sober” it helped for support through my self harm times (and even still now) and it tracks how clean i am and gives me daily motivation/pledges and there’s this totally anonymous community section where you can post whatever you wanna say/vent and people can react/respond and you can respond/react to them! (i love the app sm and all the people and they’re very judgment free+you can just sign up for the self harm sobering part and just share w kind strangers even if you don’t SH) this isn’t an ad i’m a real person it helped me and if it can help anyone else i’m happy to share! oh and it’s not for self harm specifically it’s for substance abuse too, you just have to select “self harm” on the list when you make your account and you can sign up to sober up from multiple things"
1525,"Memory loss, hard to focus on trivial things","Hi, i am a 21 year old man, just finished my course and have been now looking for a job for over a month...

I am constantly trying to find new things to improve myself, i workout everyday, i eat well, i try to sleep well, i always get atleast 8 hours of sleep every night and still i wake up feeling like crap most days. I wake up with soft but annoying belly pain almost everyday(probably telling me something is up) and also not feeling very well rested...

When i'm watching a movie it's very hard for me to get the details, i lose all the important parts of the storie everytime and somebody has to explain it to me later, even though i was watching the same as them... Recently my memory has also been the worst, i forget about a lot of things i've just done, or things that i just said or that people told me!

I get anxious a lot of times when around other people, sometimes even with people i'm very close with... Its also hard for me to focus on conversations.

I've started meditating to try to cope with the stress, what else do you think i should do? And what do you think this can be? Anxiety? Too much stress?"
1526,I think my lack of stress is why my warts went away after I graduated.,"I have had warts on my hands my entire life. I had over a dozen all throughout high school and college. They always got worse the more stressed I got. I’ve always been really self conscious about them. They aren’t my fault, but I still got bullied for them occasionally.

All but 2 have gone away since I graduated in May, and those 2 are also healing. I might be an unemployed loser, but hell if it isn’t nice not being in school anymore."
1527,"Can't function with thoughts, too much going on","I'm smart and educated but I deal with horrible anxiety and depression. I seem to constantly have thoughts about ideas I want to pursue, things I want to try, knowing I need to get better, and knowing that I don't function now and never really have. I have such a hard time with work especially, because at least 5 - 10 times a day I experience existential crises like:

&amp;#x200B;

""what is the point?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""We're all just ants, going about out lousy lives""

""Why is everything so terrible?""

""Can't anyone do something?""

""How will i survive?"" or ""Why is it so hard just to be alive (and stay that way)?""

""I won't have any impact on anyone""

 or worse 

""All I've done is impact people negatively""

&amp;#x200B;

I work for my family and live with my family and i have a hard time with people. I don't get along with most people, though I try to be nice, I seem to rub everyone the wrong way. I think of outcomes for everything and tend to find the really bad outcomes and walk away. I've been in psychological pain for as long as I remember and I have moments where im really happy, just before I crash back into earth and feel worthless again. I can't even do things that seem like they'd be enjoyable. Recently got a music maker to try to make songs, but even now, in a good mood asking for help I think:

 ""Whats the point"",

&amp;#x200B;

 ""its going to be shit"", 

&amp;#x200B;

""its going to be terrible"", 

&amp;#x200B;

""someone's already thought of it""

&amp;#x200B;

Something always rings in my brain that has hurt me a lot, and I don't suppose it was intended when it was said but when I was young I was told ""If its too good to be true, it is"" and ""There will always be someone better than you"". If those are the cases, why the hell should I do anything? or believe anyone? I just honestly, I'm so sad, I'm a failure, a loser, mentally ill, a felon, a bad person, and with all this pain I just go back to ""If all I'm due is misery for myself and others isn't it a moral obligation to remove myself?"" I feel like all I do is waste peoples time and money. I hadn't always been this way, I used to think I was SUPER smart and intelligent and would change the world, and did really well. But that arrogance and disconcern for others led me to a really bad place. I seriously can't function, as you could probably tell by the fact I'm writing this while im ""working""."
1528,Started new job last night and loved it!,"Yesterday I started a new job at a huge plant that is bigger than my hometown, and despite having two panic attacks the night before, and one on the drive there, I showed up, worked the whole time, and loved it. Normally in situations like this I have a tendency to quit if I feel overwhelmed, but everyone there was kind and welcoming and it was overall a great experience and huge relief!"
1529,LORAZEPAM,Hi i have taken Lorazepam 0.5mg for 12 days. Can i leave it cold turkey or what's the right way of leaving it? Thanks
1530,Do I have a personality disorder?,"**A little background**: I'm a male in my 30s. My parents have always been good to me. I have no real complaints. I think my dad might be a bit neurotic, but he's had a good career and treated me well; my mom is a bit aloof, but always tells me she loves me and never done anything to me that stands out.

**Relationships**: I've never been good with friends, but I've had them. The problem is I inevitably tire of friends and find ways to completely sabotage our friendships. I'm not talking just ghosting, but plotting against them in order to make their lives worse, subtly manipulating them into doing bad things I'd never have the guts to do, etc. All signs would point to me being a sociopath, but I actually ***DO*** eventually feel guilt over these things. Not while I'm doing them, but I absolutely do feel guilt; in times, I feel completely racked with guilt and attempt reconnecting with the folks I've wronged. 

Sometimes it works, sometimes it's a disaster because I was so bad to these people. I've always felt like people are judging me or talking behind my back. Maybe it's because I'm doing those things in my own head?  But I do have some stable relationships. I have a family and have been married for quite a while--no issues there. 

I've been to therapy, etc. and have never really been able to figure out what exactly is wrong with me. Pretty much everyone I've left in my wake thinks I'm an insane soulless freak, but I don't feel like that is who I really am. I just can't figure out how or why I have this impulse or what I would even call it. Do I just get bored with people too easily?

Admittedly, I feel the impulse has somewhat gone away in recent years. I haven't made many friends and the friends I do have only check in with me once in a while. Perhaps I'm just an introvert and do anything I can to protect my status? But I do enjoy human company. Just not a lot...

I'm not looking for ways to become insanely popular and rekindle old friendships. I just need to figure out why the hell I'm so broken."
1531,My sense of time is disorented,"Has anybody else experienced times when time accelerates around you. Everything is a blur and when you come out of it, you know things happen but the memory is a mess. Like, say I’m walking down the hall, all of a sudden everything is blurry and I’m at the end of the hall immediately. I can remember walking down the hall, but the memory is blurred and i can’t accurately remember what happened. Sorry for the lack of detail, this is really weird to me."
1532,cool therapy podcast!,"It's called ""Panic Attacking"". Two comedians talk out what gave them anxiety that week while a licensed therapist listens and gives advice. One has general anxiety disorder and the other has a social anxiety disorder. Really cool to hear them talk discuss things that I only thought made me anxious and make light of it and the therapist's advice is really helpful. I listen on Soundcloud but its available all over i think

1534,Wife suffering from Depression / Post Partpatum Depression when to go on Anti-Depressants?,"My wife and I have two kids 3.5yo and 12mnth old. The last few months she has been struggling with the burden of being a stay at home mom. She gets a lot of support from me and has acknowledged that she is struggling more than a normal mother. Beyond taking care of the kids she is not wanting to cook, clean, so resorts to ordering take out and leaving the cleaning to me. She has said she forces her self to take a shower each day but that is a struggle energy-wise.

I have suspected some Postpartum Depression for the last 6 months but it has gotten worse the last couple of months. I haven't put a label on it with her as I didn't want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have just tried to be supportive and helpful.

Last night she was talking to me about what she is feeling and she described it as feeling depressed. She was saying she didn't know what else to do to make her feel better. She also said she was scared of antidepressants. She is a big fan of natural healthy living. She does want to be on antidepressants and have the cycle of increasing tolerance and increasing dose.

I don't know if I should be encouraging her to take anitdepressants or encouraging her to stay the course, and things will improve.

Other relevant background information:

* Our kids are going to be going to a home daycare two days a week starting today.
* We are meant to be moving to NZ (my home) in January. She lived there for 5 years, but we have lived in Canada for the last 7 years (her home)
* We haven't been able to book our flights yet because of pet transport. Hoping to have a date that our dogs will be able to travel in November then we can book our flights. The uncertainty isn't helping the situation.
* She has been seeing a therapist bi-weekly for the last 2 months.
* Our 12-month-old is sleeping through the night but is waking up early between 5:30 to 6:30am. We have had a sleep consultant to try and get her to sleep until 7:00 when her older sister gets up but has not been successful yet. I think this will continue for a couple more months until she drops to one-day time nap.

TLDR: Wife is depressed, I don't know if I should encourage her to take anti-depressants or not."
1535,Diagnosed with bipolar 2 and do not know how to feel,"I (F19) have grown up in a household where I had lost my father and my mom was kind of emotionally unavailable. She would buy me stuff if I was upset instead of talking to me, thinking it would help. 

Years later, I saw her go though several severe manic episodes and went weeks without seeing her at a time. As a got older, I started to realize I would get so angry every few weeks, to the point where I would say horrible things and act completely irrational. 

As I got to highschool, I started to become hyper sexual &amp; smoke all the time. It finally caught up to me when I got into an abusive relationship and I’ve never been the same since. 

I started noticing myself feeling euphoric and amazing for about 2 weeks, then completely feeling like shit, feeling intense levels of depression. I had gotten a bipolar 2 diagnosis last week and was asked to be put on medication. 

I was experiencing mania when I was being told, and did not want to take the medication. Now that I’m not, I’m starting to realize that my mania is affecting my relationships with people. It seems like whenever the intense happiness and motivation ends, I’m angry at people who are close to me. Specifically my mom. 

I’m honestly nervous to go on medication and don’t know too much about how the medication could affect you. Does anyone take any sort of medication for bipolar 2, or know anyone who does? how has it positively or negatively affected you?"

1537,Trying to carry on,About 2 years ago I left my ex wife who was toxic and controlling for several years prior. I didn’t really realize that she was controlling me until I started getting more and more depressed. My life went on and I was just losing interest and needing assistance. My wife was never there for me as I started spiraling. I had to leave because I realized that environment was a factor on my issues. Well now I’m with someone I care a lot about but I’m still stuck in the job I had when I was with my ex. Honestly my job is the biggest struggle right now. I’m contracted for another couple months and I’m struggling. I know it’s just a couple months but I had to move away from my home for this job. All my work friends finished up their contracts and the people who are left don’t care for my well being. It’s hard working in this environment. I’m constantly anxious and I honestly can’t see the end. I have my girl but I don’t want to develop a toxic reliance on her. I feel alone and forgotten so often even the people who offer help don’t actually plan to try to help me. All my friends are gone and my job keeps piling things on me in preparation for the end of my contract. I’ve become a worse employee and a worse person. In the last couple years of my life I’ve become a completely different person and I absolutely hate it. I’m not even sure what I’m looking for I just feel like I need help.
1538,I suspect I might be dead. There is a lot of evidence to support my hypothesis that I am likely in purgatory. Is someone able to convince me otherwise?,"Just from the onset here, I do not nor have I ever had a history of episodes of psychosis. At least to the best of my knowledge. I do have a history of depression and I am on medication for it. I have been since January and it seems to work. 

Why I think I am dead and in purgatory:

There have been more than one events in my life that may suggest I have died at some point and that everything since has been some sort of hallucination, like Jacobs Ladder without the creepy aspects. 

I do not see things or hear things.

When I was 10 (almost 11) I was really, really ill. I was admitted to a children's hospital where they considered giving me a lung transplant. They put me on steroids and that seemed to work but I underwent changes physically as a result and everyone in my life treated me differently from then on. Before then I was fairly happy, even optimistic but when I returned to school everything changed. Life has seemingly just worse with every single passing year and I saw it coming. All the bad things that have occurred I knew by instinct that they were going to happen. I saw the pattern. I feel like it is possible I died then.

Now everything is so cartoonishly awful, it's a like a bad country song and I feel like it must be purgatory since all events seem like a dramatic punishment. I want to be convinced that I am in fact, alive, so I have even a kernel of optimism that I might be able to change the course of my life instead of feeling like I'm lost in some sort of current and I am atoning for my sins."
1539,is this something to be concerned of or am i just faking this or overreacting?,"i never really talked about this because of my
weird anxiety but i feel like venting.
   like i've been getting these panic attack ish things, that last for day every time i get yelled at. that's probably because people tell me, that i've been abused mentally (and physically), but ehhh i dont really think it fits the criterions of abuse and yeah.
    like sometimes i get this weird anxiety from nothing, and it is really hard to leave home/fall
asleep because i get anxious and feel need to
doublecheck everything too many times and i just feel too stressed/anxious to do that. 
   and the anxiety and panic attackish things has made cancel plans with friends and canceling them makes me feel that they hate me and it makes feel worse and yeah the cycle continues.

so i've been feeling like i should talk to someone about this last 4 years, but usually i get a feeling that my things aren't bad enough to be heard or shit like that. and i would appreciate if someone would know does this mean anythingg or what lol.

okay thanks for reading bye lol.

(and sorry if i misspelled something cause english isn't my first language)"
1540,Anyone want to chat? i’m having a mental breakdown..,"My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me last night and i’m having a huge mental breakdown..
I honestly feel like i can never be happy again because i thought he was my soul mate..
I’m having panick attacks and real dark thoughts but my psychiatrist can’t seem to fit me in for about 2 weeks.

I’m living with my mom again so i won’t actually hurt myself but i really really can’t cope with this pain.."
1541,How to deal with new wife that is having hallucinations,"Ok.. so we recently got married. We've known each other for about a year or so. Which is pretty quick for me. She is Arabic Muslim (I am a non religious American) and somewhat insisted on a quick marriage because ""that is how they do thing"". Before we were married I did notice a few strange things such as beliefs in demons and spirits. Much of which I put off as differences in cultures and religions. I've never strictly denied existence of these things but mostly would say that they are not a part of my life or that I've never experienced things like this. So the other night when we were laying close to each other she said felt something poke her butt. She was obviously very startled but everything quickly went away. I was laying completely still and there was no ""poking"" type of anything that happened. About a week later and we are in a similar situation. Getting ready for bed. Very loving conversation about missing each other... blablabla. Something came up about a show that I've been watching when shes at work. She doesn't like scary shows, so I watch them on my own. She was concerned that I was watch a scary show. I said something like ""do you feel like I have bad vibes because i watch that show"". Immediately she got a fear of death on her face. Jumped up. Started asking me ""what did you do""..""I don't know whats going on""...""I feel like you are going to kill me"". She got dressed and told me she was leaving. I tried to stay calm and ask her what was going on. Told her she has nothing to be afraid of. Ive never done anything to hurt her. She made me stand in the doorway holding the door open while she paced in the hallway of our apartment building. She left for sometime. Then I messaged and asked what she wanted me to do. She was on the phone with a friend whom advised her that I was not a bad person and I would not hurt her. That it was in her head. Anyways. I end up meeting up with her and walking around town till 3-4am. Gradually she calms down. She keeps asking me if I have plans to hurt her. I keep recalling all the things we've been through and tell her that all of these things dont add up to someone that wants to hurt her. She keeps saying that maybe they are just that way to make it look like im nice but I really plan to hurt her. Anyways.. she end up telling my that when i made the comment about ""bad vibes"" that my face turned into a demon. The more we talk the more I find out that she has had visions or hallucinations in the past. Even though I did know she had trauma in the past with one of her x's I didn't know the extent of the issue. She said that she has been treating the issue with suggestions from religious people she has found on youtube. Things like reading/meditating with religious books. Many of the things she won't expand on though. She just says that she needs time by herself to do these rituals of some sort. She said it has helped a lot and up until now she hasn't had an episode for quite some time. I have suggested seeing a psychiatrist. She initially agreed but then backed up. I didnt try to press her but the situation seems serious. I should say that 99% of the time she seems 100% normal. Very intelligent blablabla. I just dont know what to do. Any advise would be great. Is there anyone that has dealt with similar situations??"
1542,Ive been so close! (dont really know what to flair this as),"Ive been kind depressed for years, on and off. Not all days are bad, but some are really bad. You guys probably know what im talking about.

In the past ive attempted suicide, ive done self harm alot.. Dont recommend it at any point!!!!

Now ive covered my scars with tattoos, i like that.

I often think of death, im not afraid of death. I often think about suicide, and why i shouldn't do it, i got a family, a daughter! Thats whats stopping me, everyone else would eventually cope or get over it or whatever they'd do.
But my child, she would never really get over it, that would be different.

I don't know what i want to say. That I'm fine, because that's a lie. That im bad, that things are shit, that too would be a lie. Im neither. Plain and simple really.

I also have a degree of social anxiety, that shit kicks in, and stops me from doing what i want to be honest. Its really difficult, but my wife helps me through it, i love her, we got married 19.09.2020! That was a though day.

Life sucks, it does, no matter who you are life sucks! You just have to keep the good juice to yourself i guess.

Maybe this was venting, maybe bragging, maybe i want someone to feel sorry for myself. Honestly i jave no clue, i just felt i needed to put something about me put there.


I made this account to stay a little anonymous.

Thanks guys!"
1543,Want to find her reliable care once and for all.,"So my girlfriend struggles with OCD and BPD. Shes made strides with BPD and is doing quite well in that regard. Her OCD however is driving her crazy. 

She is now off her parents Healthcare and can't afford to see a therapist or her meds. She needs these things to get through life.

Simply put- We live in Arkansas and I would like to direct her towards long term mental Healthcare. She must have it. We have ARCARE that charges based on income, but even with that therapy and meds are astronomical. Other than that, I don't know what other resources we have.

Any ideas?"
1544,I’m in the middle of a small anxiety attack rn and i need to calm down.,"So as the title says, i’m having a small anxiety attack rn and i need to calm down. 

I’m crying, feeling weak, shaking alot and breathing heavy. I had one like 2 days ago and it was alot worse but i just need to calm down and stop crying.
 
Does anyone have any advice please?"
1545,Are these normal thoughts?,"
I am convinced of the fact that this is normal. My mother and I seem to share the same level of paranoia (she might have unknowingly taught me this) though they come in different shapes. That’s why I think it’s normal, and just something people don’t talk about due to being taboo.


Thoughts like «my friends/ family all hate me, they are whispering about me» and «they pity me, they think less of me». These thoughts can come from nowhere, from a remark or two, or from a wrong movement or gesture. I know this is irrational and silly, but in the heat if the moment it all feels *so real.* It is a fact— like how the sky is blue and gravity is real— undeniable because to me it is all tethered to a solid fundation to reality, though most times I tell myself to not get upset and ignore it. Ignorance is bliss afterall. Even if this was all true, being passive-agressive won’t help. 


«those strangers on the street are laughing of me». The worst thing is that I know this obviously is rarely true. Yet my back burns from a dozen imaginary eyes glaring holes on my back with disgusted amusement.


Worse are thoughts like « can people read my mind?». Fortunately I rarely get that thought. That one is especially harsh because you feel as if you are a specimen put under a magnifying glass with a view of your mind for the whole world to see and probe into. I know this makes me sound like I’m on bath salts; it’s not as dramatic as I make it out to be. Funnily enough, when I tell a friend or two about some of my personal problems (not these) they often either laugh and say me to, or when they sense I’m being serious they tell me to «get help»— I realised then that I have a habit of overdramatising because it feels normal to me.


Sorry for extra long post. Am on mobile-&gt; typos and errord are abundant. English is a bit wonky too. It’s almost 1 am afterall lmao."
1546,How can I get my family to take my mental health more seriously?,"They never listen to what I have to say, they always just brush it off as me being stupid or overthinking. I’m just getting sick of it. Any time I bring something up they laugh at me and make me feel like an idiot. 

I’ve tried talking to them but they won’t Listen at all. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I can’t talk to them about anything either as they get really annoyed even though they tell me to go to them. But the also get annoyed when I don’t. I just don’t understand it"
1547,Why do I feel guilty for almost everything I do?,"This is probably the wrong sub, but I don't know where else to ask. Why do I feel guilty for almost everything I do? It doesn't matter if what I did was right or wrong, I feel incredibly guilty for doing it. If what I did was wrong/incorrect, I feel like I'm the most terrible person to walk the earth. Why is this? I want to stop feeling like this. It makes those around me upset which makes me feel even worse about it. I know I'm just a whiny little bitch that should just shut up and deal with it, but I just want to know if there is any way to stop this."
1548,What is this?,"
I (17F) am very sorry for the rambling and awful grammar, I'm not a native English speaker and have been typing fast and also am a bit stressed out.. Anyway, this is more of a rant, but really thanks if anybody actually reads it.

Could I have ASD? Or what is this?
- I absolutely can't stand eye contact. I just can't hold it. At all.
- Physical contact from some people is unstandable - like, I can't help myself backing off.
- I'm always playing with something, picking at my skin, moving my foot or something, sometimes I feel like I'll explode if I stop.
- I can't hold conversations, especially small talk. Really, I'm absolutely awful, everybody starts to think I'm stupid (not smart, but I study at a relatively good school, so it can't be that bad as my speaking makes it look) / brushing them off / nuts. It's like I don't know what to say, no sentences come to my mind.
- I often feel out of my body or sth, like I'm not there, like I'm a zombie. Emotions become distant echoes and everything's surreal.
- I'm alieneted from people. Like, I can usually put myself in other people's shoes and tell how they feel, (and feel bad or happy for them eventually), but I still feel somehow disconnected from others when interacting with them and it's killing me - I really wanna have normal relationships and all. I want somebody close.
- I have troubles with speaking too quietly, though that's normally just nervousness. 
- Can't focus on more things, it's harder for me.
- Am clumsy - can't dance to save my life, bump into stuff, lose balance, you name it.
- My mom's autistic, depressed, on medication, and a psychologist - she'd told me when I was like 10-12? that I probably have something too, though I've never been to a psychologist, counselor or anything. My dad's prolly something too. Either way, they're both very withdrawn and we don't share nearly anything, we've never hugged and stuff - not that I want to rn. Mom's tired all the time, and honestly? I don't think she cares about me on some deeper level. I mean, she's good, nice, materially I have everything, but you know, I'd trade it.. She loves dog more than us, she's fucken said it, not to me, she's not cruel, but she did say it and I happend to find out. Not her fault, though..
- I dont know what I want to do with my life, I just cant see my future.. Since I was like 12/13, I've thought that I'll just die or something, but I'm here now and clueless. I don't study for school, so my grades are medial - I'm always tired and lazy and my parents never really minded. When I come from school (sometimes 5:30+pm), I can spend hours doing nothing. I have animals to feed and a dog to walk, but that's it (no, parents don't do everything for me, I wash my clothes and clean some stuff etc, but we don't do much, nobody cares, it sucks, our house is not very homely, plus my mom lets her new puppy she's fixated on destroy anything he wants, and she also buys unnecessary stuff and them dont use it and leaves it somewhere around the house, so..). I don't do anyrhing else or go anywhere with anybody. Hell, I don't even text with anybody.. Like.. Maybe once a month or two? Seriously, I don't have any social life whatsoever - aside from school. I dread the day I'll leave. 
- Honestly, I'd feel absolutely hopeless if it wasn't for our lit teacher, like, I probably just annoy her and have never talked to her or anything, but those 4 hours a week are really what keeps me going.. Idk, she's so nice and all, I just enjoy her presence, when she's being positive and I like to listen to her (hell, I'd enjoys math class if she taught if), you know, that's all. And I always look forward and despise that one day we don't have lit. 
Seriously, though, even these feelings are making me sad - they're not a real love, I think, it's just the made up idea of her what I love. And I can't be this dependant on somebody either. I've felt like this about other.. um, older people. Ironically, I'm not even sure what my orientation is - the thought of being close to somebody else's face is too much, let alone something more. Plus I don't really have ""peer crushes""..
- I don't find joy in anything. Hobbies make me feel sad and alone, because I don't share. I don't know how to. I've tried, believe me.. I used to be into stuff when I was younger, I would borrow books about astronomy, physics and stuff since I was like 7, but this interest of mine has faded and now I'm an uninterested zombie. I've tried to learn about computers and programming and was really into it around the time I was 13-14?, I've also loved psychology and it combined with linguistics, but like I said.. I had some other interests (I still find these things interesting, but am dead inside), like guitar and horse riding, but there's always been an anchor in this mess, and (as bad as my English is) it was writing. I don't do that anymore either. Everything just feels like.. bleh.
- And now a classic one, I hate my looks. I'm normal weight and all, but my face.. God, my face. I've entered a store couple of days ago and got honestly terrified by my own reflection.. Like, how is something this ugly freely roaming the streets? And it's not just a big nose/thin lips sorta thing, it's real pure ugliness. I've seen average or slightly under average looking people, this is not it. Seriously, I swear I've never met anybody who I thought looked ugly, because of the comparation my face creates. It's even written in my expression: ""Ugly on the outside, ugly on the inside.""
- I do everything last minute - chill, then panic. 
- I keep forgetting stuff. Not some ""academical"" information, but everyday stuff like homework, exams, doctor appointments, what people tell me, what I need to do..
- I'm not gonna even go into my eating and sleeping habits, lmao.

Okay, I'm done. Not that I'm that narcissistic to think that people would get through this and even tried to reply, I just needed to vent, but if anybody somehow did.. Thank you, seriously, it means a lot to me."
1549,Stuck in the void (16M),"(edit) sorry for not adding the flair, I didn't realise.

Hi, so I've struggled with mental health issues all my life, but can never find a solution to actually. Recently I've started not being purely sad, but just having absolutely no motivation to do anything and just watch pointless shows, nap or just listen to the same 3 songs over and over. The worst part is, I can't fix it. I can't go onto medication because I've been on types before and it makes me suffer me (large moodswings and hallucinations), I tend to eat well, I have a good friend and support circle, I go the gym, I be ""mindful"", I used to have a therapist, but nothing works and I absolutely hate being stuck like this. There's no end to this feeling and it feels like I've tried everything. I need it to stop because I need motivation to actually do school work and apply for a job, but there seems to end to this feeling. Also ,sorry if the grammar and spelling is atrocious"
1550,It this normal?,Most of the day I'm fine and positive but for a solid 10 minutes I just sit thee and want to die and think about how shit of a person I am. Is this normal or am I just depressed
1551,How to deal with intense homicidal thoughts,"Please help. My mom's sexually and psychologically abused me my whole life. She has split custody and I genuinely cannot bear to be around her.
Lately ive been getting these violent homicidal thoughts when she snaps at me- which is every day. And theyve been getting worse. Ive only been here 4 days and already my seizures are coming back because of my anger.

I dont have diagnosed anger issues. But something is wrong.

I dont want for me to snap one day. I have a girlfriend, i have a future. I can't waste it because i just wind up killing my mom.

Please. I just want to kill her so badly every day and i dont know how to make it stop. Please please help. Anything. Anyone. Please help me."
1552,"What nice, but not too cheesy, things can I say to someone going through a hard time","A friend of mine (13F) Is going through a pretty tough time, and is harming herself. I (14M) have been trying to help her in a lot of different ways, and also got her a stress ball to help. It's going pretty good, but I still feel that she's kind of tense. Is there anything nice I can say to her?

I've said stuff like 'I'm free whenever, and would love to help,' and 'I'm trying my best to help you, and I need you to know that I'm not going to stop trying to help you.' Anyone got things like that I can say? 

Thanks :)"
1553,I cheated on my husband 12 years ago and it’s destroying my mental health. What do I do now?,"I have posted this on a couple of other subs but haven’t had that many responses. 

Growing up, I was neglected and emotionally abused by my mum. I was told I was ugly, worthless etc etc. In my teen years, I also had some bad experiences with a boyfriend who got very annoyed if I didn’t have sex with him whenever he wanted it (multiple times a day) even if I was in pain.

When I left home in my late teens, I went completely off the rails. I was drinking excessively and sleeping with lots of men. It was a combination of me self sabotaging and of me thinking that was all that anyone would want me for.

During this time, I met someone who lived overseas. We got to know each other a little and he wanted us to be exclusive. I agreed, but after that, when he left, I continued my self destructive behaviour. I carried on like that for the first few months of our relationship. At one point, I couldn’t bear the guilt any more and I tried to tell him over the phone. He told me he didn’t hate me, he despised me. I then told him that it wasn’t true, I hadn’t cheated on him but I was afraid that I would cheat and that I thought we should break up. He begged for me to stay with him and eventually, I said we could try again. I was drinking myself into oblivion and not realising what I had done until the morning. I was so ashamed of myself.

After a few months into our relationship, I realised that this was different than every other man I had met. This guy really cared. He really wanted to help me sort my life out and he wasn’t going to reject me, humiliate me and degrade me like everyone else in my life had.

I moved out of the flat I lived in and stopped contact with the group of friends I had who were most definitely part of my problem. I stopped drinking. I turned my life around. My husband and I continued living in different countries for over 2 years and then married and moved in together.

That was 10 years ago. My husband has given me the best 10 years of my life. We have 2 beautiful children now too.

The problem is, I hate myself for what I have done. Even 12 years on from my infidelities, I can’t forgive myself. I feel dirty, disgusting and full of shame because of the person I used to be and the way I behaved.

My DH told me whilst we were talking about another couple we know, that he wouldn’t be interested in anything that went on before we got married. At times, I try to remind myself of this and use this to help me in forgiving myself but as the years go by, I’m realising that I just can’t. I hate myself and my husband and children deserve a better wife and mother than I will ever be."
1554,My [19] brother [25] is going on yet another date.,"This has honestly made me feel so defeated and worse about myself. I have never been loved or wanted by anyone else except one girl in middle school.

My brother is going for casual flings and stuff and talks about every girl he goes out with. I dont think he knows how much it hurts but he has always been a meat head so I'm not surprised.

He goes out on a date and finds a new girl what feels like every week and its slowly driving me closer to suicide.

I have never kissed, held hands, or gotten close to a girl and it makes me feel pathetic. Especially when objectively I would say I'm a good person. I love caring, and  talking/connecting with people and feel like I get along really well with others. 

It hurts because objectively I really hate his personality and type and if I was a girl I would not be interested in this type of person. He is a gym/fitness bro which isnt a bad thing but its literally his  whole life and had living with him my whole life a really cocky ego personality to go with it. I cringe when I talk to him because of how close minded and rude he can be but doesnt see it. I know it may seem rude or toxic but he is the literall definition of a meat head. 

His Instagram is filled with tournaments he has won since he loves Brazilian jui jitsu and I guess that's attractive? I could understand how some girls like that but I would be immediately turned off when I would talk to him, maybe he talks to them differently idk. Not to mention while we both look different we both have some undesirable features. We both have receding hairlines, we both are short like 5'6, and we both have big noses. 

When I look in the mirror I dont think I'm ugly but why has only 1 girl liked me my WHOLE LIFE. to be fair I have been completely isolated from any social life due to shyness and bullying for my whole life so I never really tried anything social or dating apps. 

This year I was ready to change that by making an instagram and finally starting some fun hobbies and stuff like volunteering at an animals shelter, rock climbing, archery, as well as joining some clubs in college. I wanted to make friends first but if I found a girlfriend that would be cool as well. 

I set a mission to not be alone by next valentines day and to spend Halloween with my new friends in early February. My life is literally on pause and he still gets dates every fucking week. 

It's getting to the point where I feel so fucking lonely my depression and suicidal thoughts are coming back. I just want to be In a  loving relationship. I'm not asking for anything FUCKING CRAZY HERE. 

I cant do anything to make me happy and life just keeps taunting me and laughing about how I can never have this. It's getting much easier to think about suicide again after making so much progress. Guess I am not good enough to be loved right? 

OH AND BTW I have respected the pandemic worn a mask and followed all rules meanwhile my brother thinks it's all a conspiracy and a ""scamdemic"" and STILL GETS DATES AND HAS FUN. THANKS KARMA AND GOD REALLY MAKING ME FEEL GOOD FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING! 

If I kill myself I hope it hurts him and he feels guilty, fuck him and I know he has no idea how much it hurts me and he would feel guilty for the rest of his life but I dont care anymore.

And finally please don't come here and spew meaningless garbage like enjoy being single or it will happen later, I'm ready to love and care for someone now not 6 years from now. I just want ONE loving relationship NOT ASKING FOR MUCH. 

One last note, I actually have a co worker at my new job who is kinda cute and I like talking to her. I dont think she likes me but ik everyone enjoys me being around since I made a good impression and make people laugh. This February I think I will get some flowers and bake some cookies to ask her out. I expect rejection but fuck it I'm feeling so bitter and jaded with life that I dont think I am afraid of rejection at this point. Maybe just worried things will be awkward at work."

1556,Relative wrote this wondering if it is serious,"standards for myself always getting higher and that's the problem. I push myself so hard to get better at everything and I do improve but it's still not enough for me. The bar keeps getting higher before I can grab it like climbing a staircase where the top keeps getting further away, and the ball and chain attached to your ankle's getting heavier and heavier but you keep trying. Eventually this branched out to more that just what I was doing. It started seeping into my self-image which wasn't high in the first place either. It wasn't only telling me what I was doing wasn't enough. It started telling me I wasn't enough and that's when I started wanting to fix it. Look how in control I am but I wasn't. I was in this downward spiral. I built up fears and rules and my head got foggy and foggier every day. This whole awful cycle went on for several months. I don't even remember anything else I was doing in my life. It all just became a blur. The only thing I can truly remember looking back now was just being so tired and cold and sad all the time. Nothing was good enough. My brain didn't let me see how horrible it was getting. I don't know what happened but eventually I was able to break through and tell myself this wasn't what I wanted. I didn't want to live like this anymore and I had to get better. You create these fears and rules for so long that when you want to escape the jail cell you've built around yourself, they beckon you to stay and try to drag you back in promising happiness and how they're only here to protect you. They let you feel like you're the one in control when you're not. You're the puppet on strings and when you try to cut yourself free, not only do you face your fears head-on but you live them. There's so much more to it. I wish I could express you how toxic your mind becomes while dealing with something like this. It's not how your brain would normally function when it's clear. You know what you're doing to yourself is wrong but you just can't shake it. It has a death grip on you. So I was attempting recovery completely on my own, I'll remind you. I didn't tell anyone in my life what I was going through and it was indescribably difficult. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I had to be the doctor and that patient. I kept saying this is what will make you better. You're on the right path but the voice was still there. You're a disgrace. Look what you've done. I wasn't ready to go back to school. I wasn't back to normal yet but I was approaching so quickly and there wasn't any time to go back. I told myself this was my punishment. I did this to myself. So I put on a mask and pretended to be fine. I was trying to act like myself so much that I wasn't even me anymore. I became a stranger to who I actually am. My self-image and esteem was at an all-time low. I tried my hardest to push through it. Every person I met, the voice inside me said you're such a disappointment. You're aren't good enough for them. I felt like I could feel every single person's discontent through their embrace but I didn't let the mask slip off and I kept truckin' through. was almost like I wasn't even there. I wasn't present. It was just a daze. After the convention was over, I was so mentally torn to shreds. I wasn't okay. I felt like all the progress I was trying to make to get better had just been ripped down. The voice was louder than ever drowning out the one that was telling me everything was going to be okay. I realized I couldn't let people at school see me when I was in such a toxic horrible state. thought I had experienced the worst already but this destroyed me. A nightmare where hundreds of thousands of people are wanting to see you and then when they finally do, it's at the lowest darkest point of your life and they don't even know it. When you don't show yourself, people develop expectations. I don't know what those expectations are and I feel like sometimes they don't even know what they are, but I believed with all my heart, I disappointed every single one. It's not just the fact I wasn't where I wanted to be appearance-wise. So many people saw me for the first time when I was at such an awful point mentally and I felt so much deeper into darkness I've ever been. I felt like I was drowning in my own emotions. Every time I tried to get back to the surface to breathe, another wave would crash down on me and pull me right back under again. I started having even darker thoughts and I knew I should have been scared of them but I wasn't and that's what scared me. The voice was echoing in my head almost completely muting out the other one. Every day I just wanted to feel happy again. I wanted to wake up and everything's just normal. Not one day passed without me hating myself. I couldn't find a reason to get out of bed. I felt broken and that no one could fix me. Black fog surrounded me everywhere. I went and I couldn't breathe. That was so stretched thin. I was trying so hard to swim but the waves kept coming. Each one stronger than the last, but I kept going. I don't know why. There wasn't a reason and I couldn't really find one. I just did and even though I didn't have a reason for myself not to give up pushing through everything, I wanted to be there for people. I want to be able to be there for people like me who felt like they couldn't go to anyone and are drowning and help them like how I wanted someone to reach out and help me. I want to exist for other people. I don't really care about myself."
1557,Please kill me,"My family basically told me that they're better off without me after I refused to go on a trip to Colorado with them and leave my boyfriend behind. I offered to cover his expenses, but they refused. I'm basically in an open war with my mom already, and this is making things worse. I'm considering killing myself to end it all."
1558,Took a chance and got a new therapist,"I recently took a chance and got a new therapist. I had been waiting on a psych intake through my hospital but the appointment was two months out at the time. I was facing a lot of life changes including a separation, living on my own for the first time ever, family troubles, heartache, medical issues, being non-med compliant and the oncoming of seasonal depression on top of my already diagnosed PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

My depression is my first and most serious concern as I’m a recovering self-mutilator and have a history of being hospitalized for suicidal ideation. However, my PTSD has been very active lately due to safety concerns related to neighborhood violence. It brought up a lot of old memories and before I knew it, the flashbacks and nightmares were starting again. 

I’ve probably seen close to or possibly even over twenty therapists since I was 12. I’m now 35. I’ve only actually liked maybe five of them. So, yes, I took a chance and called my local Rape Crisis Center to see about getting back into therapy while I await my psych appointment. To my pleasant surprise, they got me scheduled in within two days of my request. I have now seen my therapist twice since then and see her again next week. I absolutely love her. 

I’m gradually freshening up on old coping skills like journaling, writing and occasionally even sketching/drawing/doodling. I’m not stuck putting the burden on what little of a social network I have anymore. Not that there is anything wrong with doing that when needed of course. I just hate putting all my problems on my friends and family, especially for a long period of time. They’re not professionals and basically can’t do much more than lend a supportive ear. I’m working towards goals again. My therapist asked me what I want to get out of therapy. The answer was a lot of mixed things, but overall my goal is to understand myself, why I do the things I do, why I feel the way I feel and how to control that.

Believe me when I say I am predominantly a pessimist, but I’m feeling optimistic about this. I took a chance with therapy again and I’m so glad I did. Reach out for help when you need it. If you know you’re suffering, reach out and keep reaching until you get what you need. Eventually your needs will start to be met through your own self-advocacy and you’ll start to feel better and won’t need as much help anymore.

I am by no means saying I’m out of the woods yet. Things could easily get worse again before they get better… but I just wanted to share with you all that even when you think all hope is lost, don’t give up. Keep pushing to find that tiny shred of hope to keep you hanging on. It can get better, and it will, eventually. Just don’t give up."
1559,I'm here to listen.,"If anybody is in need of someone to whom to vent and discuss their feelings, however big or small the matter may be, please feel free to message me. I am a listener and I can chat with you one-on-one. While I can not give health or legal advice, I can work to help you feel supported."
1560,Does anyone else feel like their mind is constantly at war with their soul?,"My mind has so many thoughts and creates so many images that I don’t want it to. It’s like my soul is in a constant fight against these horrible images, thoughts, and sensations. 

No matter how I feel or what I’m doing, my mind can create a surge in my body. When I’m drawing, my brain sometimes seems to enlarge the picture in my mind like it’s flying towards me, or it’s touching me, or I’m going inside of it. In a way it’s sort of dream-like. It’s my mind intentionally trying to give me chills. 

Unidentifiable triggers can cause my mind to surge with images or sensations such as pain or burning. Also there’s intrusive images, such as stabbing my eyes out or having graphic sex with someone. In addition there’s intrusive thoughts that cause me paranoia. 

There’s many I don’t even notice too, like images of bricks being relayed or the road being fixed. This has basically been happening my whole life. It’s really hard to put into words, but I hope it resonates with someone."
1561,Weird Panic Attack,"Hey everyone, I apologize for any poor grammar or typing at the moment I'm having this weird panic attack. I

Basically every once in a while ill get these weird panic attacks, I'm not even sure if they are panic attacks. It basically feels like, I am moving so slow and the world is so fast or vise versa, Im not sure how to explain it or what it is, but its very scary. It feels like I'm a robot, not really a person... any advice or ideas of what this is?"
1562,I (18M) am really struggling and I don’t know what to do. Please help,"I started university in London this week (moved in last Thursday) and so far I absolutely despise it. It’s not a particularly good uni, but not terrible either. I am also a committed athlete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I want to be a world champion. It’s my main purpose in life and it defines me. My entire identity is built around it. I also have a lovely girlfriend who I love very much, who is at a different university in London, studying something she is very passionate about, and that defines her in the same way BJJ defines me. It is about an hours journey for me to get to her.

So that’s the situation. The problems are these. I am currently injured so cannot train in my sport, which is pretty vital for my mental health. There are also no competitions because of COVID, and this is also vital for my mental health. So everything is a bit skewed at a fundamental level for me at the moment. I am working through my injury rehab and am making good progress and should hopefully be back to training in a few weeks. However, it takes me about an hour to get to the gym from the uni, and I plan to go there to train at least twice a day, ideally three times a day. This is going to take some schedule juggling, but I am used to that. Luckily 99% of my classes are online at the moment, so I can do them at the gym, and then go to training the second they finish, which makes things a hell of a lot easier. However, I feel like I might be losing my passion for my sport because of my girlfriend. I love her very much, she really is an incredible girl and she makes me so happy when I’m with her. I have a big stupid grin on my face when I get to see her and I would do anything for her. But, I have noticed a decrease in my motivation to train because of her and I really don’t like this. It feels like I have to pick one or the other. I’m working super hard to balance it, and I think it will work but it’s a source of constant stress and soul-searching as to the state of my athletic career and my happiness. If I was forced to choose I would choose my sport, and this would tear me apart, but it’s the right choice. Hopefully I will not be forced to choose. I have been spending a lot of time with her recently doing nice things and I’ve been loving it. I’m glad that I’m injured in a way, because it’s given me all this time to do nice things with the girl that I love. I feel guilty about enjoying this time and take it as a sign that I’m not passionate enough about my sport and that I am letting myself down. I know that this is overthinking and that I am being too hard on myself, but I think it nonetheless.

I have no friends at uni. I’ll be honest - I’m only here because it allows me to train more and not have to work full time. I’m not that interested in the degree that I’m doing. But I really dislike all the people that I have met so far. None of them are on my wavelength and I feel so alone. I just sit in my room all day and do my online lectures and scroll through my phone. I feel depressed and anxious 24/7 about everything and the only thing I look forward to at the moment is seeing my girlfriend. Today I had an in-person lecture and I was surrounded by all these people that I didn’t vibe with even slightly, being taught a degree that I’m not invested in, and I just had a breakdown and started crying silently in my seat. No one noticed, luckily, and I went back to my room as soon as the lecture finished and proceeded to have a panic attack. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be at this uni, I don’t want to do this course, I don’t want to be around these people. But I can’t see a way out. I can’t drop out, because I can’t work full time, I’ll have no time to train, no friends, no time to see my girlfriend, and no energy whatsoever. I’d be suicidal within a couple of months. I hate the area that I’m in too, it’s horrible. I’m going fucking stir crazy in my tiny room as I write this, my flat mates are completely antisocial and I never see them. 

On top of this, my girlfriend and her flat get along amazingly. They’re like a little family, and I’m really happy for her, but it also makes me sad to see what I could be having if I was in a different situation. She’s surrounded by people that are passionate about what they do, and very good at it too, as is she, and who are grateful and excited to be at that uni doing what they’re doing. Whereas I’m surrounded by people doing some random degree because they felt like they should go to university, probably don’t love what they do, and are doing a very dry, non-creative subject and basically have no substance to them, and it is depressing me so much that I am one of those people now. I feel like such a drop kick. I applied to university through clearing very last minute because I couldn’t face my original plan of full time work in London and training as much as possible. I feel like a failure, and an idiot and a loser. I have lost my identity because I’ve been unable to train, and all my self esteem has gone with it as well, because I have no value outside my sport. I worry constantly that my girlfriend would be happier with someone from her uni, who shared her passions, who she sees everyday and who is out there achieving things at a prestigious university in a creative, soulful subject, than she is with me, a meathead athlete doing any old degree at a mediocre university, trying to go pro in a sport that no one cares about and that probably has no future in a post-COVID world. I am terrified of her leaving me for someone else.

I hate my situation at the moment and I definitely can’t do this for the next year, let alone three years. I’m so upset all the time, and I don’t know what to do. I feel I’m going to lose my athletic career that I have worked so so so hard for for the last 4 years, my girlfriend and my sanity tbh. I’m already experiencing the worst mental health I have ever experienced and I’m terrified. I really need some advice, please."
1563,I’m off lithium and I am in my feelings so hard,"I forgot what it’s like having SO many emotions in just a period of an hour. Lithium made me a zombie and I was on a lot of it. My old psychiatrist thought I was bi polar and borderline but I don’t think that’s the case, so I convinced my new psychiatrist to let me come off of lithium. I’m NOT manic, but I am experiencing severe mood swings. One moment feeling almost surreal and like I’m the most interesting person on the planet to having crying fits and wanting to self-harm.

I feel like I have no friends atm. But that could change pretty soon. Maybe I’ll feel popular in an hour or so. I forgot how exhausting it is to actually experience all of your emotions because there’s definitely a lot of them. 

Never going back on lithium though. I’d rather experience the intensity of all my emotions than be a zombie again."
1564,Just realized wife is delusional. What do?,"It should have been obvious long ago,  but last night I suddenly awoke from denial.  All the pieces fell into place.  

For over a year,  my wife has been accusing me of ""hacking"" all her accounts.  Email.  Social media.  Her iPhone. On and on.  I guess that it has been hard to see what was going on because I've been in thet middle.  I think she's told everyone we know. 

Recently she's refocused and thinks some anonymous stranger is hacking her.  I've investigated as much as she'll allow and never hand seen any evidence. 

Just looked it up and it's classical non bizarre delusional disorder.  It's been over a month.  Check.  Could happen.  Check. Isn't.  Check. 

Not sure what to do.  I'm positive that she won't listen to me.  Should I contact her doctor? Her family? I don't want to further alienate her or cause more distrust, so I feel this must be handled delicately. 

I'm worried.  Apparently it's a type of psychosis."
1565,I get really really lonely,"I (m14) am doing online school and I thought I would really like it. I also moved hundreds of miles away from my hometown where I only spend two days of my week but am doing school there. I didn't have a lot of friends going into covid and I thought I would love it but I get really devastatingly lonely. Feeling like I'm annoying and nobody wants to talk to me. I try to talk to people but I feel like im not being taken seriously. They say things like ""that sucks"" but I just feel like I'm cripplingly alone.

 I have friends in my home town but I only spend two days and one night there. I cant switch to regular school without having to redo a quarters worth of school. I meet girls in my hometown but everytime it seems like I might get to hang out with someone they either don't respond or have other plans. I dont know anyone in my new town besides two people that are not my crowd.

 Ive tried to be around them to remedy this loneliness but it doesn't help. My mom tries to get me to meet people by dropping me off at a skate park and scolding me when I wear headphones because I would supposedly meet tons of people. That's not how it works. You don't go to malls and skate parks to meet people, you go there to hang out with friends. Every day and night I start tearing up and crying because I feel so Isolated. I played a game that hit really close to how this feels.

 Sea of Solitude is a game about loneliness that exactly shows how im feeling. When I see someone for a couple of hours the weather is beautiful and the air is vibrant. But then the next day I go back into this darkness where every moment I feel worthless and annoying and I feel like anyone I text is just annoyed by me. I don't know if anyone is going to respond to this but saying how I feel is doing less and less as time goes on."
1566,I want to die I just cant take it anymore,"Im 14(f)

I am physically and mentally at my limit I just cant take it anymore. Ive been overworking myself and I'm struggling. All my life I've done everything my mom has wanted me to do out of fear of what she would do to me and now I'm living with my dad. I still fear my parents and adults in general so I'm always afraid of sharing things with adults which is why I'm here. During August I started highschool and everything was fine until we did digital/going to the actual school I got distracted, I didnt understand anything, and I barely even get to talk to my friends. Recently my parents have threatened to ground me because my grades are so bad but I'm struggling and I just can't understand any of it I feel overworked because in gym we did these intense workouts that have made my body hurt. My parents have pressured me into doing my work and now i dont have any time to play games or relax I've been doing school 24/7 on weekends and breaks. I've cried everyday because I'm so overworked and I just want it all to end I want to die I have lost all motivation in no longer confident in myself ive become lazier and I barely even eat I've felt insecure and I'm stressed. 

I felt like a spoiled brat writing this but I just want to be happy again I want what ive lost back so please just help me I dont like feeling like this."

I've always felt as if I'm quite emotionally mature cause the circumstances really drove me to be in touch and in control of my emotions. I've really developed my ability of empathising with other people as well, and it's kind of how my entire thought process works. Yet despite this, sometimes my anxiety and anger just feels so overwhelming that I feel as if I can't possibly control it, and end I end up acting on impulse. Is this normal, are my problems severe, or am I being immature? And does this happen to anyone else? Feedback would be really appreciated."
1572,"A struggling 14 y/o student, close to giving up 🙃","Im a 14 y/o girl who is struggling in school rn. This year is very important to me. Because after this year i need to chose which path in life i want to go down. Every test is so important because if i mess up now im not sure i’ll make it to next year. I want to study but i can’t seem to. I keep doing other stuff like reading to get my mind of all the test and homework i need to do. I end up not doing homework and studying for tests on the last evening,  and i end up crying because i cant take it. Im so stupid. I should just study but i can’t. And its breaking me. Even now im writhing this when i have a test tomorrow i didn’t study for.

One of my friends is very smart but has a fear of failure. She keeps saying that she is going to get a 6/10 and is generally disappointed, meanwhile she got a 10/10 and im here with a 3/10. She is a good friend dont get me wrong, she is my best friend. But it hurts me what she is disappointed with a 7/10 at some subjects, while im glad I barely got a pass. I haven’t told her because im scared i’ll lose her. 

Everytime im in the middle of a test, i dont know anything and just stare at the words. I keep thinking “ i could have studied, im stupid, im going to fail, im going to end up homeless, my parents are going to be disappointed, i should just kms. Then I wouldn’t have to make this test. I want to go home, i want to cry, i want to go.” 

I don’t know if im going to make it. In school. In life. Im close to breaking down. And im only 14. I have like 60 years ahead of me. If its going to be like this i dont want it."

I feel like I can’t find the words, last night I absolutely fell apart; I screamed into my pillow, wept, and felt completely suicidal. I am actually physically harming my self both unintentionally and intentionally, like my back will not stop hurting since last night and I almost really hurt myself while in this fit.   
I need to tell them and I know that but like I said I can’t find the words, I’m afraid they will give an answer that will not help me and then it’ll be old news and it won’t get better anyway thanks"

But then i just decided i want like a soul searching personality fixing quest. After my exams this October im just gonna leave everything behind for a week. No internet distractions or escapism tactics and just pure simple meditation and a relaxing break somewhere abroad/ peaceful and quiet. Any tips on what i should do to make the most of my week? Im gonna focus on my religion, maybe read a book too and learn to draw a little cause i have no hobbies really, just watched a ton of anime this lockdown (first time tho). But im just looking to press refresh and ground myself to reality. I want to come back to my life focussed and strong and really happy too."
1575,Activities to connect parents and their children through virtual campaigns?,"I'm saying this because children aged 12-19 are not usually well connected with their parents in the brown community.

1577,"Friend all of a sudden told me the fictional character/her secondary social media ""nickname"" is real, but actually not physically real, but real in her head ..What could this be ?","So, hopefully I'm in the right sub here. A friend of mine has been feeling very up and down lately, more depressive episodes, etc. Ive noticed some odd behaviors in the last few months;  feeling paranoid, saying shes being followed, saying she woke up and just ""doesnt feel right "" that something happened to her etc. She also created another social media account with a different name, which I just assumed was so she can stay more low key, however last night she sent me a snap saying ""A\*\*\*\* is real"" A\*\*\*\*\* being the name of the secondary social accounts.. saying A\*\*\*\* is real in her head etc etc and things of the sort. Now, I don't believe this is schizophrenia, but I honestly am not sure. From my understanding that is a misconception of that disorder. Now I am willing to provide her resources etc as she is asking for my help, I told her a good place to start would be to keep log of when this happens, situations that have happened and if there is any triggers. I feel that this may be a  fictional character shes created as a form of coping  with trauma, or stress. It should be noted that she smokes ALOT of pot. Like I'm talking poppers all day everyday, from morning to night every half hour to the point of fried, while smoking joints in between and has smoked this heavily for a couple years now, progressively more in the last year or so.  She lives in a pretty toxic environment and Ive seen her decline in the last few months. I told her speaking with her doctor would be a good start with her journal/ log and they can rule things out and do assessments and questionnaires. I guess my main question is - Any idea as to what this could be ? Split personality ? Trauma/stress coping tool ? Any advice?"

1584,Why am I such an asshole?,"I feel like it’s probably from my chronic depression, but even so it’s no excuse to be mean. I always someway or somehow find a way to push people away from me. Weather it’s my anxiety that stresses others out or my tendency to be overly critical. Why am I like this? How did I become like this? 

I use to love being around people, talking and being open. But now I have developed some weird social anxiety where I don’t even know how to talk to people anymore and come off as awkward. 

I have moments where I lash out at people and hurt their feeling, but why? Why I do I this? Why am I so annoyed an sad all the time. I become distant and mean to those I care about and end up alone which makes me feel worse.

Any tips on how to not be an asshole?"
1585,Mental Hospital?,"Young female in the US

Anyone have advice on spending time in a mental hospital? How much does it cost? How do you find a good one? Does it matter which one you go to? How do you decide if you should? or for how long? Will it really help? Do you need a diagnosis before you can go? 

I've just been having such a hard time functioning the past few years it's been getting really bad and I really need help with dealing with my mental health issues and I feel like just going to a therapist has only worked temporarily or like a band aid that just let's me talk about some things and get some advise but never really life changing or actually working through my issues or changing my habits and thought patterns
(Sorry for the stupid run on sentence lol)"
1586,I feel lost...,"Ok this'll probably be a long one. It all started when people (close friends to be exact) noticed that I get mad at stuff too easily, they of course told me to not care and push on. Here's a thing about me. I'm a sim racer, as a sim racer when something bad happens to you during a race you push on and continue and make the most of what you have, I'm pretty familiar with that (as in not caring for the past and just doing the best you can do at the moment). I took their advice and started implementing that on a daily basis. It all went ok and I felt pretty well and burden free, my parents also aren't really good either, I used to go to the gym every day(pre quarantine of course) to get out of this place  where I have to be with them. I can't stand them, they aren't exactly supportive and they don't believe in mental health much. It was all ok I managed quarantine with that mentality. I avoided travelling with them as much as I could during summer. But it's been a couple of months that I've not been caring about anything really. Like, ANYTHING, I go around saying stuff that's rude and inconsiderate and if people dont like it they can f*ck off I couldn't care less but then I realized that I did this to my close friends too. And this shook me. I used to be considerate and try being the best I can be. Now I'm just a cold headed a-hole. I'm writing this after a mental breakdown. I don't know what's wrong with me, I feel like I don't know myself anymore. I've apologized to my friends and they all told me it's ok they've also went through a similar phase as well. But I really feel bad and I feel lost. Adding insult to injury, I'm supposed to convince my parents that I want to pursue a business degree in university and my whole family are engineers (Asian parents yes). Can someone please tell me what's wrong with me. And what can I do to stop being so bitchy. I'd like to deeply thank you if you've read this far. I hope you have a nice day."

1588,Menstruation is getting to my mental health.,"Everytime like a week before my period starts my mental health goes down the drain. Negativity gets to me, I always want to lay down, I never want to go anywhere, I cry over everything ect. I've heard of PMDD and PMS But I don't know what to do."
1589,"Obsessed with my own depression, how do I stop?","Hi there.

So, I've been depressed since I was eight years old (I'm 21 now). I've been on dozens of different meds, seen tons of therapists, done basically everything that can be done. I've always been doing poorly, but lately my suffering has been unbearable. I'm obsessed with my own depression. All that I can think about is how bad I feel, how the treatments aren't working, what treatments could work, if treatments work at all. I'm terrified that I will be sad forever, since I can't remember a time I wasn't sad. I'm not sure if happiness exists at all. Sometimes I get distracted, but whenever I have a moment to laugh or get excited, I just end up thinking ""this isn't enough, you still feel terrible"". I try to do meditation and all that stuff but nothing makes it better. I want to get better so badly, but I feel like I won't be able to get better until I stop obsessing over how I feel and how to fix it.

How do I stop these thoughts from controlling my life? And if anyone can give me some message of hope, please give it."
1590,I dont know what to do,"I personally use the term ""I don’t know"", for ""I haven’t thought that far because of ending my life"".

I need help on where to start"
1591,Have I been a manipulative and horrible person my entire life?,"Honestly, I feel that I have been someone like that... And I could still be as well.

Ever since a few years ago, I kept blaming an Asperger misdiagnosis as the main reason for my suffering **(never had it, I'm neurotypical, and I made a mistake saying that)**, but I've had trouble connecting with people ever since I was younger...

Got some memories from when I was 12-13... 

I was a selfish person back then, not sociopathic or anything like that but...

I remember I wanted to be popular and famous, I was a boot-licker towards teachers and classmates (in the sense that I agreed with them in a servile way, just in case), and I developed a defense mechanism to act in a child-like way to gain protection against bullies.

Now... I think that because of those attitudes of mine, people started to bully me a lot more than before.

My own way of acting made them hate me and despise me, and they constantly hurt me or used me as a tool as punishment for my selfish way of being...

For the rest of high school (when I was 15-18), I was bullied a lot, almost no one cared about me, they made me realize in actions and words that I didn't matter, and that created the bases of my current personality... And not only there...

Wherever I went, my bad luck followed me. Even after high school (where I somehow managed to make a few friends), things went downhill...

Flunked out of my first college career because I ended up making four enemies there (although it wasn't my entire fault, maybe 60% of it), and not being able to learn those topics... 

After the misdiagnosis, many people treated me in a child-like way, they stopped taking me seriously, they stopped reaching out, and I learned that I burned countless bridges beyond repair...

In my current college career, I've had five semesters of classes (six if you count the orientation semester), and I don't have a single close friend there... And as another irony, I have four enemies there as well.

Had two, but my way of being pissed them off so much that they ended up hating me and bullying me for it... One of my best friends defended me from them, and they apologized a few months later but, I feel that if I changed, that wouldn't have happened at all...

I also drifted away from countless people either because I was too much of a coward to reach out, or because I pissed them off, or for promises I didn't fulfill, or even when some of them apologized and wanted to reach out again I didn't value it...

Aside from that best friend I mentioned, I only have 3-4 people I'm still somewhat close to (another best friend and a few close friends), all the others are either acquaintances/classmates or casual friends I ended up drifting away from...

And it's all my fault.

I must be wrong, or at least have most of the blame, because if so many people ended up leaving or snapping at me, there's no way all of them can be wrong, right?

The worst part is... I became paranoid, distrustful of others, I have so much repressed anger that I'm afraid that someday I'll end up screaming at someone, I've doubted people whom I shouldn't have ever done so... All of that, plus not being able how to understand others, being inmature and annoying, happened because of those mistakes I made when I was younger...

I'm almost alone, I don't know how to fix this, I haven't even done the tasks my psychologist gave me...

I don't want to burden my family anymore, I don't want to be a burden to anyone else anymore..."
1592,Dear 80-year-old Me.,[removed]
1593,Mental health and how it is affecting my relationship with the love of my life,"Hello all, just to give you a warning this is probably gunna be quite a long post. So much has happened and is going on there's no real way to make it short.

So to get into it I am F23 and my now recent ex is M24. We were together for about 3 years give or take and he was and still is my best friend. Early on in the relationship I saw some issues within himself that causes conflict between us but most importantly himself. He would have fits of rage brought on by what seemed to be anxiety, like he wasn't good enough for me. If I gave an opinion about an idea he had it would make him to believe I thought he was stupid and he would become over the top angry. For the longest time I just thought he has anger management problems, as our relationship developed more and we lived together I started noticing other things. He would get extremely depressed and be in a slump and then would have extreme angry energy like he couldn't balance out. I am no therapist or psychiatrist but I have been diagnosed with bipolar manic depressive when I was 14 and have found a pretty healthy way of living with it through years of therapy. Watching the way he struggles reminds me so much of how I used to be when I had no help.or understanding of what was wrong with me. I believe maybe he could also have something going on that's more then just mood swings if you get what I'm saying. Anyways, he was taunted by these ideas of me thinking he was useless, ugly, not good enough, stupid, pretty much a waste of life and that he only made my life bad. I worked very hard on trying to reassure him that those thoughts aren't real and that they are being manifested from insecurities, but it's really hard to change someone's mind when they start to believe the delusions are real. He progressively got worse he was so unhappy with life nothing would make him feel like there's a point to anything. But then there would be a week where his sex drive would be intensely high and couldn't keep his hands off me and then it would drop again, following the cycles that I recognized from the beginning. He's never leveled out. All of this led to some recent situations we have been going through. He broke up with me 4 times in a month and got back with me 4 times in a month, he was becoming hysterical he was almost unrecognizable. It's like he hated me but as soon as I left he realized that I am not the issue it's all the demons inside his head that are making him believe I am the problem because he has tried to change everything else and he's still not happy. This led to him cheating on me and I broke up with him because that's the final straw for me. He is now living at his aunt's while he's trying to find a place of his own and he now agrees that his mind was the issue and not me and that the bad thoughts in his head made him hate me because they told him I hated him when I love him so much. I just want him to be okay. He is now worst than before he said he doesn't know what his mind is saying it's just gibberish and nothing makes sense, he says he's having a hard time holding on. I try to be there for him and he tells me he loves me so much but that he's afraid if I'm around him he's going to hurt me more (not physically) because he can't control his thoughts or his moods. He starts therapy in 2 days something that should've happened a long time ago and he said once he gets help he wants to earn me back, but I am so afraid that something bad is going to happen and idk what to do. He never talks about hurting himself but he is just so down in this hole and I can't do anything to help. I remind him everyday that he is an amazing person and that he can get through this but again he doesn't believe me he believes the demons in his head. I feel like all I can do is wait and give him this time to find help and maybe one day he will come back to me and maybe one day he can live life and enjoy it. 

Don't know what I'm really looking for out of this post but maybe if someone has advice I would appreciate it. Thanks for reading"
1594,I need advice to help a friend,A friend of mine just told me he is depressed and the only thing that makes him happy is masturbating. Has anyone else gone through something similar? What can i tell him to make him feel better?
1595,Diagnosis BPD,"Got diagnosed today. Can anyone tell me how they cope with it and how they make their lives ok? I know I have problems, but I have no idea what it means."
1596,What the fuck,"I was in a car with my sister today. We were driving on thw highest hill in my town and i could see the whole city and forests around. Suddenly i thoinght to my self ""Wow there is a lot of places i could kill myself in and nobody would find me this place is huge"". What the fuck is wrong with my brain."
1597,Ah Parents,Love when my mom invalidates my anxiety by telling me to stop overreacting and just calm down🥰🥰
1598,i have no one to talk to. nobody.,"hello. i'm a 14 year old female with no friends. i'm about to turn 15. see, i've had a traumatic past with people and school. i've been physically/verbally abused a lot, and this is been going on for 2 years. toxic friends is a plus. 

so i started self-harming. i wanted to escape the fact that everything mattered. the mentality of keeping the label of ""giving no fucks"" meant a lot. after years and years of being pressured to do certain actions, was so repulsive that i had to urge to cut. 

this was several months ago, but when school started (not online anymore) in late august, the mindset is gradually coming back. i was so traumatized that i was afraid some similar incidents were going to happen to me again. i couldn't focus on schoolwork, i couldn't even flash a grin at someone. the fact that i'm keeping this all to myself hurt a bit more, so i decided to talk to my parents.

when i talked to my parents about this, they either didn't take any of this seriously, or ignored me. they were like ""just be happy! easy!"" or ""stop being sad"" which sounds incredibly vague. it's like they think i'm making up jokes. i was genuinely upset.

like i stated previosuly, they may ignore my statement and just nod on, absorbed into looking at their phone and texting their friends. same for my sister when i tried to talk to her.

when i talked to them about a therapist, my parents both agreed that they wouldn't pay for one because it's very expensive, and i accept that. its their money anyway. 

my main point is that i have nobody to talk to. what should i do?"
1599,I am spiraling,"My therapist has needed to cancel several appointments recently and now all of our appointments in October. That's fine, I understand that she has stress going on. I don't even know if therapy (CBT, what we do) would help. 

TW: mentions eating disorders, suicide, dissociation, family deaths (not by suicide.) 

About 2 years ago I struggled heavily with dysmorphia and an eating disorder. In that time I was extremely dissociated. I find myself back in that place. My eating isn't currently disordered but I am sitting here crying over my appearance. I have a recessed jaw. I've gotten braces and am still wearing them, doctors are talking about pulling teeth and doing jaw surgery. Which I would do, but I want to be positive that I will get the results I want. I have a very hard time talking to the doctors and asking questions and I have nobody in my life who can support me with that. 

I know this seems like such a vain thing, and maybe it is. But I feel so incredibly ugly. I am either hyperfocused on my appearance or completely ignore it. When I ignore it I tend to dress lazily in a way that doesn't make me feel good. I have no confidence, generally not interested in sex. But I don't deal with this fixation on how much I hate my appearance. It's the opposite when I am focused on it. My eating disorder was more than just hating my looks, but on the surface it very much appears that way. And I can't hide that right now I genuinely am disgusted by myself. 

I find it very interesting that when I'm dissociated I start to focus on my body. In a big way, I feel like this is my mind distracting me from all the actually important stress I have. 3 days from now will be the 6 year anniversary of my moms death. I'm sure my body doesn't like that. I don't like this time of year, it is very hard for me to function. 

Again, I'm just dissociated and feel perpetually ""derealized."" I haven't been able to take care of my body and I want to try, I want to eat better and exercise and I've taken steps to begin that but now that I'm beginning to think about that it's triggering the absolute fuck out of me. I can't look at pictures of myself even a couple weeks ago without getting triggered. It's because of my extremely skewed view of myself. I don't know what I look like. 

I had a night a week or so ago that I was genuinely suicidal which doesn't happen very often for me anymore. Sure, I have the thought that I don't want to exist pretty much constantly. But I was actually suicidal. And then after that everything just turned off and I either feel stress or numb or self hate. I can enjoy myself to an extent but I don't look forward to anything. I don't want to do anything. I guess the exercise was something I wanted to do but it's opened up a huge can of worms I'd rather leave in 2018. 

I rarely smoke to avoid my emotions. I've been doing it every once in a while (I'd say the past month or two. Before then I never smoked to avoid emotions) when I am overwhelmed by self hate. The personal self hate I feel makes me want to harm myself. The aesthetic self hatred I feel is tiring, distressingly confusing and often leaves me helpless. I feel both right now. I don't want to smoke since I really wanted to accomplish something in my personal life after work, maybe dishes, literally anyting - but I'm exhausted and I know smoking will make it worse. I guess it's not like I can get anything done like this anyways. I don't even have the energy to get up and eat. I want to, I'm hungry. But I don't want to get up and I don't want to create another dish. My roommate never helps do anything but contributes to the mess constantly. That's a whole other story though. 

Thank you for reading."
1600,Limbo,Really weird feeling lately. I feel like I’m in limbo??? I’ve been really productive but the past weekend I had an emotional breakdown. I really stressed out by someone and much more. But now I feel like I may be depressed but I don’t feel it. I just feel unproductive and unmotivated. I tried to do something’s but half way through I decide that I don’t feel like it. But that’s not me. I’ve been very productive before this mishap. Now I feel just hopeless. Very lost. No motivation to do anything. I feel like the world around me could be burning down and I would not bat an eyelash.
1601,When is it okay to flip out?,"Hey so I'm a 30m with anxiety issues and come out as anger. My long time SO and I are trying to come up with ways to work through the issues while my doctor gave me a beta blocker. My main problem is stupidity in others, and getting my time wasted.

Today I went to McDonald's. They gave me the wrong drink. I ordered diet coke and 4 mc chickens, got dr pepper. Went back, and they fixed the order. Got home and realized they gave me 4 mc doubles instead of 4 mc chickens. I got angry pretty quickly, but also got over it pretty quickly, went back and got my correct food. I took my SO's advice and was nice to the McDonald's person. 

I don't feel as though I projected my anger onto my SO, but she's ""punishing""  me so to say for it, telling me that I had a major meltdown and I ""lost"" for the day. 

This is an issue that keeps coming up. When is it OKAY to get angry? How many times do they need the fuck up the SAME order before it is okay for me to feel some sort of way about it? This is just one example of a situation that keeps arising."
1602,I have nothing to hide,I wake up confused and I forget. In on anxiety medication so maybe it's that but I often don't know if im dreaming or not I can't  remember my alarm I can't remember him calling me I'm really tired now. But i have to exercise. Do I do my exercises or sleep. It's rehabilitation excersices for a knee operation
1603,"Obsessively thinking I am missing something whenever leaving the house or just doing something like taking a shower, to the point where it makes me feel naked and vulnerable.","Too many times to count I will check all my pockets to see if I have everything, and after that I just get even more anxious about it. This has probably been asked so many times but I wanna hear from some actual people.

Thanks :)"
1604,Mourning before death,"I recently found out my grandad is terminal and no one not even the doctors have any clue how long he may have left. I'm going to see him this weekend but I am dreading it, I know I'm supposed to want to go see him since I may never see him again but the idea of leaving on Sunday and risking never getting another chance to speak to him is unbearable, I almost don't want to go but that feels selfish. I feel like I'm mourning him but he isn't even dead yet. I should probably talk to someone about my feelings but knowing me that isn't going to happen so I'm resorting to jettisoning my ideas onto reddit in a vague attempt at pretending things are better than they really are. Ill take any ideas about that I should be feeling to be honest because I've just never had to deal with something like this. I've dealt with death before but never like this, it was always so sudden and in my mind it was never any different to someone just leaving. The fact that my grandad isn't even dead yet but knowing he will be somehow makes it worse than if I woke up one day and he was gone, I'm being forced by circumstance to confront my own mortality and its really not that fun. I suppose this kind if scenario should be normal really I mean we can die at any time and we all know that we will die some day but there is something horrifyingly total about the fact that one very soon and very unknown day I will simply loose such a big piece of my life. I think that even if I just had a time frame it would be infinitely better, if I had an idea of how long I had I would feel so much better because I would be able to organise and make the most of what I have left with him but there's just nothing I can do, its all utterly hopeless, I am stuck here, watching a man I grew up adoring knowing that everyday is a game of Russian roulette for him and his cancer crippled organs are pulling the trigger, I am stuck knowing the outcome of an event that is going to happen but never knowing when it will happen, only that it will be soon. I feel so useless, there is literally nothing I can do, and I fear that even after this weekend I will go back home and it will be no different, impending loss will hang over me and I will sit their and accept it as I wish for million miracles that just aren't going to come. What the fuck am I supposed to do?"
1605,Counseling VS Social Work???,Hello! Since I want to become a therapist I am either thinking of pursuing a Masters in Counseling/Social Work. Any advice on that? Also which of the following is better in terms of job opportunities and salary? 1) LCSW 2) LPC or 3) LMFT ? Thank you!
1606,I strongly suspect having BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Should I mention it to my psychiatrist?,"I've made a lot of research on BPD in the past weeks and I tick all the boxes. I read many articles and studies on the disorder I've found that I fit every aspect of it.

I want to ask my psychiatrist about this for a potential diagnosis and therefore treatment/support but I'm unsure about it.

I feel like an idiot just thinking about it, I don't want to sound like I want attention by pretending to have a disorder and I fear being ridiculed for it."
1607,Does anyone know what this is?,"Sometimes I get this state of mind that everyone that does something for me does it with a secret reason in mind. Sometimes I believe this and I just get sad or angry before I find out it wasn’t that big of a deal or just a simple cause.

E.g. my friend can’t hang out with me tonight. I get this feeling it’s because they don’t like me and won’t tell me, when in reality they were just busy with school.

Or when someone else was assigned a task at work it wasn’t because that my boss hates me and thinks I’m doing a bad job but because my coworker needed to learn the task as well.

Does anyone recognise this?"
1608,I don’t think i can do this for much longer.,"I had an anxiety attack earlier. 


I 15m feel guilty for basically everything i do, even if i just think about it i don’t know why. I am around 1.5 years without self harming and i really don’t want to do it again but i have had those thoughts since it stopped. 


I now feel really quite depressed and i’m crying again now because i’m scared of basically everything. Anxiety just makes everything worse. I feel guilty for literally everything i do and think. 


If i do anything wrong, even mess a conversation up, i have to apologise because i’m scared of if i did anything wrong or something. 


I have Adhd, anxiety and depression. Anxiety is probably the biggest and worst thing in my life right now. It’s breaking me. It makes me worried and scared about everything i do. I can’t even say “excuse me” if i need to get past someone or something. I only eat alone now because i’m just scared and stuff. 


People at school make jokes and stuff and find it funny but it sticks with me and adds on to the others. It’s non stop. 


I basically come home every day and cry. 


I hide my emotions from everyone.  I have done for the last 4 years and i can’t do it for much longer. 


I almost broke down in class because they were talking about anxiety and how different people deal with it. I almost just walked straight out. I had to try and distract myself from it. 


I am losing motivation for everything. I feel like i can’t do this. I think i’m just gonna end up crying myself to sleep so i really apologise if i don’t reply because it’s 00:00am. 


There is gonna be one day where i just break down infront of everyone and get judged and laughed at by everyone because they will see me cry and stuff, or i have an anxiety attack in class or i won’t be here anymore. 


People who make jokes or say things that don’t think will effect me, they do. They stick and are adding to the 4-5 years worth of crap in my head that i’m hiding from everyone. At school i’m becoming less hyper. As i’m known for being the crazy one because of adhd, i’m just not myself. I haven’t taken my meds in almost a week, it started because i forgot and now i don’t really want to but i know it will help. 


I don’t want to go to school, i just want to be left alone in my room with someone who i can trust to just let everything out with no worries or judgements at all. But that will probably never happen. 


I’m really sorry for this post being really long. I can’t even read it because i can’t keep focus for long and stuff. But yeah, if i don’t reply, i’ll be either crying a bit more, or going to sleep. 

Thankyou"
1609,Idk how too come out,"I am gay but idk how I to come out, its been really stressful"
1610,Here's my story of how I almost went Insane.,"  as someone who once had a imaginary world for 4.5 years. I grew up really antisocial. I was really lonely and alone during my childhood. I have ADHD so adaptig to the social norms was difficult to me. It all started when I shockically played Mario and Luigi Partners i Time. When I played it, I got REALLY into it, but not towards the good guys, The Shroobs was what attracted me into it. SO I created a made up world called Shroobville in my head. Along with a shitload of other shit from other sources of media at the time. To be brief. I had 4 imaginary friends. They were humanoid Shroobs but didn't look like them at all. They were called Shroob 1,2,3, and 4.  1 had blue hair, eyes and tongue, 2 had red hair, eyes and tongue. He was meant to be the more short tempered, strong member of the group. 3 had purple hair, tongue and eyes. He was the smart one of the group and 4 was orange. He was the speedy wild party one. I got so entranced with these imaginary friends that I used to actually think they were real and that I was an alien from the shroob planet. I thought I had psychic powers because anything I saw in real life media. Ex: PSI in Earthbound and Mother 3. I made the Shroob Team have them. They were literal gods, They couldn't die, they could do whatever they wanted. They ruled the planet and I went so far that I tried to contact them in real life, asking them to come to earth and abduct me in a UFO so I could Live with them in peace. However, since they weren't real, that never happened. Throughout the first half of high school. people were asking me to shout out certain PSI powers to make me look stupid. I even tried to convince others that I was an alien who crashed on earth, as a sperm cell. The story I explained was that I fell into a salad belonging to my father, he ate me, unaware of my existence and somehow, I managed to swim into his testacies and that's how I was born. I literately sounded insane. My mom was aware of this. I was freaking some people out. I sounded like I belonged in a mental ward. Luckily during grade 10. I had an awful nightmare that scared me awake. My body was freaking out, I was so scared and uncomfterable, I was crying uncontrolabality and even had thoughts of ending my life to make the pain stop. I guess my head couldn't take it anymore. This was when I had SEVERE anxiety problems and panic attacks. I didn't want to live like this anymore so I decided that I had to change my lifestyle. It was time to grow up so I had a private tearful farewell to my imaginary friends. I was crying all night, saying goodbye to over 30 imaginary friends. And I visualized all of them being erased from existence and therefore, I was free. Over the years I adjusted to reality and I actually found Actual friends, I sounded more mature and I could do whatever I wanted to do, that was possible and legal. I put the past behind me through I had mild panic attacks when I thought of the Shroob Team but now that passed on. I could play Partners in time without letting them bother me and and just put that part of my past behind me. FOREVER.  TL:DR I almost became a Chris chan 2.0."
1611,Need advice please,"Hello

I’ve (F 25) had depression for a while now (around 18mns) and I probably would have described myself as high functioning for most of the time (despite previous self-harm and intentions of suicide). I’ve been declining the last 6 months or so, mostly due to a new medical diagnosis but there’s a few other things going on. I then was given a “less than ideal” update on my health condition (nothing fatal, just impacts my life significantly and will do so for who knows how long) that has really got me down. That was about 1.5 weeks ago. I feel like I have shutdown and I don’t want anything to do with anyone/anything. I am currently on sick leave from work, and I don’t want to go back. I rarely get myself out of bed. I have no motivation nor any enjoyment for anything. I am so sad and I feel hurt. I skipped my Psych appointment (although, I went after he followed up on it as I didn’t want to cause any alarm and get myself into another mess). I am not suicidal which is a change. I am just numb. 

Basically, I am writing here because I don’t want to talk to anyone, but I still want to ask... what am I actually meant to do now? I feel like this can’t go on like this forever. 

Thanks"
1612,Weird dead feeling,"It all started when I was in 6th grade in Waikiki. Still vividly remember it. I suddenly had a conscious thought that I was slowing dying, I didn’t know how or why I felt it. But I started feeling and I felt it. It was a very weird feeling and assumed a deep sleep would knock the feeling away. But it turns out it never goes away and always sticks with me. I really didn’t mind it for a while but I felt alone apart from the world since I had it. I explained to my parents over 5 times but they never really payed attention. Even my friends make fun of me for having this weird feeling. They even avoided me because I was slightly acting “negative.” Maybe I have depression? I don’t like to act fake and have depression so I’m quite not sure what this feeling is. I’ve asked if anyone had this feeling, but unfortunately, no one did. It’s a very complex feeling that I don’t know how to explain. I read the cotard’s delusion but it quite wasn’t the right answer. 

But I’ll list somethings I feel with this “dying” sensation
•Every time I don’t get enough sleep or stay up all night, I feel even more dead than I was. After I sleep, the feeling stays the same
•it always gets worse and never gets better
•feels like I’m not in my body
•feels like my brain isn’t working/i can’t think properly or concentrate 
•causes a lot of memory loss, forget about each move I make every second unless it was something memorable 
•Feels like my eyes are working but my head is shut off"

1614,"I look forward to nothing in life anymore. Everything is just anxiety, pain and disappointment. I no longer want to live.",It's exactly as the title says. The only things that keep me going are temporary escapes. I worry constantly and everything just seems so unhappy in life. My life feels like a mess that can't be cleaned up.
1615,Hypomanic episode? I have no clue?,"So I had a longer hypomanic episode before- diagnosed. It was not pleasant. I've always been a very hyperactive and upbeat person, so its not astonishingly shocking and can be hard to tell. I'm pretty sure I've had short episodes since. Not bipolar. Have depression anx and ADHD, however, pretty sure I'm In a semi- hypomanic episode rn, I am acc sleeping, which is strange cos usually I can't, I'm Fucking exhausted actually, I feel like I want to start a riot, and like I have 110 things to do and my brain genuinely feels so racey that it feels like beat boxers are having a battle in it, I'm irritable and angry, able to cry? Which I struggle with normally. I am on concertra for ADHD, believe I accidentally took too much the other day and have had a crazy crazy few weeks. The term is not euphoria and my hypomania is rarely euphoric but can be super productive, but makes me do strange things and feel hyper sensitive to any stress or problems. It makes me want to do awfully weird things like go on mile runs in the night or sing loudly in the street, talk so much. My ADHD tablets just do not help in these states but are completely helpful when I'm at my baseline. I'm concerned because I feel so overwhelmed to the point I lit want to beat somebody up, or like do something major for attention, not harmful, I'm not depressed right now, but go through episodes from mild to severe over the years. WTF is wrong with me I just can't seem to have a stable mood. At first I was concerned about bipolar but now I am seeing perhaps triggers to this hypomania, but is that still hypomania if it can be triggered because I notice triggers"
1616,Being suicidal,"The craziest thing to me is that my experience with trying to commit suicide is all of the repercussions. Firstly, why deal with a mentally unstable human in such a way. My experience at the hospital was absolutely horrendous. The whole time while at the hospital it was consistent verbal abuse and at time physical, whilst I understand they just do there jobs it sucks that it had to be done in such a shit way. Then on top of this I put other people's life on hold just because I cannot handle my own situation. I'm writing this because the bill just came in... It's 5 thousand dollars which is more than I completely have.. the honest truth about all this is that it boils down to the care of the whole operation.... I think suicide in my instance was more of a cry for help than anything else... And they shove you in a fucking room, yell at you and send you out with a 5 thousand dollar bill.. with nothing to show for it than a still mentally deranged person and no money in his pocket or fucking support from the hospital... It sucks so fucking much... Fuck the health care system.."

Do I want to die? Mhmm

Does it not really matter though because I won’t act of those thoughts? Yep

Is my mind filled with destructive and intrusive thoughts as a way of subconsciously distracting myself from the grief I haven’t welcomed in my life from losing a loved one to suicide two years ago? Yeah, probably 

Am I going to do anything about it? Not likely

Do I feel like I’m failing therapy because of that? You’ve got it"
1621,I made a mistake and was met with a lot of hostility. I’ve been anxious about it all day and last night,"(sorry, some slight spoilers for The Legend of Korra, if that matters)

also tw // s**cide

&gt;!There’s a pretty large head canon that, at the end of season one, Korra is about to commit s**cide when she cries on a cliffside. Korra is a really dear character to me because the show later depicts her fighting through PTSD and depression. She’s just one of those tv characters that I feel really connected to.!&lt;

This is where I made a mistake, and it’s haunting me for more reasons than one. I made a mindless comment about how I like to believe that Korra wouldn’t do that and isn’t a quitter because her strength is a huge motivator for me. The word “quitter” was an oversimplification because it’s such a triggering subject and it felt easier than going into more detail

Someone very hostilely pointed out that I lack an understanding of the subject for me to word it that way. I said that I related it to my own experience when I was in the same exact position and the ugly voice in my head repeatedly told me to “quit” in that moment. The person continued to say that they don’t know anyone that would “stoop so low as to fake being s**cidal [to win an argument]” and later continued to say that I was disgusting and an asshole for victimizing myself

I don’t know, I guess I’m just looking for validation, and maybe even forgiveness. I know I was wrong with my wording and for victimizing myself as a defense mechanism. But the hostility has been eating at me all day. I almost threw up earlier today. I haven’t been in this much anxiety in a while. I was in such shock at this person that I blocked them so that I don’t see their comments anymore. I’ve never shared such a depressing part of my life for it to be met with words like “disgusting” “faking it” or “you’re an asshole.”

I’m totally receptive to constructive criticism, it’s ok if you’d like to bring clarity to the other person’s side. I understand that emotions ran high but I just can’t help feeling anxious. Also sorry for the long-ish explanation but it also helped to just type this all out"

I’ve also mentioned to her the EMDR and brain spotting that I have done and she’s said that she does not believe in that sort of work and wants to “just talk to someone.” Any advice?"
1625,Feeling lost,"i don’t really know where im going with this but i cant talk to anybody about it because they don’t fully understand. lately i’ve been incredibly stressed out to the point where im losing hair, im only 24. everything always feels like it’s pushing down on me and no matter how hard i try it always feels like sadness and doubt are right around the corner. my job pays me little to nothing to where i can’t really afford bills, i don’t feel like i can actually tell anybody my issues, i catch myself just thinking about suicide, and i just always feel so used. i care about people and the people i socialize with but i just wish i could be more open with them about things without feeling like a burden or as if i’m looking for attention. 

i’m posting this because i feel like someone on here may be going through the same shit as me and i just want to let you know that your not alone, we’re in this boat together, and one day we will see land. we can’t give up or give in, we have to be strong (i may even be talking to myself at this point but still)"

1631,An effort to spread awareness and share my thoughts.,"My name is Mackenzie. A fellow teenager of 14, nearly 15.

This post will be  incredibly long, but is of  an incredibly important nature, so please read it all.

First, I wrote a poem, or a song.

Pain-

My insecurities are burning through me,
I change who I am so that people don't see
The pain that I'm in, and I try constantly,
To face them, embrace them, my insecurities.

My emotions confuse me, they're tearing me up, 
I put on a smile but that ain't enough. 
I'm losing this battle, my feelings are too rough, whe I feel like giving up, but I try to act tough. 

I try hard to focus, on the good things I have, 
My friends are amazing, my family love me back. 
But my feelings suppress them, I start to lose track, 
Of what I have left, and I continue to crack. 

Depression, emotions, these unspoken things, 
Anxiety, fear, that constant feeling, 
That you are not worth it, that you don't fit in, 
Take over your body, they are life destroying. 

People say that I'm perfect, but little does that help, 
I know these things are true, but I still push myself, 
Further and further, down into the ground, 
I'm up in the clouds, reality knocks me down. 

Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I'm broken 
I bottle my problems, I give into them. 
I know that just talking can help, I've got friends, 
But I'm not worth the effort and so I pretend. 

I struggle, I worry, I cry and I scream, 
But I know it's no use, I can't be heard or seen. 
I wonder what life would be like without pain. 
Breathing in the harsh air, til I don't breathe again. 

And, hopefully you have got this far, now a message. 

As someone who struggles, like many teenagers, and young people, with insecurities, worries, depression, judgment, harassment or bullying, and someone who is aware of the harsh rise in mental health issues, I wrote the song/poem to try and spread as much awareness as possible.
 The pressure put on the young today can have massively overbearing effects on later years. Being young as I am, some may find things that I've said or will say invalid, but I believe that anyone can take the time to understand issues like these, regardless of wether they are young or not.
 I'm not going to pretend that I have experienced, or fully understand what everyone else is going through, but I make an effort to try. What I do understand is that bottling up your issues worries or whatever you may label them, can destroy a life.
 In spreading this message, I hope to make people see, understand, realise that, as I have been reminded by my friends, that you are perfect. There is not just one definition of the word perfect, there has been billions, and currently is  over 7.8 billion definitions of the word. Each individual different, each perfect by their own way. You are beautiful. You are worth it, worth everything, to me, to everyone in your life, and even the planet.
 That's billions of people, each of whom love you, each of  whom  is also perfect. Each little quirk that you have, each individual aspect of you, every little thing about you, is perfect. 5here will be people who disregard this post, but I guarantee this  post  also applies to them perhaps less or perhaps more so. 
There is only one life you get to live for definite right now, so live it in the light. Cringy or blunt or metaphoric though that may sound, it is entirely true. Live your life, embrace your pain, anxiety, sadness, and everything else, and use them to push you, towards happiness, towards your goals, towards your future. These words may help, and I hope infinitely that they do, but they may not. For that, I apologise wholeheartedly and solemnly.
 I may not be experienced, or have experienced everything that I have spoken or will speak about.,but I have experienced enough to not want to stand back and watch others suffer, weather it be less, equally or more than I have. If you are or feel close to the edge, step back. Go to the people you love, and talk to them. Talking, I know can feel like the hardest thing, but it is the most rewarding thing too. 
And if you feel like there is no one that loves you, find someone. Remember that there will forever be people that love you, for you. No matter what. 

Please, spread this message, tell me if I have missed something, said something wrong, criticise me, thank me, talk to me. Message me if you want to, to talk about anything and I'll try my best to help. 
Spread this message for Andrew Leach. For James Myles. For McKenzie Adams, for Hailie Mass on. For Niegel Shelby. For the 264+million people who suffer from depression. For the 7.8 billion people who suffer from mental health issues. For you, for me, for us. 

Please repost this, share this, spread this in any and every way you can. 

Please, do not spread hate or cause unnecessary damage in the commennts or community, or anywhere at all. And if you read this far, thank you very, very much."
1632,im scared and tired for the ones i love. i need advice. [TW!!],"TW: heavily discusses negative mental health and intentional death by oneself and self injury. 

hi all. please stop reading now if you are triggered easily. this is a rant/need for advice. reddit is the only place i have to explain these things- everyone else is going through too much.

a close family member passed away in august in a lost battle with depression. i survived an attempt a few months ago and have gotten better since. but around me, my loved ones may be loosing the same battle.

my family always had a negative mental health record. it has taken lives in my family. and now another is gone. im fearful that my mother, father and brothers may be taking the same road. my mom is drinking and smoking and getting worse. i know my parents dont want to exist.

my girlfriend (im a lesbian) isnt okay either. not one of my friends are okay. one of them in specific is at a point where i start to panic when they text me. im terrified. i dont know how to help anymore. im so tired. im so angry. i love all my friends and for years ive tried so hard to support them all through their issues. i cant take it. i began to self injure every day starting january. i am a few weeks clean and i feel guilty for feeling not so bad while my world is falling apart around me. i know soon i will face another few months of what caused me to self injure in the first place. i know the school will try to send me to a mental hospital again. im scared. my life is falling apart. my friends and family are dying. 

if i take a break from them all i know at least one will end up dead. ive been told im the only thing keeping them alive. im trying to hard to help all these people and it hurts. i cant stop. i know for a fact once one friend goes, so will the rest. we all know it. we all know it’s inevitable. i dont know what to do. im lost. i cant sleep anymore in case one of them needs me in the middle of the night. i cant do this."
1633,New sub for alternate faith followers who face discrimination or mental health issues.," Hey guys, I thought I would make you aware of a sub that has been made called [r/ThinkMagick](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThinkMagick/) that is a new safe and open space designed to help those who face persecution/mental health issues for their beliefs. In the past I have faced targeted persecution for who I am and the faith I follow so I understand how it feels to be treated badly for a belief.

I know many people in life suffer because of their chosen faith, because they do not align with common thought or beliefs. I have not found a sub-reddit that caters to providing a safe space where people can get help from like minded people and hopefully make friends and discuss their interests with others.

ThinkMagick is a combination of discussion page, support group and community that attempts to break down barriers and bring people who are different together.

I hope this is the right space to share it as I understand this isn't necessarily directly tied to mental health, however too many people suffer and thereby do not practice their craft in peace. Being treated fairly and equally is just as important to the craft as ritual work and belief, for everyone deserved equality, regardless of belief. I thought I would share it here as I am a practicing witch (be it a baby-witch) and understand the difficulties some face, thereby I created this page to help others who are facing equally challenging times. 

This page is a mental health page designed to help practitioners of alternate faiths/beliefs who suffer from discrimination or mental health issues. I decided to highlight it here as often people who practice do not realise there are other like minded people out there who are willing to help.  

(P.s Sorry if I have breached any community rules. I am unsure if I have. I apologise if I have. If so please let me know and remove the post. I would be grateful if you could let me know where else to post this as I feel encouraging good mental health amongst practitioners needs to be wider spread and have greater emphasis placed upon it)"
1634,Why am I depressed but can’t sleep?,When your depressed do you sleep more or stay awake? Cause I’ve been only getting like 2-4 hours of sleep a night.
1635,I hate my family,"You’re afraid of online class? That’s illogical so it’s impossible!

Want therapy? Why? We don’t have family history so it’s impossible that you’re crazy! You should be able to fix yourself so deal with it yourself after I tell you and make you “promise” to be better.

Oh, you’re crying? I can’t f-ing understand you so fix your speech while I keep talking down on you on things I assumed from what little I saw from your recent behavior that I only noticed because it resulted in problems and of course I should ignore the fact that  you’re literally crying!

And also why are you so distant? You don’t make sense even if I just never really spent enough time with you to know that all your behavior has been consistent for the past decade plus you’re starting to withdraw even more. Stop blaming us because since we worked and gave you money and provided you with stuff so we couldn’t have gone wrong with anything else like maybe how we neglected you and your siblings and expect you to be as well-adjusted and responsible as we are."
1636,My Mum ignored my mental health issues growing up and now I can't stop resenting her,"F22. Growing up I progressively got worse and worse handelling symptoms of ADHD (which I've only just recently started the process of being diagnosed with) along with misphonia. Instead of helping me she always cirtisied me, everything related to ADHD was me being lazy and selfish and with the misphonia it was always again me being selfish and it inconveniencing her ending in her not getting mw help or at least making an effort not to trigger it.

Fast forward to now and I have gotten better at handelling both of these but my resentment stands. And my misphonia has not eased when it comes to her,she still does all the stuff that irritate me (chewing gum, eating crisps) knowing full well they do, never gotten me help for it. It's bad association mixed with a mental health disorder- association being I used to stick wet tissue in my ear to block out the sound and scratch myself until I bled when she did these things that irritate me. 

She knows I may have ADHD and according to numerous online tests I've taken my symptoms suggest severe, and she knows that the noise thing is misphonia, yet she has never even bothered to look into these things as some sort of redemption and apologise for never trying to help me or support me. My life has been impossibly hard and I don't know how to forgive her and move past this."
1637,"Is it normal that among all the people lining up for their scheduled psychiatric appointment, I feel like my problems are not as serious as theirs, and I don't think I deserve the psychiatrist's time.",This is just my 2nd visit to the doctor on my 15th day of Sertraline. I actually feel a little better now. I feel a little more optimistic compared to other days where my brain was fogging up and numbing.
1638,Frozen in place,"Through a series of hard life challenges that I couldn't quite match up to I have found myself stuck. Seems I've been pretty depressed for the past 2 and a half years. Things started not working out in California and I had to leave the west coast. That cut deep. When things were going bad out there I was embarrassed about failing and never talked to my friends and the people I care about with it. I began isolating myself.
 By the time I moved back to my hometown I went from having all of the friends and being a respected member of my community to not being able to show my face to all but 5 of my closest friends. I was starting to get better. A year after being home I was getting involved with the local burner community and bringing my projects to events and volunteering. It was starting to bring back a part of my sense of self as burning man plays a large part in my life and my ideals. I had found a new job and was performing adequately. 
Let's jump forward to just before Covid. 
My grandmother pretty suddenly passed away. My aunt (mother's sister) (bad history) did not tell me or my mom when grandma got sick. We learned through extended family just before she passed. Losing my grandmother, feeling helpless and seeing my mother in distress had gotten me drinking. Then covid happened. Furloughed from work and isolated at home got my drinking more. 
I was trying to cope with the stress of being alone and furthermore being stuck to dwell on my failures. At this time I started feeling paralyzed. When I am with friends I have plenty to say but cannot open my mouth. At home I have things to but I cannot move to do them. I got stuck in a fantasy where I win the lotto don't have to work and can afford all the mental care I need. 
Work called me back in. Damn it felt great. I was working again and I was feeling like there was some purpose to all this.  That's been fading. I still feel so and am so isolated from my friends but powerless to change it. I started drinking less but it just makes me aware of my failures and hate myself more.  Dread is taking its place. I spend the majority of my time lost in my fantasy while stagnating in my life and career."
1639,? Why???????,"Ok so i made a post telling men to stop posting here because as the more educated group of you women know that men cant have mental health issues and they cant feel emotions sadness depression anxiety etc and that they ahould stop begging for attention and pitty and SO MANY TOXIC MEN WERE SO MEAN! Even some women got mad, why cant yall handle the fact that men cant feel pain yall need to do your research i should know"
1640,Am I bipolar?,"For the past couple of years I have went through spells. For like two weeks or a month I’ll be sooo motivated and happy, then all the sudden I’ll wake up so depressed and I just feel like everyone hates me. Does anyone else do this? Is it bipolar? Right now I just feel so sad. For no reason. I went though a lot of trauma in my childhood. I have anxiety and ptsd to unexpected loud noises and people’s tone of voice. Can somebody help or relate?"
1641,Looking back on my past memories with old brings me sadness.,"Today I decided to look through some past videos/pictures in my phone. 

Looking through them, I began to feel a sense of sadness, as they showed old friendships of people who are no longer in my life anymore and exciting experiences that I feel like I failed to savor in the moment in which they were occurring. A part of me misses having a close knit group of friends- my life responsibilities and the beginning of a serious relationship led me to live a reserved day-to-day lifestyle that limited my ability to hold a close relationship with friends. They were there willing to spend time with me, listen to me, and just laugh and suddenly, one day, life led us all apart. It’s difficult to believe you can make such strong relationships with other people, only for them to be almost non-existent in the future. I suppose, in a way, I’ve began to feel lonely.

With this post, I wanted to target a question towards the older folks. After having lived your life through the ups and downs and reflecting on the great memories of the past involving people you are no longer in touch with, how exactly do you feel about those old memories? Is it the same sense of sad nostalgia? How has your philosophy in life changed growing older regarding the topic?"
1642,How real am I?,"This is my first post ever, so go easy on me. I have had a feeling for a while that the world I exist in is not real. Obviously it's real enough that I can touch this and interact with it, but I have this itch at the back of my brain that I might be the only thing that's actually real. The people, the places, the things could just be a part of my own mind or a simulation or whatever. I've wrestled with it for a while and the only people I've told are my wife and a psychiatrist. Neither of those were particularly fruitful. They both tried to be helpful, but how convincing can something be if you aren't sure it's real either. I try not to talk about it with my wife because it makes her sad to think that I doubt her existence, which is fair. Not believing in the world can make it tough to get close to people, tough to feel empathy. I try to live life like everything is real so that I'm not just cold and heartless, but I sometimes have a tougher time feeling bad for people that I have no connection to. To some of you I probably sound like a loon, and to some of you this might sound all too familiar. And wouldn't that be convenient. How convincing would it be to not be alone in this. I think that's half of the problem, convenience. The world seems too perfect. I don't mean perfect like sunshine and rainbows,  I mean it sucks a little too perfectly. There's always something wrong, there's always something dividing people so that we don't realise how fabricated it all feels. I've had a pretty easy life. I've had struggles too though. Just enough for people to go ""eh that's being in your 20s"". I think some people do stupid dangerous things to check if they really can die. I'm far too afraid that I can too try it. What if everything just ends after that. Or worse what if it is real and then I make everyone I care about sad. It just feels like an endless and unsolvable problem that is slowly going to drive me insane. For those of you deeply concerned, yes I have sought medical help, and am taking medicine for depression and anxiety attacks. I guess it's just easier to talk about it here where I'm faceless and so are you. Where I can't see the pain in people's eyes when they realize how impossible it is to convince someone that you are real. That they're real."
1643,This just annoys me,There is this kid in my class that I am kinda friends with. And he does one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I’m young and too scared to talk to my parents that I think I might have some mental health problems because they’ll say “it’s just they electronics” but anyway about that kid. He always says something every week about how he has something that makes his life so hard. And of course that’s possible but the thing that he has that makes his life hard changes every week. And I think about those people who actually have mental health problems but he is just using it for attention .
1644,If you want to talk I’m here...,"Background:
Hello, I’m a therapeutic counselor of sorts. I help give people the understanding they need to solve their problems. And I’d like to help as many people as I can especially during this pandemic, very depressive times. I used to have debilitating social/general anxiety, I’d wake up every morning with a panic attack, and I was extremely depressed but I solved all of those things for myself, went on to solve it for the people around me, and now I’d like to try to solve your problems as well. What I’m offering is 4 free sessions each an hour long, extended if needed. And if you’d like to keep speaking with me after the first few sessions then you pay for the 5th and so on. The payment plan is income based starting at $25 an hour. You can stop after the 4th session as well no judgment. 

Why I do this:
I used to be a super depressed person, extremely nihilistic, so I know how it feels, and I understand how it feels when people don’t understand how painful anxiety and depression can be. I’ve also battled with eating disorders, and a myriad of other common mental health issues. But now I don’t have these issues so I teach people what I taught myself. And when I was dealing with these problems I went to therapists but they just did not help me, they felt uncaring, intimidating, or they couldn’t relate to me, biggest I felt they weren’t being themselves which felt disingenuous. 

Qualifications:
People told me I’ve helped them be who they are today. I’ve talked people out of suicide. I’ve helped people overcome body image issues, anxiety, etc and given them healthy ways to keep progressing. I’m also a little well read in psychology &amp; sociology. 

Note: 
I am not a licensed mental health professional. That’s why the first 4 sessions are free so you don’t have to pay for a service you don’t agree with or jump into anything you don’t like. I’m not claiming I’m a doctor or I can change your life, but I can definitely help. If you have any questions message me. 

At the very least. I’m someone to talk to that has pretty decent advice on a lot of topics."
1645,Why do simple things stress me out so much?,"I see out of the corner of my eye my overflowing laundry basket, or dirty dishes in the sink, or litter from my cats all over the floor, I remember I haven’t watered the plants yet and a look at my calendar makes me wanna cry, even though the only things on there are “Vet appointment” and “Call dentist”. I feel constantly overwhelmed by everything and even after a really productive day where I got a lot of things done my mind is already focusing on the next chore, not letting me rest.  Why am I like this?"
1646,How do I control my drives and why do I have different ones?,"There’s a drive to love and be loved; a drive towards self actualisation and independence and abandoning love at all expense. There’s a drive for death and to wipe out other people through my rage especially partners if they offend me or get in my way, so I don’t physically hurt them but I do discount them and walk away from them in a cruel fashion as a result. Then there’s the drive to simply be me and happy and just bonding. Why do I have so many different ones and how does one control them all without one taking the reins and being in control longer than I want it to as a result?"
1647,Is there any way to stop feeling mad while you are still mad?,"Like, you are still mad at the person, but at the same time you are not feeling the anger in your body. Something like that. Because being mad is pretty annoying and overwhelming, but I also don't want to stop being mad at the person. I just want to stop feeling it physically."
1648,Am I overthinking?,"Lately, I've(F16) had suspicions that my boyfriend(M18) doesn't like me being around him anymore. I have extremely bad anxiety and tend to overthink things so much but I'm not too sure about this. 
It started with me losing all of my friends during quarantine (lost alot because i continued his relationship ship which is no way his fault but still. And he's the only person I really get to interact with. He started a band with a group of friends and things were fine. I was invited to practices and it was cool being able to hang with people. But the last time I was invited, my boyfriend started making jokes that made me uncomfortable.
 I'm a very jealous person I will admit. But I have told him that I am working on it and will not blame him or be angry at him for anything out of his control. But while we were there, he made a comment about not being able to find a sexy enough Mexican milf in any pornos he watches and it just made me kind of sad because I'm the complete opposite of that. I'm pale, very petite. Anyways, the joke was made but of course I'm not going to get angry in front of everyone so i kind of just went silent and waited to go home. But he noticed and we talked about it and he said that i took the joke the wrong way. So i just dropped it. 
But then i stopped getting invited to these outings. It  didnt bother me too badly, it just made me sad being stuck in my toxic ass house for weeks at a time while I know my boyfriend was having fun and making music. And I've always loved his music so much and I love hearing him play and now I dont feel involved at all. 
But today, he told me he plans on practicing tomorrow, since they have a show on halloween, and I was cool with it. But his phone rang earlier and it was from the band group chat and someone asked if they could bring their friend and his sister and someone else in the group said ""the more the merrier"" so of course i was like ""hell yeah :))))"".
So when he came back into the room I was like, 
""Hey could I come with you to practice tomorrow?"" And he started making up excuses like ""well you probably won't have much fun"" ""hang with your sister tomorrow"" (shes in town this week) so I decided to test my theory. Does he not want to be around me? So I asked him ""it's okay if I cant, I understand y'all have a show soon and you guys dont want any distractions."" Then he acted sad and was like ""yeah sorry it's just gonna be us tomorrow :("" 
I just seriously need to know if I'm in the wrong for being upset. I dont care about him being around girls or anything, I just dont understand why one band member can invite his friend and sister but another band member cant invite his girlfriend?"
1649,"I’m going to speak to my family about my anxiety over my hair loss tomorrow, but i need to speak to someone about it now, so why not talk to reddit","So...2 weeks ago i started my 2nd year at university. It started off great, I was loving everything; the parties, hanging out with mates etc...but in my 2nd week my flatmate got a positive corona test and we all
had to isolate for 10 days. Since being in isolation i started to notice small things in myself which I hate, and then I noticed my hair is thinning at my crown. I’m only 19 so this has hit me really hard. Noticing all these small things i hate about myself and my hair thinning has led to me developing really bad anxiety. I’ve had 2 panic attacks in the last week and it’s only getting worse. I can’t take my mind off it and it feels like my crown really stands out and it’s all anybody can see when they look at me. I can’t focus on any uni work, and i’m too anxious to leave my uni bedroom and go into the kitchen. The hair thinning isn’t that obvious yet (although it’s obvious to me, i can feel it too as the hair is getting thinner), and i know it’s something stupid to be getting upset over, but it’s affecting my life in such a drastic way i cant seem to cope with everyday life.

The anxiety is making me feel so down about myself; ive lost all self confidence. i’m speaking to a beautiful girl and i just can’t see how she’d see anything nice in me now. It’s such a stupid thing to be upset over but i’m honestly really struggling to cope. I’ve sent my mum a text explaining things and i think i’m going to go home as soon as my isolation is over and speak to someone about it and see if there’s anything that can be done to help. I realise this isn’t the end of the world, but to me it feels like i’m losing everything. i’m sorry if i sounds pathetic, i hate the fact i’m posting this on here, but i just need to talk to people about it. 

Thank you so much if you read all this, much love and hope you have a great day ❤️"
1650,Looking back on past memories with people who are no longer in my life brings me sadness.,"Today I decided to look through some past videos/pictures in my phone. 

Looking through them, I began to feel a sense of sadness, as they showed old friendships of people who are no longer in my life anymore and exciting experiences that I feel like I failed to savor in the moment in which they were occurring. A part of me misses having a close knit group of friends- my life responsibilities and the beginning of a serious relationship led me to live a reserved day-to-day lifestyle that limited my ability to hold a close relationship with friends. They were there willing to spend time with me, listen to me, and just laugh and suddenly, one day, life led us all apart. It’s difficult to believe you can make such strong relationships with other people, only for them to be almost non-existent in the future. I suppose, in a way, I’ve began to feel lonely.

With this post, I wanted to target a question towards the older folks. After having lived your life through the ups and downs and reflecting on the great memories of the past involving people you are no longer in touch with, how exactly do you feel about those old memories? Is it the same sense of sad nostalgia? How has your philosophy in life changed growing older regarding the process of dealing with those memories?"
1651,How to deal with people that have very strong personalities?,Does anyone know of any strategy on how to deal with people that have very strong personalities? It can be very stressful trying to reason with someone that has a very strong personality.
1652,I wonder if i would have struggled less if i got help sooner or was on meds.,"I’m not gonna bore everyone with the struggles i’ve had but i struggle with the following: ADD, Depression, Anxiety, CPTSD, Turrets and after that they didn’t care what I had. I see a therapist but there something’s that make me wonder if i got the right help. My parents refuse to get actually diagnoses and just take what my therapists say. They don’t go to an actually physiatrist and think it’s a waste. Even when i was trying to not be alive they refused to take me inpatient. They just yelled at me. I wonder what i can do to get better. I’ve managed to do fine without much help, but i wonder if i’ll ever be okay again or if different things would make stuff easier. Like i have constant chest pains from anxiety and an irregular heartbeat because of it, and my depressive episodes get bad. I just always ignore it and put my self in autopilot like rn. Because actually going through an episode with school and everything and all the expectations i’d lose my shit and call them out but i can’t do that. I feel like i have no way of dealing with how i really feel because it’s been shamed and they don’t respect me feeling this way because i’m not the only one who suffers. I’m stronger then them so i must be able to drop all the chores around the house. Idk what to do I just needed a vent and an out."
1653,Anger issues,"Hey there! This is my first time posting on this subreddit and honestly, I am nervous to even post this on Reddit. But I have to find ways to get help so here I am.

So I currently have anger issues and get very angry very easily and I am trying to overcome that, but it seems as if that is just making things worse. The stress of high school combined with the stress anger issues gives you is unbelievable and makes things worse for me. A lot more worse for me. 

I had discovered this subreddit and I came here to ask if anyone went through this and how did they go through it if they did, or if it is anyone who would like to drop a tip for me to overcome this issue.

Thank you in regards if you drop a tip or a way to get through my anger issues."
1654,Is this normal?,"I am a student in school and I see many things as tedious, or not worth my time. If i do not see a benefit from doing it i most likely won't do it. I see my assignments and think they're tedious and not worth my time, I can look away from the online classes for a while, days even, and when i look back I can almost instantly understand what they are teaching. My point is that when I view something this way it is very hard to muster the urge to do it. Is this just normal bitching or is this something else?"
1655,How do I bring up things I’m embarrassed about to my counselor?,"I’ve been going to counseling for 2 weeks now and there are still things I haven’t brought up yet that are hurting me the most. I already talked about my need to hyper focus on fictional characters/worlds and pretending I’m in those worlds as a way to cope, which was already pretty embarrassing for me, but I really need to tell my counselor about my constant guilt towards everything I do. There’s a part of me that tries to convince me that wearing gothic vampire clothing, watching Harry Potter, being lazy, not praying enough etc are all sins and although I know they aren’t, it makes me feel extremely guilty and anxious as a result. I’m posting this because 1) i wanted to know if anyone else feels excessive guilt and 2) i wanted to know how to bring up this somewhat embarrassing topic to my counselor because I just have no clue how to since I’ve never had one."
1656,"I am one of those people that is addicted to pain literally like full-on addicted to pain, Dea deal with this symptom?","Ok like I already suffer from terrible tics and spasms ever since I've been a kid and they seem to get much worse when I start causing pain from having too many tics and twitches and spasms(which are mainly from jaw clenching squeezing my eyes shut very hard literally every 3 seconds or opening them up as wide as I can because the uncontrollable urge seems to come from in my eyelids, I also have a problem of twitching my nose kind off like on bewitched to the point my nostrils get sore and scabby and irritated and even swollen also as the uncontrollable urge to keep moving my jaw and grinding my teeth and when that starts becoming painful, NOW THAT'S when shit hits the fan because I've got temporomandibular joint syndrome where i get that clicking sound in the corner of my jaw(and pain and discomfort) when I'm eating or something that involves moving the back corner of my jaw.

So to get straight to the point yes the tics and spasms are so freaking bad they cause great daily pain in my jaw my face my eyes, wherever I get bad tics and this is the worst part here the tics get even worse because I seem to be addicted to this pain caused by the tics, I feel like I'm teasing the pain like performing never ending tics to see if it will be painful,so just saying the tics get much worser when I'm in pain because I get this uncontrollable urge to see how far I can push my limits until I really get real bad pain no matter how much pain I'm in from these tics I will still do these tics mostly just to see if I get the pain from it which it usually does anyway and even though I'm in extreme pain from this i can't stop but feel I NEED the reassuraning pain in order to stop the urge to do the tics 
And at the moment I'm having jaw and nose tics RIGHT NOW as we speak and they have already started to give me great pain but as I said I can't help but have to feel that pain again and again and again and it just keeps going on all day every day!!!

PS I HAVE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TOURETTE'S, BUT I SUFFER FROM EXTREMELY BAD OCD, BPD , ANXIETY , ASPERGER'S AND INSOMNIA, IN THE COURSE OF 6 DAYS ONLY 10% OF THAT TIME HAVE I SLEPT BUT HAD NIGHTMARES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY COUNT AS SLEEP

PS 2 : I'M ALSO THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT SEEMS TO GET ADDICTED TO THE THINGS THAT HURT ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, LIKE TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS AND YEP PAIN AS WELL"
1657,"I have no self esteem, like i’ve never had it.","TW

Even as a kid i never felt pride. I was always compared and told what to do better that now I have no self esteem. I’m 17 and take no pride in what I do because “Xyzzy” or “i” could do this better than you. I have no pride and esteem when I accomplish somthing. Like I get no serotonin only disappointment of not doing it sooner or not being better. Even when i’m “the best” at something i still feel like i’m the worst. i have no pride and no sense of accomplishment and idk how to fix it. Even as a kid i would do something and no matter what I’d cry and apologize for not doing better. At this point i wanna change but idk if i can. I think what was the worst hit to pride is that one family member practically said how they don’t take pride in my own life and told me to oof myself on multiple occasions and i often feel like i have no value. I only respond well to negative things now. Like i get happy when I fail on certain things. It itches the validation that i will be a constant failure like my parents always told me I would be."
1658,I had 2 good days and now im back to feeling lile absolute shit.,"I ripped a sweater I just bought and its ruined my 2 day streak. I keep telling myself ""how could you be so stupid"" and now its been occupying all of my thoughts since it happened. I just want to go to sleep..."
1659,Any Advice,With everything going on in this world I officially topped the year 2020.   Seem like I can’t break out of these chains.   So much stuff stacking on top of one another.  The heart break seem to be the hardest.  How do you leave someone you love ?  I seen her transform into somebody else.  I did love her it’s been three years now.   We have a baby girl together.    I don’t like what she turned into.   I been drug free for 7 years.    To find out she has been using.   The same thing that her mother OD in died from.   I have to go but I’m scared if I leave in get a call something has happened I don’t what I will do.   My baby girl is the my world.   She needs her mother more then she needs me.   With everything I been thinking a lot about popping pills agin.   Feels like they are calling me.   I love them both but I find myself having a hard go at it.    I have thought of taking something.   For some reason I keep finding it harder to tell myself that I want to live.    The truth I think I want to just this whole situation has me guessing.   I feel like she is going through this &amp; it’s my fault.    I should have tried harder to help her make better choices.  Maybe if I told her a few more times I loved her are she is beautiful it might be different now.  I feel this darkness taking ahold of me.   I don’t know how I am supposed to keep fighting.
1660,Opened up to a good friend and they’ve ghosted me,"Hey! 
New to this sub so hope my post is ok

I’ve struggled with my mental health for a lot of years now, I have good times and rough times as I’m sure everyone does. 

For the past 12 months or so I’d been in a really awesome place mentally; I’d come off all my meds with the help of my doctor and everything felt pretty good. Then something happened at work and it’s knocked me completely sideways. I’ve lost all sense of being good enough at work and my moods have been erratic AF. 

Past couple of days I’ve swung between feeling ok and then suddenly being “everything is terrible and I want to die” and back again - this can happen within the space of hours and it’s pretty scary and a rough ride. 

I have a really close friend who I’ve been confiding in lately and they’ve been a great source of support, until now. I told them about how I’ve been feeling and they’ve totally ghosted me. They’ve read my message but that’s it. 

I don’t know what to think and I actually feel ashamed that I opened up to them and let them into my most vulnerable space."
1661,Does depression make you lose impulse control?,"The past few months I've been slipping and saying things out loud that I don't mean to. Things like ""I fucking hate you"" (meaning me) ""someone kill me"" ""why won't you just die"" etc etc. I never mean to, and I don't think I actually want to die or anything? But it's like the thoughts just happen randomly and I say them aloud without realizing. I kinda told my therapist but I played it down... I'm worried about admitting to what I've actually been saying because again I don't think I'm actually suicidal, but for some reason I say these things out loud anyway. Also it's really hard to be honest with a therapist about this over zoom when I don't want my fiancé to overhear me... we have a small house and he lost a sister to suicide and I just don't want to scare him. I'm really worried I'll skip and say one of these things when he's in the same room but so far I only slip when I'm alone and he's asleep, thankfully. So I tried to explain what was happening to my therapist using nicer sentences like ""I'm stupid"" but I think maybe I didn't explain it well... I feel like I'm losing control of myself and it's starting to scare me. Last night I had an urge to slap myself and I did and I don't know why I did that?! Is it possible to not realize you want to harm yourself? Can depression get to the point where I'm acting without my own consent? Maybe I'm just freaking myself out... it's so hard to feel like I can talk freely to a therapist right now. I really don't want to scare my fiancé. Maybe this will just go away..."

1663,PLEASE stop self-diagnosing,"I love this subreddit and how it serves as a great area for people who’re struggling to connect, but I’m so tired of self diagnosing. Not only is unhealthy for those who seek it out, but it’s honestly offensive to those who are actually diagnosed and struggle with it. 

It’s one thing to ask about people’s experiences with a disease, but drawing conclusions and comparing yourself is just wrong for both parties. I completely understand feeling confused or anxious about possibly having a mental illness, but the ONLY person who can confirm or help your fears is a -doctor-"
1664,I’m always here to talk.,"Hi, I know with everyone going on it’s easy to fall into depression and anxiety. I just want to say if anyone needs to talk you can private message me or comment below. We can talk about anything, I am a mental health activist at heart because of being a crime survivor so I will most likely understand what you’re going through. I know for myself being stuck in the house and with working from home I have struggled with being depressed lately. Having deep conversations and talking to people makes me feel better.

Just to share about myself When I was seven years old I was stabbed in the heart by my grandma due to her having schizophrenia. I almost died 3 times. Before that my childhood was full of alcohol, abuse and neglect. I have dealt with being suicidal and depression.  For years I struggled with knowing who I was after being put in foster care and later on figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was angry for everything that happened to me and I had no control of. I have triggers that I have healed from and things I still deal with. I struggle with feeling safe, I have anxiety and minor things that I know how to manage now. I have done the work to get the healing I need. For many years and I can say because of that I am happy. I am in the process of being a life coach because I just want to give back and help others. My point is, is that I am a safe place. And I encourage you, even if life has made you a victim in the past...does not mean you have to stay one. You can be happy no matter what has happened to you. It takes work and it hurts like hell but it is worth It! It get better I promise. If you don’t want to talk just know at the very least you are not alone!"
1665,How to get mental help when you're alone,"Hi all! I am a 23 year old gal who has found herself having to devote a lot of time to sorting out her mental health. I am the first in my family to be diagnosed with mental illness, so I have had to forge my own way. It was hard at first, because these things have been very difficult for my family to relate to. I've climbed a lot of mountains, and I do feel closer than I did a few years ago. But I still feel like I have not been properly diagnosed. 

I don't have much of a guiding light in this matter, as my light is usually my family. So what I am asking you all about the steps you took that lead you to your diagnosis and your eventual incline in mental health. I'm kind of stumbling right now and just need a bit of guidance. I really don't want this to rob me of more of my life than it already has."
1666,((TW?)) In need of advice,"((TW?))

This is my first ever Reddit post, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing... and to be perfectly honest I'm having a hard time even typing. I just don't know where else to go. I'm here for some advice or possibly insight?

From what I can tell I'm extremely mentally ill. I've experienced psychosis and other mental health issues for the past 6/7 years, and it has left me unable to function. I spend some days quite literally paralyzed. The severity of this constant confusion/depression gave me no option but to drop out of high school. Every day is worse than the last. I can hardly go an hour without severely dissociating from what I know to be real. Some moments it feels like I'm drowning in my thoughts, and they can be pretty nonsensical. My emotions range from overwhelming and intense to barely noticeable. Pretty much all I think about is killing myself. Every minute has began to be marked by fantasizing about how I would. The only reason I haven't is because I have a little sister, but I've nearly lost the emotional strength to hold out- even for her. It feels weird to talk about myself in this way, so I'm sorry if this comes off as self centered.

Does anybody have any insight as to what could be wrong with me? Advice on what I could do to alleviate the pain? I do not have a support system in my day to day life. All comments are appreciated no matter what.

Thanks for reading."
1667,All I feel lately is despair,"How do you look at the news (I’m American6 and feel anything but hopeless? I’m turning 30 soon. I have a good partner, a good job, but still I feel like there is no future that is good."
1668,Wow yay I wanna fucking die,"I’m literally just studying for a test and my daily mental breakdown is hitting me. I don’t wanna be here. I don’t want to go to school or work or anything I just hate everything. 

What am I even doing here. I’m overwhelmed by literally everything in life and I starve myself every day and for what? 

I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. 

I can’t do this. I NEED to go to residential treatment but I’m not skinny enough for them to care about me. They sent me home because I failed at the one objective of this disorder. Fuck me."
1669,Is therapy useless?,"I’ve been struggling with major anxiety and panic attacks for a while now. I’m breaking down crying at least once a day and I don’t have the motivation to do anything. I have trouble sleeping and I have urges to just scream throughout the day. My heart is racing a lot throughout the day, I feel tired and sometimes I feel like passing out while at work until I am able to calm myself. I don’t know what to do and I constantly feel like I rather have not existed. I don’t know if I have depression or not, since I never saw anyone officially, but I feel like I am. literally feel alone, although I have a boyfriend that I live with and friends. I hate it, it hurts. I always felt this but it really hit me hard five years ago and it’s just getting worse.

I hear that therapy has helped people get better, I tried using BetterHelp once, and they told me some genetic thing that I can find in a inspirational quote. 

Than I heard BetterHelp sucks, talk to an actual psychiatrist. I sucked up my embarrassment and awkwardness to seek an appointment. 

All that happened is that she asked me if I needed drugs because she doesn’t think I do (which I never asked for or wanted). After it went to since I am not actively trying to die, I’m completely okay, just “anxious”, go work out and go on a diet. Write my thoughts on paper, you good, k bye. 

I just want to know if this is normal for therapy and it’s just a waste of money because I tried like twice now since everyone is been telling me to seek help but if this is “help”. I rather google inspirational quotes for free."
1670,I just learned what it feels like to relax.,"I'm 21 and i've always heard people say they were going to relax over the weekend or after work. I thought i knew what that meant. I've always had anxiety and racing thoughts my whole life. I've never been able to sleep until i am exhausted from thinking about everything. I overthink and analyze everything. I've had a pretty hard life and it always messes with me in some degree, mainly in obsessive thoughts about people leaving me or not liking me. I know that these are not the case and tell myself that, but my mind always puts them there. 

I tried meditation for the first time because a buddy of mine recommended it to me. I was able to sit there for 25 minutes and it didn't seem like i was there that long. That is the first time in my life i can remember where i have had almost no thoughts in my head. I know, it is a stupid thing to get emotional over, but it made me cry. 

For the first time in my life, that i can remember, i was able to nod off from anything other than exhaustion. I just wanted to share this. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk lol."
1671,What considerations should I make when searching for a therapist?,"I’ve recently realized I have some traumas from past relationships and possibly some from childhood that I want to sort out. I feel like I’m making progress on my own with them but I want to seek professional help to see how it can help the healing process. I’ve never seen a therapist before so I’m not sure what to even look for. I think my biggest concern is that I won’t connect with a therapist and I’ll waste my time and money. How do I find one that I think I’ll connect with? Located in Ontario, Canada."
1672,reading your own charts/ progress notes,"Whenever I read my own charts that the psychiatrist writes I usually find mistakes and it causes huge problems and I have stopped seeing psychiatrist in the past because of it. Some of the issues were small some big. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this I have not read any of my newest psychiatrist progress notes for the past year because I am afraid I will find mistakes. Should I just continue to not read them or do I need to at some point?

&amp;#x200B;

Some of it is irrational fears like what if he is diagnosing me with something in his notes and not telling me. I have OCD. Not sure if that is making me have these issues with notes. Also was mis diagnosed in the past created lots of trust issues."
1673,what is an adult mental hospital like in america? what was your experience like? i need as many viewpoints as possible!!,"i'm thinking about dropping out of college and going to a mental hospital to get some help because i think about dying all day everyday and my anxiety is getting so bad to the point where i'm physically ill all the time. i can't handle college right now either. but i'm not sure if i should make this drastic decision. (all outpatient services around here are closed atm, if not, i'd just be doing that). here are my questions: **1. what should i generally be prepared for? 2. how many of you were allowed to keep your phones? how do you keep in touch with family/friends if you stay long-term? 3. do you get sent to an inpatient facility afterwards or just home? 4. will they let you keep piercings in if they're dull or no if they know you're a self-harmer?** I really don't want to take my 14 piercings out (12 on ears and then 2 on nose) but i feel like they will make me, even though none of them are ""risky"". lastly, and please be honest, **5. did you feel safe and understood there? did it help at all?**"

Should i go to psychiatrist or stick with the psychologist for now?"
1675,My family not actually caring about my mental health,"I was told recently by my parents the reason why I haven´t an appointment with a therapist was never scheduled. Now, I understand what´s going on in the world, it´s difficult. However, my parents didn´t ever actually call anyone on the list of therapists in my area (it was given to me at an outpatient program was going to),  they straight told me in my face that ¨my health wasn´t at all important¨, in other words, I was once again being put on the backburner. 

I get that I have other siblings, my parents are working while trying to take care of the others, but I too am there child, right? I feel like I´m making a huge deal about it, making seem as though I´m making myself the center of attention. But this has been happening for six years, still, they´re pulling the same shit."
1676,Just wanna talk,Hey guys back again. Just need to talk to someone... anyone up for anything?
1677,Not Knowing What to Think,"Does anybody know that feeling where you know in your head is a library of reactions and perspectives to take for a given situation but you don’t know which one to pick because they all stack up on you and you just 🙃 especially because you don’t know if you’ll hurt anyone or yourself or whatever, you just don’t know. It’s like a a hovering stack of folders that tell you how to react is just floating right above your head and your head is never clear."
1678,Is it crazy that I'm incredibly picky with who I hang out? (trust issues),"I don't know to which subreddit this belongs to exactly but I really love hanging out with people. I feel like if there's any dreams in this world that I'd love to accomplish in this world is to connect with people who make me feel really good, and vice versa for them. Like I can just feel it, belly laughs and all. But so often when I meet someone, I can just feel someone having bad intentions with me, or selfish intentions if not meant to be bad. I can't stand anyone trying to do that to me. I remember even having some person being friendly with me in my college semester (it was a boy) and he always asked that we should hangout. Always tried talking to me, and all. And he seemed really friendly, but I felt like he was expecting something from me. I kept talking to him but always declined anytime he asked to hang out.

the people that I hangout with, I know that they're 100% clean - just by feeling like they are so. And they haven't done anything backwards with me so far. But I do wish to have more friends. It's just that I didn't listen to this feeling too many times before and in a way I regret it. I don't entirely regret it because it was a learning experience for me. 

What would you guys think?"
1679,Is it normal to feel like you're going to die young?,"I can't remember when, but since the age of about 12-14 (I'm now 21), I've always had this thought in the back of my mind that I'm going to die young. For whatever reason, I just always had a thought that I'm either going to die really young (younger than 25) or live a really long time. 

 I'm pretty sure it's not a depression thing because I don't want to die or have suicidal thoughts. When I was younger, I really didn't care one way or another. I always saw as nobody ever sees themselves dying young, but there's a lot of people who did. I could die in a car wreck, from sickness, violence, or anything. 

Now I have a kid and I don't want to die; I want to see her grow up. I'm finishing school in two semesters, I'll be closing on a house next month, and have a lot of stuff I want to do, but I can't shake the feeling I'm going to die soon or in a few years. Any time I think of the future I only think how it's not going to last. 

Some times, when I'm driving, I get the sudden urge to wreck my car. Like completely mangle it. Not because I want to die, but kinda like idle curiosity. Like what would happen? Would I die? Or would I live?

Is that normal?"
1680,Can I have some tips for feeling lonely,"Hi everyone, currently I'm having some very intense feelings of loneliness and I just wanted to know what your coping mechanisms were for loneliness, if you have any? Do you guys have any positive affirmations? Please let me know. Thank you! &lt;3"
1681,It could be anything.,"After years of learning why I do the things I do it’s never easy to handle but now that I’m almost 30 I think I am managing them when episodes strike. I can even feel them and it’s uncomfortable when I try to let the feelings pass I even goosebumps doing so. I’ve been diagnosed with a couple things here and there like clinical depression but I try to stay way from labels like what most people do because I don’t want it to defy me. Then again it’s and actual problem where I can’t pretend to be “okay” and say I’m doing “fine” all the time. 

People in the past even tell me, “not to worry”, “it’s not worth it”,  and lastly the worst of all “I’m sorry,”. My mind can’t even comprehend what to say to comments like that anymore. Now, I’ve even developed a habit in not saying anything to anyone because of reasons like that. For the longest time I get the feeling where everything and anyone bugs me. I even feel angry at myself for feeling like that. I wish I was mentally healthier where I could enjoy the little things. I have the feelings of irritability, anger, sadness, and uninterested in mostly everything. I get the feeling it stems from the depression but I felt like there is a word for it too and then the word apathy catches my eyeballs. It sounds about right to me and the little section I read did say it can come from depression. I don’t talk to anyone because of several reasons and it can be very overwhelming to handle this, alone. 

I do this all the time but when an “episode” strike hard it’s worst where it turns into a panicked feeling. I think it’s called irrational or unhealthy thinking. I become freaked out with life things like why do we have friends?, what’s the point of being in a relationship?, or why am I here doing this? Is this what it’s like to be normal and talk? I’m not sure what that’s all about but I’ve been doing it all my life. Do you have a clue what that is? This little thing I have is a biggie because it’s really sparks up all my emotions and the depression where I loose myself."
1682,Should I seek help?,(I'm not diagnosed and I'm not saying I have depression I just wanted to know if I should bring this up to someone) I'm gonna make this quick. I have told my parents that I thought about killing myself and they told me they will get me counciling that was 5 months ago but they act as if it never happened. I have no friends  and I have a social interaction twice a week for 30min a piece. I'm not afraid of taking my life it's just I don't want to break my family into pieces with the addition of my cousin who has been diagnosed with actual metal illness and is my best and only friend really but I consider him more family than a friend so I don't want to mess him up more. I tried drinking and abusing medicine to ease pain but it doesn't help and these recent weeks suicide sounds really nice and calm with zero worries. (So my main question is should I bring it up to my school or family or a prevention line) I can answer questions if you need to ask any
1683,I Need Advice for Finding a Therapist,"hi! I'm in the U.S.A.. Idk if this is the right forum to ask about this but I was hoping to get some advice regarding finding the right therapist? Idk what resources to use or anything. I am 17 and I just don't understand what look for or what different terms mean (like should I get a trauma specialist or a psychologist? what does humanist mean? PsyD ?? etc.)

I have some issues but I am too scared to admit them out loud to a stranger through phone so they can match me with someone. Its hard for me to open up and I'm scared I might cry or lie. 

When I look for therapists online, they say they specialize in one issue that I have but not the others. I was wondering if there is a way I can talk to a psychologist or a professional that could recommend me to someone that can help me with all my issues? I am about to turn 18 so I should be able to get therapy soon but I am broke. Maybe if someone could link some good resources? Thank you for reading :)"
1684,Feeling like I’m faking depression for sympathy.,"First off let me say that I don’t need a suicide hotline. I just want to talk to certain people, about what I am feeling. However, I also get this thought of “Are you really feeling bad about this or are you really just looking for attention?” How do you know which is right? Am I needing to talk with someone or am I just trying to fill a selfish want? 

I’m working full time and have thought of going to a psychiatrist or psychologist, but they don’t take insurance around here and I can’t financially afford it. Especially if I am just trying to get sympathy."
1685,Ways to cope with the side effects of Wellbutrin?,"My girlfriend has just switched antidepressants, and things are starting to get fairly concerning.

She's been experiencing the side effects of her medication, as well as withdrawal from her old antidepressant. These side effects include nausea, dizziness, exhaustion (to the point of being bed ridden), etc.

She's going to call her doctor within the next couple of days and see what they suggest. I'm just curious to know whether there's anything she can do (or I can do) to help with these symptoms?"
1686,State hospital,"I am wondering if anyone here has any experience with a state psych hospital. I’m not talking about just a psych ward in a hospital or psychiatric facility but like the state hospitals that are very long term and you have to give conservatorship to someone. 
I have had many psych ward stays, residential stays, etc and my therapist now thinks it would be best to be in a state facility for years. 
(To clarify I have very severe depression and chronic suicidal ideation, but no history of psychosis or schizophrenia so I’m not sure if this would be the right place for me) 
Thanks!"
1687,Feeling scared out of the blue for not a specific reason.,"It's just like I'm sitting there using my phone or studying and all of a sudden I'm overwhelmed by this huge fear of something, I just can't do anything in that moment just dropping everything and looking at the floor waiting it for it to be over. I do have certain stuff to worry about since online schooling the amount of work that I gotta do is doubled... but I don't think that's it.

I've also been really arrogant lately, and these feelings of sudden fear have been circling around since 7 months... what should i do ?"
1688,Online support group for sex workers?,"Need support I am not in a good position and I do not have other options. The greatest threat to my life is suicide. Second is the virus. I have a heart condition. One contact with one person is unfortunately the safest option. 

I was raised into this work, I thought I finally escaped when I got a retail job even though it caused me physical pain. Covid turned everything upside down. I cannot go back to that retail job. The guy is urging me to come back to the bad work. It is the only way to survive when unemployment barely pays groceries. I feel so trapped."
1689,Username checks out.,"I am here because I just need to vent a bit, I think. I just tried to turn in a long post, but my internet cut out and there it goes. I cried the whole time writing it, but now feel drained. Maybe that is better?

I know I am screwed up mentally. Everyday I find another landmine my parents or family left me. It's rare I find something positive. I will forever be grateful to my wife, for seeing something in me that is worth a relationship. I know it hasn't been easy. I vented some of the things that my family did... But does it matter what they did? The effect matters more I think.

Sorry, part of my issue is I don't feel much anymore, if I ever did. I feel love and care around my wife, but that was a while after we began dating. I enjoy solving problems and reading, but that is a mental joy at solving puzzles a form of ennui. I don't feel anything else but sadness and anger... And I haven't since I was about 8 or 9.

I am just in a state of not knowing what to do. Financially we have been screwed by 2020, and things had just begun to look up. I graduated in December, and I was looking for work. There were various delays and things got postponed... We had to move back home with my mother as she was the only relative with space for us at all. We are in a storage room and have minimal space since February.

I got deathly sick in February, and it wasn't solved until March as Covid hit; just a gall bladder issue that took a month to be recognized. We've been stuck with my... Wonderful and charming mother, since then. We are starting to reach a point we will be unable to afford to move where I find work. I don't know a way to work from home as an editor or using my English degree. I hoped we would move closer to a publishing house around May at the latest, but things have been crazy in America. I am at the point, that I feel I'm self destructing my marriage and ruining my only good relationship.

My wife, my only good and truly supportive relationship, and I have argued more in the last months than in the previous 6 years. We have recognized it as both stress and environment, but this is getting out of hand. I don't know where to go or how to cope. To others I would suggest selling any possessions to keep themselves afloat, but we are both Spartan in decorations. She makes things as her creative outlet and all she owns are tools and things she's made. I collect books, but the few I own worth something are beyond priceless to me, and not worth the emotional drain. I.e. $50 for something that carries memories of me feeling worth attention. I have a collection of video games I could sell... I don't think I'd get more than $400 from a stupid investor as they have been kept and used. I collected them to play with any future children I have. Things I wish my parents had cared about.

Even if I sold everything I had... and got lucky, I can't see us getting enough to move and afford even a hotel room long enough to get a paycheck. I suppose camping may be an option by next year... But I am nothing but frazzled trying to solve this issue. Maybe I am borrowing from the future, but I just see this as writing on the wall."
1690,Struggling to cope and feeling like I shouldn’t have to “cope” or have to make an effort to make myself feel better,"So it’s a really long story but basically im going through an insanely messy breakup. I’ve been living in the past and really have been neglecting my responsibilities amongst other things, like missing meetings and deadlines etc. anyways whenever I try to do nice things for myself or make an effort to just do some self care so I can feel a bit better, my brain instantly goes into like “well why should I have to do this, why should I have to cope when he is living like normal and carrying on with his life and being happy and not needing to cope at all” I guess I still can’t accept the fact that he really doesn’t give a shit about me but also it’s making me suffer more I feel like cause I won’t let myself just cry it out, or read something, or really any self care act in attempts to feel better because I keep comparing my day to what his day is like and I know he’s just having fun with whoever and doesn’t struggle like I do. I hope this makes sense it’s really hard to put everything into words but basically how do I just live for myself and stop comparing myself to my ex who I know is doing significantly better than I am"
1691,Hope for advice,"I am very reluctant to live, I have always had good opportunities, but I do not enjoy anything. I feel like I was wasting my life because there are no important issues that attract my attention.  I feel myself coming just to fill the time, my friends are worried about me because I am not satisfied.  I'm too reluctant to chase you"
1692,i saw a video,⚠️⚠️⚠️TW: murder⚠️⚠️⚠️i was on instagram stories and i was clicking through and saw a graphic warning and i thought it would be a cut or something but it was a poc girl hanging really high from a ceiling and white kids were recording it and he kept pulling tighter and tighter and i clicked off. i haven't moved since i saw it and im traumatized... im in shock. i cant move. i dont wanna sleep. it wont leave my mind. i need help.
1693,Another angsty teen ig,"I feel as if I’m emotionally disconnected from everyone for no particular reason. I don’t want to be a self diagnosing attention seeker, but I feel like that’s exactly what I am. I can’t officially get diagnosed because I’m in high school currently and I don’t want my parents finding out. I just hate myself so much. I hate that I have the social skills of a toddler. I hate that  there is no good reason for me to be alive since I can’t contribute anything meaningful to society. I hate that my grades are dropping because I can’t find motivation to actively study. I hate that I used to cut myself because it was the only way I knew how to get attention. It’s just like I’m using depression, which I probably don’t have, as an excuse to not take responsibility for anything. I have 0 friends, and if I disappeared nobody would notice. I say that but somehow I don’t care at the same time. I’m confused I guess. Maybe I’m being a stereotypical angsty teen. I dont know why I’m posting this."
1694,Need advice on how to handle a mentally unstable person,"For context, I live with my grandparents in a sparsely populated area in Texas, my cousin who I will refer to as “A” has recently moved into an abandoned trailer near our home that is in total disrepair. He’s been there for around 4-6 weeks and isn’t doing well. A is a long time junkie with little to no assets such as clothes, transportation, appliances for food storage, my grandparents and I feel for him but do not have the means to help his situation and the limit of our interaction is occasional conversation and paying him for odd jobs when we can. He hasn’t shown signs of drug use recently but it’s not out of the question, I didn’t make to many assumptions about him because he’s family and very polite and respectful. 
Today a very disturbing event took place that has me fearing for the safety of my grandparents and our property.
He came to me and seemed lucid but the subject matter of what he had to tell me was incredibly worrying. I took a video of our 20 min conversation. He went on an unhinged rambling about “I have autism and it is a superpower” “I have traveled though dimensions” “time travel is deja vu” “I am having conversations will bill gates in the other dimensions” “I don’t have thoughts just conversations with voices in my head” “I tried to kill my self, I died, but I saved my self with schizophrenia and autism”
He came back multiple times over hours to further explain his theory and I told him not to come back until the morning because it’s late. 
How do I proceed? I feel he is a danger to himself and those around him."
1695,"My major makes me want to die, how do I talk to a therapist without getting institutionalized?","This is partially going to be a vent, but I'll get to the point in the end///

Ever since I started going to college, my mental health has been in a steep decline. I remember looking up ways to commit suicide painlessly in the waiting room of my academic counselor after I found out I got a ""C"" in Anatomy as my final grade. I tried to choke myself to death when I failed a midterm in Microbiology. I'm trying to get into the nursing program, but I've been rejected two times. As a result, I took a short CNA semester class over the next summer. 

My CNA instructor gave a lesson about suicide and how certain methods of suicide isn't serious and that they were just seeking attention, such as the slitting your wrists horizontally or vertically debate. I dunno why, but it kinda set me off a few months afterwards because it made me wonder if my past attempts could be seen as attention seeking and if I need to go harder so people won't think I'm some sort of childish, attention seeking, dumbass wasting everyone's time and money. My instructor also said that people who commit suicide are selfish, and it still kinda haunts me. I think about suicide at least once a week ever since I became a CNA. I know that some people will miss me, but sometimes I feel like I'm sinking further and further down into a pitch black ocean with no light in sight so I don't know what to do. 

Every time I talk to people in major, I feel like an idiot. I know I don't belong here, but I have no choice. If I don't become a nurse like my parents wants me to be, my dad might commit suicide and I'll destroy whatever hope/joy my mom has left inside her. My classmates thinks I'm stupid, my CNA teacher thinks I'm a useless moron, and I for sure know I'm an idiot. I'm just stuck here now. I don't even know if I want to do this anymore. 

I recognize that I need to talk to a therapist, but my parents don't believe that mental health is real and if I bring up that I might have depression, my parents will tell me that I have no right to be depressed because they lived through the Khmer Rouge, don't even know if all their family is alive, and that I'm being childish and lazy. Not only that, but if I somehow manage to get to talk to a therapist, I'm scared of being institutionalized. I'd talk to the suicide hotline, but I heard the stories of cops being called and busting into your house if you seem suicidal at the moment. I don't want to leave my house. 

Any advise on how to talk to a mental health professional secretly or how to talk to a therapist without getting institutionalized?"
1696,Is it normal that I'm scared that one day I'll be sent to a psych ward?,"It's been a reoccurring thought I've had for about 2 months. I'm for some reason scared of going to one, even though I don't know what for. I've stayed up all night thinking about my family sending me to one. I don't know why. I constantly want to scream. I really have no clue to describe the way I feel or what I think."
1697,"Mmmm, what a delicious lunch","A delicious upfront threat served with an order to keep myself uncomfortable sitting on the dining room table for mistakenly falling asleep through class.

Because obviously class and what others think is more important than me right?

Can’t wait to never meet my family anymore."
1698,"I failed my first year in uni, I lost my safe space because of someone who bullied me"," I failed my first year of university because of various reasons such as : depression, adhd, low self-esteem, death in my family, lockdown, i was also far from my university ect… My year has been horrible, at all levels. Ironically, my university became my safe space. When I was there, I was able to disconnect myself from all my problems. During the short amount of time, I didn't feel anxious anymore, i felt smart, happy. I made news friends and I was still in contact with my high school friends. The fact that no one knew me before played a big role in my well-being. Everything was new. I can finally be far from everything that has a link with my chaotic life. 

When I failed, my depression got worse, I’ve never felt that low in my life, even after someone I loved passed away. But I could have been able to begin everything again. Until the girl that I hate the most came. I knew that she was going to pursue the same major as me butnot in the same university. I actually found out that she is going to attend the same university as me. I lost my safe space and I hate it. I feel like i was robbed. And it’s not any girl, it’s the girl who (cyber) bullied me, who pushed me out of the group friends, left me alone and came back in high school like nothing happened. I also saw her many times laughing at how I look with her brother, laughing at my name with her friends, laughing at how I dress. If I didn’t fail, I wouldn’t care because I wouldn’t see her. My campus i really really small, there is no way I won't see her. I know that the university isn’t just for me and I know that this major isn’t just for me, that’s why I’m asking you how to deal with this, please…

(sorry for the bad english, it isn't my first language)"
1699,asking for mental encouragement ideas for myself after cutting ties w someone,"this year‘s been incredibly hard for everyone. through the hardships, i only talked to this boy i reaaallly like. i’d open up to only him. he likes me, but i think he’s interested more on how pretty i am. 
i’ve never had a boyfriend and i’m super softhearted. 

i noticed he’s incredibly indecisive and inconclusive about dating me = red flag. i also noticed he prefers memes/jokes about serious events instead of advocating for them. it broke my heart to see innocent being made fun of. 

i realized his negativity, didn’t provide any good support. so yesterday, i sent a short message, then i gathered the courage and unfollowed him on all social medias.

i feel incredibly mean and guilty. i did hurt his feelings. i keep wanting to revert back and talk to him. :/ however i know it’s not a good friendship/relationship to be in.

one thing i really need help on is: my grandma died a few weeks ago from covid-19. he was the first person i told. i feel so incredibly sad and guilty for sharing something so dear to me with someone who didn’t ask ever again. how should i change my viewpoint? 

how can i change my mindset or create positive thoughts to encourage myself, and not feel mean or guilty for basically leaving him? 

thank you kindly 🤍"
1700,Just be honest should I keep going?,"Grew up on a dysfunctional family. You can go through some of my older posts if you’d like to here more. Basically I was homeschooled but not really taught anything and pretty isolated. I had behavioral issues as a kid, swearing, not listening, not wanting to go to bed on time, acting like a dog, throwing things, getting into things, demanding things, getting my little brother to also act up, lying. Ect. And was hypersexual by age 6.

Some bad things I did 
Grew knife at my older sister while she was holding my younger brother when I was like 2
Bit my sister in the stomach because she wouldn’t pick me up 
Did sexual things towards animals
Abused animals 
Worst was between ages 6-11 doing sexual things with my younger brother off and on worst was when I was when he was 9 and I was 11 and penetration happened
I’ve always talked back, didn’t want to listen been really lazy, wanted things my way.

As a kid I would cry for my older sister who was more like a mom to me an my actual mom
Cried during white fang 
Cried over some kids books involving animals 
Cried over a intendo ds dog game that had the dog leave at the end 

I think I’m a born female psychopath. At age 18 one of my online friends introduced me to one of her friends and we talked for two years and ended up having a long distance relationship and then I moved in with him. I’ve been happy with him but I’ve also been controlling, and mean at times and selfish. I can be very immature. I ended up doing an impatient program because of how my mental health was becoming and I’m currently doing outpatient but it doesn’t seem to be doing much. I’m lazy as hell, have poor hygiene, and poor ways of health. I don’t understand the world and the things I do understand I don’t seem to enjoy. Connecting with others is hard, wanting to do things is hard, I’ve never really had any hobbies and wanting to develop any is hard/disinteresting. I don’t go out into the world much. There’s nothing to be as a person and nothing good. I don’t enjoy being me or living. I lack an incredible amount of knowledge and lfke skills and wanting to develop these now is tough. Working 40 hours seems awful. I enjoy sleeping isn’t anything else. I’m chronically restless, anxious, and unhappy. Nothing really interests me at all. I really can’t take care of myself or be committed to life. I constantly feel like I’m hiding. It’s lonely. I’m paranoid. I’m currently 24 and getting older seems scary and like something I can’t handle. My head is never clear. I constantly ask myself what’s the point of living. I’m chronically bored and so messed up. I cry often and out to others. I constantly think about how and when I will die. I barely do anything for myself and it’s like as soon as I wake up I just lay there with a sick feeling not wanting to move or be conscious. I really don’t see how this could ever get better. I’m terrified of being out in the world on my own. I don’t drive or go to school or do anything. I’m awful with commitment or responsibility. I was always have a bad feeling. I don’t want to lose my boyfriend but I’m also not loving him right. Being out in the world or being a functional or decent person seems impossible. I feel physically and mentally exhausted. And I’m scared a lot. I get no joy out of having to live as me or experience life but I’m also afraid of ending it. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped and angry. When I lived with my boyfriend I used to chronically masturbate sometimes having bad thought or weird thoughts. Everything about the human experience and continuing as me seems awful. I know I don’t enjoy life and I know I can’t have kids or a family or likely ever be any thing good and I’m lonely and not okay Feels like I’m just trying to get my life over with. I know I’ve been an awful person and it all seems so pointless and hopeless I feel suicide is my only option at all.."
1701,I feel as though I’m at the end of my rope,"I’m not seeking attention but I don’t know where else to go or where to go.  This year has been crippling for me in so many ways.  I’ve been drinking too much, I feel so distant from friends and family, my relationship with my fiancé is crumbling, my job that I once found fulfilling has reached a dead end due to one reason or another, and I feel like pursuing happiness is a fool’s errand and getting more unlikely. 
I’m turning 30 in March and I feel like everything is so bleak that there’s no point in continuing in this world. 
I apologize for sounding whiny or desperate but I needed to vent somewhere"
1702,What's my problem?,"I have this problem with relationships in general, where people really drain me. Social events, meeting new people, and even having a normal conversation really drains my energy. Just going out on the street and seeing people is already an annoyance for me. I think this is important, I don't feel scared of social interaction, I just really don't like it

I'm not totally anti-social, I have a gilfriend and she is one of the few people I enjoy being around most of the time, and of course it helps that she knows my personality. Still it's a real problem for me there's just things you have to do and involve others, I wish it wouldn't be this difficult"
1703,Beyond Desolation,"I haven't held someone for a long time now. I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship, but my lack of one makes me really upset sometimes. Like, I see other people, who has someone that is involved with them in an intimate way. Their souls are intertwined and in many ways, they have something beautiful. They get to smile. They get to feel butterflies in their chest as they spend time with the one they love. They get to feel happy. They feel wanted. I feel none of these things. I know that I'm not destined to be alone. But man, it really feels like that sometimes. Endless nights laying in an empty bed, waking up with no text notifications on my phone, no girlfriend telling me that they hope I have a great day, none of that. My life is completely devoid of intimacy, and it has frozen my heart almost completely. In a way, I feel starved of human touch, I feel like something is missing. But here's the scariest part of all this:

I *know* that being in a relationship won't mend me. I know exactly what would happen. It would feel incredible for the first week or so, but eventually, I would end up feeling just as shitty as before. Nothing will change. But it's easy to hope that one thing will fix it all. ""Once I obtain xyz, I'll feel better!!,"" but that's not how it works. That's the truth. Life is complicated,  and there is no easy solution to anything.

Man, I wish there was."
1704,Why Can’t I Remember Periods Of My Life?,"
Hi all, 

I sit here in a hopeless spiral that I’ve been in the past few years filled with hate, anger and regret. I’m so angry and sad all of the time because it feels like “nothing” is going on in my head. I feel so disconnected from reality that it feels like anything I do doesn’t feel real. I constantly retreat to this fantasy world in my head and I can’t face reality anymore. 

I’ve tried to draw back to the past and remember how I was when I was younger and I can’t. It feels like I drank too much and blacked out and just can’t remember how I was when I was younger at all. My whole life feels like a blur and I just don’t remember it. 

What is happening? I’m a 19 year old male btw."
1705,Burnout,Over the past few weeks i've been feeling burned out by personal stuff and social media. Everytime i log on facebook or twitter i always see political bs with people  always giving their own dumb founded opinion and all the fake news we see on each platform gives me a headache. Another factor that has let me to a breakdown was when i lost my job for the sixth time since the start of 2020 and i'm growing evermore frustrated with myself. I just need someone to support me please
1706,Help :) I just want to finally say this,"Hello All, I don't really know how to start this. We'll start with formalities. Hi, I'm 18 years old. I'm not gonna say my name. Uhhhh I guess I'm just depressed. I feel empty most of the time and things and people that used to cheer me up, don't anymore. I don't feel like I'm here anymore either. I feel like I'm just floating watching myself. The only thing I feeling I feel so strongly now is nostalgia. I wish I could just go back to when things weren't so bad. The thing is that everything, all these negative feelings, came crashing down on me. I think it began when I started remembering all the repressed memories. I forgot about them for a while and one night they just came to visit me again. I was sexually abused by a cousin when I was about 6 years old. After that......I'm getting embarrassed just writing about it. Well afterwards, I started having sexual intrusive thoughts of many people who shouldn't be the subject of sexual thoughts. It wasn't just sexual intrusive thoughts, but just intrusive thoughts in general. They make me feel like a bad person. The way it happens is like two people talking, but one says something horrible and the other one then begins scolding the other person saying that they shouldn't have said that. I don't know how to explain it. The way I dealt with this was through escapism. One thing I am proud of myself of possessing is my imagination. So I used it and started creating fake scenarios lasting all night and then they began to last all day and eventually I lived my life as if I was in that reality. I couldn't walk into a room without putting on my desired character from whichever scenario I had created. One thing about me is that I don't know how to talk. I stutter and I look around everywhere except the person who I'm talking to. I know it sounds dumb, but it makes me feel like shit. It makes me think that ill never get to establish a real connection with anyone. It makes me feel alone. I become awkward with even those who are close to me. And slowly I start to isolate myself and it extends to some time of me not reaching out or answering messages. I've lost a few friends because of this. I wish i could tell them that I did care, but that I needed that time for myself. It makes me sound selfish. I'm just a bit of a introvert. Well now that you know this, let me bring you to my present time. Now as I'm writing this. Well, I feel empty and I kind of wish a car would hit me while I'm crossing the street.  I feel like a fraud because nobody knows who I am really. I feel, I'm sorry if this makes me sound selfish, but I feel like I go out of my way for others, but nobody does the same for me. I feel immense pressure because my family refers to me as the glue of this family and I'm scared that if I leave, my family will disintegrate. Everyday i feel as if something bad is going to happen and my heart begins to pound too fast and i feel like throwing up. Well basically I just feel on edge every single day. I just want peace. I just want to go to sleep at 9 pm without a single worry, instead of at 4 am with all my worries clouding my head. Well I'm gonna be honest actually, I just want to die. And If I keep feeling like this, then eventually I will take my life. I really don't look forward to the future at all or what it'll bring. I might just be in the moment, but I think nothing grand will ever happen to me. I'll probably just live a boring life with nothing to look forward to. Anyways that's it. I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

Goodnight"
1707,Thoughts/dreams of suicide,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a while now, although there has only been a couple times I’ve felt like maybe acting on it(both times being over a year ago). It generally just acts as a daily reoccurring thought in my mind. I recently had a dream where I committed suicide, and I keep thinking about it. I’m not going to act on anything, but the whole situation made me feel so weird. I’m on antidepressants so my dreams do tend to be more nightmarish and vivid, but this was the first time I’ve dreamt that. I feel like it means something, maybe it does to me. I’m still trying to figure it out, idk."
1708,Has anyone experienced work anxiety?,"I’ve been out of work for 2 and a half years. I’ve worked here and there but haven’t lasted more than a month at a time because I get so overwhelmed. There have been times where I’ve ran out of orientation bc I couldn’t handle it. I’ve given up very good management positions because of my mental state of mind. Can anyone relate or have any tips? At my point, I need medication (which i’m in the process of and i know isn’t the answer but helps a lot) but tips couldn’t hurt. But when i’m ready I could apply these tips. I’m desperate."

1711,Life is feeling gloomy and dark again when I was looking forward to a new chapter in my life,"I (20F) just transferred to university after 2 years of community college and I was looking so forward to making new friends and actually getting to connect with others. Now all of my classes are remote and I'm still at home living with my parents.

I've always been better at talking and being friendly with others in person so I don't know how I'm going to make friends online. I only have one friend that I talk to regularly but our friendship has more to do with us being friends for so long and not that we have a lot of interests in common so her friendship isn't fulfilling enough to combat my loneliness if that makes sense. 

It's also hasn't even been a full week of classes and I'm already stressed out about learning and remembering everything I need to so I can do well in my classes and hopefully get into my major next quarter.

To top it all off, my relationship with my mom hasn't been great lately and it's getting and will probably continue to get worse while I'm stuck at home instead of being at an apartment like I was supposed to before the pandemic. 

All of this combined has made my depression come back full force. Yesterday I had a small yelling match with my mom about how we don't have respect for one another (I didn't say I was perfect, she gets mad when I don't clean when she tells me to) and how I don't feel like she loves me. I cried and full-on sobbed on like 15 separate occasions every time I thought about how she doesn't seem to care about me and I haven't talked to her since. My dad doesn't know about anything because he was on a walk when we fought.

Typically I turn to reading, listening to music, or watching youtube videos and while it helps distract, my chest still feels heavy and it feels like my usual coping strategies aren't working as much as they used to. I was hoping to start eating healthier and exercising this quarter but my depression and stress are causing me to stress eat unhealthy stuff and just sit in bed. The light at the end of the tunnel is looking so dim and far off. I don't know what to do and my hope for the better isn't strong.

I know it's unlikely that someone is going to read this but I feel like I just needed to let it all out somewhere.

TL;DR Feeling lonely from lack of friends, stressed from online classes, and relationship with mom isn't great atm. Struggling with depression again and finding it hard to cope. Just wanted to let it all out."
1712,"Can anybody help me, I kept imagining to much.","Let's start the story, the way that I start imagining I'm some kind of God is by spinning around and listening to music, yes I would spin my body for something even hours on end without stopping because it fueled my desire to be a supreme being. I would imagine myself as a all powerful being who stopped war and famine all across and it is very cringe and embrassing when I look back at it. I also keep on browsing and googling issue that someone my age shouldn't be focus to like religious war and politics, it just make my head hurt so much. I kept hearing from the religious people how they are superior and let listening to atheist on why they are better, it just makes my head hurt. I know it doesn't effect me personally but the thought that it happens to someone else just make my head hurt so much that I skipped school on multiple occasions, sometime weeks on end. Please help me, I recently discovered a passion toward art but couldn't focus properly sue to this. Adding to that my Muslim friends and family are becoming more and more radical by the day, it just makes me so angry at how racist, homophobic and xenophobic they are. I don't know how to support myself, if you can talk to me on DM, I can talk more about it."
1713,people making a personal tragedy all about themselves,"I recently went through a personal tragedy that led to total annihilation of my social standing and image. This came with a lot of social isolation  but a few people stuck around, one of them is my ex and her friend. Basically, it was due to things I said and did when I was 16-17 of age, now being 21 it all resurfaced but somehow my ex is making this personal tragedy all about her, how it affected her being associated with me and despite public pressure she is associating with me, that I should be grateful. She has brought up things from our relationship in context of my past (I dated her last year, ending it before everything went to shit, she didn't even know me back then), I didn't ask for her support nor did I ask for any sort of association, making it all about herself, asking for accountability and reminding me how painful it was for seems disingenuous and she keeps bringing this up again and again without any consideration about how it makes me feel, it's about how she felt. I wanted her to stop talking to me and told her straight up about how I felt about the situation and blocked her from my social media. Now her friend is saying I'm perceiving things wrong and that her intentions are in the right place but it feels dishonest to say the very least, that blocking her was ""really wrong and that she's hurt"". I'm torn, incredibly devastated that a person who says that they are here because they care, their actions say otherwise."
1714,Should I get help?,"17 M UK, I’ve been going through a lot lately, I’ve been doing nothing but thinking negatively for the past few weeks, and I haven’t been feeling genuinely happy most of the time, the funny thing is I want to be happy but I can’t somehow. I went through major mood swings and I’ve always been thinking about other people (sorry if you don’t understand my writing normally I never make these kinda posts)."
1715,Am I pathetic?,I feel pathetic for feeling this way. I’d do anything to get a girlfriend. Not even for the reason most people would think. I don’t care about sex or anything like that I just want someone to share life with. I’m already incredibly lonely and seeing all my friends getting girlfriends just makes me feel even worse. Is this bad?Am I some sort of weirdo or something?
1716,How do I tell my manager that I'm burnt out?,I have spent the last week should almost nothing. Can barely get myself to answer any emails or do any work. I am barely doing the minimum. And that's only because there aren't any urgent issues. Basically pushing everything at work off. The deadlines coming up in a month are going to be a problem. I've never been this demotivated in my life.
1717,[OCD] A major resurgence of intrusive thoughts and panic.,"\*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING: I am going to do my darnedest to avoid any triggering content, but I can't make any guarantees. Please proceed to read at your discretion.\*

Also TL;DR. Prepare for a rant. 

Hello everyone. I don't post here often, but I wanted to immediately report on a very difficult last couple of days that I had in regards to my mental health...specifically, OCD-related issues. My goal here is to both encourage people to stay positive during hard times, as well as to remind those of us who have had experience coping with our issues to keep on it.

I also wanted to be a little humble, as I have frequently given people my own perspective on how to deal with intrusive thoughts, and after this little stint of mine, I now believe that I never gave the matter enough weight. I apologize for this and will be more open-minded and empathetic in the future. 

Anyway, it all started randomly before bed on Sunday. I was coming back upstairs and saw my beloved dog waiting for me on the top of the stairs. Then, boom, I was hit with a particularly horrific intrusive thought (it still makes me tear up thinking about it sometimes). I haven't had a particularly bad reaction to an IT in years; in fact, it had been so long since I truly freaked out over one that I couldn't remember how much time had passed since my last episode, and I was convinced that I had mastered them. 

Then, that night, it was as if I was in the throes of a PTSD flashback. I holed up and panicked, meanwhile freaking my dog out. I should have called out of work the next day, because yesterday morning I got on post, and basically started to cry and fighting panic. Ended up asking if I could go home and I was allowed to take a sick day (my workplace was awesome, by the way. I couldn't have asked for more help and support), and basically just went home and cried for 3 or 4 hours and attempted but failed to take a nap. 

My wife was truly my guardian angel, too, as before bed that night we talked about everything that happened and she reminded me about the reality of life and death and being out of control in every way, but never judged me and helped pull me back together. If it wasn't for my wife and her love, I promise that I would still be a sobbing wreck sitting here after calling out of work a second day in a row. 

That said, I was able to go into work today; did get teary eyed to and at work at times, but otherwise it was a much better morning. Everyone was awesome; it's just that my job, for now, is very, very slow and I am bogged down by other stressors in life...so I think everything came together to just reinvigorate my OCD. 

Still, I had never imagined that last weekend is when I would relapse with an extreme OCD episode. Overall, I have learned a lot from it, and am still struggling quite a bit...but doing well for the most part, and just seeing how to approach this sort of situation going forward. 

 Thank you!"
1718,0 Friends online and in person for 1 year,"My life has taken such a dark turn. Used to hangout everyday with friends. I moved and this pandemic has made me even more isolated. I feel like Im starting to lose my sanity. I really just want to connect with people.

I'm so sad"
1719,How to ignore insults?,"I’m talking about insults from my parents. Especially my dad. Every little mistake i make irritates him and can’t help but to insult and threaten me. He’s been like this ever since my sister and I were little and we can’t just take it anymore. The things he says affect me negatively and i don’t know how he doesn’t see that. I barely talk to him because of this. I am having suicidal thoughts for the first time because of him. I can’t stand him at all. Any kind words of encouragement would mean a lot to me, thank you."
1720,"I am extremely, deeply ashamed of my family","I don’t know if this is even the right space. I am deeply, deeply ashamed and also guilty of my family to the point where I can’t talk to them like one would, or see them, or involve them in my life. And I don’t even know what to do about it or how to begin to fix it. And because of them, the upcoming holidays are absolutely agonizing.
I have entire separate lives that I keep boxed up and separated. For one example, I can’t under any circumstances begin to bring myself to tell my parents about my partner, and I don’t think I can have him meet them. On the other hand, this makes me extremely guilty because my parents are elderly and also not at all healthy so I don’t think they have many years left in this world. I don’t know why this is or why I feel it. 

I guess I’m venting because it haunts me every night, I literally don’t sleep because of it, I have headaches over it, it makes me cry and sob but I hide it from my parents, and it drives me to be constantly unsatisfied in my relationship, where I live, and affects my job. 

I was just wondering if anyone has any anecdotes that could help me understand, or any words of advice."
1721,Hello r/mentalhealth!,"So, I have a small favor to ask. Out of the blue tonight, I decided to write a book/diary on what its like to live with a mental illness. If anyone of you would like to be interviewed or put your input in the comments below I would truly appreciate it (if interview PM me). I understand that this is a super sensitive question to ask, and I’m not trying to force anyone because I understand it can be super hard to talk about, but I would love to let people know who don’t live with a mental illness what its like to live with one. I do have anxiety, but I want to leave my personal bias out of this as much as possible. 

So just a quick recap, if any of you would Iike to be interviewed or put your input in, comment below or PM me! Thank y’all so much!"
1722,help?,"i need advice. badly.

so this might sound cliche. this might sound edgy. this might sound emo. but it’s not. i promise.

it takes a lot for me to write this. a LOT. this is basically my life story and i don’t really know the question i’m trying to ask. i guess i need insight? i don’t know. 

ever since i was a kid i’ve had the feeling that i’m meant for huge things and i never knew what that meant or what i would be doing. i just had the feeling. i lived in a small town up until my mother moved out of state. i didn’t go with her but eventually i made the decision to go. she has had a lot of piece of shit men in her life. that also affected me. the reason she moved was because of a man who i won’t name. anyway, i moved there. i lived there for 2 years. i dropped out of high school. lost my mind. grew hatred for myself. got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety. i ended up running away and going back to my dads in the small town. i worked my ass off, saved money, bought a car, got a girlfriend. eventually we broke up and i met another girl. we ended up breaking up, i was lost. i quit my job. started stealing. got caught in the act. house was raided. guns, drugs, money, etc. this was a year ago. i never was charged but i want to be. i want to be rid of this guilt. i am a piece of shit. i have changed my entire life around, but i still did it. i still made those choices. during the time i was stealing i had another girlfriend. one who i got pregnant and we lost the baby. then we broke up. my life just feels like a movie and i don’t know where to go or what to do. i know this post is all over the place. i’m sorry. i’m at rock bottom with no idea on where to go or what to do. i make music now. i try to tell all of these stories but my life is such a cluster fuck i don’t know where to turn. i recently got a new job. i start this week. can i come back from this? should i end my life? should i continue? should i overcome all of this and get famous? what the hell do i do. please help me. i’m sorry for the low detail, i really don’t know where to turn. i’d love personal conversations but comments are perfectly fine. please :("

1724,Something is wrong with me,"Hi I don’t know what to think I don’t know if maybe I have adhd or maybe I am just lazy and I struggle with self confidence issues but I do know there is something wrong with me. I am not very good at speaking correctly if that makes sense, I I feel like I come off as an airhead or stupid. It’s like my my goes blank when I try to tell a story and I cannot find the right words to say and I cannot speak property. Like for instance I’ll say things grammatically incorrect as if I wasn’t able to speak properly. When I talk to people I can never have a conversation where I am confident in what I am I am saying I always come out sounding stupid and it makes me very insecure. I don’t know if this even makes sense or if anyone can relate but this is a problem I struggle with in a daily basis. I come off as dumb or my mind just blanks. I struggle with focusing which is why I think I might have adhd as well as I’m always fidgeting and procrastinate to the max. Sometimes I feel as though I am incompetent and everyone can tell. I feel as if I lack common sense sometimes and I can’t figure out how to do things on my own which is why I always rely on someone to help me with things, I feel so dependent on my sister and friends. I don’t know what to do or what could be wrong with me."
1725,"Hate not being diagnosed, feels like I'm faking it","For reference, I'm 13 and from England. About a year ago I started having mild suicidal thoughts and getting a bit depressed but I just ignored it. Then lockdown cam around and they got a lot lot worse. I remembered at the beginning of lockdown my dad had said to me that if I was depressed i could talk to him and my mum so I decided to tell them. Only to be met with the response 'you're 13, how can you be depressed' and my mum said once you get back to school you'll be so much better don't worry.

Well, now I'm back at school, and surprise surprise its the worst its ever been. I'm incredibly depressed, I  been driven to self-harm and I have frequent suicidal thoughts. I also think I may have anxiety but I don't say that I do have depression or anxiety because I'm not diagnosed by a professional. It just makes me feel like I'm faking it or I'm just doing it for attention and it's driving me crazy!!"
1726,Therapy,"Hello. Sorry if I seem a little closed off... I usually only talk to my friends about this. I’ve recently been going to therapy. It’s okay and it helps but sometimes I want to hurt myself. Mostly slamming my head against the wall lightly kind of hurting myself I guess. Sometimes I feel like I want to be put in a mental hospital because of how bad I’ve been neglecting my needs. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything and my parents refuse that me as a child seeming them yell at eachother and hit eachother hasn’t affected me. I recently got yelled at by my father. I don’t remember much of what he said besides “what’s your fucking problem why isn’t your work turned in” (referring to me not doing my work because many of my friends have been self harming and having attempts so I’ve been really unmotivated) I remember he said to stop putting my friends over my work and that I “need to focus on what really matters.”

It’s like my mental health means nothing to him. My therapist says I might be unmotivated because I tend to try to cater to my friends needs because I’m afraid if I don’t they’ll leave.
I have a lot of trauma, it just really hurts to have them say that I’m just a hypochondriac and that I’m just anxious. Because I’m not. I’ve tried to get therapy for years and my mother only put me in therapy when I said it’s the only thing I want for my birthday.

I hope I get diagnosed soon so I can start trying to heal better and someone finally admitting that something is wrong. I wish I could get an understanding of myself but it’s like everytime I do it’s not who I am, it’s like every time I try to admit something is wrong I doubt it. 
I

I have trauma from a lot of things that would take too long to get into, I’ve been emotionally abused a lot in my past and sexually assaulted and groomed so now I’m afraid of love. 
I’m dating someone at the moment and I trust him so I’m starting to try and re-write what my brain has learned. Some days I love him to death and wanna be with him forever but sometimes it’s like I want to push him away, I know he loves me and I know he cares yet I feel afraid of him. I don’t know why, honestly. It’s terrifying to feel love for the first time since I tend to attach myself to people. 
I just wish I knew what I needed to correct and how to work on it so bad but I only have therapy once a week, it’s a nightmare.

I would tell my therapist about the thoughts of me wanting to hurt myself (slamming my head against the wall and throwing myself on the floor, I already bully myself a lot mentally.)
It’s been like this since I was 11 or 12. I had my hopeful period and I believed in myself but now I believe I was just dissociated. I don’t remember a thought from that time besides basic thoughts like “we should dance to this,” or “go eat/ shower”
My therapist doesn’t deal with these kinds thoughts and I think it’s taking a toll. I black out randomly sometimes and collapse on the floor from being so weak. I feel like my dad is gonna hell at me any minute, I feel like I don’t even deserve food sometimes. I don’t know what’s wrong, I hate it. It’s like I’m looking at a fogged mirror towards my problems. I can see why they happened but most times I don’t see what part of life they affect or what the problem is causing me mentally. My parents liked to call me disgusting for neglecting my physical health around 13 or 12. I really wish I could help myself.


I’m sorry if this was all over the place, there’s so many thoughts in my mind and so many things to do that lately I’ve just been stressing out and shutting down. I’d like to hear what you have to saw about this. Thank you for reading."
1727,What is this feeling? Does anyone relate?,"To preface this I want to say that I’m currently going through the process of finding out if I have adhd so will bring this up with my psychiatrist, but I was hoping to gain some info on what I’m going through as from what I’ve seen it doesn’t seem to be related to the possible adhd diagnosis.

I have trouble dealing with other people’s emotions. Now, I have the full range of emotions, so I understand why people have emotions, I just don’t know how to respond or care about other people having these emotions. I don’t know if this is a lack of sympathy, empathy, both, or even something else. 

For example; say someone is going through a break up. I know that I would be so upset if I was going through that, and I care about this person very much, but I can’t bring myself to care about what they’re going through. I know that I need to fake caring and being supportive, but it’s almost annoying that they’re being emotional. I know I sound like a selfish asshole and I really wish I could care but I just don’t?

I don’t know what sympathy and empathy are, from what I understand I have empathy because I know that I would hate to be in that situation, but do I have sympathy because I know to reassure people?

I don’t know and if anyone relates I’d love to hear your experiences."
1728,Anxiety,What do you usually do when you feel anxious?
1729,Mind of feelings and scents,Hey guys for as long as I can remember my mind has been made up of feelings and scents like if Im imagining something in my mind it is made up of scents and or feelings. I also have a full inner world which is made up of scents and feelings rather than pictures. does anyone else have this and have any idea why. I've tried talking to people about it but no one has ever heard of anything like it
1730,Realization,Last year I was severely depressed but I didnt know it or come to terms with it but today I learned that hearing voices is a symptom of severe depression. I just needed to tell someone because I've told no one except an online friend that I've experienced this. Fyi I stopped hearing voices after I got better.
1731,"Lying, Stealing, and minimally caring","Imma dive right into it. 

I’ve stolen over an ounce of weed from almost all of the members living in my fraternity house over 3 months . I had a routine for each room specifically, knowing when to enter, where it was, and how much to take. I would have a list and rotate between rooms, kinda like a game. But hey it’s not my fault, I can’t be spending too much money on weed. 

When they would go out to bars, I would tell them I would follow them in 20 minutes, just to find one of their empty rooms and steal a few beers or pour some vodka into my bottle for some free shit. 

I would stay up till 2 am until everyone was sleep so I could go down to the fridge and take some food. Sometimes small, sometimes sandwiches on a good day. It’s a free meal. 

Fortunately for me, there was another brother who got caught red-handed stealing once, so every time something goes missing, I never worried about being suspected. For the most part, I took optimal amounts. Enough to not need to steal for another few days, but not enough where it was noticeable every time. 

More examples, 

A couple of years ago I’d use my roommate’s credit card on Uber and EatStreet without his knowledge. He asked me and I said no idea , “I don’t even use Uber bro, Lyft gang here!” I also took his entire CBD bottle, and blamed it on drunk people stealing it at our party. 

While in quarantine with my four friends. I told them I am not smoking weed anymore. However, every time they would go to bed and leave the weed bag outside, I would have to take a few hits. Or maybe take a few beers from the fridge every few days. I would also tell them I do not want to pay for groceries since I am “fine on my own” and make myself free meals at night when all went to bed. 

When I was in charge of door for my fraternity parties, I would tell people to Venmo my personal account for entry, and took a neat 15% and transferred the remaining to my fraternity social Venmo. 

While I was ordering McDonalds on my friend’s phone, I went to his Venmo app and cancelled a few of the requests he sent me, and then deleted the confirmation emails. 

I took $150 from my dad in 6th grade so I could go on a shopping spree afterschool in Candylicious, a popular candy store. 

I pretended to be sick in 5th grade P.E so I could sit on the bench, and sneak into the locker room to steal one of the other kids’ best football trading card, which was the only one at the school. Since I knew they would lock down the locker room to see who took it, it was in my placed in my shoe nicely. 

In 7th grade, I literally stole a PSP from my friend who lived abroad in the Middle East. Since I knew we would not keep in contact, it was a very easy opportunity. Why did I do it? Well, what if my main PSP ran out of charge? 

I’ve stolen at least one thing from virtually every person I know. Whether it be money, weed, booze, something of value I want. 

And this is just the stealing.... now the lying. Since the post is getting long, I’ll try to sum fast. Things I’ve lied about. 

-My high school friends (grew up in Middle East) think I was born in the USA and have an American passport, and that my dad moved there in the 90’s and came back. Also, 
my College friends (In the US) think I am actually from Abu Dhabi/Dubai, but in reality I only grew up there and my parents are Lebanese. 

-All my high school friends think my fraternity is insanely cool. But that’s how I make it out to be. In reality, it’s pretty nerdy and parties rarely happen, and I didn’t wanna join, looking back. 

-I’ve lied about my lifting stats, about PED usage, about my GPA to my parents, and hidden my daily booze binge from people. 

Why do I lie? So people think my life is actually better and easier than it really is. So I don’t have to face any wrong, which I have rarely made anyway. 

Out of all those instances, I have felt bad one and only one time. The $150 Candylicious spending spree was not worth it and my father was struggling financially at the time. 

There is so much more I want to delve in regarding childhood, but I will leave it at that. 

Since there could be signs of sociopathy here. What else should I look for in term of “symptoms”?"
1732,How to help a depressed person?,"I just found out that my friend has the same problem as me. I don't know how to support a depressed someone, especially that I haven't got my undiagnosed depression cured. I never tell anybody about it. 

My friend avoids talking about it and says ""I'm ok"". I don't believe it. I want to get her to open up without being pushing or forceful. I won't be able to meet her any time soon, and I can't afford to lose another friend. I want to be the person who she vents freely with."
1733,Is it normal to always think of the worst?,"For a long time now i’ve been overthinking about horrible things that could happen to me or a loved one (mostly a loved one) like them being seriously injured or worse. This is MUCH worse when attempting to go to sleep. I just begin thinking of possible accidents that could happen in full detail and how its incredibly possible and almost likely to happen. It is really hurting me mentally and I just keep scaring myself. This has honestly really just started as the pandemic began and I’ve unfortunately seen some gruesome videos and images of late. Why do I think this way? I seem to always think of the worst possible outcome or the worst possible situation, even when I have no reason to think so."

1737,Friends damaging my self worth.,"Hi I (F16) recently got chosen to be an interim prefect for my school. I was hesitant to take the role at first because I felt like I wasn't confident or responsible enough, but my teacher and parents eventually talked me into it as they said it was a good way to be an ""all rounder"" and ""get out of my shell"" (I'm first in my class and I'm quiet and ""shy"" according to them), so I ended up applying and being chosen to be a prefect. I felt okay about it at first but most of my friends tell me that I won't be good at it. They also say that I'll be bullied by students due to my height (I'm 153cm :( ) and this really hurts because it took so much out of me to even apply for the role of an interim prefect. I don't even know if they were joking or not, because they bring up my height and nature whenever they can. I don't try to fright back because it's all of them against one little me.Not many people know that I struggle with my self worth, to the point of self harm and deprivation of needs (sometimes I feel so worthless to the point of withholding food and water, or anything that makes me happy because I don't feel like I deserve it). This really hit me hard and it has me questioning my ""worthiness"" of becoming a prefect. I wish that I could disregard their comments, but it's all I can think of. I've had multiple panic attacks over this and I haven't slept in 2 days. I don't know if I should be a prefect anymore. Maybe they're right."

1741,disconnect from myself,i’m 16 and for a lot of years i’ve been struggling with my mental health and it often gets worse and a new struggle pops up that i don’t know how to deal with. i’ve never seen a professional and cannot do so because of my parents. one of the new most recent things that has been occurring is this sense of disconnect from myself. this has happened i think 2 or 3 times and every time i was with my boyfriend. i go into stages randomly where i get super confused and i don’t understand how ive gotten where i am. i can remember everything that’s happened to me but i feel as if it wasn’t really me and when i think back i see myself in third person. i start to panic and things are suddenly really scary. my boyfriend tries to console me and help but when it’s happening he seems like a stranger and i get scared. last time i started talking about how i wasn’t me and how the me that he remembers is a different one. i don’t know why this is happening and i don’t know what it is. can anyone help?
1742,My dream has messed me up.,"I struggle with making new friends and I'm an introvert. When I was in school I was able to make friends, really good and close friends. But as I grew up I developed social anxiety. Now I'm in college and I haven't been able to make any friend for 3 years now. I have almost no human contact other than my parents and one or two other friends I talk to maybe once in a month. 

A few days ago I had a dream where I had a group of 5 friends. We had a lot of fun together. I fell in love with one of them and we started dating. We went for vacations and hung out together.

I've had these kind if dreams in the past, just not so vivid, so as all of this was unfolding I had a feeling that it was a dream. My in-dream girlfriend even reminded me that this time I'm not in a dream. I was convinced and I was having the best time of my life. And then I woke up. Everything, everyone just gone.

I thought I would just forget it ever happened, but it's been almost one week and I just can't. I even call out her name sometimes thinking that she's there only to be reminded that it's not real. 

Please help me, I feel like complete shit. I'm feeling really depressed and no matter how hard I try I can't forget them and the stuff we did together."
1743,I feel stuck,"Hey y’all this is my first time posting anything like this. I just want to vent to a safe community and to people who get it. 
I’m a stay at home mom. I absolutely adore my daughter and my husband. 5 months ago my whole family packed up and moved to another state. (My husbands in the military) Before we moved I had a really awesome job, good friends who I’ve known for years, a lot of family, and a babysitter so I would be able to work. I was incredibly happy and I loved my home state. I was finally really recovering and feeling better. I’m diagnosed with depression, anxiety, substance disorder, and ptsd. I met my husband 2 years ago and while I agree we moved really fast, I’m happy that I’m married to him and that we have a beautiful family. He’s great and supportive and tries to understand my mental health the best that he can. When we found out we were moving, I was excited and terrified at the same time. 
We move and are living on a military base. It’s a really nice place and for the most part I’m impressed with my living situation/house. There’s a lot of bugs which make me really uncomfortable but I make the best of it. As we settle in more, I meet the neighbors and people around base. They’re absolutely horrible people. A lot of our neighbors are 10-15 years older then us and we feel as if we’re being judged by our neighbors because my husband hasn’t been in the military as long as they have. So we keep to our selves for the most part. That’s really difficult for me because I haven’t been able to make any friends. Every time I try and reach out to someone and try and create a friendship, it’s either a mlm scheme, they’re rude and judgmental, or plans fall through and we never meet up. I try and stay in contact with my friends home but I know they’re really busy and have their own lifes.
My husband has been working extremely long hours. I get to see him for maybe a hour or 2 a night and then he goes to bed because he has to get up really early in the morning. That leaves me taking care of our kid all day every day. (I’m aware that the military life is the life I signed up for but saying that doesn’t make it any easier.) While I love my kid, I would love to be able to have a hobby, have some time to myself, and be my own person. Recently it feels like my only personality trait is the fact that I’m a mom. 
As stated above a struggle with a substance abuse problem. I got clean almost 2 1/2 years ago. Where I’m living, meetings aren’t happening in person. Meetings are a big way for me to make friends and reach out and build a community and a support system. With how everything is going on in my life, I’ve even struggling and having some really strong urges to pick up again and I really don’t want to do that. Along with my urges to use, I’ve been feeling like I may need more psychiatric help then what I’m receiving right now. What I’m feeling like I need, is not possible to do because that would mean I’d leave my daughter and my husband is not able to take the time off. I just feel like I’m trapped and stuck in a loop of doing the same thing every single day. I’m extremely unhappy.
Anyways, thank you for taking time to read my rant. Even if no one responds to me, it’s really nice just getting all of my emotions and feelings out there."

1746,It gets worse every year,"I have multiple mental illnesses.  I had a really bad psychosis that lasted for 4 months last year at this time.  I still feel like I haven’t really recovered from it.  I can’t really be around people without being paranoid and hearing voices.  I don’t have my sense of humor anymore and I can’t really help carry a conversation; I’m flat.  I have this constant fear.  I keep thinking about killing myself, and if it was only me I would have already.  The thing is, I got married and had a kid when I was in a better place and have a 5 year old.  My wife also got pregnant last year and now there’s a newborn.  I don’t know what would fuck my kids up more, living with someone who is afraid all the time and then having them adopt my fears or having a parent that killed themselves.  I know when I’m ill because I feel different than when I’m feeling normal.  It feels like I’m in a dream like state.  I know the voices aren’t real (kind of) and the paranoid is possibly unfounded (but maybe it is true) but the fear is still there at all times.  It’s this fear that makes me want to die just so it will stop.  I’m on medication and I’ve tried therapy but nothing seems to work."

1749,Lexapro and seroquel,Hi just a quick question I was on 20mg of Lexapro for my depression and anxiety and 50mgs of seroquel for my insomnia. Lately I have been up and down with my anxiety (feeling restless and anxious) to where I wanted to kill myself with sleeping pills (bought the packet). I explain this to my psychiatrist and they have jumped my dose to 200mg. I was just wondering if I should be alarmed by this and I’m also worried about taking higher doses of antipsychotic drugs as I have no mental illness issues besides depression and anxiety (also substance abuse). Thanks everyone :)
1750,"I need suggestions, or just someone to insure I'm not insane.","Disclaimer: I'm not claiming to have anything I don't. I have PTSD, but that's it.

Trigger warning: mention of suicidal thoughts, mention of someone using slurs that aren't theirs to reclaim.

I feel trapped in my mind and thoughts. I try to be optimistic, I try to think positively about myself, but I can't. I don't understand why this is so hard for me. I only see everything wrong with everything I do. I never have motivation or inspiration no matter how creative I'm feeling or how much I want to write or make a story. I even lied to my therapist when she asked me if I had any suicidal thoughts because I felt like she'd judge me or be disappointed because I got so far than spiraled back down. I feel like I'm being way to overdramatic. I constantly question everything I do and everyone I'm around. I only ever focus on how I failed, and not how I could get any better. Even though I always go to sleep anywhere from 7-9 pm but mostly no later and mostly closer to 9 pm, I always wake up anywhere from 1-6 am, and can't fall back asleep. This morning I woke up at 1:20 am and right now for me it's 4:40 and I still haven't gotten any more sleep. I also have school at 8:39.
I've been so, so forgetful. I'll think about something highly important or interesting, look at something, even if it's plain like a literal white wall, and forget every single thing about what I was thinking about. Am I insane, or is this normal? Is something wrong with me?
My cishet white parents really like to say things such as ""what's up ma n*****"" to friends, or, ""imma go smoke a f**"" (we're not from the place that that's normal, which I forgot the name of) and such. It's kind of offensive, especially since my sibling is part of the lgbtqia+ community. Do you guys have any suggestions?"
1751,Looking for advice on how to handle PTSD/Anxiety/depression during physical health lows,"First time poster, so forgive me. Also on mobile. This is really long so I apologize... I just have a lot going on. 

Hello, I am a 23f with a mental illness history of Manic Bipolar, Depression, Generalized Anxiety and PTSD. I have been in and out of therapist offices since I convinced my mom my depression was serious after 4 years of self harm(age 17. Clean since the week after my 21st birthday!) I was in counceling up until the Virus started in March, but they moved it to telephone calls and I personally was not comfortable with that for anxiety and in general privacy issues, so therefore they discharged me from their practice. So my only support through this has been my boyfriend, who is truly a saint but does not quite know how to help with my lows and anxiety. 

I have ALWAYS been scared of not being able to have children, different issues with my period made me paranoid this would be an issue. So in June and my right ovary somehow grew a cyst that burst, and the male OBGYN i DID NOT WANT(PTSD from sexual assaults) but had no choice in having told me this seriously impacted my chances of children. I lost it. THEN I developed Colitis last month, which if i get a reoccurance could lead to Chrohns or Ulcerative Colitis. (but supposedly no cyst in right ovary, just enlarged and that could be causing my pain) So far of what I read, it is possible, but hard to have kids with this. And then to top it all off, last night I had another hospital trip that resulted in me finding out my ovarian cyst was hemmoraging(AFTER being told it might be Crohns or UC on admittance, which led to a panic attack while everyone could see me because of lack of beds). 

At this point, its been four months of pain and overwhelming anxiety about whats going on with me and if I am going to be able to do the one thing I want in life(have kids). My boyfriend and I had agreed to try when I got better in case of my cyst reoccurring...obviously it didn't happen. Just popped again so who knows how much of a chance I have now. The OBGYN office is calling me tomorrow for my appointment so hopefully Ill get some answers but in general... Im terrified. Im constantly having anxiety attacks throughout the day because I start to think about this and what my life is and may be looking like the rest of my life. I'm in general having massive anxieties about doctors and hospitals and all the scary what ifs. 

I took two DBT classes with my two therapists, and in general have tried to build coping mechanisms and they aren't working because I cant seem to calm down. The only slight relief is my prescription of Xanax but it only does so much. I know the rest is on me to handle, Im just having a really hard time figuring out a mindset to spin this to help my anxiety like I was taught by my therapists. I know this is long, and everywhere, so thank you if you've read this far, and thank you so much for any advice anybody could give me."
1752,"Extreme paranoia, trintellix?","Heya. I'm a 23 year old who's been in mental health care for the last ten years. my diagnoses were just updated so we're talking ADHD, PTSD, BPD, OCD and generalized anxiety disorder. My medications are: 300 mg seroquel prolong at night and 18mg concerta in the morning.

My doctor started me on a new med, trintellix, last week so I have been taking it for 6 days now.

I am constantly so afraid my muscles lock up. I live alone but have to hold a knife at all times because I feel like there's someone behind my shower curtain, there's someone under my bed, I can't turn my back to a room without almost starting to cry, I can't look into mirrors or open the curtains because I feel like people would watch me. If I have to do something besides sit on my bed so I can see the whole room (and I still feel like there's someone under my bed) I run and swipe the knife around so no one can get me. I can barely sleep with the lights on. It seems to get worse with caffeine and nicotine.

I have never been like this before and I'm scared. Will this go away? Can a depression med cause something like this? I've been trying to reach my doctor but she's so busy I haven't heard from her."
1753,How do people deal with the constant uninvited and unhelpful advice?,"I find that a good percentage of my anxiety and frustration comes from the feeling that my friends, colleagues and family can't resist giving me totally useless and often badly thought out advice.

I've tried to explain to people that no amount of positive thinking helps me to overcome a depression, that even trying to think positively is like trying to piss into a gale force wind. That yes, I did think about getting a regular routine, but my brain won't shut off because it's touching a pillow and weather I'm reading, listening to an audio book, walking the streets or snuggled up in bed, my brain will decide when it's going to let me sleep. No, I don't need my fucking Chakras cleansed and my star sign has nothing to do with my condition.

It's hard to keep being gracious and not seem like an ungrateful asshole. But most of this advice implies that they think I have never considered all of my options before, or that I'm simply not trying hard enough, or that I'm akin to a petulant child who just doesn't want to get better.

How do you explain to your wife or best friend who is just trying desperately to help you that they are just making everything worse? I've tried using those exact words to avoid confusion and it never ends well.  It's almost like them trying to help is more about them making themslves feel better than helping you, and now you've taken it away from them  you are the asshole.

It's exhausting."

And I keep seeing other 13 year olds, who aren't depressed (this is not a baseless assumption I have asked them and they said they weren't diagnosed )
And I just feel like shit, since I keep seeing them post on their insta edgy stuff like ""oh life sucks were all dead"" basically everything you can imagine a 13 year old trying to sound deep and act like an adult.

And I feel bad, since I don't want to associate myself with those who fake dark thoughts for attention and to act cool."

1756,Need Help for my Girlfriend,"I’m really concerned for my girlfriend and I really really need help. We are both 14 and have been together for 4 months and attend the same school. 

She has parents who are very controlling i.e. picking all her clothes and banning the colour black because it apparently looks ugly on her, and hit her when she messes up in the slightest, i.e. talking back to her mum.

She has revealed she is very sad sometimes and cuts herself, probably once a month.

Recently, she’s shared an account with me as the only follower and the whole account is dedicated to how bad she is.

The whole account is filled with posts about how much she hates herself, how ugly she is, how she wants to end it and how she can’t take it much longer.

She hasn’t posted on there in months but she sometimes tells me how she is still extremely sad and today asked me my thoughts on self harm and suicide and wrote my a paragraph on how much she hates herself.

She’s amazing to everyone else and very pretty yet she thinks so badly of herself. She’s been bullied in the past and been betrayed by two people who she’s called her friends and has a hard time opening up to others.

I’m really worried for her. I’m not sure if I should keep quiet or tell someone. She’s from a traditional background so her parents aren’t accepting of mental health and suicide.

What should I do?"
1757,I need serious help,"My mental health has gotten really worse, constant mood swings, anxiety, paranoia, insomnia, annoyance and non stop racing thoughts which goes on forever. Feels like there's a dozen people living in my brain, that take over my mind and body.

Right now I can’t put into words how I’m feeling but what felt like 2 minutes ago I could write down everything that is making me feel ‘the worst i've ever felt.’

I do want to tell people what's going on but I feel like I can’t because I keep blocking myself from doing it even though I know I really want to and I know I really need to.

I feel like I’ve been trying to piece together everything that has been going on in my head. But whenever I come to some sort of conclusion that I’m not doing okay I try to prove it wrong.

I feel like I’m battling between everything in a fucked up way which is making me feel like I’m fucked up. But here I go again as I write this down I’m telling myself everything is okay.

I can’t keep feeling like this anymore because I can’t tell people what's going on and it’s all in my head. And I’m the only one that hears this stuff. It is hard. And I’m confused and scared about what to do.

Everything's adding up. And it’s becoming too much I don’t know how much more it will take before anything happens. I don’t want to let anyone into my head because I just doesn’t make sense but if I don’t let someone else in then it’s just me listening to all this bullshit and I’m fucking over it."
1761,I think I’m a toxic person,"I’m 18F, and I think I’m a toxic person.

I wasn’t popular growing up. I was bullied and alone from kindergarten - grade 1. I went to a small Christian school, then switched to a bigger public school for grade 2. I quickly became friends with a girl, Mandy. Mandy was overweight and wanted to be my friend because I was “pretty.” I specifically remember this one day we were sitting in the grass at recess while I made her a flower crown out of dandelions. I put it on her and she looked at me and said “I’ve never had a friend as nice and pretty as you.” We were best friends until grade 4, when I met another girl who I liked better. (Becca.) One day I just walked up to Mandy and told her I thought she was annoying, and I didn’t want her around me.

Becca and I are still friends. Over the years we’ve cycled multiple third girls in and out of our group. First was in grade 7, when the girl was our “bestie” for the year but eventually she pissed me off and I cut her off entirely. Next was grade 8/9, when we had a new third girl. She was overweight and had a very annoying/grating personality. I felt better about myself around her because she was overweight, and her personality made me look mature. I knew she had bad things going on at home but I really didn’t care. I kind of thought of her as the backup in the group. In reality, Becca was spending more time with her than with me and I took it out on the other girl. She moved after grade 9 and I cut contact.

In grade 9 I reconnected with a former friend from elementary school at a youth group. (Hanna.) In elementary school, I met her on my first day. She sat on the bus with another girl who I liked better, so I just kicked Hanna out and convinced the other girl to do the same. When we reconnected, I saw we had both gained some weight. (She was always chubby as a child, I was always skinny but had gone up to about 150 lbs in grade 9 because of an eating disorder.)

I do this thing subconsciously when I meet new people. If they’re skinnier or prettier than me, I feel inferior and they usually end up being the “dominant” one in the friendship. (Like Becca.) If I feel like I’m better looking than them, I’m the dominant one. (Like Hanna.)

Basically whenever I hung out with Hanna, my personality felt different. I was more outgoing, more flirty with guys, and just more “popular acting” than normal. Because of this Hanna tended to be shy and quiet and listened to what i said. I had another acquaintance at school who was the same. Hanna and I both play the violin and are good at it, but she’s extremely competitive and it would often drive me insane. She would talk about how her lessons were more expensive than mine, or that she was going to make a career out of it and I wasn’t. I genuinely didn’t care about any of it. We went to different schools, so I would completely trash talk her to Becca and others at school about how she was “pretentious” and “full of herself.”

Now that I’ve graduated, I don’t see people as often anymore. (Especially because of covid.) I do miss Becca, but I don’t miss Hanna at all since she’s gone to college. (I’m taking a year off.) The only reason why I would want to hang out with her would be to feel superior again. Her parents are strictly against drinking, tattoos, etc and she’s very “good girl” Christian. I’ve sort of lost my belief in religion these past few years. I could tell it made Hanna feel insecure when I showed her a new tattoo I got or talked about times I went out with friends, which made me want to do it more.

The other time my personality got ugly was before schools shut down. I had dated this guy (Derek) a couple years back, but we broke up. Last year we had some exchange students from Italy and he got really close with one of the girls. She flirted with every guy but never when they were all together. I deeply disliked her even though I had no interest in getting back together with Derek. So I started “befriending” her. We paired together for projects and other things, and I started talking to Derek again (which caused him to ignore her for a little while.) I added her on Snapchat so I could see if she was staying at home or going out on the maps, and I sat near her to hear if she was talking about or to him. Overall I just interfered with shit a lot.

I absolutely was not one of the popular girls in high school. We had a group of them, pretty stereotypical with the popular girl theme. I’m not overly attractive or ugly, I was just one of the background people that everyone knew to some degree. (Small school.)

I’ve been thinking about this for awhile and I’m realizing I’m a toxic person. Everyone I pulled into my friend group either ended up getting kicked out/banished, or got accused of something and was cut off by the school as a whole. I really didn’t give a damn about any of them, except for Becca. I could care less what happens to them. The majority I can’t even remember their birthday or favourite colour. I only seem to make friends so I can get something out of it. I don’t really feel either bad or good about realizing I’m being toxic, it’s more just a feeling of “oh, ok that makes sense.” 

I’m genuinely a good friend to Becca, and care deeply about her. I also care deeply about my family. It’s just people who come into my life, and I see as temporary or for gain that this happens to."
1762,Changing slowly,"After living for the last 7 years with almost untreated, diagnosed ADHD, which as a common side factor has depression and suicidal thoughts I've finally decided and open up to my mother about those thoughts, something I never dated to do before because I thought she'd reject or ignore me or use it against me since I've had bad experiences with both parents and my dad had always called me a wuss. I've told her about what I've been emotionally going through for the last 7 years and my father actually told her to kick me out for trying to make up excuses and that 'it couldn't be that bad' if I waited this long to tell her. My mom stood firm by me and didn't kick me out, instead we started to regularly go for walks together out in nature, talk more with each other, I've started working out again (while looking out for Covid safety of course) and just 2 hours ago got my first meeting scheduled for in 4 weeks with a psychiatrist. I'm kind of happy about that and feel like if I keep putting effort into it I'm on a good road to change for the better and to be happy being myself again.
Thanks for reading everyone, I hope you are having a great day and are also doing the best you can!"
1763,"My friends are ignoring me, and I don’t have any cellular service to call the suicide hotline or text the crisis line.","I feel like such an attention seeker but I’m actually alone right now, by myself.
I came home from a buddies house on Monday, and I got the news that my mom had been fainting when she stands, and it’s been going on since Friday. My mom is borderline, and tends to act like her body is invincible. I can’t help but feel like I saved her life on Friday by nearly yelling at her to go to the emergency room. She had been insisting to her boyfriend that she knows her body and she’ll be fine, she just needs sleep. She wasn’t fine. The diagnosis she got shattered me to pieces and I can’t seem to differentiate real life from a nightmare right now. They suspect she has a brain tumor and bradycardia... I’ve been sobbing for the past three days because for the past couple of years I have had severe intrusive thoughts about my mom dying and me finding her body. I can’t take it anymore. I’m trying so hard to be strong for my family and I’m begging for support for my friends,,, and I’ve got literally nothing, not even the suicide hotline because I have no cell service. I’m having intrusive thoughts about even more self harm and making myself get admitted but I can’t go to a psyche ward right now, I need to watch my younger siblings (13, 10, 8, 3 years old) while my dad works graveyard at Amazon. I’m truly by myself because the kids are all asleep and it’s 3:00am. I live in the United States, California to be exact if you have any ideas on my hotline issue. I’m really struggling and I can’t stop trembling."
1764,Are my dreams a warning or just yet another thing my depression is throwing in?,"21F. A few days ago I decided to skip class for the first time this semester and sleep in. When I went to sleep I dreamed that I could predict people’s deaths. When I woke up, I found out that my prof had cancelled class anyway on the one day I skipped. I laughed and thought it was a nice coincidence. 

It’s been three days, and everytime I’ve slept since then, I’ve dreamed about family members dying, usually my mom + extended family. Like I literally just woke up from a dream where my sister murdered my mom and aunt and decided to make this post. 

The reason I think this might be my depression is because when I get really low I often dream about myself or others dying. I dream about death fairly often as a whole but it’s usually me dying or me killing others as opposed to this. 

The reason I’m not so sure it might be depression is because 9/10 I am aware I’m dreaming at night. Idk why but I just nearly always know and I can shift and change the dream how I please. For these last few days, I haven’t been aware in my dreams, and I wake up and have to remember what universe I’m in and it’s incredibly jarring. 

I don’t have anxiety and I’m not really a superstitious person, but I can’t get this weird feeling out of my stomach for days now that something negative is going to happen, and everytime I wake up from these dreams I have this inner ear pain as if my ear infection is coming back, but it stops after a few minutes. 

Have any of you experienced this sort of thing? Am I going crazy?"
1765,Ready to give up,"I'm sorry if this isn't the correct subreddit for this kind of thing, but I just don't know what to do in life anymore, I just feel so lost and I feel like I don't even fit in with society anymore. 

I'm only almost 19 but man I've been thru so much. From getting molested when I was only 7 because my mom decided to send me off with a stranger she just met when she divorced my dad, to having to grow up constantly having to stress and worry over every little thing because I never knew if the electric would still be on when I got home from school. To recently having to live in a crappy bug infested motel because I have a shitty step dad.I don't even know how to really function as an adult because I've never had a role model in life, and so I just feel so lost, so confused. 


But sorry it this kind of post isn't allowed here, I just figured I'd give it a shot since I have no idea what else to do since I can't even see a doctor or anything because I don't have a way there."
1766,"I think more money should be invested in mental health,its only recently it's being recognised,but not yet understood,it took my daughter a year to get diagnosed with borderline bipolar...and numerous doctors shes at uni studying to be s forensic pathologist and its been really really hard for her .",Mental health
1767,Im so confused right now,"My entire mental state is just lost right now, I am so lonely and sad all the time and i just have no energy or motivation anymore, whenever i go for a walk all i can think about is jumping into the road. I feel even worse when people reach out cause I tell them im fine but I am not. I dont know what to do with my life anymore and I really feel like im on the edge of doing something stupid. What do you guys do when you feel like this? Who do you go to for help and what steps can i take to stop feeling so lost all the time."
1768,I don’t feel safe at home anymore but I don’t know why.,"I live with my parents and brother and 2 sisters. I have 2 older brothers that moved out about a year ago or so. My family is loving and caring and stuff and not abusive or anything. 

But over the past few months, I’ve grown “paranoid” at night, thinking someone is going to break into our house and hurt my family. Every time I close my eyes to try to sleep, I think I hear a noise in the house and I get freaked out. 

I have dogs that bark pretty loud if they hear anything, and we have pretty heavy duty doors. So the house is fine, but I still make sure I check all the doors are locked before I go up to sleep, even though my dad already checked them. And then when I try to sleep, I can’t because my mind keeps making up awful scenarios (and I mean very awful). The past two weeks, I actually had nightmares about my family being hurt. 

The funny thing is, I can sleep fine at my boyfriends place. Whenever I sleep over, the thoughts don’t come at night. But when I’m home, I think I hear someone in the house or i begun thinking the worse that can happen, causing me to lose sleep. 

I don’t really know what to do. I’ve tried talking to my mom about it, but she just says I need to stop worrying. But I can’t, it just happens, and it’s freaking me out now."
1769,Just wanna talk feeling down anyone up?,I don't like anyone now a days I don't feel connected even with my bestfriend feels like this whole life is about money.
1770,Feel like giving up (redo),"Sorry for reposting, I just wanted to give it a test because I've already tried 3 different subreddits and I didn't wanna type out another long paragraph just to find out I don't have enough karma points or something


But I'm only almost 19 and my whole life has been nothing but problems, when I was only 7 my mom decided to divorce my dad and in the process she decided to up and go with some guy she hasn't seen in years, she ended up sending me to his place after I only met him twice and well long story short I had to share a bed with him and if always wake up to his hands on my/in my pants. I've always been to scared to say anything because I didn't wanna screw over my mom so I've kept quite all these years 

The next traumatic thing to happen  was when said guy and my mom finally got a house together,  he ended up turning very unpleasant and started neglecting us leaving my mom to have to find a way to do everything, and so in that process I'd always have to worry about stuff like if we'd have food to eat or even of the power would be on when I got home from school because with it being left up to my mom that only had child support to depend on she was hardly ever able to pay it and would always have to depend on some silver lining like the fact they were required to turn it on in the winter

Fast forward to when I turned 14 I need up going to live with my dad, and with that I had to start yet another new school, well the traumatic thing to happen there was the typical situation, I was the new kid and with all the stuff previously I decided to just stay to myself anymore and so In the process some popular kid decided to make memes about me saying I was a school shooter all because I was the new quit kid, so somehow I ended up getting kicked out and nearly arrested over it even tho his own cousin showed proof that he started it all. 


So I ended up having to move back home which at this point my now step dad hasn't gotten real bad to where he's barely talk to anyone and I guess it really affected Ted my mom because it turned into where I'd come home from school only to find her trying to off herself with a broken piece of glass, and that turned into a habit to where if come home only to find out either she tried to off herself again or that she addmited herself to the hospital again, 


Now let's jump to when I was 1t  now this situation is more my fault but I ended up taking whatever way I could to get out of the house so I ended up loving with a chick I just started dating, well the whole time I was there I was treated like I was their personal little maid, and the whole family was just toxic, the thing I'm getting to here is the girl I was dating convinced/threatened me into having a kid with her by saying she'd off herself because she wasn't happy and that only a baby could make her happy and what not, so me being stupid and only being 15 eventually gave in only for her to up and ditch the day she found out she was pregnant, and yes I tried and tried to be there but shed always ghost and block me any time she dated a new dude. But that's more on me for being dumb I guess


And the most recent thing to happen is back in like 2017 my step dad got us kicked out of our house and so he resulted in going to a motel, and we've remained in motels since then, at first it wasn't bad until he decided to up and quit his job only to mice an hour away all for some other job, and this place is horrible, he chose the cheapest motel and so as usual there's bugs here, not to mention everything's just shitty anyways, and I'm just loosing my mind because no matter what I try it's useless, and it's to the point I can't sleep unless I pass out from exhaustion anymore


I just don't know what to do with life, I feel so trapped anymore because all my hopes of going my own way have been crushed, and in the end I think this is what my step dad has been going for all this time. 


I just feel so lost in life anymore, I've isolated myself so much to where I ruin any friendships I do get, I feel like I don't even fit into society anymore. And I just have no idea what to do anymore

My mental health has just plummeted, the only reason I'm even still around is because I get all panicky when I think of ending it all because I get worried I'll mess it up and just be in even more pain then I already am. 

But sorry for this being so long, I just needed an out for all the stuff I've been bottling up I guess, and sorry if this all gets confusing I tried to simplify things so it wasn't longer then it already is"
1771,Rabies OCD. Need help,"I thought my rabies OCD was done, but now it came back. Ive already done a lot of research about rabies, but my mind keeps on doubting me. ""What if im wrong? What if what i read was wrong?"" and it just creates new, more questions about rabies, and im now stuck on a loop. Also, my mind is creating these scenarios, like for example. In the future, where my my unvaccinated/vaccinated dog bit me and i didn't care to get rabies vaccine cuz my dog would most likely have no rabies... But what if my information about rabies were wrong all these years, and i will get rabies and die?? Another scenario is that ive pet my friends unvaccinated/vaccinated cat/dog and I've come in contact with its saliva and i rub it on my eyes or got it on my wound. And i got rabies, and i will die. Ik this wont happen cuz most likely my friends pet wont have rabies, and if im worried, i can tell my friend to observe it for 10 days, and the pet would most likely be fine after 10 days.. But what if my information all these years were wrong and i will get rabies and i died? Man, this is all a waste of time, i cant even focus on studying anymore, my brain is all foggy, and my heart is racing rn. What should i do??"
1772,Person that always talks in stories?,"There's a person in my life that often talks in stories rather than answer any question directly or even just converse. These stories are often stories of their past - work experiences, interactions with friends, upbringing. These stories are nearly always used to paint this person in a positive light and/or show how they're a victim.

This person thinks very highly of themselves and believes they're honestly a cut above most. However, deep down it seems like they're incredibly insecure. 

I initially assumed this was a sort of narcissistic personality issue. However, I'm confused at the constant use of stories vs direct conversation. Sometimes, these stories can go on for long periods of time, wearing people out."
1773,Tips on regulating emotions,"Hello. My family member is dying and is mentally unwell. Today we are admitting him to the hospital for a psych eval, as he is threatening harm to those closest to him. I need to focus on work as I can’t take time off - doesn’t anyone have tips on regulating emotions (I’m a mess) or compartmentalizing? 

Thank you"
1774,Sick of my parents' shit,"Just yesterday, my mom demanded I ""voluntarily"" cough up 200 euros just because my older sister did a few months back - she thought this was the most normal thing in the world. I refused on the basis that this skewed definition of ""voluntary"" doesn't sit well with me.

Just an hour ago I was told that I had to leave within 3 months time, that she wouldn't want anything to do with me anymore.

I've grown used to the fact that my mom doesn't listen to what I have to say and just pushes me away whenever I don't act according to her image but this is a new low. To sketch the situation I'm in: I'm a heart patient with half of my capacity cut off, unemployed and a second lockdown seems to be on its way shortly since the government is putting on stricter limitations.

I'd be glad to move out of the house but being kicked out in this situation is going to be hell."
1775,.....,"-1 poem

A shimmering light enclapses my dreams,
A wall between you and me.
I want it to grow brighter, to see what’s on the other side,
my desire to end darkness growing bright.

To be or not to be, is only an illusion,
for what you are is different than who you know.
The path that lies ahead of you is fixed,
the journey to the wall being different for everyone.

An eternal darkness, that was mine,
the last cry of a wolf that howls,
an old street light flickering unnoticed,
electricity cut that stays eternally silent.

A dream,all a dream, or is it another delicately woven illusion?
For what it could be, I cannot answer."
1776,Irritability turns to anxiety and anger! Does anyone with anxiety or manic depression experience this?,"My birth mother is manic depressive (Bipolar) I never got to know her because she was mentally unstable and still is now. From what my family members tell me she had very bad anxiety and was always irritable with a bad temper. That's pretty much all I know about her bipolar symptoms and I'm aware it can affect others who have it differently.

When I got into my late teens I started getting these kind of like ""mood shifts"" where I would feel fine and then I would get easily irritable and anxious and then go into this what I call""rage"" where I've become so angry I scream yell and argue with my family and friends! My doctor put me on a migraine preventive which is also used as a mood stabilizer and I didn't have that ""rage"" anymore. Since last year I started taking an antidepressants for nerve pain and the ""rage"" came back again along with severe depression and anxiety, panic attacks along mood shifts.

It's mostly is something to do with the antidepressants or maybe my anxiety is that severe, but sometimes I wonder if I could have bipolar like my birth mother. I did some research online and found that anxiety and anger can be connected to mania. I talked to a psychiatrist about it before, but he didn't take it seriously and said it was just anxiety and that ""I would know if I have bipolar. Getting an appointment with a new psychiatrist for another opinion isn't easy right now because of the virus, but I'm trying to get a phone appointment with my primary doctor this week to switch nerve pain medications.

I don't know anyone who has a similar problem like me. My friends and family don't relate to me. Whatever this is I just don't want to feel isolated and alone."
1777,Don’t know how to get better,"I guess this is a vent but any advice could be useful.
       So I fell back to rock bottom about a month ago because of allot of things that happened, and since then I just can’t handle my mental illness. I have (diagnosed) bipolar along with 5 other things, but it’s truly my bipolar that has been getting to me. Today though, I couldn’t stop myself from switching from pissed to depressed,which ended up causing issues with my boyfriend. I guess I’m being triggered by hose much I hate myself and my situation at the moment. I know how worthless I am, I’m a mess. I can’t get myself under control, I was doing amazing a month ago, I had my issues under control more than I ever have before. I don’t understand why I can’t get back to that point. The counseling doesn’t really make a difference and I don’t want to be on meds, they always seem to mess me up more. 
    I feel like I’m I’ll never be truly happy, like every time I get better I’ll just end up at rock bottom again. I know I’ll never do anything with my life, I have no motivation to do anything and I have no desire to do anything with my life. My addicts are acting up. I relapsed with my self harm today, and I want to be high. Although I can deal with that, it’s still putting strain on me. I know I can make it through this and I can be okay at some point, but I just truly don’t feel like living anymore, I know I’m better off dead and would be happier. Im not going to kill myself, I just know I don’t want to live."
1778,What exactly is this feeling I feel in my chest?,"I been feeling this way for months now. I feel like its void, a depraved hollow feeling lingers in my chest at all time. I lost interest in the things I've been doing in the past 7 months. I do nothing all day but use my phone/laptop. Honestly I don't even leave the house as I'm not really allowed to. I don't enjoy the music I used to like, and the hobbies I once loved. I get bored of everything. My chest just feels void. I have no friends around and I just stay in touch via text. Prior to living with my parents I stayed for 5 months in complete isolation at university. 

I don't feel like I'm sad enough to be depressed and I don't feel like it can be classed as lonely as my family is around so there is someone I talk to. Its just that this live is to repetitive and its just me constantly waiting for this pandemic to end. Every day I wake up it still exists. IDK what to do. I've tried therapy it didn't even help. I was meant to return back to university but chose to stay home because the cases have gone up, not worth the risk and classes are online. I just don't feel like myself anymore and I hate it.  IM 21 years old if that matters"
1779,Does trauma affect memories,I had the sad task of holding my mothers hand as she passed away from cancer in 2002 I am 44 now .and I cannot remember much about my mother .it was like my Brain locked out the memories because they were to upsetting for me to deal with at the time . But now I struggle to remember much about our time together up to when she passed away . Anyone suffer from the same thing ?
1780,Just want to cry out to somebody i am losing it,"I am a 32 year old guy stuck in a foreign country with my wife and 9 month old baby, we are away from family and because of this covid restrictions we might not see them  for another year or so. My baby has developed fever and its been more than a week, we have done multiple GP visits, also a visit to ER. They just ask us to continue with the medicines. 

It is heartbreaking to see him suffer, everybody is anxious , scared and very sad around me. My wife is going crazy and thinks she has to do something to cure him, I am the only one who is acting tough and trying to keep everybody calm. But inside i am losing it, i want to cry out loud and share everything.

Sorry if this is not a big issue to be shared here, its just that we both were well pampered throughout our lives and this is all overwhelming. I have other mental issues as well, so this life situation currently is breaking me. I just wanted to vent"
1781,Does anyone else have a group of many inner voices?,"I'm trying to figure out how to word this without sounding super weird.

I have several inner voices that all weigh in on different day-to-day things. They each seem to have different roles and step in at different times:

* one that's very childlike --- happy but also easily confused, excited and brought out when there's things like sparkly colors
* one that's just sorta me and my inner monologue --- thinking about what I'm doing, how I'm feeling, standard stuff, ordering food, responding to conversations
* one that tries to keep things organized --- making sure I remember things and that I keep the childlike voice from being too present in professional contexts
* one that focuses on physical wellness --- saying things like 'don't forget to eat,' 'maybe just a small banana,' 'you can take a quick shower and then get in some water,' 'you've been feeling sick for a few days, maybe you should go to a doctor,' 'can you walk on that hurt ankle? maybe we can wrap it up?'
* one that focuses on emotional wellness --- talking softly and telling me 'it's okay babe, you can do this. you're doing so well. I'm so proud' (maybe one of my favorites although I appreciate them all, and she's super kind to the childlike voice)
* one that serves as almost an internal therapist --- stops me in my thoughts when I start getting anxious and questions whether the concerns are truly rational and how maybe they could be reframed, also considers if my approach to things and people could be altered to make things feel safer and more pleasant for everyone involved (sorry this one's hard to describe exactly, it's also one of the one's that argues the most with the other inner voices &amp; weighs in a lot on interactions with others)
* one that comes up when there's moral dilemmas or decisions to be made --- maybe a devil's advocate, but it presents both sides
* and then the worst one, which is almost like an abuser inside my head --- this one constantly tells me things I would never dream of saying to another human being. things like 'you're a failure,' 'you can't possibly do this,' 'you're worthless,' 'why are you even trying,' It yells at me if I upset someone and says I shouldn't be forgiven because I'm a terrible person. It also gets angry and punishing if I do something imperfectly or get something wrong. it goes on and on and it's really hard to manage

I've been working (mostly with the help of the therapist voice) to try to get the inner voices to collaborate more and be more supportive of each other rather than blaming or getting angry at each other. But it's still quite tricky

But yeah - is this something many people experience? I have heard people talking about their inner monologues. Is that what this is? I haven't talked to anyone about this before for fear of sounding crazy

(also just to note: I know they're not hallucinations, they come from me, they don't sound like they're coming from outside)

I'd be interested to hear other people's experiences"
1782,how can I fix what is happening and what are my options?,"so some time last year I attempted suicide. 12 grams of paracetamol and some alcohol. the only thing I feel guilty for is hurting my family by doing it. went to therapy and essentially lied my way through to the other side because I didn't actually know what I was feeling. he asked me a series of questions, most of them I have forgotten so I wouldn't be able to re-answer. he interrupted a lot and mostly only listened to my parents and even when he talked to me I said what I thought was normal. so I decided to keep track of when things get bad and I've made a list of things that happen. they're not constant, but not frequent either. most of the time they come in waves.

Can't form sentence because words slip away after thinking them, only Able to focus on one word.

Extremely tense shoulders happening more often when I wake up

Concentration loss, pretty fuckin bad

Anxiety sometimes no reason

Struggling to get up

Emptiness.

Can hear people speak but can't properly register what they say sometimes

Random mood swings/sudden bursts of energy or get sad for no reason

Get angry at small things for no reason 

Suicidal thoughts, don't actually want to act on them

Dissociation, feel like I'm dreaming but know I'm not

Static vision
like a static TV screen over my eyes 

Sometimes don't actually know how I feel

Don't know how to explain emotions if I'm not feeling them in that current moment

feces changes consistency when in school, when at home it's normal but I tend to get diarrhea when in school

the last one is a bit weird but it was one of the questions he asked me and I passed off as like ""emmm normal?"" 
he asked me what the consistency of my feces is.
recently I've really been struggling to concentrate. I have to try very very very hard to do it. my grades are currently around 40%-90%, varying in subjects. but I find it almost impossible to study by myself and it takes me a while to do my homework as I have to sit by myself and I find I get lost in my head very quickly.

the doctor that I went to therapy with, in CAHMS (in Ireland)
said that I could have mild Asperger's, but it's so mild that it almost wouldn't be worth testing for. and I guess, my parents got an answer, so they were happy. it's Asperger's. that's why I tried to kill myself. i don't know. I don't really have an answer myself to be honest, I was just in a lot of emotional pain and it comes and goes a lot.

so if I were to try get help with this, who should I talk to and what are my options?"
1783,I used to be toxic to others in the past and now it's taking a toll on me,"I've apologized and always try my best to make it up to the people I may have hurt in the past, being young and stupid. Still, I don't know if I'm imagining it but it always feels like I'm doing something wrong in a relationship, romantically or not. 

I always go out of my ways to help others, basically a people pleaser, however I always have this inkling that my friends think badly of me. I'm terrified of asking for help, from anyone, ever. 

I have a very close friend that I'm doing my uni course with, I love her with all my heart and would honestly never wish anything bad upon her. Partly because I owe her a lot in the last semester. I was going a really rough time and her calling me, telling me to do work every day helped me pass my first semester. 

This semester she isn't doing so well and I helped her with a few quizzes, the marks aren't ideal and I know it's really hurting her. I'm trying my best to help her but it makes me feel horrible when the questions I helped her with didn't get the mark. 

I feel like i'm a disappointing friend. I could have done better for her."
1784,"How to forgive our family, the people who hurt us, and most importantly ourselves?","As much as I've been hurt by a lot of things in my life, I recently had an emotional relapse and I realised I still resent a lot of things, especially myself.

Does anyone else just like forget everything that has ever happened in their entire life? Like my interviewer asked me 4 questions like ""describe a time when...."" and my mind just kept going completely blank?? Anyway I'm really upset because I think I actually have a mental illness of some sort (not sure which one). I just wanted to rant since I really wanted this job but struggle with coming up with stuff on the spot like that. Anyway I think these questions are stupid and unfair if I really do... how do y'all feel about the typical job interview process?

On Friday his genetics, mixed with his stress levels as a teenager and a member of the divorced parents club kicked in, and he had a panic attack. He asked me if we could discuss it on the podcast, for him to let it out and also to help others out whose kids may be going through the same. I thought it may be helpful to post it here.

1791,"You Smile, But You Wanna Cry. You Talk, But You Wanna Be Quiet. You Pretend Like You’re Happy, But You Aren’t.","In the eyes of others, you are happy, living your greatest life, full of joys, laughs and the company of others. But, deep inside, you feel lonely and lost. Realise that sometimes you just need to be alone and let your tears flow, a puddle or an ocean, it doesn’t matter the amount, let it all come out. 

Whenever you can, bring those tears out. Hiding your tears will only flood the heart. I understand how hard it is for you. But, the more you hide your feelings, the more they show. The more you deny your feelings, the more they grow. Keeping your darkest emotions and thoughts inside of you can be critical in the long-term... 

- The feelings you’ll hide
- The dreams you won’t be able to find 
- You’ll lose your mind
- You’ll fall behind 
- You won’t find your place
- You’ll lose your faith
- You’ll fall from grace
- You’ll be all over the place
- You won’t feel like yourself 

Sometimes, the person who tries to keep everyone happy is the loneliest person."
1792,How do you cope with how the world is right now?,"Specifically America because I feel like we’re destined for the second Revolution by next month. I had to drop out of college to homes school my stepson. The small amount of friends I had did not value social distancing, so I was forgotten. My partner is struggling too. We have to live with my in-laws so it’s been pretty terrible. I cry myself to sleep and wake up crying most the time. Wtf do I do?"
1793,don't know what this is,"my father died last year in front of our house. he was shot, almost midnight. after that incident, i became scared of going out at night. there was this one time that there was a person outside our gate and it was around 10pm. i felt so nervous and was trembling. after talking to them, i felt like puking and i was so scared. is this serious?"
1794,I’m proof it does get better,"I know it seems like your mental health will never get better. I was on the verge of cutting myself and thinking about suicide, but I surrounded myself with good people. They made me not hurt as bad anymore. I no longer am hurting myself and I know you can get better to."
1795,I need advice and tips to ground myself in stressful situations.,"Just going to start by saying sorry if this gets confusing. I'm not completely present right now and may miss out info. 

I'm in a bit of a bad spot mentally right now and need some tips to stay grounded. It's kind of difficult to not drift off. Especially when my home environnement is causing me great stress and there isn't may places to go during this pandemic. I've just come from therapy and we were talking about how I've fallen into this habit of ""zoning out"" (I don't know what the best way is to describe it), when I get emotionally distressed. It's hinders me more than it helps now.

I know physical sensations soothe me, so I've ordered a weighted blanket to help, and brought some stress toys. I know auditory stimuli and moving visuals do not work - most of the time it's like a sensory overload and it makes me feel worse. Walking home from therapy today was awful because of the noise and everything and everyone moving. I don't know if anyone has any recommendations for noise cancelling headphones. The Headphones would be a bit more dangerous for me when I'm on the street, but they'll probably be handy when I'm indoors. 

I don't know where else to go with this. My therapist told me to also explore taste and smell to ground me. I don't know how to do that in a safe way without falling into self-harm territory. Eating for example, I've used in the past to distract/""soothe"" me, but it goes to extremes.

I think getting rid of some clutter and reorganising my space will also help, but I get stuck in this frustrating cycle of zoning out and feeling guilty for being triggered/getting emotional when I try to do day-to-day stuff. I'm struggling to move forward and it's upsetting me."
1796,Wtf MH awareness,So I'm new and would like to give people a chance to feel there not the only ones. Many stories experiences to come.
1797,no diagnosis?,"so by the end of 2017 I was feeling really down and having suicidal thoughts so i decided to get help and went to therapy for about a month or so, after that I started to feel better so I just stopped, 2 years later, so last year I started seeing another psychologist and she said that it was something that i needed to do my whole life(?), by July or so I started feeling really bad so she decided that it was better that I started seeing a psychiatrist and started taking meds. I stopped going to therapy by the end of the year bc I was feeling overwhelmed bc of school and stuff, but some shit happened and I started therapy again with a new therapist at the start of 2020. I’ve been on meds for a year and doing therapy for almost two now but neither my psychiatrist or psychologists have ever given me a real diagnosis, is this normal?"
1798,I had an appointment to talk to a psychiatrist today and I fully planned on telling the truth about everything,"When she asked me questions I froze up and started crying and all that stuff about telling the truth went out the window. I wasn’t telling her the truth about how bad I actually feel and past attempts, partly because it’s so hard for me to explain things and I feel like I just don’t know what to say about how I’m feeling or anything really. Now I don’t know what to do, I want an accurate diagnosis but I can’t help but hold myself back and it’s just really hard being vulnerable like that."
1799,I need to vent...,"The only thing that was keeping me going and I was proud of was my weightloss....


Now it's not. I feel like a failor. I've lost 30 kilos in 9 months. I still have a problem with binging once a week between 2000-3000 cals one day a week. 


I fast and eat healthy and on 1000 cals all of the other days and supervised by my doctor. Low calories due to medical issues. 

I'm still put down and belittled online all the time when I try to mention that I'm proud of my weightloss... I'm not doing well the last two days and have had two massive breakdowns. 


I feel I've failed at everything. That I don't want to get out if bed anymore. No one is willing to understand and it's all getting to much to bare..

I never promoted binging I never said any of it. I said I eat well and exercise 6 days a week on 1000cal diet. On Saturdays once a week I eat between 2000-3000 cals in a meal becouse I fast. So I only eat once at night. 

My meal is 2000-3000 once a week.

1800,"God Complex, needing help.","Hi, I’m using this throw away so no one finds out who I am in my social life. 

I am a M(14) and I think I suffer from a god complex, or at least I have been told too many times by my friends and now my family. I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do. It’s becoming a struggle of mine and it’s making my life absolute hell. 

The reason they accuse me of this is because of how I act. I often want things to revolve around me, I’m often selfish and ignorant, a few other things I can pin point. People have constantly told me to change but it’s so hard to do so because of this problem, it haunts me and it’s making me lose my mind.

I feel as if my friendships are beyond repair and I want to save them as best as I can while helping myself. It’s hurting me, my family, my social life and everything I do. Affecting my day to day activities. There isn’t an hour of the day where I constantly worry if I have done something selfish or rude without realizing. 

I decided to turn to Reddit cause I have tried everything, I want help. I don’t want to be this way and I don’t want to lose my friendships. I’m not asking for pity, as most people think that I would because of what I do. I realize the things I do; but I can’t take responsibility for it. For me in my head, it feels like the whole world will end.
 
So Reddit, what do I do? All I ask is for help, not anything rude. I’m seeing my therapist Saturday but It’s freaking me out. Please send some advice or something until I can go. 
  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
tl;dr: I think I suffer from a god complex, what should I do? It’s affecting my friendships, my relationship with my family and it’s affecting my wellbeing."

1802,How do you develop a sense of identity and self worth?,"I am 32/f and have been dealing with this my entire life. I feel myself starting to snap lately. It pains me to interact with anybody beyond surface chatter. I’m not able to discuss normal things, preferences, hobbies etc with anyone because my mind goes blank. It’s hard for me to even listen to music alone sometimes becagse I judge myself for whatever I listen to and think about what it says about me. 
I’m still lost in life and don’t have any idea what I want to do. I’m unemployed and have no hobbies.
I’m decent at mirroring so occasionally I’ll appeal to people much more interesting than me, even though I know it’ll hurt me and stress me out, and watch as the interest drains from their face as I answer yet another question “I don’t know” and have nothing to say. 

I can’t even be around family. Can’t be around old best friends. I feel humiliated at all times even completely alone in my room. I can’t believe I still haven’t gotten it together by 32. I feel like a huge loser.

I signed up for TalkSpace therapy today. I’m desperate and hope it helps."

1804,Plz i need advice on how to stop seeking reassurance(Rabies OCD),"My brain just keeps on doubting me, even tho im absolutely sure i know the answer. My brain would go on saying, ""What if im wrong"" ""What if what i read was wrong?"" ""What if the information I've been told was wrong?"" I literally spend this day just seeking for reassurance, searching over and over again questions to feed my doubts and worries. I haven't studied for school, and did my homework. Now im left with a ton of homeworks to do. Seeking reassurance is such a waste of time, and its causing me intense brain fogs, like rn. I just wish to stop doing it, but i cant. Cant even focus on a certain task. And my heart was racing the entire day, worrying.

Also my OCD theme is rabies. I dont have rabies. But my mind worries a lot about getting rabies. I've already read a ton about rabies, and i can guarantee myself that i have no rabies, and i wont ever get rabies, but my mind wont fucking listen to me."
1805,How do I reach out for help from my support system without feeling like a burden to them?,"I grew up with emotionally unavailable parents. My mom was always angry at my dad bc he had no income and she was the sole bread winner. Growing up, I was forced not to feel anything because everyone around me was feeling their own emotions and I felt responsible for it. I was constantly putting out fires left and right as soon as I turned 17. Worked 2 jobs, paid for my own expenses, had to deal with my mom’s and stepdad’s marriage issues, be there for my friends, dealt with an emotionally abusive boyfriend and here I am. I have been feeling like Im swimming with no end in mind. Im afraid that I’ll get tired of swimming and I won’t come back up for air. I dont think I am suicidal (at least not now). I have always struggled with reaching out for fear that I would be seen as a burden. I have an irrational fear that my friends are not actually interested in how I am as a person. That they’re friends with me because I’m always that person who they go for when they need an advice. I have been trying to be better at asking for help but I don’t know where to start or how to change my way of thinking that my friends are burdened by my problems. Im scared that I’ll never get to experience how it feels like to be a mentally healthy person."

I don’t want people to think I’m a liar . I feel like I constantly have to prove how much mental pain I’m in or people will think I’m a liar .

1809,My friend wants to kill herself and I'm afraid she might act on it soon. (US),"A friend of mine (32) had a miscarriage earlier this year. Her marriage is also in shambles (all faults of the male party), and she is teeter-tottering on another love interest. She's been resorting to alcohol to numb the pain for months and has been suicidal throughout. She has constant breakdowns, multiple times a week, and has trouble functioning in her daily life.

Today I am afraid she might act on her thoughts. She said she just wants to be with the child she lost, and the stress she's going through is too much for her.

She is in a different State and I am unable to reach her physically to meet up. I have no idea what to do. I do not want to lose my friend, PLEASE HELP"
1810,"""I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.""","I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I don't know a better place for this. 

I am struggling with 2020 situational depression. (I do have diagnosed PTSD.) It's a lot of things coming together - the US election, working from home, the fact that I haven't touched another human being except for medical exams in 7 months  - coming together and dragging me down. My therapist has assured that this is a normal, healthy response to a terrible situation, but it's vile and it's gotten so much worse since September.

When this all began, I would make plans for what I would do when it was safe and everything opened up. Work told us we would only be working from home for about two weeks. That was March 17.  I was happy to be kept safe and tried to figure out what this weird little moment in time was - and where I was going to find toilet paper. I wasn't happy about the isolation - I am very sensitive (see PTSD above) and it felt uncomfortable, but I'm also a high health risk for COVID so I just made plans for what I would do when it blows over, much as I do during a bad flu season.

I stopped doing that because... it's now October and there are zero signs of this blowing over. Flu season is approaching and will probably further isolate me. (I am in negotiations of opening my pandemic pod to a previous FWB if only to get some human touch, but pod negotiations are ongoing.) 

The pandemic and elections scare me but I'm mostly apathetic. I've lost interest in things. I've tried starting new projects to jump start enjoying life, but it's just not there. I struggle to see any kind of hopeful future - although this could very much be the PTSD talking, too. I'm tired all the time - although this could also be my medications, almost all of which cause tiredness. I've also been dealing with on-and-off flares with my physical health problems and limited access to doctors, which isn't fun either. I had been having a fun sexting thing going with a guy I met on an app early in the pandemic, with the goal of meeting once it's safe, and he pointed out last night that it's been more than a month since I texted him anything fun and sexy. And it's true because I cannot imagine having the energy to do that or the desire.

Like I said, my therapist is fully aware of what's going on (and encouraging my FWB negotiations to positively conclude so I can get some human touch) and believes it's a situational reaction to the fact that 2020 is happening. I just really don't like it, but don't know, either, how I can improve it."
1811,Frustration at an online post,"Not necessarily after advice here I just need to vent a frustration.

Since me and my ex broke up she has become very outspoken on social media (she was quite quiet when we were together) which is totally fine I’m glad she’s coming out of her shell, I’m just annoyed at the sort of content she posts.

She wrote this huge paragraph about how important mental health is to her and how she would help anyone in a position where they needed it, which again is totally fine, but she wasn’t like that with me during the last half a year of our two year relationship (specifically the time where my mental health really started to decline).

I worked at a company that required me to work away for three days of the week and that started at four in the morning, this didn’t stop her from calling me at midnight to start an argument that lasted between one and two hours. She would start arguments about a wide range of topics, sometimes it would be about sex or the lack of (my libido sort of took a nose dive during my mental decline), sometimes it would be because I was spending too much time with my best friend (she would mockingly accuse me of being gay with him, not that’d be an issue but I’m aware of my sexuality and know that I’m not), and sometimes it would be about other mundane topics that she decided were relevant at daft O’clock. If I were ever to have an illness, she would claim to have it worse, if there were ever any rules within our relationship, they would only apply to me. She spent a huge amount of time being jealous of both my male and female friends, often using the phrase “you’re boiling my piss” behind closed doors if a female friend so much as hugged me, yet would claim innocence at the things she would get up to, like how once she told me she approached someone in a supermarket because she found them attractive and it turned out to be me or she would say sexually explicit things about my friends when they were not around.

What really broke the camels back in this situation though was how during a phone call a few days before we group up I experienced for the first time in my life a panic attack, I was genuinely frightened as my arms started to go numb and my chest compressed and I was asking for help, yet all she did was continue to talk about something that was happening on her end of the phone call, as if I wasn’t wheezing and spluttering down the receiver.

My point is her post made her seem like a Good Samaritan when it came to mental health but I know for a fact she contributed to a percentage of my decline, and it took nearly everything I had to not start an argument either on that specific post or through private message."
1812,I am cursed,"My entire. Family. Is so mentally ill. The worse part? My parents are the type that refuse to get therapy. And it’s hard for them to believe in actual mental health. I feel like my family would be the type that would have haunted looking portraits of each member hung up in an abandoned house and our family name would be tied to a local legend that we were all cursed and doomed to live horrible lives till death. Does that even make sense? Anyways, I am. Closer to losing it every single day. I feel so unlucky. I feel like a bad luck charm. Like my life is surrounded by negativity and my existence brings negativity and constant torture. I dont feel real. I feel like a robot. There’s so much thats been on my mind and so much I can say but if I spit out everything right now it would be as if I was writing a novel. Im so fucking tired. Every day of my 16 year life has been so painful. Im so tired.  I am so.   Tired.  Im not even old. Why have i suffered so much and im not even legally an adult? 

What is even going on anymore"
1813,Do I need help?,"Should I see a doctor?

When I was 15ish I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and OCD I took meds and had therapy and it got better until recently again. I’m 18 now. 

I can go weeks/ days feeling fine and happy loving how everything’s going and then I will get into a state of mind where I feel insanely anxious, suicidal, self harm and desperate for drugs (weed at the moment but I sometimes get extreme desire to take cocaine to the point I actively try and seek it out) 
I get so angry at my mum and I will read into everyhting she says and assume everyhting she says is a bad thing even though I’m consciously aware that I’m overreacting I physically cannot hold back my anger with her. I ignore eveyrone even though I’m lonely. I get into relationships with toxic people but I can’t stay away from them even when they’re controlling and spew abuse at me. 

My appearance is making me suicidal which I’ve never felt before. I despise how I look and it is one of the main reasons that I would end up committing suicide over. 

I think I just need someone to tell me whether or not thsi is normal. Do I need help?"
1814,Looking for resources for GF (24F),"Ottawa (Canada)

Hi, I'm 26M, my gf (24F). It's been really rough between us but we finally talked a little and she asked for help finding resources to help with her depression and anxiety. I'm not too sure where to start looking, I think she just needs someone to talk to. Maybe online therapy could help I don't know.

If anyone has suggestions on where to look I'd appreciate it."
1815,"""I am not thinking anything, but I am thinking everything at the same time""","Sorry for the bad grammar and all. English is not my first language and I am not really good at explaining things. Thank you.

Let's get to the point:

&amp;#x200B;

My mind works too fast.

I can't think about anything 100 per cent because at the same time I'm thinking about A LOT of things and trying to proccess a lot of thoughts. My mind goes from a thought to another making random and often irrational connections between trails of thought; and it can't even proccess all the information it's creating in time. While I'm still processing one thought another comes, and then another, and then another, and then my head hurts and I don't know what I'm thinking; but then again I'm thinking about various things simultaneously and too fast for me to understand wat is going in that brain of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes focusing on schoolwork really difficult and it's really annoying because my brain works faster than my mouth and I have trouble speaking and socializing.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine I'm doing a work about cells for high school. I'm trying to focus on cells, but at the same time I'm thinking about my favourite song, how the conclusion of the work is going to be, what I'm gonna do tomorrow, the solution to a math problem I heard yesterday, why bthe educative system sucks, how I'm gonna prepare for my next concert, what did x author meant when he wrote x book, how pretty the colour blue is, and many, many more until it all bcomes a black ball of wool (made out of thoughts) that I can't understand or unscramble."
1816,It is OK for men to open up about their health.," Someone recommended Elephant Journal to me a couple of weeks ago, it is a site full of people writing about important things.

So I took a leap of faith today and published my first peace of writing. It follows up nicely to the YouTube video I posted a couple of weeks ago about men's health. It is a peace of writing I put together about six years ago.

Please take a look, if you like or connect to what I write please comment on the Elephant Journal page, share it and like the article. Thank you for helping me reach wider audiences.

1817,Mental Breakdown,"I just have not been okay lately. I’ve been less okay that usual. I am a 22 year old master’s student. My research is on pause until the USDA reopens, so I am already behind, even though I have just started. My classes are too much. A big part of my research is organic chem, and I’m way over my head. I feel like I have already failed as a student and scientist.

I’ve been reverting back to behavior I exhibited when I was 18. Uncontrollable crying, falling asleep on my couch, not having the energy to take care of myself, letting my apartment get messy to the point where cleaning would take hours, feeling anxious. One gross thing I do when really anxious (that I don’t even realize) is pick at my skin. My legs have marks from scratching/picking at them. I called my boyfriend 10+ times this morning like a crazy person while having a breakdown. When he answered, I didn’t even know what to say. 

I feel like my mental health is affecting everything. I’m unstable. I don’t take care of myself. I don’t eat or I eat too much. I look horrible, which is a big trigger for me. I’ll look in the mirror and see acne/knotted hair and that’ll just make me feel 100x worse. I also have a huge exam I need to study for.

I am sorry if it seems I am just complaining. I have really lost all sense of myself. I am taking Prozac (20 mg a day), but I don’t know if it’s doing anything.

I don’t know where to start."
1818,"Why am i feeling like this, i don't even know him","Someone on social media (that i barley listened to) recently died because of an infection or aids allegedly. since then i have been thinking about my own death, searching up about what happens to ur body when you die, reading all of his old posts on social media etc and for some reason i can't stop this, im just kinda shocked as i remembered him being so enegetic on his Instagram live and now he is dead and no longer exist. Idk maybe its because of the way some people reacted to his death was very cruel imo"
1819,Need Advice! My GF is obsessed with scheduling and completing tasks to the point of daily breakdowns and wanting to hurt herself when she can't complete everything on her schedule. Not sure what to do!,"Hey guys, 

So my girlfriend is a super sweet and talented girl with a heart of gold, but she's been having some very serious struggles with depression, obsessive thinking, and possibly ego/being a bit spoiled as a child.  

She has very large dreams, and I think she's totally capable of achieving them. She's broken them down into multi year, yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals in order to keep herself on track. Every week she makes a very detailed schedule for herself, and has every task planned out. Many of these things are creative things, as she is in the arts, so they aren't necessarily ""completable"", they are just things that you work on throughout your career. 

She's also found herself in the position of needing to support her father who is sick and can't work (Non pandemic related) , as well as her brother. She's able to do it with her job, but just barely, and I've been doing my best to help her out as much as i can. She's not in a terrible spot, aside from needing a little more income to support her family. Her job is kinda flexible. 

Over the last few months, she's been putting such intense and obsessive pressure on herself to use every single second of every day, sleeping later and trying to be up at 5:30am so she can do her other tasks (which her body is telling her it's not okay with). Listening to all kinds of books on how to use your time better, how to organize your life, etc. Her drive is admirable, but it's gotten to the point where if ANYTHING interrupts her day, including her family wanting to talk or her brother needing something, or oversleeping a little, it sends her into a big breakdown, where she can't stop crying or get out of bed. She obsessively goes through her calendar over and over again, and frantically readjusts things constantly - if something doesn't fit anymore, then the day is ruined. If even a single daily goal is interrupted, to her it then disrupts her weekly, monthly, and yearly goals, and exponentially adds years to when she will have achieved them, if at all. A lot of times she blames other people, her parents, her boss, or me and says i'm trying to stop her, or i'm not ambitious enough (even though I am quite ambitious, i just have a less intense approach to it) 

She simultaneously thinks she deserves bad things, and she has multiple times been feeling a need to punch herself for not completing her day or not getting up on time, wishing she didn't have a family and that they'd stop bothering her so she could just focus on the things she wants to achieve, wishing she could just be dead so she wouldn't have any pressure, etc. To my knowledge she hasn't explored the last part with intent, but once she gets into that rabbit hole it takes up the whole day basically.

These breakdowns are happening almost daily, and are creating a nasty downward spiral.  I've been strongly pushing her into doing some online therapy like Talk Space so she could have some professional help, and offered to pay for that, but she can't see how she could possibly fit that on her schedule, although she sees how it would be useful. I think she is about to sign up though, finally. She doesn't really talk to her friends, and doesn't read the news, so she's pretty isolated, and doesn't grasp how the pandemic has deeply affected the world. Everything is an excuse for why she isn't achieving her goals, and just a waste of precious time.

 She is generally okay when we see each other over the weekends, but then immediately the next day something tiny will be a trigger, and the whole cycle starts again. She can't see a middle ground between taking care of her mental health, and achieving her goals. It's either full steam ahead and use every second, or give it all up and lower her life expectations and kill her dreams. She's not able to see the big picture of how focusing on building herself now will enable her to achieve her goals down the line. 

I'm not sure how to be helpful or what to do. I think the online therapy would be a great start, but I can't figure out how to ride the line between being encouraging and motivational, and pulling her back from the edge so she doesn't have a really serious breakdown."
1820,what does this mean?,"sometimes i will start to hate absolutely everything about my closest friends. i will hate what they look like, hate their life, wish they were different, and that i was the only person they liked. this is obviously not a good thing, and i have no idea explanation for it except that i just get really jealous and start to hate people for no reason. i hate when this happens because i know i love them but i can’t feel it, and then i start to act mean and try to push them away or become possessive over them.

i swear i’m not normally like that but sometimes i just start feeling and acting like that."

1824,Seeking others with family members who have Histrionic Personality Disorder,"I feel like my family is all alone. 
My sister displays 7 of the 8 symptoms of HPD. She does not display any of the other unique symptoms associated with other Cluster B personality disorders. She has not been assessed, so many mental health professionals do not take me seriously when I express my concern for my sister's behavior. However, every time I describe her behavior or demonstrate her behaviors to a mental health professional, they say, ""Yep. That's what it sounds/looks like.""

Due to recent trauma and the circumstances involving Covid-19, her behavior has exacerbated. My family and I want to get her help before she finds herself in an unsafe/unstable situation. However, every time we have tried to express how her behavior makes us feel or how her behavior is negatively affecting her life, her behavior becomes worse and she accuses us of being abusive to her and we don't hear from her for days. We just walk on eggshells when she's around because we don't know what else to do. 

I believe I read in a medical journal that less than 1% of the population has HPD. I believe that most people who have it are diagnosed with Borderline PD because we have ways of dealing with that condition and it ""comes close"" to HPD. But, my sister doesn't have that. I am a graduate student in a behavioral health program and have spent months researching this. If she doesn't have HPD, I have no clue what else it could be. 

Anyway, I'm trying to find other people in this world who understand what my family is going through with her. Is there anyone else out there with siblings/family members with HPD? I want to learn how we can help her and how we can protect our own mental health when being around her. 

Please, is there anyone else out there who understands what my family is going through?"
1825,Self Harm TW: Intrusive thoughts help?,"I just want to start by saying I never have and most likely (hopefully) will never harm my self in any way, especially not with blades. 

A few years ago, I was in a very bad place and involved with some really bad, really unhealthy people.  Some of those people self harmed and since I was their friend, they would be very open about it in a way that wasn't ok. There were very few boundaries and I saw things I wish to this day I had never seen. That part of my life is over but for years now I've been brought down by these horrible thoughts of blades and knives... well, cutting me. My imagination just goes wild. Even as I type this, I'm thinking of it, I feel a tingling in my wrists. 

When it began, I could usually just tuck my arms under my elbows and slowly the feeling would go away. Now, it's started up again after months of nothing and I have no idea what to do. I don't remember now, but I certainly don't think the horribly intrusive thoughts were as bad as they are currently. It'll keep me up. Any moment I'm not doing something that takes my full attention it invades my thoughts. I have to sort of fight with my imagination to pretend the blades are stabbing me in non triggering ways (to explain: If I think  now about getting a blade in my heart or in my toe, I feel nothing, it's not weird, it's just my imagination, but anything on my forearms and sometimes on my thighs feels horrible and makes me feel so unwell emotionally). 

I don't know what to do. With this pandemic, professional help is kind of out of the question. The thing that's really messing with me is I've never in my life heard of someone who's never self-harmed be so deeply affected by the idea of it like it this. I didn't even know it was possible. 1. If this is the wrong r/ for this I would much appreciate a rec 2. what the hell can I do to at least make it happen less? thanks, lots of love &lt;3  ps. I can go into more detail if that's necessary. I don't need a diagnosis or whatever just tips, or similar experiences."
1826,How do I get myself checked?,"Hmm so, I have been going thru a lot lately and people seem to dont care about it. I tried venting to a few friend and everyone seems to say thing which i didn't really want to hear. And I feel like it is genuinely affecting me mentally this time around. I have no experience and knowledge about mental health but with reading more and more about teens going thru stuff and being clinically diagnosed with mental illness/disorders, im quite woried if Im suffering from any mental illness. Im 18M btw.

I want to get myself checked-up? but like I don't want my parents to get involved in it. They have a lot to handle already, dont wanna disturb them with my shit.

SO basically I feel like I need to get myself checked by a professional without my parents knowing about this."
1827,i don’t know what to do anymore.,"i don’t know what to do anymore.
my mom always made me take care of my younger siblings i was their second mom literally and with covid shit is more tiring and exhausting i’m in nursing school and teaching my younger sibling who’s in the first grade since and i’m stuck at home rising kids and studying for my degree too while my mom just goes out partying with her friends ALL the damn time.
i’m suicidal now which is something i haven’t thought about in years, my trauma from other stuff is coming back to hunt me. 

its so hard to just breathe sometimes. i know no one is going to read this but i felt like i want vent."
1828,What an I doing wrong?,"I am working out everyday, I go to bed regularly, I eat right, I only take the drugs my doctor tells me too but I still feel like crap. I'm still experiencing crazy lows or just not feeling anything at all, I can't sleep once I'm in bed, I'm a mess every day. Why? Every tip people have given me about keeping your mental health high I follow but it's not working. Is it lonesomeness? I am with my family almost all day except when I go to the gym and a couple times a week I go to work and hang out with other people. I don't know why. Please tell me what I'm missing. I need to know. I don't want a magic cure or whatever I just want things to get slightly better and to feel like I'm healing in some way."

1830,How to deal with anxiety while waiting for assessment results?,"I recently had an assessment with my psychologist and I'm waiting until my next appointment to go over the results with her. Next appointment is on the 13th. I can't afford to see her more than once a week so I have to wait. Really struggling with anxiety about how I'm going to be diagnosed since the assessment was for trauma and dissociation related stuff, not knowing is killing me. Any advice for dealing with temporary uncertainty and distress? 

Note: breathing exercises work for lots of people but I find that they make things worse for me so suggestions other than that are appreciated &lt;3"
1831,Weird but it helped,"So I’m a very nervous person I have very bad anxiety and I struggled with thoughts in the past I’m feeling a little better though still no where near where I’d like to be I’ve found that talking to myself helps sometimes like just a couple minutes ago I was overthinking one simple text and I laid down feeling like shit as if I was gonna breakdown then I just started talking to myself out loud because in my head in feels like my thoughts drown me out but when I talk out loud it helped because I was actually hearing my thoughts on everything and I realized how little this mattered in comparison to how good its been going before so if your feeling thoughts like this try talking out loud to yourself maybe it will help 

TLDR 
Talk to your self out loud it’s weird but it helped me"
1832,Please read!!! I need advice,"About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal?


 I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education.



 I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive?    My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless. What the fuck am I supposed to do with myself? What the fuck is wrong with me?"
1833,Does anyone else get short random bursts of euphoria and happiness?,"It will hit once in a while at any moment of the day. I could be doing homework, playing video games, or hanging out with people and I suddenly just feel ""happy"" and get excited for the future. A feeling like ""everything's going to be okay"". This lasts for less than maybe 40 seconds and then it goes away. 

It seems that no one knows what I'm talking about when I ask my friends. Looking online, people are saying it's due to anxiety but I don't find myself an anxious person, is this euphoria feeling out of the ordinary? Does anyone else get this?"
1834,I’m not sure if this fully qualifies to be here but I was wondering if anyone could talk with me?,I’m about to leave right now but I’ve been stressing over a lot of things due to the thought of them maybe not being realistic and just over all feelings that I don’t know how to handle so please if you see this and would like to give advice or are just interested please message me
1835,Am I overthinking?,"Lately, I've(F16) had suspicions that my boyfriend(M18) doesn't like me being around him anymore. It started with me losing all of my friends during quarantine (lost alot because i continued his relationship ship which is no way his fault but still. And he's the only person I really get to interact with. He started a band with a group of friends and things were fine. I was invited to practices and it was cool being able to hang with people. But the last time I was invited, my boyfriend started making jokes that made me uncomfortable.

 I'm a very jealous person I will admit. But I have told him that I am working on it and will not blame him or be angry at him for anything out of his control. But while we were there, he made a comment about not being able to find a sexy enough Mexican milf in any pornos he watches and it just made me kind of sad because I'm the complete opposite of that. I'm pale, very petite. Anyways, the joke was made but of course I'm not going to get angry in front of everyone so i kind of just went silent and waited to go home. But he noticed and we talked about it and he said that i took the joke the wrong way. So i just dropped it. 

But then i stopped getting invited to these outings. It  didnt bother me too badly, it just made me sad being stuck in my toxic ass house for weeks at a time while I know my boyfriend was having fun and making music. And I've always loved his music so much and I love hearing him play and now I dont feel involved at all. 

But today, he told me he plans on practicing tomorrow, since they have a show on halloween, and I was cool with it. But his phone rang earlier and it was from the band group chat and someone asked if they could bring their friend and his sister and someone else in the group said ""the more the merrier"" so of course i was like ""hell yeah :))))"".

 So when he came back into the room I was like, 
""Hey could I come with you to practice tomorrow?"" And he started making up excuses like ""well you probably won't have much fun"" ""hang with your sister tomorrow"" (shes in town this week) so I decided to test my theory. Does he not want to be around me? So I asked him ""it's okay if I cant, I understand y'all have a show soon and you guys dont want any distractions."" Then he acted sad and was like ""yeah sorry it's just gonna be us tomorrow :("" 

I just seriously need to know if I'm in the wrong for being upset. I dont care about him being around girls or anything, I just dont understand why one band member can invite his friend and sister but another band member cant invite his girlfriend?"
1836,Does anyone else ever get 'stuck'?,"Sometimes, like when I'm sitting in my car (which is most common), one time while I was at my desk at work (the work day finished and I was still there an hour later, not working, just there) - I get like, stuck? Its not that I physically can't move, I can often roll cigarettes or look through my phone, but it's like I can't will myself to get up, or do something to get out of it. Sometimes I have to call a friend to help me become unstuck. 

Does anyone else experience this?"
1837,COVID-19 Mental Health Funding/World Mental Health Day 2020,"As some of you may know, on October the 10th, it is the **World Mental Health Day**. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical Mental Health services within 93% of the World’s countries, even though the demand for Mental Health is increasing, according to surveys. The survey from the WHO indicates that there is need for an *urgent* increase in Mental Health funding. The survey was created ahead of the World Mental Health Day, which will bring celebrities, world leaders and advocates all together to increase Mental Health investments in the wake of the pandemic. 

The WHO, or World Health Organisation have already highlighted the underfunding of Mental Health. For example, prior to the pandemic, the countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budgets on Mental Health. Due to the pandemic, the demand for Mental Health services has increased. For example, the main fears that are triggering people who are suffering from Mental Health are:

- Isolating 
- A big loss of income
- Bereavement
- Fear

Also, due to the pandemic, people are currently facing increased levels of anxiety, insomnia and the using of drugs and alcohol. COVID-19 can lead to different mental complications and neurological such as stroke, agitation and delirium. A survey had been conducted from June to August 2020 amount 130 different countries across the WHO’s six regions. The survey evaluated how mental, neurological and substance use (alcohol and drugs) has changed due to the pandemic, the types of services that have been disrupted and how different countries are currently adapting to overcome these challenges. The statistics had shown:

- 67% saw disruptions regarding counselling and psychotherapy; 65% to critical harm reduction services and 45% to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence. 
- 30% had reported that there were disruptions when trying to access medications for mental, substance use and neurological disorders. 
- Over 60% had reported that there was disruptions to Mental Health services for vulnerable people, children and adolescents (72%), older adults at (70%) and women that required postnatal services or antenatal (61%). 

89% of the countries worldwide have reported in the survey that the Mental Health and Psychosocial support is one of their top priorities and a part of their COVID-19 response plan. But, that being said, only 19% of those countries have the full additional funding to cover these support. **What does this mean**? It shows that more money needs to be invested into Mental Health. As the pandemic continues and looks like it won’t be going anywhere in a while, the demand for National and International Mental Health Programs is greater and grows by each day. Spending only 2% of the National’s health budget on Mental Health is simply not good enough. It’s been know that, pre COVID-19, nearly $1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from anxiety and depression alone. 

**World Mental Health Day 2020**

This Saturday, October the 10th 2020, the **World Health Organisation** is inviting the whole world to take part within *The Big Event For Mental Health*, which is an online event that will call for bigger and increased investments within Mental Health at every level.

1838,Appt with psychiatrist tommorrow...,"I saw one once before, but it was 21 years ago.  All I remember is that he was 45 minutes late for our appointment,  and he kept writing down things I couldn't see, which drove me nuts.

Anyone know what I can expect at my first appointment?"
1839,Depression is flaring up again,"I started feeling better a few months ago since I'm taking antidepressants and started a new creative job. But now I've been feeling low again a lot. I feel ugly mostly and that I'm not special or worth being loved. I just want to hide away, I know I should be doing modelling for extra money because I struggle financially but I just look at other models and think ""nah they got it, I have nothing to offer so why bother trying"". I feel so below average, so invisible and insignificant. I don't know where this is coming from. I have a nice job, a good partner, taking medicine and got everything I need. I'm just missing something from inside. Something to make me special. I'm realising every day how I'm just a below average person with no real purpose and it hurts. I don't know how to fix this"
1840,"Has anyone else experienced involuntary ""mental blocking""?","I am unsure as to what sub to post this on so I decided this one would be my best bet for now. 

Today has been bad. This whole year has been horrible. I woke up and realized I missed a zoom meeting for a class and then found out I missed the deadline on THREE quizzes and one important project. I began to have a panic attack, Hyperventilating, shaking the whole 9 yards but as soon as it started it stopped and I kind of just sat there and stared out my window. It was like the thoughts that were bothering me were inaccessible, I knew why I was upset logically but I could just not seem to access those thoughts at the moment. That's really the best way I can describe it. I was in almost like a catatonic state and couldn't really think or feel much of anything. It was like my body and mind were just too overwhelmed to deal with any more stress. And that's saying a lot as I have dealt with my fair share of extreme stress. I am diagnosed with OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. They all mix well to make a potent concoction of almost  constant  stress but this has never happened to me before where I couldn't seem to really think much of anything. Has anyone else experienced this?"
1841,Obsessive and Intrusive thoughts making me feel trapped,"Recently I've been having this problem where I'm on reddit or pornhub and my brain says ""I'm going to tie this image to this character/game or thing in your room."" I think this is rooted in me being too hard on myself, not knowing when to give myself a break from work so when I'm trying to masturbate my brain wants to punish me for it. This then bleeds into when I'm watching a show or playing a game. 

I've had problems with intrusive thoughts before but this episode is hitting me really bad. It started when I saw a thumbnail on pornhub for a kink I don't care for but my brain tied it to this character I really like from this game I've been playing for a while and now when I look at the poster I got of them or the figurine in my room it just becomes present on my mind. Or when I play the game itself. 

I've tried meditating and thought blocking, both of those remove the thought but every time the thought is removed it's like my thoughts have become a pendulum and it returns back to thinking of that image. I think I've made progress because I'll go longer without thinking of it but then my OCD hits and it just really hurts feeling like I'm weird or that I just can't enjoy this game like a normal person.

I woke up this morning depressed af and thinking about cutting myself again. It’s bad i know. I haven’t done it in about 1.5 years and the scars have really decreased. 

Now i am crying again and my anxiety is just taking over. I am hiding it as best as i can but i’m struggling. 

I have tried to tell friends but only 1 listened, which is alot better than nothing but she is slowly drifting away. 

I have no love for myself at this moment in time. I had an anxiety attack yesterday again for worrying about everything. 

School is to hard. I just feel like that one kid who gets left out from the fun stuff. I have been told i am good at making friends by my mother but now i’m beginning to think she was just saying that, not meaning it. 

Fuck, i’m trying really hard to not drag myself down more or other people down with me. I don’t know what to do and i want to try and avoid therapy for a few reasons."
1844,Might be suicide the right way?,"Hey people reading this,

before i start, I want to say that my english is not that good, i live in germany.

So I've been thinking about killing myself for a few years now and it feels a bit strange to me, telling you guys my story of my life but I really need help or advice.

It all started when I was a 12 year old boy (I'm 18 now) there was this one guy who were friends with my family.

He knew alot about Computers and was also playing games (like I did). He always helped me out when I had problems with something. My parents really trusted him and so did I. 

My parents allowed me to stay at his home for a night or two. I really enjoyed it because he allowed me to stay up longer than my parents did, I always had to go to bed early at home.

When I was at his home we were always playing games until 4am or so, basically I always went to bed really really late. When I think about this now, it might've been his plan to make me tired, but I am not sure about that. The more often I've went to his home the more strange it become.

He said shit like: ""If you need cigarettes for you or your friends, just tell me"" same goes for alcohol.

I just denied it, I was 12 and he just seemed like a cool dude to me.

He often put his hands between my legs I didnt liked that so I told him to stop doing that.

He then laughed and said: ""It's alright, I wont do it again. I just wanted to make you feel good."" 

I told my parents about what happend and they didnt take me serious. So i also started not taking it serious and kept on visiting him until something happend, that changed my whole life.

I woke up because of a strange feeling in my genital area, my boxershorts were completely soaked so I looked down to see what is happening and saw him sucking on my penis. It did really hurt but I was so scared that I just pretended that I was sleeping until his phone rang he got up to get his phone and he saw that I was awake and asked if I liked it and if he should keep doing it. I said: ""yes, but I really have to go to school now I am already 2 hours late."" He then asked me if he should pick me up from school later. I denied, packed my stuff and ran out. When I was outside I started crying and ran to my home to tell my mother about what happend. (side info: he turned off my phone because I had school that day and I was wondering why my alarm didnt go off) 

I told her exactly what happend and she saw me crying but still had the audacity to ask me if I was really sure about that. She told me that I should go to school now and that we'll discuss everything after I got out of school.

So thats what I did, I went to school with a completely soaked boxershorts and tears in my eyes.

Nobody noticed how I was feeling and that really disgusts me.

My mother picked me up from school that day and told me i should talk with my dad about what happend. So that's what I did. He just couldnt believe what happend and took me directly to the police where I had to make a statement about what happend exactly. After I finished they asked me for my boxershorts for any evidence (they found saliva from him on my boxershorts) they got a search warrant and found a lot of child porn on his computer. He had raped a few kids and only 1 kid had the courage to make a statement against him. All he got was 3 FUCKING YEARS and I was done with my life. He is probably out there doing the same shit again destroying innocent souls..

I was in a clinic for 3 months after this happend but I denied any help so I started doing drugs when I was 14. First it was ""only"" cigarettes then weed then amphetamins/mdma and later heroin. 

Right now I am only addicted to weed and cigarettes which im proud of because it was a really hard time trying to get over to all those addictions I had.

Now I am a 18 year old boy sitting home without work and without a graduation playing computer games and taking drugs all day long.

I am diagnosed with PTSD, antisocial personality disorder

I basically can't get anywhere where a lot of people are and if I try I go crazy.

I feel like a worthless piece of crap who has nothing done in his life I just feel like this world isnt made for me.

1845,I am toxic,"I have been diagnosed by two different therapists that I am borderline. I couldn’t complete therapy and I tried to ignore that I am borderline but it got worse...

* I keep jumping from one date to another
* I keep talking about my exs
* I keep warning people not to hurt me (guess what, It s a self fulfilling prophecy)
* Instantly demonize and idealize people
* I am very impuslive
* I refuse advice, it triggers me that someone lectures me
* Right and wrong are so blurry and I abhor self-righteousness because I don’t believe in universal right(sometimes it feels normal and sometimes not)
* I freak out and over react when someone leaves me
* I describe in detail how I am afraid of abandonment (which can be overwhelming)


I don’t even know what’s normal and what’s not anymore but I know for sure there’s something unhealthy for me and for people who get close to me.

Is there a guide book to being normal? Or at least not to scare off people and get shut out?"
1846,Am I being bullied?,What is it called when somebody calls you something “gaslighter” in this instance and makes you feel like you are an abusive person? I’m none of these things but I think calling me it gives this person the upper hand.

1848,Relapse?,"I recently got admitted to a hospital because I wanted to kms, they take everything from you. Since covid they had a no visitor policy but a 2 hour cell phone window everyday.  I didn't get ahold of my phone until day 3 of 5, when I turned on my phone I had alot of messages/pictures from my bf wondering where I'd been and telling me each day what he was up to. So that day when I got my phone I called. I knew he might be asleep due to working nights, he was asleep and he eventually ended up calling back the last 15 minutes of phone time. He seemed distant and quiet and blamed it on the fact he was tired and just woke up. Didn't seem like he cared at all.. (My roommate had texted the day I was admitted to say he might not hear from me for awhile because I hurt myself and was going to the hospital.) So, he knew that much. 

    The next day around phone time I turned on my phone to see just simple ""I'm omw home from work, I'm going to sleep "" texts. It was way different than the prevuous days but I shrugged it off to him being tired. I called him and once again he was quiet and distance, mentioned he was mad at me. I also soon realized he logged me out of all of his social media and the whole thing made me uneasy but I was glad to talk to him. In simple terms, I told him when I was being released and he didn't care much. He didn't come see me or anything,  just made plans with other people.

  It's been a half a wk since all of this and he is still emotionally unavailable. Seems to be keeping himself at a distance and shutting me out. He said something along the lines of ""The first 2-3 days I was worried so much and lost my sh*t having breakdowns..and then I just went numb."" I can't help but blame myself and feel helpless. I was hopeful when I got out to be getting the proper help I needed. As I went through abuse from the time I was a toddler- early 20s. I'd been housebound the past 4 years with agoraphobia so even getting help was a huge step for me. I've pushed myself these past few days but I'm beginning to feel helpless again with the current transition. 

If anyone has any questions or advice or wants to message me, feel free."
1849,I'm thinking of checking myself into psych ward,"Warning: this may be triggering for some!

I've been going through a really bad time lately. I've lost all hope in life and I've been thinking of suicide a lot. But my parents have been careful enough to keep potentially harmful stuff away from me. I've fought with them due to this and have even physically and verbally harmed them sometimes in the fight. I feel very ashamed of it. And due to the lockdown, I'm unable to find other ways to take my life. I thought of trying my hand at college or job but I'm really feeling hopeless at all of them. But even then, I joined a college. Yet, as soon as I joined I've been having severe heart palpitations and anxiety everyday and I'm finding it hard to concentrate on online classes and finish assignments. I get confused over every little thing. Day by day, I feel as if the whole world is a very unsafe place for me to live in and I'm unable to do anything. 

So, I'm thinking of checking myself into a psych ward. Please give me your advice and support."
1850,Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse,"Hello. 

My therapist told me yesterday she strongly believes I have Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD). I found out yesterday, while I was visiting my adoptive parents home for a small family emergency. 

I'm looking into HPD, and am seeing my memory of childhood neglect and abuse were not ""all in my head,"" and being home is really triggering. 

I'm starting to have flashbacks of vaginal pain, and discomfort. I have no clear memory of being sexually assaulted in my childhood, but it's like my gut it telling me this is true. 

Does anyone have HPD? Will you share your two cents? I'm a little overwhelmed, and feel like my entire personality is this disorder in certain moments. Also, has anyone heard of sexual abuse in childhood resulting in HPD?"
1851,"Tomorrow is my birthday, and I'm going to spend it all alone.......","Tomorrow is my 21 year old birthday and I'm going to be alone on it. I do have family and a partner, but they are all working or currently out of the city. It really makes me teary tonight, because tomorrow is a day that is supposed to be joyful and happy, but I'm going to remember it as a lonely day. I was alone on my 20 year old birthday too, and I look back at it today as a sad day.... When I was younger I used to not understand the meaning of my birthday and thought it didn't matter if I celebrated it (I still loved attending other peoples. And loved seeing them having a great time ) But now I understand today that it is really special, because you are surrounded by the people, you love the most.

1852,How to let go?," 

So days ago I was going through an argument, I was on the wrong side, I agree but I used my words well. I didn't attack personally but I might have seemed pretentious. The other person attacked me and called me names which were hurtful because I don't call anyone as such.

Now the problem is I can't let it go and those words have been going through my head every now and then, that day was essentially ruined. I found myself thinking about revenge and bad thoughts about them even days later.

This has become a recurring thing for me. When wronged, I keep the calm and try to move on, but it takes toll on my mind. I play the event on repeat all day. I daydream about how befitting reply I'd have given. I make plans about all those vile things I'd do with them. It's just in the head. I asked a similar question in relationship advice, only to understand it doesn't have to do with interpersonal relationship. It has to do with me and how I process things. 

How to react to a conflict that doesn't leave me resentful later? How do I let go? How to convince myself the words someone says are just the projection of their own mind and not mine? How to stop ruminating about things?

I don't know if this is appropriate sub for this. Apologies if not, please let me know where I can ask."
1853,A response to the people who say you have to be diagnosed to be on this subreddit:,"I’m just gonna preface what I’m about to say with the fact that I am *actually* diagnosed with GAD (anxiety, essentially) so this isn’t coming from a place of defending myself, but rather the people who I’m about to mention. I have dealt with my fair share of suspected malingerers, I say suspected, but there’s no doubt in my mind that they had conjured up labels like ‘anxiety’ and ‘depression’ as a means of getting attention from others in a disturbing way, so I see entirely where you’re coming from with that - I’ve dealt with it first-hand - but the people on this subreddit are id say... 99.99% of the time are coming here for guidance and support! Malingering rarely occurs on forums like this as it doesn’t give the same *attention* that they may crave, it’s advice, not pandering?! Someone could be feeling immense anxiety and be looking for an outlet to get help or advice from, those people (who may have not been diagnosed per say) are gonna save unnecessary explanation and say “I have anxiety” - that makes sense, surely? Someone may be feeling really down and be experiencing anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure) and come to this forum and, exactly like my previous point, state that they have “depression” as a means of avoiding unnecessary explanation. I agree with you that malingering and people using faux mental illnesses to get attention is rife in the outside world, but in forums like this - I just don’t agree with you. Please stop making unnecessary criticisms like this when people who are coming here are already struggling and questioning themselves, think through what you’re saying!"
1854,Everyone is used to me being depressed and now feels like no one cares.,My depression has been around for about 10 years. Been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Me being sick feels like I’m just really annoying now. I try to explain how I feel and I just get this reaction from everyone that shows the look on their face of “here we go again”. Everyone gets to run away from me and take a break or just not deal with it at all. While I end up alone with these thoughts and it just gets worse. How the hell do I feel loved and cared about again without saying “I want to feel love and cared about” because everytime I do that it feels like it’s something I had to ask for and I wouldn’t get it otherwise.
1855,I'm stuck and I want out.,"I genuinely think my personality type, upbringing, genetics and all of that has made me incapable of surviving in this world and this society. I'm not saying that I'm not responsible, I'm saying no matter what I do, the fact that I'm 'me' and programmed in this way it means I won't succeed. Like how some people are more confident than others, I'm less able to cope with life than others. And I know there thousands out there too, likely most of this sub, but that just makes me more angry and more annoyed at the world.

Why do we have to follow the rules and struggle through all these expectations. I can't do it, so now my only option is to what? Not live anymore? Doesn't seem fair tbh.

I have bad mental health, I can't work, my benefits have been cut and I have no partner anymore, no friends and my family mock me and don't understand at all. I am alone, I am incapable and pathetic and I am not going to make it.

1858,How do I fix a friendship that I am extremely dependent/reliant on to a healthy one?,"reposting because I got no answers before, but I really want feedback sorry if reposting isn't allowed

Won't go into too much detail, but this guy who was my best friend growing up, we used to tell each other everything, but as we got older it became more of a me talking to him and him listening and giving advice.

It stopped being a give and take for both of us and transformed into me taking and him giving. I want to help him, but every time I ask how he's doing he asks how I'm doing and says I don't need to worry about him and this makes me feel extremely guilty because I know this is wrong and I feel guilty because a part of me feels like he feels like he has to help me and doesn't want to stop because he thinks he'll destroy me if we stop being friends or stop talking about everything that's going wrong in my life.

Which is and isn't true. If we stop being friends completely, yes I will be totally crushed, but I just want to fix this back to normal. Even if it means not talking about the heavy stuff for a while.

And I've tried to do that, but once I stop talking about that he doesn't talk to me at all. Doesn't reach out, nothing. And when I try to have a casual conversation it's like nothing comes to mind of what to talk about because he doesn't keep up the conversation. I'm like how's your life bla bla bla, but there's a clear disconnect between our casual conversations now and what they used to be. We used to FaceTime for Horus talking about the most random shit making each other laugh, but now it's like dry conversations about ""so how's your life?"" ""good"" I mean there are some inside jokes shared and humor bounced off one another, but definitely not like it used to be.

And the only times we talk have these conversations is over FaceTime since he moved schools. over text it's like talking to a brick because I can't think of anything to text about because he won't talk about himself, and I don't even mean the heavy stuff, I'll ask a question and then be like ""but how are you?"" and he completely avoids the question and only answers mine about myself.

I've tried to not ask another and just say how are you, or start a conversation trying to ask how are you, but then he just goes no how are you?

and I can't think of anything else to talk to him about that doesn't relate to him helping me with my problems.

I really don't want to lose this friend, what can I do to fix this?

Like why is he so adamant on helping me and then when I try to ask about him he doesn't answer or keeps it to ""I'm fine"" and doesn't want to share about him?"
1859,Panic attacks that last for long periods of time?,Okay so this is a first for me I usually don't talk about my mental health. Especially to strangers. But I've been diagnosed with anxiety for like 10 years now? And as of recently I've been having abnormally long panic attacks. Most average panic attacks are only 20 minutes for most people but my panic attacks can last hours at a time. It feels like I'm stuck in my panic attack and I can't get out of it. Like it's a part of me. I did look up that there is a small percentage of people that can have like ... A wave of multiple panic attacks. So I guess it's not completely out of the ordinary? I had a panic attack that basically lasted my entire work shift today and this just doesn't seem normal. Please help 🥺
1860,it’s getting bad again,"tw just in case

im not eating, drinking water, exercising/moving in any way or getting out of bed. im letting my negative thoughts consume me because im too tired to be strong anymore. it takes all my energy to appear normal and have an average day. the expectations of me are too high. i tore myself apart and built myself back up just to meet them and i can’t anymore. as days pass, it just gets worse and worse. please stop telling me to do things because it just overwhelms me more. i don’t want to exist. im not allowed to hurt myself anymore but i don’t know how long i can stick to that promise. sometimes i think about ruining what’s left of me so that people finally realize something is going on but i know im going to cling on to that desperately - no one can know about me like this. i’ll be admitting defeat. i doubt professional help would actually be good for me, all the trouble of getting it would make things worse. so im guessing my end will be the stupid and unimportant daily things we are all expected to deal with. sorry i couldn’t push through it, maybe im just not the person they all knew"
1861,31 M. Struggling to get control of my life,"So here's the story. Ever since I was a kid, I've been insecure, timid, and sensitive. I was a good student but cracked under pressure.  I was always stressed and overwhelmed by the littlest things. Even so, my grades remained quite strong. Things went downhill after starting high school and after puberty. Social anxiety went through the roof and my own doubts and fears about myself exploded. I went away to college for the first time and crashed hard. I didn't have a clue on how to socialize on my own or build my own network. I was coming from a small town and relied on my brother as a social security blanket. Doctors started me on all sorts of medications over the years and diagnosed me with 3-4 disorders. The process has been slow and painful. Even the meds that helped, made things worse due to side effects like weight gain. I started tracking my hormones in my early 20s because I didn't know what else to do. Sure enough they were on the lower side, although normal. At 29, my hormones were so low that I started TRT. Treatment was amazing for about a month, but I had to stop due to blood pressure issues and elevated estrogen. I then tried adderall and ritalin which again was amazing, although only for a week before things got bad again. blood pressure and anxiety eventually spiked on both. Doctors are not sure what to do. My hunch is that my personality  predisposes me to certain conditions like anxiety and stress. I'm always in my head, over thinking. I also think hormones have played a role as well. At this point, the only treatment that makes sense to me is exercise and healthy habits like eating and daily mindfulness. Maybe that's been the trick this entire time but I was too stressed to even realize this. idk, any advice?"
1862,People are really out here trying to gatekeep mental illness and it’s toxic af. (Please read the whole post before commenting),"I posted this in offmychest and I got absolutely flamed for it. I think people weren’t quite understanding what I was saying. I am not supporting people who knowing fake mental illness for attention. I am talking about people who genuinely are struggling with some problems but are undiagnosed, wether it be that they can’t afford to go to a doctor, family or social stigma or any reason. I think that instead of shamming these people for being fakers and undiagnosed, we should help to try and give them ways where they could get help and receive a possible diagnosis, instead of saying that since they aren’t diagnosed they don’t know why there talking about or that there opinion doesn’t matter.


So I feel the need to make a disclaimer. Obviously, not everyone in the mental health community is doing this. Most aren’t but a couple bad apples ruin the bunch. 

For a while now on some subs i’ve been seeing some posts about people’s friends faking mental illness or people self diagnosing and it seems to really upset people. For a group about helping people with mental health you’d think they be more open and welcoming. They talk about how mental illness isn’t a personality trait yet seem to get really offended when people who they seem as “faking it” for attention claim to have it. 

While I understand that that a professional diagnosis holds more weight than a self diagnosis, I think that basically everyone has had to self diagnose to some extent before or they would have never found out what was wrong and gone to seek help. Even if a person is genuinely faking it, that still shows that they have some mental problems and we should encourage them to get proper help like therapy. 
If you have cancer but it is undiagnosed, you still have cancer.

While I used to be somewhat guilty of this myself, I realized how harmful it can be to people seeking help but now feel that their problems aren’t significant enough. Even if you don’t have enough problems to classify it as a mental illness, you still have mental problems and it’s worth it to get help. 

Mental health is classless but many people seem to fail to understand this. Look at robin williams and kanye. Both of them have a ton of money and success, yet both suffer from mental illness. 

Next time your friend mentions something about their mental health, don’t just dismiss it because you feel they have a better life than you. Who are you to say someone doesn’t have a mental illness, you have no idea what going on in their head. There will always be someone who has it better than you and someone who has it worse than you, money can sometimes percent mental illness but not always. Mental health isn’t a competition, just because someone doesn’t have it as bad as you doesn’t mean they aren’t suffering. Please advocate for them to get help instead of being petty and making it a competition. Thank you for coming to my rant."

1864,How to help friend with depression,"Hi,

Between late 2018 - Feb 2020 I was casually seeing a girl. We never really discussed being in a serious relationship apart from a few times where I mentioned I wasn't looking for anything serious and she agreed. We saw each other a few times per week and things were fine.

In February of this year I told her that I still wasn't looking for something serious but this time she got upset and it seems like she was looking for more. I enjoy hanging out with her and although we agreed to be friends we still had a sexual relationship for a few months after that. I regret doing that now but thought we were on the same page about it being casual so didn't worry too much.

In July I met another girl who i went on two dates with and at which point my friend found out from a mutual friend in a random coincidence. She was very upset about it and felt like I had lied to her. I wish I had told her before going on the date, but thought since we weren't in a committed relationship it would be ok.

Since that time I have come to know that she has been suffering from depression since a child. Her father left their family at a young age and her mother doesn't seem to give her much attention. I have managed to get in touch with her sister who explained this to me and has mentioned she has tried to commit suicide several times.

I told her that I want to remain being her friend and we can still meet to watch movies etc. as before. The only issue now is that she has many bad episodes where she gets very upset/angry and often blames me for her issues. Sometimes she will make a sexual advance toward me and when I reject it she will get upset. I will occasionally receive a message from her mentioning she is thinking about suicide. I want to keep being her friend but I do not know how to deal with her blaming me for these issues. If I confront her about some of these issues she will act like I am tired of her and tell me she will hurt herself. She has cut herself for the first time a few weeks ago.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should deal with this situation? I am not sure how much of this I should accept but I would like to continue being her friend.

Thanks"
1865,I get very anxious when people enter my room and today I had a mental breakdown in front of my mother because of it,"I have had mental health issues for a while, now I live with my grandparents, why that is is irrelevant and all you have to know is that I get incredibly anxious, I have depression and when I get depressed my room gets fairly messy, I dont like it but finding the motivation to clean is almost impossible, one thing to note about my room anxiety is that Im not anxious when I invite people in, but I am when they come in unannounced and I get especially anxious when they start doing stuff inside of my room such as looking at my stuff or cleaning in any way, my mom came in today unannounced and started cleaning my room, I kept telling her to stop but she wouldn't, I eventually started having a mental breakdown and she wouldn't stop, what is wrong with me."

How could I deal with these emotions in a way that doesn't hinder my studies?"
1867,need someone’s help!!!,"
(16F) i’ve been struggling with my mental health for quite a long ass time. it’s been hard these past few days trying to hide the pain and emotions, but it’s spiraling out of control. i’m a victim of sexual abuse, mental abuse, and physical abuse. i’ve been used and betrayed by the ones i love. even though people tell me that they care about me, my trust is so fucked up that i can’t even believe it. i have strict nigerian parents who always question why i act the way i do, such as not eating or having an “attitude”. my mother who seems to be more concerned asks me what’s eating me up.

i seriously wish i could tell her because i just don’t know how she’ll take it. i remember when my school counselor told her that i had a suicidal plan and she was extremely upset about it. from that day i just continued to keep everything to myself. i even tried hiding my cuts. i have anxiety and depression (and maybe some other diagnoses i’m not sure yet). i push myself so hard in life and seriously feel like giving up. i sound like a hypocrite to my own self because i constantly tell others that suicide is not the answer and that there are people who actually care.

i use to be extremely encouraged to do things such as getting a job or getting my drivers license at 16 (which caused me to get a mental breakdown, but i got my shit (license). i got my first job at 15, but after leaving the first job the second and current job has really shown me another side to my mental health. i constantly would cry on the jobs or have mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks. my anxiety caused me not to be able to call out sometimes because i didn’t really wanna talk, so i’d just stay home. i never really felt appreciated at all the jobs i worked at no matter how hard working i was. i was supposed to go to work today but i just ended up telling my mom i “called out”. it even caused me to cry to my mom because i hate that i can’t tell her what’s wrong with me. 
 
i perform very well in school, but it wasn’t till my sophomore year where i would constantly skip school to avoid the people and work. i use to always come to class late or i would be somewhere crying because of what happened at home or some shit. i was like a target to people (including the ones who i didn’t even know existed), for no reason. when i turned 16 i was extremely blessed to get a car that my mother and i were sharing. well i ended up getting into a car accident on my mother’s birthday which was on sept. 17, 2020. but a few days before it happened i went to my see my ex who kept harassing me and he took advantage and raped me again on sept 10., 2020 before my sisters birthday (yea it was hard trying to celebrate their birthdays). 

i had not spoken to him in a long time because all he wanted from me was sex and to harass me (which i was doing a good ass job by avoiding his bitch ass), but i don’t know what told me to go over there that night. i just wanted to settle things with him and ask him why did he keep doing this to me, but he hasn’t changed. now that you got a little back story, my mom just wants me to tell her what’s wrong but i just don’t want to hurt her or seem like a disgrace (which i am already)."
1868,How do I handle a mental relapse from medication?,"I've slowly been tapering off my anti depressants. They are not something that are benefiting me and doctors agree I should come off. 


Every 3 months I've been tapering down 25mg as doctors suggest. 

But I think that's been to fast for me. As I've relapsed or had a massive mental breakdown since then. 


Will the relapse go away in time? Or should I go up 25mg in medication and then taper back down later on and do taper at a even slower pace? 

Ether way, staying on this medication is not a option it's been coursing alot of havoc on me psyically and mentally. 

I'll be seeing my doctor in two weeks time unfortunately he doesn't have a appointment until then. But just wanted some advice. 

I'm okay right now but the last two days I've completely relapsed"
1869,"Are you expected to have occasional fluctuation in Depression symptoms while on Antidepressants, or does that mean it's the wrong dose or medication?","Are you supposed to dose until functional, or until comfortably numb? Or are there no medications to make you immune to life? 

I've tried several, and microdosing Lithium Orotate was the solution with side effects I can live with. I'm taking the minimum dosage of 5mg which is known to be good for mild Depression.

I'll deflate like a balloon if I quit taking it regularly. But I still periodically get a week here and there where it feels like a backlog of Depression is weighing on me. It's generally stress catching up to me and pulling down the wall that's shored up against my personal baggage."
1870,Something doesn't feel right about the rehabilitation facility I work for.,"Hello all, I am from the USA and something feels suspicious about the drug rehabilitation facility I work for but I can’t put my finger on it. The feeling is rooted in the sense that I’m being left in the dark about almost all practices—from policies to the hierarchy of people working there. There was no time to be trained. I was simply thrown into a Tech position and started working alone after a few days. There is no policy book and no instruction, notes, or guides to be seen anywhere at all for employees to refer to. I am told there are tasks to be done, but I am not given the “how” or “why” of these tasks—I am told to simply do them with no one present to instruct me. 

There are many processes that I have never been shown to do and when I ask for instruction from my bosses, they speak in nice tones wrapped in a thin layer of frustration. My other coworkers who have been here since reopening tell me that they still have no idea what is going on and they also received no training. One coworker has taken to playing online games while I’m left alone to stabilize clients who are having nuclear meltdowns. 

That’s just red flag number one. On multiple occasions, the clients have told me that the services provided to them in the facility are nothing like they were told about or what was advertised to them. Sometimes it’s little miscommunications; one client was told that they could use their cell phone after a few days. Other times, it’s big misunderstandings about the actual structure and function of their treatment as a whole. A client was told there would be massage therapy, dual diagnosis treatment, and EMDR—they never received any of those things and they noted that their telehealth meetings with their therapists and case manager was seriously lacking in quantity and quality. 

Red flag number three: I did some digging and found that the facility has gone through name changes at least four times, and is about to go through a fifth name change. Is this constant name-changing fueled by creative whim, or is it motivated by the need to conceal something? I’ve tried looking into the previous names of the facility, but every crumb of information about them seems to have been scrubbed off the internet.

All red flags aside, I am learning a lot as I go. I love being in an environment where I can put my education to use and the nomenclature feels both exciting and familiar. I care about my clients’ wellbeing and put a great deal of my energy into building rapport with them and making them feel safe. As techs, I realize that we get to spend more time with clients than anyone else in the facility. I use my role as an opportunity to listen closely to them and do my best to amplify their voices through detailed documentation so that the Case Manager and therapists can obtain a nuanced depiction of our clientele. 

Nothing feels better than being able to watch our clients open up and heal. Gently guiding them to the realization that they are in fact intelligent, funny, unique, and worthy of healthy relationships is a priceless gift… but I worry that the facility does not have the client’s or worker’s best interests in mind. 

Going forward, I don’t know if I should tough it out and stay for the ride or if I should start searching for work somewhere else. The more I think about it, the more it seems a bit dodgy. On one side of the coin, I see this as an opportunity to prepare myself for my Master’s program and to learn how to sharpen my advocacy skills. On the other side of the coin, I cannot in good conscience be part of a system that nebulously &amp; concretely takes advantage of vulnerable populations. 

The investigative part of me wants to see this situation from a bird’s eye view, but I’m not sure where to begin or what questions I should lead with. Is this lack of training and oversight normal for the industry, or is what I’m feeling just good old imposter syndrome? Has anyone else had similar experiences? 

Thanks all. Any advice or resources on how to navigate this would be much appreciated."
1871,Is being submissive bad?,"I (20F) recently jokingly said 'hurt me' to my friend (21M) and he told me that I'd probably like it.

In fact, I'm well aware of my self-esteem issues and insecurities.  But when he called me out on them, telling me that I seek attention and he could probably ignore me for months, talk to me only when he's bored and I'd say thank you, I felt so stuojd. He then went on ranting about a lot of other hurtful (but true) stuff about me that I'd rather not talk about.It's been almost five months since then and my anxiety has never been worse. I forced myself to stop talking to him because I couldn't get his words out of my head (he's never checked up on me or asked me why). I almost relapsed on self-harm and I beat myself up over it almost daily. Is it bad that I'm a people pleaser? That I crave praise and attention? My childhood wasn't particularly traumatic even though I've been verbally and (very rarely) physically abused ever since I can remember. I've never felt comfortable in my own skin, never not struggled with standing up for myself. The fact that I don't get mad or angry is a running joke with my friends. I constantly seek validation. I don't trust anyone or even myself at this point.

I know I'm a submissive. I know it's not necessarily bad. But I really can't get over what he said."
1872,Me Myself and I,"I feel like this three parts of me there's 
my body 
my brain
and my soul

My body does whatever the hell it wants whilst my brain tell my body the result of that in a synthetic tone and then there's my soul which is floating behind the body like a third person camera in a game

And my problem is that all three needs to agree on something before I can get something done and I'm only in control of my soul

Have I gotten schizophrenia or some form of dissociative personality disorder?

I'm from Denmark and English is not my first language"
1873,I feel like I’m cutting off the people around me,"I really don’t know what sub I should post this in, but I think this one fits best. 
Lately I feel like I cut off the people around me. 

I’ve recently been in a relationship that lasted 11 months. During the relationship I kept noticing I am a rather closed off person compared to my ex (I’m generally not so good at trusting people). And when he tried to ‘help’ or ‘protect’ me from some things I appreciated it in the beginning. But after a while, when I started to lose feelings for him, I hated him doing that. Maybe it was one of the reasons I broke up with him. He kept on acting as if I needed help. And by now I keep thinking that I don’t need help from anyone (especially men) at all. And this is something I remind myself of everyday. It’s so important for me to know that. 

This leads me to cut people off in some way. My family isn’t affected by it, because I know they will always stay family. But when it comes to friends, I don’t really have that emotional bond. Like, I laugh with them and have fun. But if I lost them, I wouldn’t care so much. This might also be caused by the fact that I might take a job offer and leave this place in January, so I’m trying to not get too attached to them. But I fear that my behavior will lead to me not making strong friendships at all in the future. I also keep telling myself that I generally don’t need anyone. I tell myself that I can do anything alone, because either way, I will only achieve what I want to achieve on my own. This life is my own responsibility. 

On the one hand this could be a very positive development, turning me into a strong, independent woman. Because I will turn 18 in a week. I’m growing up and this might be the result of it. 
On the other hand this could be a very negative development, turning me into a bitter, lonely person. I really don’t know if the things I said are red flags; alarming because I’m cutting off too much. 

I’d really like to hear your opinions on this."
1874,Need help finding help.,"Hello everyone, I wanted to come on here to hopefully have someone to help me through the process of finding help. I have looked non-stop for about 2 years now, when I was under my parents health insurance. Now, I’m trying to understand if I will need to get my own insurance and if I will be able to afford it. I don’t know if my current provider will allow me to get psychological help. Most of the times that I applied, I got denied because they didn’t accept my insurance."
1875,US politics making me feel numb and hopeless,"Obviously 2020 has been a shitshow across the board, and a lot of people are suffering worse than me due with COVID. Objectively, I'm doing okay -- haven't gotten sick, have a job working at home.

But the past few days I've been going down too many rabbit holes about what is going on politically, and I'm at one of my lowest points so far this year. 

I've pretty much lost all hope for this country. There are too many powerful, evil people in charge, and it feels like things are only going to keep getting worse. 

I hope things change after the election but I'm having a hard time actually believing that. 

Eating junk while binge watching netflix is the only thing that seems to make life bearable. How sad is that?"
1876,"I was asked a question during an interview...""What is one thing you have accomplished that you're proud of"".","My answer was battling depression and working toward improving myself, my perspectives on things and my attitude toward those around me. Many people I talked to said that was a poor answer. I also got a cautious look from the interviewer. 

Why is this so wrong to bring up? Do people honestly think I am just going to melt one day on the job? A lot of people don't take the leap to help themselves, but I am. Everybody has weight they are carrying. Depression is one of my weights. 

It really irks me."
1877,Feeling something might be happening with my brain,"Hi, I am 18 and I feel strange to write about this. In the last months I’ve been feeling really strange. I feel some tingling in head and my speaking and communication abilities, thinking speed, memory and learning capabilities seem to have worsened without no apparent reason. People could claim it is psychological but I am sure my speaking and writing worsened a lot, since I spend too much time articulating sentences forgetting basic rules in languages I am fluent (and I am a perfectionist speaking), and spending too long to write some work. Like 1 hour to write what I wrote in 15 minutes 1 year ago. I am really worried that it might be something but I cannot really believe since I am too young to have some kind of brain damage. Also, my vision is worser, and I cannot think many things could be happening to my health at the same time.
Any thoughts on this? I would like to receive any advice, since I am lost about this, as I have huge dreams I have to attain, and permanent mental illnesses would be a significant drawback"
1878,I don’t want to die but I wish something would happen that would put me in a coma.,"I no longer have the desire to actively participate in my life. I am probably going to fail my college classes but I don’t even know because it’s so easy to just ignore everything. I want to run away or to take a long break. I wish someone would hit me with a car or something so that I could just stop. I want to come back to life eventually but I just don’t have it in me right now. 

The only thing holding me back from just letting go of the wheel while driving on the freeway is the chance that I could hurt someone else."
1879,Can someone please suggest me Or advice any show or movie etc which is very bright peaceful and calm fantasy somewhat like 19th and 20th century and europe fantasy stories. I want to dissociate for few days. I can't deal with my pain.,I suffering from cptsd due to my abusive father and I am stuck with him due to lockdown. My shocks won't stop. I usually watch anime to dissociate but lately anime shows have gotten delayed. I need to study as well otherwise I will suffer at my medical school. I am unable to get over my childhood despite all effort to think positive. I manage to dissociate into movies which are all bright happy peaceful and fantasy like.
1880,How to talk to a cutter?,"Physical Therapist here - 

I encountered a patient today with obvious cut marks on his right arm.  I know he's going through a tough time in his life right now as well (divorce, mental health issues, custody battles, etc.).

For those of you who do or have cut: I want to be there for him.  I want him to know that I care.  I want to help him, if it is possible for me to help him.  Flat out saying, ""I see you cut yourself, you should see a counselor""? seems less effective, repulsive, and down right cold.  What, in your experience has been the best thing someone has said to you when they noticed you self harm?"
1881,I'm looking for someone who is an expert on kink and mental health.,"I hope this is appropriate to post here. As mentioned, I'm looking for someone who is kink positive and can talk to mental health professionals about the community. Preferably in South Asia, Europe or Australia."
1882,my arms want me to hurt them,"i dont know whats going on but its been happening to me for a couple of years now. my arms just get this burning sensation, as if they’re begging to be hurt?? i am someone who resorts to cutting and i dont know if this is normal or if ?? its like bad bad i dont know its so scary i dont know what this is can someone like help 2 explain it"
1883,My adult brother got angry because a fan of mine was blowing and a plastic bag happened to be there and annoyed him.,"
Pathetic.

Of all the things to complain about. So I was taking the trash out, I hear him calling me through the house (I was approaching the front door) and I ask what.

&amp;gt; Oh turn off your fans I can hear a plastic bag rumbling!

&amp;gt; I mean...

&amp;gt; No ‘I mean’ don’t backtalk me just do it.

&amp;gt; Not sure how you can backtalk a brother so I dunno WTF you’re saying.

&amp;gt; Oh don’t cuss or kick your face in!

&amp;gt; Really? Yeah don’t threaten me that shit ain’t cool.

&amp;gt; Oh I’ve helped you so much and you’re bothering me in my ‘home office’. 

&amp;gt; Not sure how you’re helping me right now.

&amp;gt; Oh I’ve given you a place to stay.

Looks like he missed the point where I meant in the present time he obviously ain’t helping me.

Looks like he didn’t have the insight to not put a desk in the main room where everyone hangs out. And the funniest part? What’s he gonna do if people are talking? If people are playing video games? 

The situation was so ridiculous, I smirked at him and walked away. I’m saving money to move and you know how that goes. We’re both adults by the way. 

What would you do?"
1884,Dad is manic and out of control. cant get any actual help,"Minnesota, McLeod county.

&amp;#x200B;

two years ago, my 55 year old Father went on a severe manic episode.  to quickly summarize,  in the course of about 5 weeks he drove to colorado from minnesota and bought over $3k in marijuana, then transported it back.  he smoked said marijuana.  he destroyed every utility in his home trying to improve on the design.  he bought 14 antique player pianos, said he was gonna start a business.  many more things, of course, to the tune of about $45,000.  finally, he broke into his neighbors house at night and tried to ""plant"" asbestos so it would be condemned and he could buy the property.  arrested, jailed, transferred to psychiatric hospital, depakote, depression, and now we are here.

&amp;#x200B;

His mother told him that the depakote was preventing him from receiving gods love and guidance.. greeeeeat.  so he stopped taking it two weeks ago.  since then he has stopped going to work, drives around all day, marco polos his ENTIRE day including bathroom breaks, purchased a BROKEN 87"" 4k tv for something like $7k, bought 4 more antique pianos,  dissasembled his hot water heater WITHOUT disconnecting the gas, ripped the walls out of his house again, and last i believe last night he tried to forcibly gain entry into my childhood home to ""just take a look around and see what they've done with the place.""

&amp;#x200B;

so, the weird thing here is he is on probation and has a parole officer.  she will not return our calls, nor will the central office she works for.  myself and my stepmother have been trying to reach them for several weeks.  additionally, one of the stipulations of his probation is that he must follow his doctors medication recommendations.  not only has he confirmably not done that, but his DOCTOR confirmed that, said it was CLEAR that he was manic again, called the police himself, and when the police finally did find my father, they said ""he seemed fine"" and let him go.

&amp;#x200B;

so, hes been becoming increasingly agitated, and now my stepmother has gone to live with her children, for fear that she is no longer safe.  His local police remember him from last time, and any calls we make, they ignore because they don't want to deal with it.  I no longer know what to do, if we cannot reach his parole officer or her offices.  I am really afraid that  he is either going to hurt someone, or hurt himself very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

are there any other resources in minnesota that can actually ACT? I know all about the help lines and stuff but they are only able to ""Talk""."
1885,Im not ok,Im not ok
1886,I’m trapped in a terrible relationship with my mother and running out of energy. I hate who it’s turning me into and I don’t know what to do anymore. My life is falling apart and my grades are suffering.,"I’m tired of convincing them that everything is fine when it isn’t. I feel like my parents are trying to keep me too close and my brain is literally starting to malfunction.

I have panic attacks all the time that cause me to act out on my impulses from my mom’s various threats to defund my education and berating and guilt-tripping whenever I encounter a road block. She says vicious things, like I have a downward spiral and I haven’t changed and I really just hate telling her about any bad thing that has happened to me because more than once, she has crushed my optimism and will to persevere when I have talked to her.

It feels like when I talk to her, no matter how hard I try to remain intact she always finds a way to break me. She just has such a grip over my head. I often resort to substances just so that I can escape it for just a fleeting moment of freedom from what feels like my own lack of free will. 

I hate how much I want her to approve of me. I know she never will and when she does, it’s only temporary, but I just keep falling into her trap. I don’t know how to escape her influence without using chemicals. I have just been so desperate for her approval ever since I was a child and she has toyed with it just to take it away from me. Even as a kid, I accused her of building me up just to break me down.

Right now I’m struggling to get through my classes and if I flunk out, despite the humiliation and shock from everyone she has boasted about me to, it will come as somewhat of a relief because it means that she will no longer have anything to hold over my head and I’ll finally be free...

...but free to what? A dead end job from my lack of education? Free to whatever horrible way she’ll try to manipulate me through next?

I’m just so mad because it feels like living in this situation, my brain literally does not work anymore. I was thriving in the beginning when I went off to school but then I hit a wall when I realized how much control she still had over me and I fell into a depression.

I feel pathetic for letting this even impact me at all but I sit down and try to work and just so many things go wrong because my brain is moving too slowly and I feel utterly disconnected from my own choices. One second I’m trying as hard as I possibly can and follow the rules to a T, then the next I blow off everything. It’s like I have two polar opposite selves fighting over my psyche constantly and whatever results my pursuits yield will reflect whichever one happens to be dominant in the moment by chance. 

I was competent in my youth, but I feel like I’m wearing down. I just don’t know how to handle the relationship I have with my mother anymore. Even when things are good... I live in constant fear of them going wrong again like they will inevitably do because I’m just so obsessed with her approval no matter how hard I try to force myself not to acknowledge her... to hate her even.

I just don’t know how to handle this anymore. I feel like I’m becoming every awful thing she ever accused me of becoming and I feel like no matter what I do or where I go, I’ll never escape her grasp and she’ll always be manipulating me in some way.

I just don’t know how to deal with it anymore. Every time I get my hopes up, it seems like they are quickly crushed. When she raised me, she smothered me and forced me not to experience things that would have allowed me to grow, taking control of those situations instead no matter how hard I begged her not to because even then young me knew what it would do to me in the long run.

And here I am now... just about everything I ever feared I would become... a complete and utter failure. I can’t think, I can’t control my own actions, not even therapy helps anymore, I can’t even bring myself to do the things I enjoy, and forming meaningful relationships with other human beings is out of the question because in my 21 years of being alive, I don’t thing I’ve even managed to do that once.

I can’t imagine that things could become worse, but part of me knows that they can and likely will.

I just honest to god don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t."
1887,does anyone else completely forget what they said seconds before getting yelled at?,"when I get yelled at by someone I can’t argue with (aka my mom), I get anxious, my heart starts pounding, and I only remember bits of what I did and it usually excludes the things I did that got the person mad. I’m so stressed about it."
1888,My suicide attempt TW: suicide backstory,So it was half year ago. I am diabetic so i use insulin. I was at my lowest point in life and i took 4 vials of insulin. After 40 mins i felt dizzy and felt on my bed. I thought to myself i will finaly die or fall asleep forever  but noo i woke up next day like nothing happened hungry asf and my head was hurting. Half year and i am still at the same point i dont know how to do it properly. I just want to ask how how am i still here
1889,My BF said he can only be with me if I address my “issues”,"I’m a 24 year old female currently dating a 24 year old man. We’ve been together since March, but we were not official until August. A couple days ago he told me he needed a break, that he couldn’t be with me if I continued to take things out on him and not address my issues. We love each other and I want nothing more than to be ok with myself so I can be better for him. I have never seen a therapist or counselor, but I have an addict brother who I have had to save from ODing and who is physically abusive, as well as a mother who was physically and mentally abusive while I was growing up. I say mean things sometimes and I have anger inside my heart, with no idea of how to address it or deal with it. I feel like I don’t even know what my problems are. I’m open and willing to address them, and I think even beyond this relationship, I need to address these issues for myself. I currently live in NJ and I don’t have health insurance, but I will December 1st. I don’t think I can go on the way things are and wait two more months. If anyone has guidance on how to proceed it would be greatly appreciated."
1890,Living for one person.," I overthink everything. It's just something I can't help.

After  being left by my father, having an abusive and immature mom, a very  abusive grandfather, the only constant figure is my grandmother and I  don't what to do without her. She's the only one I can talk to and want  to talk to without the fear of being picked on or a fight starting.

I'm always with her and she's the same with me. We seem to be dependent on each other.

I  know that's no way to live but I don't know anything else. I've been so  suicidal lately but I don't want to because I want to see where my life  goes and I don't want to leave her trapped with abusers and no one to  turn to.

But when she dies I keep replaying the thought of going with her. I just don't know what to do without her.

Sometimes I wish I was in a different family."

I can actually handle stress, my spiraling thoughts, and my drastic mood swings. I can BE happy inside &amp; out instead of trying hard to fake it... and it feels great. 

Took a year of trial &amp; error, major highs, and lowest of lows, but Dr. Villari-Lee &amp; Ms. Jean Mirando are the absolute best.

1894,"Anyone else live in a constant state of ""brain fart""? How do you cope with it?","Like i feel like im on a different time scale and always running slower than everyone else and it's so frustrating to not be abel to keep up. Like my body always feels so heavy and my brain feeps foggy as if I havent slepped in ages even when im fully rested. Sometimes when its really bad people will talk to me I will hear what they say but not comprehend a single word, needing them to repeat themselves several times. Or sometimes I'll stare at something for a long time just trying to process the visual information and it takes a few secounds to a few minutes before clicking. Like I can see and hear just fine but I'm not always understanding it right away. 

I also have a issue with dissociating a lot and being caught off gaurd and I find myself litterally doing/thinking nothing while blankly staring sometimes for who knows how long. This dosent happen often but enough to cause a number of embarrasing situations that i cant explain. Its not that im not listening/paying attenchion, my brain just feels like its shutting down around me. Like being made of lead and im fighting to stay above water or trying to fight against anesthesia to stay awake. 

Dose anyone else get this? Has anyone found a way to stop/prevent it????"
1895,Yelled at a doctor today,"It's safe to say my behaviour the past few days has been erratic and whilst I regret yelling at this doctor and it's not usually something I would do she kind of deserved it.


Basically I'm in hospital for diabetic stuff but mental health stuff led me here.

I mentioned the suicidal thoughts and she said ""why would you want to do that"" I said well mental illness isn't particularly rational. She wanted to know why though. I told her I was bullied from age 4-17 by almost all my classmates for literally every reason possible. It made me upset talking about it and she said that everyone goes through things when their young and people move on from it. She said ""no adult is going to talk to you like that"" I told her it doesn't matter because from all those years it was drilled into my head so much that I started to believe it. She said I looked perfectly fine to her.

It just went on and on.

I was yelling at her trying to explain why I had mental illness, what mental illness was and that she clearly didn't understand. I shouted that she was basically saying I have no reason to be mentally ill and that she was upsetting me. She said ""oh sorry I didn't mean to do that"".

1900,I hate life right now,"I know that I'm overreacting, but this year has been hell for me. I'm in high school right now and no matter how hard I study my precalc, I do poorly on my quizzes. I spend almost all day doing work. I barely get any time to myself anymore. I rarely get to see my friends or go outside. My (chronic) depression has been getting so much worse. But I'm only a teenager. I shouldn't be complaining. I'm just not sure how much longer I can take this..."
1901,Struggling to behave consistently. Motivation levels wildly fluctuate. Terrible decisions. Poor sense of self. Constantly come across as overly intense/angry. Can’t seem to commit to anyone or anything.,"I keep alternating between being hyper-productive and not productive at all. I keep setting myself up for failure by being chill about things until it is literally a crisis.

Also my social identity is not consistent at all, to the point where I can’t even make friends because like two weeks later I’ll be somebody completely different and just vanish from whatever social circle I’ve integrated into without a trace. I’m often very talkative and engaging when I first meet people, and then after like 2 days I’m not.

Whatever I do, I just can’t feel like the same person all the time. I keep trying to force myself to be consistent over and over again but it never works. I just get impulsive and completely derail myself but then turn around and get dead serious about what I’m going to do only to do a polar 180 flip and blow it off two seconds later.

It’s like I just can’t commit to anyone or anything ever and it’s driving me crazy. I want to accomplish things in life, but I don’t want to set myself up for disappointment failure, ironically, given the outcome of my actions. It’s like the second I slow down, I start to see the same people over and over again and slowly they start to grate my nerves so unless I bolt, I’ll feel like an absolute sucker for dealing with their various kinds of bullshit for too long.

Anyway, my parents never let me deal with anything real growing up and I feel like an immature idiot perpetually as a result. My original plan was to join the military so that I’d stop being such a bitchy little waste of oxygen but it turns out that medically I can’t so basically I’m fucked and doomed to be a Peter Pan acting moron for the rest of my life with no hope. I honest to god hope that somebody sends me to prison or something one day because I feel like the only hope I have for my condition is going through something so tremendously painful and traumatic that the toxic childlike box that my parents forced me into fucking explodes and maybe kills me in the process - I don’t care what comes first, my death or the change I want to see in myself. It’s not worth it to be alive as who I am right now.

I swear to god I have just been a piece of shit for so fucking long and I don’t even know how to deal with it anymore. The person my parents accidentally raised me to be needs to die. Period. 

I have no valuable relationships and even my head is starting to implode on itself. I still fear death though and what really gets on my nerves is that maybe the one string even tying my to my will to live anymore is that shitty fucking entitled child inside of me whom I just want to badly to fucking die. It angers me beyond believe to think that the only thing that keeps me alive is the worst part of myself - that unrealistic part of my head that constantly makes me think I deserve things that I make no viable effort to attain.

And it’s like every time I try to honestly communicate with people, being completely honest, they tell me things like “you need to calm down”, or “you’re ignorant and dangerous”, or “you have a massive superiority complex,” and at the end of the day, taking all of that in, I just have no idea what to even call myself besides.... shitty.

The one comfort I take in my choices is that for as long as I live, I’m probably gonna do whatever it takes to keep people away from me so that no matter what I say or do, no one who doesn’t deserve it will have to face the consequences from my existence. 

I guess the best I can really do is yell about my problems online like I am doing right now because I have two choices: holding my degrading personality in and becoming so awful that my morals completely implode and I become an even worse human being, or just being myself in the least harmful way possible.

So that is basically the shitty story of my life. I have no idea what to do or why I even act the way I act or why therapy doesn’t even work on me anymore... and I’m stuck. Stuck being a shitty person in a shitty life and doing shitty things 24/7 while desperately clutching onto the hope (which I could almost call a delusion at this point) that some day I’ll figure out how to not be terrible.

Also. Just as a heads up - I am NOT in any danger. I do NOT have any suicidal or self-harming thoughts or plans. So... don’t worry about anything on that front."
1902,I need help,"I’ve been struggling with a.d.d. for years and noticed signs that I may be depressed.

For reference, I've already heard plenty of ""you need to leave her,"" but doing hard drugs probably means I should try to moderate her contact with our kids as well..."
1904,Please help - what are your best tips for irrational worries?,"I tend to fixate on something that is completely irrational or really not that big of a deal. For example, since seeing one spider, I cannot sit anywhere or walk anywhere without worrying about a spider. I would love to learn to turn those off for now, but right now i think i just need to find out how to cope."

1906,Should I indulge my paranoia?,"I'm a really paranoid person and sometimes when the paranoia strikes and from the darkest recesses of my mind emerges the certainty that everything is wrong and fake and I'm sure that smile faded from his lips unsynchronized from his eyes and all that bullshit. Would just putting on some unnerving media and letting my mind run wild run - a tempting offer for short term relief via my subconscious finally saying, ""see, I told you so"" and letting up a bit - run the risk of cementing unhealthy mental habits that are conducive to further mental decline?"
1907,What causes negative irrational repetitive thinking patterns?,"I think I've been depressed, inhibited, and and have had anxiety since I was 13. Now I am 21 and after reading a CBT book and really working hard practicing every health habit besides meds I am feeling normal again. And HOLY SHIT I feel I have awoken from a dark sleep of mental black magic. When I was applying for internships I would see depression and anxiety listed as a disability and while I knew I felt ""disabled"" compared to everyone else I was at a point where I saw it as self-inflicted (only to prevent self-pity) and not as bad as other disabilities. Now I totally agree it is a because I never understood how to stop being sad and inhibited and how to be resilient. 

I want to understand how this happens to people. HOW do these broken thinking patterns occur? I'm starting to wonder if it's because I may have a low IQ."
1908,I know I’m feeling something but can’t feel it,"My names Ethan and I’m 19 and I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression. I’ve been on multiple medication and been through multiple therapists, but there is one symptom that is hard to cope with. I get random feelings of panic and feelings of being really uncomfortable in my chest area. One thing I’ve heard is to open up to that emotion and it helps a little bit but it’s like there is a wall blocking that emotion and I can’t get rid of it no matter what I do. It’s like I’m feeling it but not connected to it and that is causing these symptoms I’m experiencing like tight chest and panic. If someone knows something I could do to help that it would mean the world to me."
