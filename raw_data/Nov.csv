0,Found and Lost,"I suppose I should start this where it all began. I emotionally cheated on my wife, and I hid it from her so she would not find out. It wasn't the first time but it was certainly the most disturbing. Afterward I really wanted to find out why I did that. After some soul searching I created a plan for myself to not cheat ever again. I felt like it had something to do with how our relationship wasn't how I wanted it to be anymore. Eventually she did find out, and we had a very big falling out which is led up to us being separated for at least a couple weeks.
 
 I've been trying really hard to make things work. I know I'm not on the top of anyone's list for being sympathized with. It's just one of those things that even though I'm probably not going to receive high praise for my actions, or even positive thoughts. I just need to say it somewhere and get some kind of feedback.
 
 I suppose I should start by saying I know that I was in the wrong. Which is why I try and very hard to make things work. I'm listening to my counselor, and we're going to couples therapy. But my wife keeps throwing these barbs at me, and I know that I deserve many of them. but after a few weeks it seems to be more like she's waiting for me to break down. I don't know if it's just me thinking things, or actually what she's thinking. I've asked her but she keeps saying that it's just a mean thing that she does but she doesn't really mean it to hurt me as badly as it does. Obviously she wants me to be in pain and to suffer for what I have done to her.
 
 I know this seems really rambling, maybe not getting to the point. But it just seems like lately, she's always finding a reason to get mad at me particularly. That she's always not seeing my hard work and efforts. When she does some of the same things I do, and she apologizes for them I accept those apologies. Cuz I know that she realizes that they are problems that she needs to look at herself. When I try to apologize for them she tells me they are insincere, and she does not believe any word that I say. It shouldn't probably hit me as hard as it does considering that I did cheat on her. It just really hard to deal with. My mental health has been declining sharply ever since. I just feel like I have to hold things together and things will get better as time ages them. We try to be open and honest with our communication, but sometimes when I say things she tells me she doesn't believe them. And again it shouldn't hurt probably as much as it does because I know that she has a reason to not believe me.
 
 but it just seems like I'm putting more effort into making this work by far than she is. And sometimes it feels like she's just looking for an excuse or trying to push me into making the choice to leave her. But I don't want to, I want to be with her forever, it's why I chose her to be my wife. And I know many of you will probably go, well why did you cheat on her?! And I honestly wish I could have an answer for you. I thought a lot of different reasons but most of them just seem like selfish cop outs. It's one of the big reasons why I'm going to therapy."
1,I feel seriously depressed for the first time in years and I don't know what to do,"Just for some background, I've had serious depression for a good portion of my life if but at least half of it. It escalated to me getting hospitalized 3 years ago because I wanted to commit suicide. After that I haven't felt seriously depressed until recently.

I did have a lot happen this year, which I think contributed to me going post my breaking point. In the last 7 months I've been kicked out of my parents house, got dumped by my fiance and had to leave that living situation, I was homeless for awhile, I can't out as trans, and my current living situation isn't great 

But I also feel really isolated. I only have a couple friends but they only like to talk or hang out once in a blue moon. My family has been mixed at best about me coming out, so I don't get to talk to them much, it doesn't help that they're out of state either. Most social interaction I get is taking to a person I met in a video game which is nice but even then he can only talk so much. It didn't help either that my truck hasn't been drivable for months.

I feel depressed all the time the last month or so. I have lost all motivation and energy. All I want to do is sleep. When I can't sleep anymore I still feel tired. I don't even have the energy to things I be used to enjoy like video games. Even basic hygiene feels like a difficult task.

I don't know what to do. I don't have many to talk to. I have a therapist but I feel like I'm getting nowhere with them."
2,This might not be the usual post (or it is idk),"I’ve had a couple people open up to me about self harm, depression and being suicidal. I don’t know how to deal with this and i feel responsible every time they talk to me about cutting themselves or considering suicide. And i know that i’d definitely hold myself accountable for one of them is they end up going through with it because i feel like i should’ve helped even though i don’t know how. I’m fucking done with feeling responsible for solving everyone’s problems. I also think it’s taking a toll on my own mental health too. Sorry if this is a bit rant like but i don’t have anyone i can talk to about it"
3,Social withdrawal and stigma,"Why is it so stigmatized to want to be a ""loner"" or ""hikkikomori"" or recluse, hermit; whatever it may be called. How do I get through life avoiding people? Avoiding the snare that are their interpersonal relationships? Why am I treated differently for just being quiet and secluding myself from the world?   
Why do people look at me like some monster when I say I don't have a ""special somebody"" or whatever? Why is this bad and worthy of mocking criticism? Why do people get so sad/angry/scared when I tell them I do not need friends? Why? Why is it so bad to just want to live alone and as far away from, with as little contact with, people as humanly possible?  


Can someone please explain this to me? I have been searching and searching and every time, I have not seen a similar post or received a response other than, ""talk to people, go to therapy."""
4,What do you do with friends/family when you're the only one that ever puts in any work/effort?," Anybody else experiencing this often? I've spent some time thinking about it and my brother has never actually phoned me in our adult lives. Almost every single one of my friends and family won't contact me - I have to contact them. I've even tried talking to them about this and mentioned how it feels like I have to do all the leg work and that hasn't garnered any results.  


 What do you do when you're experiencing this? It isn't exactly a good feeling. It makes me think that I'm some monster jackass of a human and the only reason people answer me is to put up with me until I buggar off so they can proceed to forget I exist.  


 I actually even started trying to NOT contact people to see how long they would take to contact me and the timer is still running.  


 Should I just chalk them up as poor friends/relationships and move on to better things? I'm trying my best to be understanding but nobody even wants to discuss anything so that further makes me think I'm some sort of terrible person or something.   


 Please help out a bit if you have some advice that is productive. I appreciate any assistance anyone can provide and I wish you all well."
5,Tips for health,"Hey guys,feeling depressed right now and want to improve my life.I’m in a nice school but when I get home I just go on my computer and play alone.Any routines to help me feel better"
6,I'm at a loss,"Please excuse any mistakes, I don't actually use reddit- I'm kind of desperate to find something to hold onto here.

While my life hasn't been particularly bad, I've been chipped down so much. You ever seen the video of the boulder that a man is driving stakes into that suddenly busts? I certainly feel like that boulder. I haven't had more than one good day in a row for a solid 2 months, and not one in the past two weeks. 

I suppose my breaking point was the fact I have decided I need to drop out of college for this semester. My mother is trying to ignore the issue and convince me otherwise, but I cannot repair my grades enough to pass literally any of my classes and my gpa will severely suffer. If I could just get to a doctor of sorts so I can get a medical withdrawal, everything would be fine! 

But then, what of the cost? My family can't afford it except *maybe* the aunts and cousins that have cut us out. What of my loans? They'll all go to waste and I'll be debt ridden even more. Where am I going to go when I'm kicked out of dorm housing? My mother's house is filled with fleas and I had a panic attack the last time I went, and my dad, while he treats me like his kid more than a roommate, has a horribly small trailer already filled with him, his girlfriend, and two massive dogs. 

I've been stuck with a horribly anxiety for years on top of all of this. I can't talk on the phone, I almost puked doing a job interview, and I can't go buy thing in the store without someone to pay for me. I can hardly do anything a normal person can do without huge trouble or stress sickness. On top of this, my dad holds the firm belief I am exactly like him and that I do not need to get any professional help or medicine because this is *normal*  and that all ""mental health resources"" are cashgrabs and he got over his issues and his significantly worse childhood himself. The worst part of it is I'm starting to believe it, and I only feel worse because I can't make myself be better. I can't make myself do *anything*, especially considering I have the willpower of a walnut.

I apologize this is all over the place and an utter mess, but I can hardly think through choking stress and a desperate want to sleep forever. I don't know what to do about my situation. I want to get professional help, but it's expensive and I don't even know if it'll work. If necessary to say for some advice, I live in the southern USA on the east coast.

Is there even anything to do about this?"
7,Please help me,"Hello.

Im 23.

I am currently diagnosed with panic disorder, depression, ADHD-I, bipolar/mood disorder, borderline personality disorder, and show some traits of being on the spectrum of autism. I believe I am a narccistic asshole and its ruining my relationships with others. I am one of those ""i dont want to work for change, itll just happen eventually without me doing anything"". Im lazy as shit and it doesnt even matter that Im on Ritalin, because ill still just not do anything but play a video game. Honestly, i have too many questions and im not sure what kind of advice I can get from here. I just want to be a better person but im so blind and thoughtless that i feel like itll never happen. Im truly a defeatist and give up on things that are hard, very easily. It doesnt help that I think im too stupid to function in reality. Idk, when i fight with my partner over something I started out of no where because of my ego - i feel like I dont want to live anymore because I cant even be a good partner to someone Im in love with. But at the same time I have no empathy or understanding of others and thats how ive reached the conclusion of being a total narcissist. 

I go to therapy and the psychiatrist but i feel like all of that will take too long to fix my issues to save me and my relationship. I hate life and I hate me....

Thanks for whoever reads this chaotic all over the place post."
8,"The truth is, nobody cares","I’ve finally figured it out. I’m ashamed of myself that it took this long for me to realize such a harsh truth. 

My childhood up until I left the house at 18 was a nightmare. My mom was manipulative and abusive, and my dad was always arrogant and abusive as well. Not only did my parents treat me like a mistake, the jokes my dad would make about me made my four siblings think the same of me. I have been emotionally abused my whole life by my family. I never understood why I was the target. 

I’m 20 now. Moments ago I was outside of my apartment, crying hopelessly. I was hidden, but I knew some people saw me. But that’s all it was. Just a passing glance, and that was it. I went out in hopes someone would at least say hi to me. But no one did. I didn’t understand why. 

Minutes after that, my boyfriend messaged me asking me if he wanted to watch a movie. I said sure, but also asked if I could have a bit more time alone. He was okay with it, and he asked why I was outside. I told him I was depressed, then he falsely claimed he would be there if I need him. A half hour later, I messaged him saying I was on my way. But he replied by saying a friend had come over, and we could hang out after his friend left, which could be hours. I said I’ll stay outside until then. After that, no reply. Some time ago I asked for help when I went through a terrible experience. He told me he was with friends, and that he’d talk to me later. 

Then I finally realized it. I realized why my family hurt me, why people grimaced when they looked at me, and why my boyfriend always throws me aside.

When I realized it, my tears stopped immediately.

Despite my family and boyfriend’s stupid claim to love and care about me, I now know it’s never been true. They always said they were there for me, but they never have been. 

The sad a terrible truth is that no one cares. People will be around the person that makes them feel good, and discard the ones who don’t. Asking for help from these people is an omen, and pleasing them so they stay close is a cruel game. 

Nobody truly cares. My family would’ve stopped yelling at me. My old friends would’ve stopped bullying me. The people on the road would’ve at least smiled at me. My boyfriend would truly love me. 

No one cares, and no one has ever cared. This true for every person in the world. No one cares about us. The best thing we can do is accept it and move on. Nothing will ever change it. 

Now that I’ve figured it out, I can finally withdraw. I can learn to stop caring for the people who hurt me. I can learn to never care for anyone else, because no one will ever care about me. That’s simply the truth. I accept it. I move on."
9,home life stressful and anxiety-inducing,"I have a mother that is mentally ill and at times, she can get really bad. She yells and even screams at me and my brother over small or normal things (one time she screamed at my younger brother for crying because he was scared. He was 9.). It is genuinely terrifying. Her abusive behavior used to rub off on me; I would yell at and hit my brother. Even to this day, i get mood swings similar to hers. She blames us for her actions, because we were doing things that stress her. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is especially sad because she is decently ok most of the time. She just has her down days."

11,Can someone talk to me?,I think I just need someone to talk to me. I've got something really bothering me and it's such a small thing that I'm embarrassed to talk to someone that knows me about it. You can private message me.
12,I am a terrible person,"I come here and complain about me being suicidal and depressed like just stfu, and I come here make posts that ppl have to see and Ik thst no one wanna see a 14 yo just complaining I'm so sorry I'm so fucking stupid


And I just want to say im sorry for posting here"
13,Something is wrong,"This is going to be long, but i need to get it off my chest.

I feel like something inside me is very wrong. I feel like I'm being watched all the time, i have the feeling that people can read my mind and that makes me supress many of my thoughts because i feel ashamed of them. I can't hear people laugh near to me because i think they are laughing at me, and i feel like people secretly hate me because i speak and act weird and that they are nice to me just because they feel bad for me. I sometimes feel detached from reality and i often have to check if certain events have happened even if they happened recently in order to say or do things because I'm paranoid that I've just imagined them. I feel like there's fog in my mind, I'm sure i should function differently, and i often feel like I'm experiencing my life in third person, as if i was isolated inside my head. My memories feel as if i had read them and never experienced them. My mood swings constantly, my emotions are either too strong and last too little (mostly minutes, sometimes hours) or so slight that i exagerate them to be credible even when i am alone. I'm convinced that my feelings are real until i stop feeling them and i can't even trust myself. I have no fucking clue of who I am, i always end up mimicking other people, acting and talking like them, being a different person with everybody. I feel like several people at once and sometimes feel like I'm nobody at all. I've almost tried to kill myself a few times and I've self harmed in the past, leaving life lasting scars that i can't explain. I've done risky things that i may regret in the future just because i felt like that. I feel like i act like a child, but sometimes i feel like i skipped my teenage years and never had a proper youth. I'm scared to dead of abandonment and solitude but i can't make friends or mantain relationships. It seems like i wasn't made to be with other people but that's my stronger desire. 
I sometimes feel like I'm a danger to other people, like i am too demanding and my mood swings are exhausting and may affect them. I sometimes feel too much empathy and other times i feel like i totally lack it and that i will end up hurting or manipulating people that i don't want to hurt. I think that people think of me as an innocent and good person, but i know I'm roten inside and it would be better if i simply disappeared. 

I've tried going to therapy (just because my ex boyfriend told my mother that i wasn't okay. I would have never be brave enough to ask for help), i only went to four sessions. I couldn't open, i never told my therapist about all the things i mentioned above. She only knew about my constant fear of everything and the crushing emptyness that i feel. The last time i saw her she told me that i had symptoms of depression and anxiety. I decided to open to her really for the first time, and talked to her about my suicidal thoughts. I regretted it when she started talking about homeopathy, i felt i wasn't being taken seriously. The quarantine in my country started a few days later, she told me she would contact me when things got better, but that never happened. I felt abandoned and lost again.

Therapy is expensive, and i can't be helped if i don't open, but i don't want to be a danger and i don't want to suffer.

I don't know what to do, i wish i could disappear without hurting anyone."
14,lol wtf is my brain doing,"*TW SUICIDE*

is it normal to randomly imagine the suicide of someone you love, cry and grieve for them for like an hour (like actually grieve, actual tears streaming down my face kinda grieving), imagine your own suicide where you reunite with them in the afterlife and then suddenly be like

well that was fun😃 anyway

and then carry on ur day like nothing happened? cuz thats happened like 3 times. im not bothered by it, its just a thing"
15,Undereating due to stress,"This something I’ve struggled with for a couple years, since starting college. I have some disordered eating habits due to personal image, but once assignments start cracking down I feel too physically ill that I can’t eat. My stomach is in knots and I’m nauseous often that lead me to never, ever be hungry and will sometimes (maybe every other day) have to force myself to eat something small (muffin, poptart, etc) at the very end of the night around midnight. Other than that, I drink water and that’s it. Along with this, I’m tired all of the time, I feel dizzy and will faint after standing up, and will constantly break down (mostly because im mad at myself that I can’t do something so “simple”). Last year this caused me to lose over 10-15 pounds and I don’t even know how much I weigh at this point now that I’ve been doing this for at least a couple weeks and probably not stopping any time soon, until my workload lessens. I’m scared I’m ruining my body but I physically cannot eat a normal diet without throwing it up or feeling nauseous/sick all day.  Anybody deal with this and know what can help? I’ve thought about maybe going on some anxiety meds but would that even help?"
16,"Every time Iam have fun by myself or being happy ,sad things and old memories that I don’t want to remember haunt me","Even if Iam not happy just chilling , I remember life memories I hate to remember and that ruins everything. I have an exam but I suddenly was reminded by bad times and now I didn’t study anything and I can’t even sleep just crying and feeling very nauseous and fatigue"
17,"Currently crying, which is normal; I get it","I don’t cry often, just from triggers like nostalgia death and regret. And I don’t get emotional in the moment just a while after. I’m not gonna go into detail, but I can’t be completely honest with anyone especially my family. So I have to go to fucking reddit which is sad enough. And even if anyone cares there’s like a 40 percent chance this post will get removed for some vague rule breaking. But I digress, I don’t think I’m a compassionate person. Seeing a person crying makes me feel an out of body disgust and sorrow because I feel bad that that person is alive and most likely conscious. A feeling similar to looking at mold. It’s not like the mold asked to be fucking mold, in fact it didn’t get to choose anything. It’s nasty and shitty and smelly but that’s just how it’s genetic code has made it to be. There is no room for compassion in nature, it’s a human construct, just like meaning or drama or the idea of someone’s life story. It isn’t sad it’s not a tragedy it’s just kinda gross and convoluted. Who’s to say putting hand sanitizer on isn’t equivalent to murder. Both organizims are just naturally coded to stay alive and reproduce. Any prevention of that should be treated the same regardless of species. The idea that I expect conscious self to be some magical third person eternal being that is perfectly rational makes me want to vomit. But that’s how most people view being a human. I have like one friend that I could be honest with and have little repercussions and they wouldn’t be very interested in hearing me out and I don’t expect them to, and I don’t fucking care about their shit either. I don’t expect anyone to read this and do anything out of anything other than self interest, mostly because that’s literally fucking impossible. But I’m not crying anymore and my thoughts are kinda organized a bit better so this is fine I guess"
18,An unusual question,"So I've been very curious about this for quite some time and I want to understand the meaning. For the longest time I always wanted to understand the deeper meaning behind things and the psychological reasoning behind people's actions. This is the first time I am posting here and I hope I can be able to get a grasp on what this means. I looked all over the internet and I can't find anywhere that explains this enough or goes in depth. The question I have is a serious question. What does your sexual fantasy or Kinks say about your personality or psychology? I wanted to get an understanding of why I am constantly drawn to a specific sexual fantasy. Maybe that might be foolish with me to try and find a deeper meaning to it when it could be explained away with, "" that's just something that gets you aroused and your body will react to that from here on out because your body is trying to do what's best for you."" What are your thoughts?"
19,Am I passively suicidal?,"20 m and I know a lot of people get this a lot worse.  Im not like debilitated or depressed all the time I just don't really care for being alive.  I can be happy around friends and I'm trying to be in a relationship because that would be cool since I've never been in one.  Everything else with life just doesn't really fit with me though and makes me just not really want to be alive.  People are too mean and selfish and hateful, living conditioms are shit with pollution and global warming, I'll never be able to afford a house because wages are shit and corporations take advantage of people.  I dont want to work 40+ hours a week in a job I hate just for the right to exist and never get to relax for myself or spend time with friends or develop a relationship or have a family in a world that just generally sucks anyway.

And I dont want to kill myself I just kinda wish I hadnt been born or could just not wake up one day.

Idk if this makes me passively suicidal or something else but I really don't want to misuse the term if Im not and diminish people who actually are."
20,Broke up with gf because of my confusing feelings,"A few days ago my girlfriend and I broke up after being together for a few months, but we had been in contact and were pretty much in a relationship for the past year. We were hanging out and I realized that I wasn’t feeling as I did, and I let her know because it would be unfair of me to not do so. Now I’m having different feelings, as though I may have done the wrong thing because I know I still love her, but I also know that if I go back to her there are many different things that could happen that may or may not be good for me. Also, I’ve realized that in the recent past, meaning about the last month or so, I’ve not been in the best place mentally, and I think that me not feeling like I want to be with her and the overall sad feeling I’ve been having can be maybe a side effect of a new and developing anxiety disorder? Over the past month and maybe even longer I’ve been lingering on topics in my mind, even though I’ve always had a tendency to worry and over analyze things when I’m bothered by them. I just don’t know where else to go because I’ve never had this feeling of worry and yet nothingness at the same time, and I don’t know if this is just a phase type of thing I’m going through. Also I know that overall my gf, or my ex now, does make me happy, and I hate having to know that I have hurt her and she’s lost me, because she herself has an identified and medicated anxiety disorder that she had told me I’ve helped her deal with a lot. There’s overall a mix of lots of feelings here and I don’t know what to do about all of them, I’ve been trying to find an end to it somewhere but there’s none in sight, I just want to see if anyone can give me some sense of guidance that makes sense to me, thank you."
21,I want to go cry in my room but my parents have friends over.,"I’m a senior in High School and I’m just crushed right now. 

I hate Halloween. I actually fucking hate it. I hate that I have nobody to hang out with. I hate that seemingly everyone else is hanging out with their friends. It’s just a regular night for me. I’m doing homework. No parties for me because I never been invited to them. I sit at my computer with my tics that hurt my head and my neck. And the pandemic has already crushed me. 

Even the people that my parents invited over usually bring their son but even he’s hanging out with his friends. 

I have no friends. Nobody asks me to go to a party. The last time I was supposed to go to a party was a straight up lie. 

I’m never going to have nany friends. And my instrument’s strings are broken so I can’t even do that. 

I just want to stop."
22,I need someone. Anyone to talk to just to know I’m not alone,Everything’s heavy and every second seems like a fight.
23,I am depressed.,"I have always been a calm person. Introverted if you will. I enjoy it but find it extremely annoying. I'm a people person but also not. I have distanced myself from people my age and I can sit next to someone for hours and hardly say anything at all. This is why I am in a really dark place. I don't talk to anyone, I'm not very popular so I have become sad and depressed. I am around the age that a person gets really interested in relationships but I can't form one because I'm too awkward. Plus I have no money, I'm ugly, I'm lanky and I am pretty much an outcast. 

I still have friends but our communication is limited to school only. Any tips on how I can get better at communicating and break out of my depression?"
24,Please tell me how to start being less crap,"First off, this is gonna be long do feel free to ignore. second, I don't suffer from any conditions or mental disabilities that I am aware of. Third thanks for reading this

I'm not an emotional person, infact that's one of the things I like least about myself.

When I was 5/6 I was bullied into a state of not talking for a whole day at a time, symptoms of depression etc.  

I'm not a popular person, but then nobody thinks they are, I'm sixth form age (high school for those from the US) and my life is generally brilliant. I have friends I love and live in an affluent area.

But I'm just not a good person.

I'm arrogant to the point that whenenever i see someone do something slightly sub optimal i.e they struggle with question I found easy I think ""wow that was stupid of them"" and then I do  a mental double take at what a twatish, dickheaded thing to think that was, this stems from the fact that I was ""special"" in primary school. The school I went to prioritised results first, emotions later, was in a class that was the worst a teacher of 30 years had ever seen and was bullied as mentioned before, by the only two boys in my class that got better grades than me (cant speak for the girls). Because of the priority for results the bullies were never dealt with or even mentioned to the parents. 

As well as arrogance I have the wonderfull  vice that is apathy: a year ago my dog died  my parents and brother were in tears and I just didnt give a shit, I was crying but only because of how broken a person I am not to feel sad at all. A similar thing happened when my grandma died and it simply doesnt phase me when something horrific happens.


Today, my semi video game addicted brother was on his xbox until around 11, I switched it of and said something along the lines of ""please go to sleep, not sleeping is why you are always so angry and irritable"" ( another story in itself). Granted I was probably a little more blunt that that but you get the idea.

I walk in 5 mins later because I suspect that he has switched it back on again (he has) a d take three of his four remotes, he says he needs to update a game so i say sure, give me the remote you dont need it. 

Long story short, he doesnt like that idea, I am the first one to be physically violent and I go for his neck. I am disgusted at myself as  i write this but if i did it IRL writing it is nothing.
I am four years older, I throw him to the floor, take his remotes and hdmi cable and leave. He goes into my room threatening to break stuff so I go into his room and hide his xbox under his own bed (this worked surprisingly well). I go into my room, he breaks a couple things so o throw him to the floor and push him out of the room and into his. Je starts going for me/defending himself, (pretty much the same) immediatley. and I let him, his attempts do nothing, I let him attack me so he can see that he is weaker and I revel in the sense of power. Infact I feel good just writing this.
 
At this point you get the point . I do this and I know it's only because I feel complete apathy while doing it, I enjoy seeing him pretend to resist until he tries to attack back and then cant scratch me.

I'm fucking scum.

This sort of thing happens maybe once a month, not usually anywhere near this bad and I dont know why I enjoy it, maybe it's because of the bullying that happened to me (why I  mentioned it here) , maybe it's because of the apathy that I can reap pleasure from something that should bother me, maybe it's the arrogance or  maybe the bullying caused the apathy, cant feel bad if I cant feel anything.
What I'm scared of most of all is that its just one of my traits. The bullying was never physical so maybe it's not connected. I realise the internet is the wild fucking west but if theres someone that can tell me how to be less of a piece of shit then please do.

Thanks."
25,Is it weird that I act out scenarios in my head?,"Idk if this is because of my social anxiety, but whenever I'm not doing anything, I usually find myself playing out scenarios in my head. They're always social scenarios (talking to girls, acting out how I would talk to people if I was a twitch streamer or a youtuber).

Sometimes I'll even talk out loud. I'm aware that I'm not actually talking to anyone so I know that im sane.

Is this normal? Is it weird, or potentially a symptom of something? When I actually get into these situations, I'm never as confident as I had thought I would be."
26,I'm gonna do it,"I'm a 14m and I have depression and I am suicidal.. Last year my grandma passed away and just recently I have been able to start to process her death. But then 2 months ago my parents told me and my sister that they were getting separated.. And then maybe 1 month ago my grandpa passed away too and my mental health is in shambles and I have no one to talk to and I don't have the will or energy to keep in going. And I am having trouble with coming out as gay and I have received death threats from adults bc of my sexuality. And it's a relief but at the same time a little scary how easy it is to kill myself, I can overdose or cut myself or just straight up shoot myself...

I'm sorry for the long message"
27,TW: suicidal thoughts.,"Everyone means well, but it feels like there's nothing that can really 'be done' to help. By me or anyone else. 

The kind and lovely people on the helplines I am grateful for, but they can only listen to you - Not give advice.

The people around you aren't necessarily equipped to give you good advice, and even if they were, what could they possibly offer, when everything is out of our control? Get a routine. Sleep well. Eat well. Meditate. Exercise. Drink plenty of water. Okay but  then what? When all that isn't enough to fix me or what I'm facing, what then? 

I'm back on antidepressants for the first time in 4 years. 

Had talking therapy multiple times, CBT twice, EMDR, and have been seeing a specialist for longer than the average amount of sessions, we have had double. I'm only permitted 2 more. Then I'll be out of therapy again and unable to afford to seek private help, if I can even pay the bills by then. I've been fighting this uphill battle for so damn long and put everything I have into recovering and I'm just really losing the ability to keep going. 

I feel like I'm living just for others now. I love people in my life so much that I stay. But I can't stop thinking about how deeply I feel this darkness, and that I just want it to end.

I'm grasping at straws and finding nothing, and I feel such immense guilt for even feeling this way when I have someone I love that loves me too. I hate myself for feeling this way, but I just can't climb out some days. Today has been a bad day. 

I'm really losing this fight and I don't know where to turn.

To anyone who's reading this, I am really sorry. I don't want to upset anyone, I'm just kind of screaming into the void because I don't know what else to do. I feel so trapped and alone and like I'll suffer for the rest of my life unless I call it quits, but I know I can't. For the people I love. I'm just tired of the pain. But I love you all. I hope you're all okay."
28,(why) do I have intrusive thoughts?,"Sorry if this written awfully, I'm very tired, and I already accidentally reloaded the page and deleted it all.

I am almost always paranoid that people can see me or hear my thoughts. Not physical people, but people seeing through 1st or 3rd person, as 'ghosts' in the room, or through pictures I have lying around or on a screen.

It's always people I know, or fictional characters (I get attached to fiction super easily), so I know them well enough to assume exactly how they'd judge me.

I constantly feel like I'm performing. Even if I'm alone in my room, I feel like there are always people watching and judging, leading to me basically getting stage fright in harmless and secluded situations.

I'm not diagnosed with anything and I'm not looking to be diagnosed on reddit, but it would be nice if there was an explanation; it's stressful as hell sometimes especially when I'm trying to concentrate on other things Otherwise, it would just be something I'll grow out of, as it started around 10 and I'm only 15 now. Thanks for reading and I'm super sorry if this was the wrong place to post this!"
29,This sounds insane but I’ve been seeing maggots/ things I’m not sure of,Okay here’s the thing is that I’ve been seeing maggots in my drawer but when I tell my family and they look in it they aren’t there and though I do have slightly poor eyesight it isn’t terrible and I rarely need my glasses but my family is making me feel crazy currently because I’ve been paranoid and seeing shapes and things. To top it off I have the issue where if I don’t do something I feel like my family will die such as hold my breathe for a certain amount of time or keep completely still and tho I’ve been having intrusive thoughts and have been doing things on impulse since I was little the shapes and bugs are very new. I’m not sure if I’m just jumpy from it being Halloween but it’s been this way for a month or two now but maybe I should wear my glasses more I’m not sure it’s just stressful. It’s just been stressful. I’m not sure why this happens if you have any ideas or explanations I’d love to hear them.
30,Suppressed orgasm on medication,"I’m currently on medication for mental health and having issues with orgasming. What happens is I get a build up of sensation getting stronger, then it just feels like nothing, and I don’t feel the need to keep going. The weird thing is, when I feel nothing or very little at the end of the build up, my body seems to be reacting to what ever I’m not feeling such as shaking or convulsing. I wonder if the meds are suppressing what I should be feeling. I was on Abilify, which is still leaving my system, and I’m still on Lithium.  Has anyone else experienced this? Is this even possible, and is there a solution?"
31,DAE get strange physical sensations on their head?,"Hi, I am not sure how to explain this but does anybody else get strange physical sensations in their head when looking at something vast, or fast moving, or very stimulating. I guess maybe something like a video game or an action movie scene. I get a kind of very uncomfortable physical sensation in my head and have to look away. I never had any mental health diagnoses until I had a psychotic break three years ago. I have always had this issue but thought it was normal. I am realising that a lot of the things I lived with as normal are not always experienced by others."
32,I dreamt of killing myself,"So the other day I dreamt of killing myself by knowingly overdosing on anything I could find in my kitchen. And when I started to feel the effects I could feel my body numbing itself and then I woke up.

What I remember most vividly is that I was really calm and tranquil about the whole process even until I ""died"".

So my real question is this anything to worry about or just some strange dream that has nothing to do with my real self, any help would be appreciated, cheers"
33,This sounds insane but I’ve been seeing maggots/ things I’m not sure of,"
Okay here’s the thing is that I’ve been seeing maggots in my drawer but when I tell my family and they look in it they aren’t there and though I do have slightly poor eyesight it isn’t terrible and I rarely need my glasses but my family is making me feel crazy currently because I’ve been paranoid and seeing shapes and things.

34,What's wrong with me?,"My story is pretty long so I won't go in details but basically I've had a long psychotic episode that lasted 3 months and after that I remember having a piercing pain in my chest and basically that was the last time I felt any emotions.
I don't feel emotions. Everyone around me says I can express emotions except I don't feel them. I'm thinking my situation is beyond mental and might be some brain type of brain damage.
My psychotic episode made me crazy. I had a hard time staying grounded but I was grounded to the extent that I knew I was going crazy. I immediately sought treatment and I got diagnosed with psychotic depression. Basically my depression got so bad that I lost contact with reality but briefly since I wasn't completely gone.
I also had my inner voice completely dim down til the point of complete silence. I can still think obviously, since I'm writing this down, it's just that I can't hear my thoughts at all anymore. I know some people are born this way I wasn't born like this.
I don't feel like medication does anything to help me feel again. I don't think that psychotic depression is the whole story. 
I can still cry and laugh but I don't feel anything in my chest or head. I'm wondering what went wrong? If someone has the same experience or knows of this somehow I would love for you to share it with me."
35,"Have any of you deleted your social media for the sake of your mental health? If so, how has it helped?","I’m debating deleting mine for a couple reasons:

1. I feel somewhat pathetic knowing that my only social interaction comes from online, instead of in person.

2. We live in the era of photoshop &amp; plastic surgery. Although I have common sense and see through these things, I still sit there wishing I could look like some of these people. Or, constantly looking at the imperfections of my face &amp; body in disgust. 

I’m reluctant to delete it because I’m alone 100% of the time and have no one to talk to. So it passes the time. I don’t what I’d do other than that."
36,happy halloween &lt;3,happy halloween everyone! i hope you’re able to enjoy yourself and find peace on this special blue moon. i’ll be manifesting happiness for u 🧡
37,I’m (15M) suicidal but I have no reason to be so my parents won’t get me help,"I think I used the right tag, I hope so atleast. 

But yeah, I have no reason to be suicidal but I still don’t want to live. When I tell my parents I sometimes think about hurting myself they always ignore me. And when they do actually pay attention, they always ask why, and I say idk, so I think they think I’m just doing it for attention. I don’t have any reason to be suicidal. I never have went through any trauma in my life. 

How do I make them get me help and understand what I’m going though? Because I’ve put up with this shit for a month now and it just makes it worse because it makes me believe even more I don’t matter to anyone. And if I don’t get help soon, I really think I will kill myself. And someone has told me once to call the suicide hotline, but they don’t help. Bc I don’t know why I am the way I am, and they say that they care about me. But do I believe that? Maybe, but does it matter? No because they will never see me or talk to me again. And they won’t even know I’m gone. And I’m starting to feel that same way about my parents"
38,My family won't get me some form of therapy.,"I'm 15 and I've now told my mom and my dad that I need therapy of some kind. And they don't seem very eager to get me help when I'm so far gone already. My suicide thoughts are getting worse. My mom and dad are split but it doesn't mean they can't split the bill in half. My mom got a new well paying job. My dad has a good paying job. My mom's moving right now but it's not like this was the first time I've mentioned therapy to her. I even sent her a place she could take me. It seems suicide is soon gonna be my only option. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm out of options. I know I won't be able to hold on much longer. I just hope that I can a least make it past 18. Anyone got any advice on what I should do? I really need help. Thanks for letting me vent though."
39,Just a general feeling of loneliness which is frustrating because I feel like I have NO justifiable reason for it.,"I’ll be 28 years old a week from today. I have a great job. Live in the city of my dreams. My boyfriend and I have lived together in a beautiful apartment for a year and a half. We just got a dog. I write on the side and have had some things published within the last year. I have friends...and yet...I feel like no one really wants me or cares about me and I feel like an imposter. I feel like I’m CONSTANTLY searching for validation or new people to reach out to for validation (I feel like this post counts in that search!!!) 

I’ve had a diagnosed anxiety disorder since I was 10 years old and it just always feels like this monster I’m beating back. Lately I’ve been wishing I had a “real” reason to feel so isolated - because nothing happening to me right now feels like enough to justify this intense feeling of inadequacy and isolation. 

Does this EVER go away??? Will I ever be happy with myself or my life?? It scares me to think I’ll never be enough for myself."
40,Always Alone.,"I'm sick being alone all the time. It hurts me so much. 

I barely have any friends. All the ""friends"" I have had either leave me, or have put me under so much drama that I have no choice but to leave. The ""friends"" I do have don't even bother talking to me. I'm the one always starting the conversation. Not to mention they don't take my feelings seriously to tend to devaluate them.  Which is awful because the person that does this was my best friend sense kindergarten. 

Honestly, At this point it I just think I will always be alone."
41,I am so stressed with everything.,"I am stressed with all my school work, stressed with moving into a new place, stressed with having to maintain all my friendships (not even that many), stressed with finding free time to do things I like. And when I do find that time, I have no energy or motivation so I just lay in bed and cry. 

I KNOW it’s not true but I just feel like none of my friends actually care about me. Same with my family. I just am so exhausted with everything and I want to disappear. Even my friends are upset with me for saying I need a break, which just adds more stress. I am also relapsing into my eating disorder. I literally don’t know what bad thing to focus on at this point, I have no time anymore. I just want to sleep forever."
42,Everyone says I’m depressed,"I don’t know what to think. I beat myself up a lot, and I guess I say a lot of depressing stuff. I just never really feel like I’m in the right place or connected to anyone around me. I talk to counselors and I feel like I’m not really myself, I’m just performing for them like I do everyone else. But, I don’t think I’m myself for anyone. I don’t think anyone is ever just honest in general though. If you think about it, we’re all doing some kind of performance, and the human mind is so complex. You can’t ever talk to a person and really get to know who they are. So, it makes sense I feel like I’m performing for other people, because that’s what it means to interact with another person.  People keep saying I’m depressed though, even if I try to act really happy and engaged. My family and co-workers all say these things. My few friends think that too. I seriously don’t know what to do about it. Counseling is uncomfortable at best and actively confusing at worst. I know not to do drugs beyond just being a social user. I guess I’m just stuck. So yeah, what would you recommend??"
43,I feel like I have nobody.,"So let me start by saying, I know people are there for me, I just feel alone. My father passed away I little over a month ago, and since then my life has been hell. He suddenly passed away from heart failure, and he knew he had it and didn’t tell ANYONE. nobody. I know he was trying not to hurt anyone but it just makes him look so fucking selfish. I see it as selfish, I won’t get into details. But my dad passed, a friend from school passed, and my uncle is in his death bed in a coma, I don’t even know what this feeling is, a fear of abandonment? And last night, I had a very vivid dream of my mother dying and it being completely over for me. Lately I’ve felt like I have no control over my life, some days I’ll eat to much, others too little. Before this happened, I would not touch alcohol, but lately I’ve been getting shit faced wether it be with my friends or alone, and getting high, without even thinking about it.. 2 months ago I would not touch much of either of them. (And before anyone says anything, I am 17, and yes I know doing these things are wrong, please do not lecture me.) I feel like I’m losing my grip on life, there’s this constant lingering feeling of pain and depression and I don’t even know. I have a fear of failing and a fear of things getting to hard to finish. My counselor is only available like once every two months. I am so scared of what is happening but at the same time I really don’t care. I don’t care if I die. But I’m also terrified of dying. I am constantly in a bad mood, not even a bad mood, just numb, numb to jokes, numb to things that make me angry, numb to pain, but I’m also constantly feeling pain. Physical pain because of how I feel. I don’t know what to do, I also do know what to do because I should probably go to a counselor more, find another one, something. But at the same time I have no motivation to. The other day I went on a drive and cried my eyes out and screamed, but when I went to stop somewhere and just cry, I couldn’t. I have barley cried at all. I pulled so much hair out and hit myself so many times. I don’t know what this is. Is it grief? Is it depression? Anxiety? All of it? I don’t know"
44,I’m confused,"I decided to try asking myself questions about stuff to try and understand more about my mental health.
Including abuse my family dealt with when I was a kid.

I’ve been trying to quit alcohol and now I want to drink all of a sudden,  and I’m 23F but wish I was still 13-16... almost like an age regression thing but not... I don’t like being my age and I don’t like my current year or anything.
I can’t just decide to be 13 or 16 rn I’m simply not.

I do feel like my childhood was ruined but I can’t just ask to have it back.... and I’m just upset right now.
I don’t want to be 23. I don’t think I want to be sober. I don’t think remembering traumatic experiences was a good idea.
I feel really alone. If I’ve never had a boyfriend/girlfriend and probably never will then I also get to just be alone. I was doing a lot of skincare stuff and picked a bunch at my skin and now it looks worse.
I feel stuck. It’s bad. I think I was supposed to kill myself before this point and I think I probably should have.
I grew up around domestic abuse I could have been someone else I could have gotten better help I could have had a lot of differences. I think I did everything wrong. But I can’t get drunk over it because I hate that too. I don’t have whichever non-trauma related mental health issue I have diagnosed because I’m sick of the mental health system and the mental health system is sick of me. I should jump off a building."
45,tw!! im having thoughts and i don’t know what to do,"hi, i don’t know where else to turn. i just need some advice. ive dealt with depression, along with other issues, since i was a kid. i usually feel a sense of not wanting to be here, but it’s always just been a thought i was always to scared to act on. but these last couple im not really afraid anymore. 

ive realized that no matter what i do my abusive dad will always have control over my life, my rapist will always have control over my life, i’ll never be able to fix my financial situation, i’ll never be able to maintain a relationship, my work has been extra stressful and i don’t have many other employment options, and i haven’t been able to go to school because of the pandemic. 

every time ive closed my eyes the last couple days i just have nightmares of me dying in a million different ways, or it feels like im reliving trauma. none of the meds i had been prescribed worked to begin with but they’re making things worse now. i feel like i need to get help, not for me, but for my family and roommate. i don’t want to hurt them. i have a plan for the first time ever and im truly scared im going to act on it. 

but i feel so much anxiety, i don’t have health insurance, i can’t really afford to miss work and get behind on bills, im worried that i won’t be able to make rent and it will hurt my roommate credit as well, i just don’t know what other options i have at this point. i feel so helpless. im just tired of being alive. 

i live in the US, btw."
46,What the hell do me and my dad have wrong with us?,"Basicaly my dad is abusive, emotionly and pyshically (sry for bad grammer. I am using a new keybored) he also lies, steals my moms meds for her disablity, attacks ppl and etc. He seems to be able to show fear and sadness. Just mostly anger (he has been depressed before when his family member died and also cried when our dog passed) and his eyes are just so, cold. I get a bad feeling looking into his pupils, now onto me, i lie, have an interest in knifes and death (if that is normal i think it is uncommon for my age, 13) i am also known to threaten ppl, point siscors at ppl, also i have to admit i have tried manipulating ppl a few times. (it takes a few mins or hours after these things happen for me to know what i did was wrong) i do attack ppl. I have thoughts and dreams of attacking ppl and killing ppl in detail. I like pain, i like the dark. I get angry easily and can feel all other emotions. i am pretty sure me and my dads behaivour is not normal?"

48,Is there a way to talk to a professional online possibly for free?,I just would really rather not bother my family with the issues I’m having right now and was wondering if there was anything free online honestly I trying to find something kinda anonymous
49,Here the thing,"Okay so, long story short I’ve been off my anxiety and depression medications for almost 2 months because of insurance problems. Previously I had the happiest year of my life. Now, I’m a hot mess of emotion and anxiety again but I can’t stop thinking about how....was I even happy? Like, was I actually happy or was it literally just the pills making me feel happy? Because if it’s literally just the pills do I even want them again? Like shouldn’t I strive to be really happy not synthetically happy?
Boy oh boy I am stuck in this thought loop. Help me out with some freaking reasoning here."
50,Shaking,Hi everyone just a werid question I notice lately that when I’m exercising it has made my really shaken for example walking my right leg shakes really bad and makes me feel super uncomfortable in that I can’t stop it shaking. Idk if that was nomarl or not and also I’ve been feeling worse after exercise mentally and haven’t gotten the endorphin hit everyone talks about (I’ve been doing gym and walking) thanks everyone:)
51,Just don’t know what to do.,"I just feel so lost. I was finally on what felt like a good regiment of medication to help with my depression and in a flash it all came crumbling down. The pain and weight is back on my chest. I feel like I can’t breathe, like everything is wrong and I can’t get it under control. My husband says I’ll make it through like all the other times and I just don’t know if I can keep doing it. I’m so tired of trying and fighting. I just feel so alone and like I don’t have anyone to really talk to."
52,I'm struggling to find any enjoyment in life now,"I (22f), like most people, have really been struggling with the effect that this pandemic has had on my life. I recognise that my struggle is not unique in any way, but I'm really just angry and upset with the world right now because not only has it put my life at risk (I have a congenital heart defect), it puts my family at risk, I don't get enough work now to even pay the rent so I have to ask for help which is so demoralising. It has also taken away the one thing in my life that kept me going, that saved me from taking my own life only 2 years prior, and that is festivals/live music events. I honestly feel as though I can't live without them at this point, I cannot focus on my university work (which has also been adversely affected in my final year) because without them I feel like I am unable to destress and cleanse myself mentally and physically. 

The worst part is knowing that there is no end in sight, experts keeping saying it will be years or even decades before we can do these things again. I can feel myself sinking back into my old depressive ways but I don't know how to stop it since I no longer have access to my outlet/coping mechanism and it's causing this chaotic cycle of sadness, and what is worse is that almost everyone I have talked to has just criticised me for feeling this way and called me selfish. How am I supposed to get through this, being bored, lonely and painfully unhappy knowing that this is my future for an undisclosed amount of time?"
53,Am I wrong for wanting to stay out of family problems?,"Hi all.

Some background: I (27F) had to leave my fathers house with my mom because he had an alcohol problem amongst other problems/vices about 2 years ago. To this day, I am still trying to heal from the fact that my family broke apart.

My mom recently started to date a man who has a same vice that my father did. He denied it and said that the information we found on his social media is old and that he doesn’t do that anymore. The guy gives me weird vibes and is constantly trying to “I’m a nice guy us.” Simply put: I don’t want to associate with him and I feel like I don’t and shouldn’t have to. The reason Iive with my mom is due to our culture and I also love my mom very much and want to be there for her. But...she keeps shoving this guys life in my face. I told her to please respect my boundaries as My mental health is the worst it’s ever been and I’m trying to find help, plus I’m still healing from the divorce and everything I experienced. Not only that, but that vice he has, I felt like I went through all the suffering of leaving my dads house for her to end up with someone who does the same thing.

I’m trying to heal, find help. I was in a very dark place recently and It’s not helping that she keeps trying to make me like this guy and his family when I feel like that’s her business and she should respect that I’m grieving still. Am I wrong to feel this way?"
54,I am fed up.,"All my friends are happy or normal in life, meanwhile I was happy in the first few months of 2020, then I lost my best friend, atleast had my boyfriend then, but hadn't seen him for months, then his dad passed away, became worse, I went into depression, I kept crying about he was in pain, now we broke up and then I lost a bunch of friends because they got fed up of how I am rn, started going out alone because I needed some fresh air but I cannot stand seeing people together and being happy because I lost a lot of people who I genuinely loved and cared about and they don't give a fuck about me anymore and I just wanna die. I do not know why this keeps happening to me, I really loved my boyfriend and I still love him, even he does too, but he's too stressed to even have a relationship right now and I just..I am so hurt by everything and ever tiny thing ticks me off these days and upon that I have college stress where lecturers cannot just fucking shut up about things, all I do is cry and fight with my family even though I really don't want to, I just hate myself so much right now I cannot even pick myself up anymore, I feel like a useless piece of shit and I want to die so badly but do not have the courage to kill myself and nothing bad is happening to me, I just hope I die. I really want to die, I don't care if my future is bright, I do not want this anymore, I was fucking happy why'd the universe have to take that away from me, for once can't I fucking be happy"

56,"What a great Halloween, NOT","Ughhh, 
I’m so upset rn. So basically I’ve been having an allergic reaction cymbalta and of course a serve one too. So my doctor told me yesterday to go down from 40mg to 20mg so yesterday I took at 20mg. However, Bc of the memory problems it causes, I forgot to talk my pills today. So today I was excited ofc Bc it’s Halloween and my best friend and I have had our costumes planned for a year. Anyways, today I started to get a headache from it and then brain zaps and arm zaps. Then, it got worst and I started to feel shaky. Then my voice and breathing became shaky and my arms and legs feeling weak. So I had to leave my friends house early and I started to cry Bc withdraw feels horrible and I wish it upon no one. (Btw anyone who goes through it is SO strong) aaand, my ED has been acting up again lately so after I weighed myself I realized I gained a lot and needed to work out but I feel like crap and rlly need to work out. Soooo yeah, happy Halloween to me!"
57,Severe loneliness,"Hi, I wanted to ask anyone if they deal with feeling severely lonely and how they manage it. By loneliness I mean mostly emotional. There’s been more than a few events in my life that have led me to just simply, feel very deeply and fully alone. And I don’t mean like there were a bunch of people around you and now there’s none (figuratively)
It sounds super abstract but it feels more like there was nobody there to begin with (still not a great articulation)
For example, at a very young age I understood my mom used my sister and I as tokens and leverage against my dad during the custody battle. To be clear my dad was the abusive one in the household but holy shit I was 8 and I understood what was going on. I could understand the nuance and the tone in the courtroom and being commodified does not feel good, especially when you’re trying to get away from your other parent.
This is all a little longer than I wanted it to be and I am seriously not asking for pity but I need pointers or something to not feel so incredibly and deeply disconnected from the people around me. Thanks for reading and any advice you may have"
58,I overthink everything!!,I haven’t been diagnosed with anything but I always overthink things. It could be due to bad past relationships but I have the most amazing bf but he’s in the military and has been deployed for the past 11 months and sometimes when i’m feeling down I start to second guess everything. I always get nervous he’s just going to decide it’s too hard and quit and leave me because that’s happened in past relationships. I want to know what you guys do to get over these feelings? does anyone have feelings like this as well?
59,i need to reach out but im scared,long story short the last time i reached out to someone i had to talk my way out of going to a mental hospital. im suicidal not fucking psycho. i need human contact or someone to reach out to but if i explain my thoughts of self harm and suicide to my therapist or parents they will make me go to that stupid fucking hospital and id rather die then go there. i cant get out of this godawful depression by myself so i need help but i will never step foot in a mental hospital. its not an option and dont try to convince me.
60,Catch 22,I'm stuck in this cycle. I need support from somewhere in my life. I start seeing my doctor and things will be good for a while but inevitably my mental health declines. Generally speaking the support I need in those declines can't deal with me and I spiral out of control. I'm tired of losing people to my illness. How am I supposed to learn to be healthy if I have no support to show me what that looks like.
61,Tonight I'm losing my sanity,"I'm feeling like I'm at the very verge of some kind of attack. I've never been this closer to outright insanity. 
I having a difficult time holding a grip of reality. I feel like all could crumb at any moment. I fear at any time it could deform into a complete laceration of reality in which all I perceive is agressive madness.
I'm checking behind my back and under my bed. I hear the voices of my family but I have the crazy impression those are falsifications and some kind of angried creature coming for me. My sensation is distorted. They come closer and I feel like all is suddenly going to detach and I'm going to sink right into something horrendous. One just hitted me and I thought they were going to reveal their true form as an evil creature .This notion is there an enduring it for too long would be unbearable. The only ones I trust are the dogs.
I don't know what's happening and I'm scared. I wonder if this is a psychotic onset or a panic attack. I've never had the first but have had the second, and all throught the day before it I felt a very weird way. I might explode at any time and I feel like I will end up waking someone up for help, but the last time I asked for help only the dog came to help and allowed me to sit by her bed.

Starting from yesterday I started feeling a very uncomfortable feeling and sensation, some kind of owe of the dynamics of reality and fear of being witness to an extraordinary ocurrence or abnormality can't pin point any apparent cause, but I can locate from what it arose. I was casually browsing youtube when I found a video about this app called Randonautica, it was about its weird and dark side and such. Leaving aside all seemingly creepy things I considered it to be a good way of getting me out of my house (It's essentially an app for explorimg your local surroundings). I have a set of mental health problems that make me isolate myself from the outside world, so I assumed it would be a good excuse to help myself outdoors. 
I then randomly looked through experiences with the app and similar ideas. I found an amount of people claiming certain reality synchonicities and what not. Most seemed all together illogical and incoherent, but anyway my only goal was to go for a walk without any further implication. So I start to mentalize myself to go out, but then find a recommended video from a crappy creator of scary content. I watch it, nothing particularly scary nor interesting.
I went out and came across a beautiful view. At a certain moment I started feeling distressed, afraid. I had trouble falling asleep. Today, I felt disturbed again and it's totally out of the blue.
I don't find much sense or disturbance in the things that seemingly triggered it. I think it's probably a mechanism of my brain to get away with keeping the cycle of avoidance. A big reaction towards something I normally avoid but suddenly did, using as an excuse what I had previously consumed.

I wrote this last four or so paragraphs earlier in the day. The sensation didn't stop but subsided for a bit and then came back in a completely insane manner. I'm feeling incredible vulnerable in front of reality, and I know this has its basis in my mental health. 
So, I don't know, I'm going nuts right now."

64,my life is falling apart can someone please give advice?,ok so ive struggled a lot fo anxiety/depression and over the years ive gotteb myself into some really bad habits. my biggest issues are that i have a hard time feeling anything. everything is just so monotone. i have a really hard time getting excited. i also have no motivation. no matter how hard i try to get passionate about something i just burnout and forget about it. i contribute very little to me and my partners conversations besides comments on things that he brings up. i can never think of anything to talk about. and i always get so nervous about everything. i know im messing up really bad right now. especially in my relationship. its falling apart because of me. please please please how can i bring emotion back into my life. how can i feel something other than being sorry for myself constantly. i dont know how to gain passion
65,I always need someone else to have as an example for who I should be or I become depressed,"
I feel like I’m lazy and have no motivation but than I find someone else and I almost accidentally want to be exactly like them. I don’t really do it on purpose but I notice myself thinking about how I should do my eyebrows like theirs and in my head I’m also noticing how they have a similar chin to me or something which is why I kinda copy. I feel like I’ll notice someone whether it’s a girl from school or instagram model and I’ll subconsciously begin noticing similarities between them and I and than I’ll start thinking about how I’d be happy and prettier and better if I was more like them. I start taking so much inspiration from them and i almost want to copy all their outfits and style exactly and hair and personality/hobbies/interests. 

I sometimes naturally do this but sometimes I feel like I form an obsessive crush on the person where I idolize them and think they are who I’m “supposed to look like or supposed to be” because I think that them and I look similar but I’m just not as pretty or I think them and I have similar personalities but I’m just not as good and figured out. So I start wanting to be almost exactly like them for sometimes and than I forget abt it. I’ll feel a lack of motivation but than once I find someone new and it’s like I’m happy and motivated and encouraged again.

Idk why I do this or how to stop. I know sociopaths and narcissists do this but I score as having much lower levels of sociopathy and narcissism than normal or even healthy people have. I guess looking back at childhood I’ve always doubted myself so much and wanted thin hair or skinnier legs and to be exactly like other girls to be point of almost excessively copying them. I do have adhd-pi and had selective mutism as a child but even on adhd meds I still feel like I copy. I think I’m naturally agreeable and easy going when making friends and I’m able to see multiple sides to things well so I don’t act fake around friends but I can fit in with them a little too much and I feel like people maybe sometimes think I agree with them when I don’t mean it or copy"
66,"I feel like a loser, a completely loser","I spent my entire halloween sitting at home, and then working. I worked register well acquaintances and even my fricken crush came into my store to buy candy and costume materials. I felt like such a loser, everyone else was having fun and I'm sitting at work. I told my mom I felt like a loser and she just said I was being a responsible adult. I'm 18 and just want to have fun, adulting is starting to get its ware on me. I just want to curl up and ignore the world man, no one even bothers to listen to me vent like this either. I'd complain more about my life but I dont want to bother you fine people too much, so have a swell day"
67,What's it like to live without depression,"Because I'm tired

I'm lonely

I'm a terrible person

What's it like to live without being fucked up in the head

I'm tired of fighting and faking

I've turned inward

There's no one to help on the outside"
68,Never being hungry fucking sucks,"I mean, yeah, I'm grateful to my antidepressants for making me not kill myself, but I miss being hungry at normal times. I'm nauseated like 70% of the time and the rest of the time I'm ravenous. And yeah, it's loads better than my first antidepressant where I was never hungry so I never ate, but still... I want to WANT to eat!!! This fucking sucks man."
69,I'm over perceptive and overthink everything that comes along with that.,"I don't know how to explain this very well but I'll try my best. A lot of the time I feel like something is wrong with my brain and this has been going on for the last couple of years and it's starting to scare be a bit. I notice almost every change that happens around me and can pick up on details that most others wouldn't think much of and alongside that I overthink those details to extreme lengths. It's taken a massive toll on me and honestly I'm just hoping there's someone else out there that can understand what I'm going through. I've tried talking to people in real life about it but no one seems to comprehend how I think about things.

I apologise if this was a bit if a read, thanks."
70,I’m Sad,"I drink too much. My husband can’t handle my sadness. I have boarder line personality depression/disorder and I don’t know how to be a person anymore. The person who made me get help killed themselves, and I drink to handle the boredom of being a “good person” during COVID, but I’m so sad when I drink. I don’t know how to be happy anymore."
71,A not so pleasant hospital visit...,"Warning: this may definitely trigger some people (read with caution) 

I’ve struggled with anorexia and bulimia for quite some time, and have always struggled more with restriction and very mild purging. 
Since college, however, I’ve hit a full blown relapse and have struggled ESPECIALLY with bulimia. Eating meals out with friends and having to eat in a cafeteria with only trigger foods is definitely not good for my mental health. I’ve purged more than I ever have before, and I don’t know how to handle it. 
In fact, it’s gotten so out of hand that I recently landed myself in the hospital. Story goes, I was in my boyfriends room when I thought I was having some cycle cramps. Those “cramps” turned into very sudden sharp pains which led me to fall to the floor screaming in pain. I was pretty much paralyzed and could hardly get any words out of my mouth. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and was able to carry me to the hospital where 2 doses of morphine just wasn’t enough to treat the pain. I was then put on nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and immediately passed tf out. I woke up FIVE HOURS later, panicking, because I forgot what happened and didn’t know where I was. I was begging for my boyfriend, and when the gas wore off enough, I remembered exactly why I was in the hospital. Turns out, puking your guts out isn’t so good for your stomach lining. My digestive track nearly ruptured and my stomach was incredibly inflamed. I cried after realizing what I was doing to my body. I still am so mad at myself for ever letting this happen and for continuing to struggle with my eating disorders.

I just want to know if any of you guys have ever dealt with this or have had similar experiences...

Thanks for listening 💛

TL;DR I’m on a very long road to recovery"
72,Is it normal to be overtly depressed at night?,"I feel ok during the day mostly but when I try to sleep I get depressed and I feel terrible 
I also think about how life would be if I wasn’t here and I feel lonely if thought I y’all to people it just feels like I’m missing something"
73,Who I am and my goal for WDCF,
74,I’m scared to eat and sleep,I’m too scared to eat and sleep. Everytime I swallow it worry I’m gonna choke. I can’t eat without feeling like I’m gonna choke on it. And I can’t sleep either. I don’t want to die in my sleep. I slept on my side and I felt like I was dying when I woke up. I’m just so scared and I don’t know what to do
75,Just broke down at my friends Halloween party,"My anxiety for today was under control, until the person my partner and I were waiting on was 3 hrs late from when we were supposed to get together at our friends house. It immediately gave me a knot in my stomach and I felt light headed. I decided to go to the party anyways cause I figured cancelling would be more awkward at that point. I regret going cause I just sat by myself for an hour, I couldn’t help but feel totally isolated from the conversation and had no energy to try and start conversation. Eventually I texted my partner I wasn’t feeling well and was gonna go home, and on the way to the door I just started crying on their stairs. Everyone in the house went quiet so I know everyone heard me. I couldn’t get out fast enough. My partner walked me home and I told them it’s fine they go back to the party. I just really needed this night to go smoothly, I had gone 2 days without crying and I thought I’d be good. Don’t know why I’m posting this, I just feel so bad for ruining the night"
76,Tell me about your victories,"Hi! I know this is a really trying time for a lot of people. A lot of people are feeling down or depressed or just not themselves. Sometimes there’s a lack of motivation to do things and then you feel guilty and it’s just not a nice cycle. I used to feel that way a lot, and sometimes I still do. Being angry at myself for not getting anything done and feeling useless when I didn’t get out of bed. I had an old friend who gave me a golden piece of advice years ago that I still follow. It goes “there are days when victory is brushing your teeth, but it’s still a victory” let me explain: sometimes when you feel like getting out of bed takes everything you’ve got, doing the simplest of things seems impossible. If you’re feeling that way and you got out of bed and got dressed, that’s a victory, even if you got in bed again after, and I’m proud of you. Feeling that way is really hard, and you aren’t lazy. I wanted to start this so that we had a place to share our victories judgement free. Tell me about a victory you had today, even if it seems small or insignificant, tell me:) I might even come back here on my bad days to share mine. Here’s one I had today: I didn’t feel like eating, but I knew I needed to, so I made myself a meal. Your turn☺️"
77,"I sometimes get very intrusive ""worst case scenario"" thoughts of imaginary circumstances much worse than the current reality. What is that called?","For example, when walking with friends, I'll think of how anyone could have just fallen and hurt themselves. Why? What is that?"
78,Maybe I can finally do it," I don't have anything going for me. The whole friends and family probably cares is 100% bull. I can't keep a job because of my mental illness. Went out yesterday and felt sick from just that because heaven forbid I get to enjoy anything ever. So I just don't leave my house. Maybe go to the grocery store once a week if I'm lucky and the thought of it doesn't make me sick. I'm ugly and obsessed with it. I'm overweight and struggled with eating disorders.

I don't think my family wants me here. I think the only reason they say anything against me dieing is because that's what you're supposed to do. Their not even my parents. My parents didn't want me the second I was born. I think the only reason I'm here is because there was no where else to stuff me right now. Like they'd feel bad but still they don't really want me here. 

I've been obsessively trying to lose weight. I have struggled for years with binge eating disorder and finally felt it was under control. Today as I said before I felt sick and didn't feel like actually cooking as I normally do for the house and tried to find something easy they everyone would eat just because everyone was home today and I live with picky eaters and was shot down for everything. I decided to lay down as I felt bad already just for my aunt to say they decided to have pizza which is one of the foods I can't have. So I decided to just not eat. 

Before I don't think I could do this but where I've spent months cutting out foods and not being able to eat much of what I like I can just not eat. About to hit the first 24 hours and I can still go with out food. I always wished I could just not eat since I was so fat. Maybe I can just give up now."

No one can take over my body for me and I can’t control or take care of my own body. Just a complete failure. 

Just in so much physical and emotional pain. My body is hurting everywhere tonight. I want to die so bad still 😩I’m so scared I’ll mess my suicide attempt up and become a vegetable. I don’t want anyone to tell me not to die. Idk I just truly want my life to end so bad."
81,Has my childhood made me the way I am?,"My parents had me super young, basically right out of high school. They were together for a little over ten years (with a breakup or two in between), but never got engaged or married. I was born about 4 years after they were together... was definitely not planned lol. Fast forward to when I was 6/7, my dad got kicked out for being abusive and cheating. Of course, my mom would let him in the house from time-to-time, but other times he'd knock and she wouldn't, and then she would tell me to hide under the table downstairs or under the desk upstairs, it depended. There were several times I saw and heard my dad abuse her; it obviously scared me (like it would any kid... I was 6/7 at the time). One day before my mom's battle with depression came to an end -- before she passed away, my dad beat my mom so much, I hid upstairs and cried; I still remember that day. After she died, my dad wanted custody of me, as well as my grandparents. Once in a while I would stay with my dad at another family member's house (because he did not have his own), I was left alone with him and he got very angry at me because I wanted to eat dinner I believe (a frozen dinner) and he did not want to make it for me. From what I can remember, he tried to throw the box at me, and he was screaming at me as my back was against the backyard door; I remember that I thought he was going to hit me that night... I was 8, now 19. He also punched a hole into the wall another time because of something that I said about him to a judge in court. He is still an angry man today, but I am so blessed that I was able to grow up with my grandparents. I do experience extreme episodes of depression, sometimes social anxiety, and very low self-esteem issues... to the point where I sometimes do not want to leave the house. On the bright side, I am a Dean's List college student, but I have a very hard time trusting people, feeling loved and not alone in this world, and also have extreme bouts of depression. I was wondering if and how my childhood... the childhood where I basically grew up without parents (without a loving dad and of course, my beautiful mom who decided that it was her time to go)? I often just feel so alone in this world. I've been okay recently, but there are times where I just feel so alone, so unattractive, so awful, so annoying, and the list goes on. I was wondering if I have PTSD or something? I have never been abused or anything, but I feel as though I've been emotionally neglected/forgotten, and I also grew up in a crazy household. Believe me, everything I put in this post is just the icing on the cake. If anyone can help me understand what I may be going through because of my past/upbringing, please help. Thank you!"
82,Am I bipolar?,"I have been observing my declining mental health over quarantine and I've noticed some behaviors that could indicate something. I feel as if I can't confide with anyone about this, so reddit, here I go. I've had suicidal depression before COVID and manic episodes, but they lasted for months under one mood. Now, during quarantine, the increments of them are getting extremely shorter, to the point wherein I shift from feeling super masculine and on top of everything to feeling like a pathetic ugly faggot in less than an hour. I've also been having extreme anger throughout and have been trying to conceal my intense hatred towards literally everyone, even towards people who don't deserve it, but I just get so angry at them. I cope with this by not expressing any emotion and keeping the anger in the back of my mind, and only had a few minor slip ups. I don't know what to do, I am starting to contemplate suicide again and I don't want to do something stupid. I'm in high school and have no one to really confide with my true mental state with. It all began in middle school when I started having manic episodes. I don't want to commit suicide because there are conditions I have set for myself wherein I must accomplish them before my life ends. I have always aspired to be a comedian and it is my ultimate life goal but I can't even looking at myself and feel like I hate my body. I hate that because I am Hispanic/mixed my lips are supper large and I'm very skinny and my voice is high pitch and sounds like a girl and people have always made fun of me and called me gay and weird for it, even though I am straight. Every time I try to be funny with friends or something they don't laugh and I just feel like a loser. Sorry if I am all over the place, it's just my mind is always racing and their was so much to put down. Hopefully I don't sound like a sped kid I am not going to edit this after writing this post. But yeah, that's my situation"
83,My hair reminds me of my parent's divorce,"When I was young my dad told me to never cut my hair because I was fat and ugly. That my hair is good for hiding my face. So I didn't cut my hair but I also stopped caring how I looked. Till this day even when people compliment me and I've changed and decided to make myself presentable I feel ugly. I'm scarred from haircuts and now to go against my pain I always have my hair short.

Today I got my haircut and argued with my mom. Now more reason to hate my hair.

We argued about money and I was reminded of things my dad told me. He told me that my mom only wants me for the money and I believed him. I tried to change that mindset but it's hard when you've been told that since little. I always look for reasons why my mom doesn't love me to this day. I measure love by money now and I know it's unhealthy. When I see my mom pay for something I feel loved and now I feel entitled to her money which is unhealthy. She doesn't pay for much just the occasional meal out. I usually pay for my clothes and food since I went to college. But I have a toxic mindset that parents should provide food or spending money for their kids when they don't have jobs, I get money from fafsa. I don't need the money but I just always lied to my mom that I didn't have money to see her pay for me. When I was in middle school she would make me pay for things like clothes when I didn't have a job. But my dad convinced me that this is her being a bad mom. That she wouldn't even spend a dime on me. Till this day I don't know how I feel because my mind is a mess and money gets complicated in my mind.

I don't know what's wrong with me I just wished I could live by myself and forget these memories."
84,My story...,"Here I am just posting my story....
In 7th grade I remember i got teased, humiliated, bullied by a lot of kids at school. I felt sad when I would get humiliated but I was forced to keep a smile on my face and not cry so I would go along with what everyone said about me. Not a single teacher did anything to stop them from calling me names, it got to the point where I was afraid of going to school. I would be absent for weeks and then come back hoping they forgot about me and would leave me alone but it was the same thing. I would get called names from afar by other while everyone else would stare at me in the hallways....I started failing school and would get into fights with my mother not wanting to go to school. I never told her why because I felt embarrassed. 

8th grade came the bullying was still there but there was always guys who would still talk to me and be friends with me and wouldn’t say horrible things. I only had 5 friends and I was happy to atleast have them by my side but in lunch time they had other friends so I would sit alone. I hated lunch time I would spent all history class hoping lunch would be better. I loved volleyball but I was scared to socialize or to be around new people so I didn’t try out even tho the volleyball coach would always try to cheer me up and tell me to join.

9th grade...ha...the worst year of all...It was hell. I had only 2 friends. One of them I reunited with her back in 3rd grade (still talk to her to this day) her and I would always hang out together.  Around January of 2019 is when I fell into severe depression and had a lot of social anxiety. I stayed home in bed for 2 months. My mom gave up with trying to send me to school. The school counselor would call home everyday to tell me I had to go to school. I felt horrible, I gave up I didn’t care about going to college..or about being someone in life at this point I just wanted to die. My mom had no idea of my depression she just thought i was being lazy...and well fast forward to May of 2019 I attempted suicide. I tried overdosing on some pills that I found. The attempt failed even after I finished the whole bottle which were about 50 pills. I was afraid of dying but I wanted to however after I felt sleepy and fell asleep while crying. Three days after the attempt I texted the suicide hotline and told them they sent home an ambulance and the police. My mom was confused when they told her I had attempted suicide. She yelled at me asking if it was true, thankfully the police told her to calm down that it wasn’t the right time for that . They asked if I was doing it for attention....and then took me to the police station and trust me I hated it...they were laughing while getting frustrated with me threatening me to keep me in longer if I didn’t tell them what was going on. I felt even worse. After I was sent to the ER to get checked and got inpatient at a mental health hospital. I felt happier because I wasn’t alone. I made some friends and I felt more alive and was talkative. 
I then went back home a week later and everything went down. I did not see a therapist because my family was into a pastor and he told them that I shouldn’t see one. I really wanted to see a therapist because I knew I needed one but I smiled and say I was okay....

A few months later I was feeling at bit better and started exercising and taking care of myself. I moved to another city and had to attend another high school. Although I was supposed to go into 10th grade, do to the lack of credits I was considered a 9th grader still. I got put into 9th grade again and I tried my best to be better but I felt useless. I couldn’t even make friends, I made a friend but everyone seemed to already know each other so I was left alone . The tables were alwasy full so I would just stay in the restrooms inside the building and cry. I got tired of it and then although I’m hispanic I was made fun of their by a few guys because I’m pale. They would frequently call me out for it and made me feel bad for it always. I felt sad and hopeless so I started missing school. I stayed home and felt safer at home. My family split apart when my mom got a new boyfriend. Every one in my family turned against her and always compared me to her so it was also getting to me. I got kicked out of that school and stayed home for 3 months until I found another school. 

Once I found a new school it was different since I only went 2 days and did my packets at home. It was easier because there was no lunch it was only 2 hours. I felt relieved because I didn’t have to socialize much. However before I went there I decided I was going to lose weight and improve my skin care routine. During depression I gained a lot and In my mind I wanted to look like a really pretty skinny barbie doll girl. Stupid me. I lost a few pound and started fasting however since I didn’t have a scale I didn’t really know how much exactly was I losing or gaining. I went to school and my teacher was so helpful he tried his best to keep me on track with school. He knows about my mental health illnesses.

Fast forward to 2020 I felt myself gaining more weight and I would see others post about them losing weight so I decided to do so as well. I would always imagine that one day I’ll be looking at a beautiful girl with a good body in the mirror. A girl that would finally get liked and accepted. I told myself I would not go back to school if they opened until I lost the weight I needed and until I was happy. As time went by, I lost A LOT of weight. I felt happier to see the numbers go down every day. I start cutting out a lot of food and i felt finally in control of something in my life. I didn't care about eating I felt happy. 

Now...as you may know by reading that I struggle with anorexia. I am recovering but I feel myself relapsing. It really sucks but idk what to do. 


Anyways fast forward to today....I’m crying because I want to go to college and I feel like I have no chance to get into my dream university due to my past and I’m still doing 9th grade credits although I'm supposed to be in 11th grade. I'm so sad and feel useless. I feel like shit and sometimes just feel like giving up but then I wake up wanting to achieve my dreams so I don't want to. I just want to be happy"
85,I think I have an eating disorder.,"I am a 20 year old college student who worked out a lot for the last few years but I have always been on the heavier side. My height is 5'9 and I am about 225, so my BMI isn't looking too good for me. Recently, in college, I have stopped working out because my heavy work load, but I want to lose weight as I am worried about the health concerns in the future. And full honesty, I just came out of a breakup and I want to look attractive and better than I do now. I know how to workout, but my problem, which I think is mental, is my eating disorder. I live in an apartment with with a kitchen on the first floor and I live on the 3rd. I go downstairs a lot for various reasons, but every time I am down there and I am alone, I eat like everything that I can see, that is mine of course. I don't know what it is, but I have the feeling to eat till I'm full. I don't want to eat it after I have eaten it, how do I tell myself to stop eating. I have tried many things but I default back to my habits, what can I do, I want to stop eating and get in shape."
86,Can’t do anything and i don’t know how to tell my friend,"I’ve canceled plans so many times with her that she noticed n asked me about it, today we made plans too but I only feel drained and unmotivated for everything i can barely take care of myself. Going out with a friend once a week is very hard, idk how i should tell her bc I don’t wanna hurt her"
87,i just need help,"I don't know what is wrong with me but I'm always upset for no reason and when people ask me what's wrong I feel guilty and don't know what to do. It feels like there is no point to anything anymore. I feel if I ask for help I will be a burden on my parents, and be a 15 year old ""attention seeker"" I feel down for no reason at all and since I can hardly do things other people can I feel embarrassed and worthless. I would never take my own life but i feel as if I'm changing my mind on that."
88,What are differences between toxic people and those who have anxiety disorders?,"An anxiety disorder person feels constant fear, fear which paralyzed your logical response, they are constantly on the edge, agitated and irritated..

89,I was doing it so good,"I've being struggling with depression last 12 years, after an emotional break that drove me to try to kill myself for 3rd time, i finally decided to seek for profesional help, it actually worked, last months i was felling some changes, a lot more mental and emotionally stable.

Last thursday mi ex texted me asking how i'm doing and how my treatment is going, showing as soon as she could that she didn't really care and starting talking about herself, nding the conversation with ""sorry if i made you fell bad""...offcourse she made me fell bad!!! Really bad!!!
She destroyed me, she was the cause of my emotional brake, cheating on me with another mf, lying to me, exploiting my insecurity to feel better with herself... Fuck, i beg her to not leve me, but she didn't gave a fuck.

 I worked so hard to change my way to do things, so many pills and therapy, all the help from my family and friends and this girl shows up and brings back all my insecurity in matter of hours... Now i feel like shit again, felling like dont deserve anything good, feeling like i deserve to be alone, not sleeping again, not eating as should.

Sorry if i sound too pathetic, i just needed to vent.

Have a good day."
90,Borderline meets eating disorders meets anxiety,"I just wanted to try this to see if it can help.
When i talk about my mental health issues with people i always choose just one so they wont look at me like i have a a contagious disease, but here i want to say it all, i wanna give the internet a chance i guess...

At 14 my family decided it was time to go back to our country, and as soon as we did it my parents started fighting, sleeping in separate beds (the couch really) and eventually got divorced, i was put into a Catholic school ""because i needed discipline"" failed 9th and got kicked out of that school that wasn't nice to me to say the least. Went to a new school, developed an eating disorder (eat too much-&gt;feel guilty-&gt;dont eat for days-&gt;feel sick-&gt;back to eating like a pig). By then  i already knew i was depressed cuz i had tried to kill myself (lame attempts) a few times (without my family's knowledge) and started cutting myself. My mom tried to force me to live with her and her new boyfriend, so i moved with my dad and stopped talking to her for 4 years while my brothers hated me for that. I was forced to talk with her when his dad died but it was always uncomfortable and i still hate her. I was raped 4 times after 20, but even at that age i didn't knew it was rape until i started reading about feminism a few years later. The first one was by a family friend now married to my sister) who i talked to only to get weed, one day i got drunk and he let me stay at his place assuring me that I would be fine, and then he raped me half unconscious, i woke up only to find his dick in my mouth filled with cum. Second was by an abusive ex boyfriend, third by someone i thought was my friend, and the fourth one at a bar, i was at the bathroom feeling sick and he help me by getting me on his motorcycle. Ended waking up naked, with a sore vagina at this guy's house.

At 22 i was still cutting myself an to make things better i got pregnant, couldn't get an abortion (illegal in my country) so i had it even tho i hated him your eating the life out of me, making me fat and uncomfortable. I mean just imagine having problems loving your body, and then this thing comes up and makes you hate your body even more,and i cant even get drunk or take drugs to make me numb! Didn't take real care of him for a long time, but at his 6months old i wasn't ready to go back to work, turns out having a baby makes you realize how fucked up you are, and its not the baby's fault so i went to therapy, after so many years of wanting (but to afraid to ask) but i went for my bby, he deserves a good mommy. They told me i am borderline, took pills, but didn't felt better, and the lack of appetite wasn't helping my ED (wich i have never told a doctor about it) so i went to a psychologist, and it worked for a bit more than 2 years, my relationship with the baby was so much better even the one with my dad was better, so much he said i didn't need him anymore.
I was fine until corona came to my country and in march i was already in quarantine, so much time overthinking is having me in my worst mental state ever (realizing i would prob need constant mental counseling), can't get out of bed I cant even sit with my kid to teach him, got so fat during the first 6 months that now i can't eat, i have a hard time forcing myself to do it, so much my kid gets mad if i dont eat, so now i eat a little when he is home and whenever he stays at his dad's house i have a more than hard time getting out of bed or eating and spend 50% of the time crying and thinking about killing myself and the other 50 sleeping to evoid my suicidal thoughts. I had regular panic attacks, i am anxious all the time and the more time i am alone with my thoughts the more i start picking on my skin (every body part, specially my face).
I really want to go back to therapy but i am too afraid and dont know where to start, my mom issues, the all time existing thought of killing myself, eating disorders, the rapes that wont let me had a normal sex life (i had a panic attack while having sex with my current partner, also now i'm worried that he wont see me again after that) or what. My friends are my only real help, but only because they have been or are going thru the same plus some other mental problems so I don't want to give them more problems to think about.
Also, and this part is so tragic/comic, my mom and brothers think i am faking it to seek attention, oh, and my family doesn't know about the rapes Lol

I just wanted to say everything, i always feel like i have to hide a part of me from people, plus i discovered that speaking about my problems in english is much more easier than in my native language. Lol i can't even say ""i was raped"" in my native.

91,People who've survived suicide. What's made you carry on and not try again?,"As the title says I'm curious what drove people to carry on when they got their second chance.

Due to my current circumstances I don't really enjoy living, haven't done for awhile. I've had things keep me about but I just feel done with it all. I feel like the people I've talked to have either completely ignored what I've said to them or just choose to forget it, so I'm tired of explaining."
92,"I became ""addict"" to two of my friends after they support me when I struggled with my homosexuality and my feeling toward one of them. I don't know how to proceed without scaring them away and it's making me really depressed again.","I repost this here from relationship advice because my original post didn't get any attention and I starting to feeling really really bad so it probably feet better here now. TLDR at bottom.

First of all, forgive me for my writting, English is not my native language (I'm from France) and sorry if it isn't organised well, I don't have the brainpower to do that anymore.

Rencently  I (19M) have been struggling a lot specially regarding relationship. I have always been a bit melancolic but it has worsen a lot since two months.

It all started to break  down when I started to have feelings for a (19 M)  friend and a last  year classmate. The thing is, I was still in the closet and started to think about it a lot which worsen my situation because I'm  doing  extremely hard and time consuming studies (70 hours a week) so my grades  started to go down.

It went for a week until I had enough and told him I was gay. He reacted pretty well even though he was visibly uncomfortable with the subject. But the stress generated by my coming out made me feel even worse than the before. I started to fear his look for no reason, lost hunger and hadn't any desire to do anything anymore. I had even suicidal though from time to time.

I came out to another mutual friend a few days later in hope I will be able to talk about it with him instand which help me a little but not enough. I felt enormous guilty not telling my feelings for him. I felt  like I was  lying to him, taking advantage of him so I finally told him two weeks ago.

He took it very well (even though he was not interested) which was a huge relief. We talked about it for an hour by text and I began to feel well again.

But the relief only lasted for a few days and then I started to feel empty. During those terrible weeks, I seeked a lot their company (of my crush and the mutual friend) because it was only with them that I felt kind of ok.

It make me realize that I really like being with them and that I want our friendships to develop a  lot more and also outside of school. We spend 6 to 12 hour a day  together working (and chatting) but rarely did anything outside of school (all of us are introvert). But now I miss them a lot (we are in a  break from school) at a clearly unhealthy level and am at a loss about it.

It created some insecurities. I  feel like them may not like me as much as I would want. I sometimes  feel a bit jealous of them (like a need to prove something to them?) but  also guilt at the same time.

I created a group which both of them plus a few other close friends who happily joined where we played a bit together during this break but it  didn't make me any feel better.

Moreover, I can't ask them support this time because I really fear it will scare them away. They are probably the best people I ever know. So do you have any advice on the matter ? I'm seeking for a therapist but it will take a long time because of covid. Don't hesitate to ask for more details  the caractar limit suck.

TLDR : Became ""addict"" to two friend after they support me when I struggled with my homosexuality and my feeling toward one of them. I felt a huge relief after expressing my feelings but now I feel terrible again and I don't know  to proceed without loosing them and my situation is becoming worse and worse."
93,Need some insight,"So this is my first time trying to put how i ""feel?"" into words and just need some insight on what is going on within myself. I have always felt disconnected for the world in a way i can't describe, it's not that i have no feelings at all but they are very limited to the things that i consider ""important"" to me and those that i have chosen to surround myself with. I am constantly trying to convince that i am ok but am constantly sad and am almost powerless to stop it, just little things can onset a wave of emotions from happiness to sadness because the happiness has subsided then anger cause it went so quickly and i can't get it back. I have very violent outbursts, but never hurt anyone, just yell and throw things, punch the walls and be generally violent towards my surroundings. I understand that the consequences that come with associated actions so i know i must behave accordingly to stay free, but I've been caught hurting animals and despite being told that its not ok and understanding that i wouldn't want it to happen to me i can't help but continue and I'm just worried that one day it won't be enough to kill small animals anymore and I'll go for something more. If any mental health professionals see this i just need some advice. I don't have enough money to see a therapist to talk to and any time i bring it up to people around me they get uncomfortable and quickly withdraw from conversation. So again this is not a cry for help, I'm simply looking for insight on what might be the underlying problem so i can go about life."

Need help.

My partner suffers with BPD amongst other mental health issues.

Lately we've been arguing about petty things but we are better than that. Our sex life is very adventurous and we don't hold back on much. 

But yesterday my partner said she needs to feel physical pain, she wants me to fuck her so hard it makes her cry, hit her spit at her and to not hold back or stop. She said she wants me to do it, me to be the one to cause her physical pain, and its making me feel very concerned about her. This isn't normal and im not sure I can do it? 

I've asked whats going on in her mind she says nothing its numb. Last night she asked me again via text to do all the above to her today (we don't live together) when she comes over.

What do I do? Any help greatly appreciated"

98,Did I spot something ? And Am I allowed to “help”?,"Hello everyone, 

I have a question for you since this seems maybe important and I don’t want to step into the wrong hole. 

A few weeks ago I met this 24 young lady (I’m 26) . 

She does a lot of sports, a lot of camping in nature and stuff. Overall she looks incredibly independant and strong. 

However, we were going for an hike this week end and spent the earlier night together near there.

After 2.3 drinks of wine and some weed, she didn’t feel okay. 
I walked up upstairs in the bed then just before it she went blank. 
I caught her in time and put her on the bed. Then she came back to her senses, went through different “phases” sad, happy, afraid,.... 

She said she didn’t tell me but she couldn’t mix weed and wine because it awakens things inside her. 
“Like what” I said “Like drinking a lot and take pills and stuff” 
She already said she was destructive when angry like going for a swim during a tempest for two hours. 

Then 3 times she just “froze” and I had to call her thrice before she came to her senses, saying “I had flashbacks of memories it’s okay” 


In the end, I spent 2-3 hours nurturing her, reassuring her and stuff. 

Now she is “annoyed” that I saw her weak and that no one ever did. 

I’m cool with it I really don’t care about people having inner problem, we all have. 

But my early analysis is that she seems to be running away from whichever problems it is.

Am I allowed to try and tell her something along the lines of “ I have no idea what your problems are and they may be huge but I believe that you’re running away from them. I know you want to be strong, and by living with them in that way it may seem so but you could be way stronger by starting to face them slowly by slowly” or something along those lines ? 


Again, it may be a small problem that is seen as huge ... or a big problem seen as big"
99,Can’t talk to my husband,I’m having a really hard time because I feel like I can’t talk to my husband. Every time I try it seems like he will tell me how I’m wrong and then get upset about it and feel bad about himself. He suffers from very bad depression and I feel so lonely but afraid to tell him it is because of him because I don’t want to make things worse. I don’t know how much more I can take.
100,Is this related to anxiety?,"I just talked to my friend about a historical fact but it is something biased, then I said, I only dislike the bad things in history. 
I felt guilty, and I overthink about it that I might be a bad person to others. Maybe I have to stop overthinking."
101,I'm fucking screwed,"I've finally hit my dead end.

For two years now Ive been trying to get my mother to take me to get my ankles checked because I can't pay for it and can't get there by myself either.

My ankles that never properly healed because my mother simply wrapped them up when they sprained and I still had to use them rather than getting me crutches that we had full access to.

For two years she hasn't done so. For two years it was a sarcastic eye rolling ""great."" For two years it was putting me off because ""you'll be fine."" For two years it was her admitting they never healed but never doing anything about it. For two years it was putting me off and then when she finally ""considered it"" Covid hit and ""they won't be able to check your ankles now so you'll have to wait."" For two years she'd shrug it off. For two years it was suddenly blaming my anxiety for my pain just like my old doctor was.

In those two years my ankles have made my walking go funny because they're constantly twisting my legs and knees. Now my knees have paid the price of those ankles and my kneecaps have almost completely gone sideways. I can't walk for more than five minutes without my knees stiffening and becoming incredibly sore.

I got tests done that checked for any arthritis. Nothing came back positive for it. It wasn't until I was moved to another doctor that didn't blame my pain for anxiety that he decided to get an x-ray done to observe what was going on. That's when he found the damage. It's the worst he's ever personally seen. He said it would be 6 to 12 months of physical therapy to fix, but he doubts it'll work given the damage that's been done. I'll have to get surgery done if they can't be fixed.

Two years worth of neglecting that's now caused this. They're still being neglected now. They see me in fucking pain when I walk or do anything, they see me stop and groan when my knees jolt. That doesn't stop them from getting me to move around over the most useless fucking things. Heating up food they're fully capable of doing. Moving things they're fully capable of doing.

I still have to rely on the person who's caused this. I can't get a job with this. I can't afford my license with this. I can't afford to pay for my own ride and doctors appointments for this. I still have to have an adult around who can sign the Medicare forms given I'm not 18 yet. 

I'm so done. I don't know how much longer I can go for."

I’ve quit the drinking for now but I need to address the issues arising. 

I’ve been seeking help to battle this, but it doesn’t seem to be that easy. I contacted a local psychologist who seemed like a good fit on Monday, but haven’t gotten a call back.

105,"Can you have Borderline Personality Disorder, but be happy?","I'm struggling to understand myself and need some help.

I experience emotions really intensely - the positive and the negative. I've been this way as long as I remember and my family would describe me as gullible, naiive, often too trusting of people and easily hurt. I don't feel this is the case though - I just feel so captivated by my experiences and relationships. Ive always had this weird thing where my eyes fill with tears and I get a lump in my chest whenever I am listening to somebody talk about something particularly positive OR sad. It's like I feel the emotions other people are portraying.

I get incredibly drawn in by sensations, like the sound of music and the taste of food - I know this because nobody elses experience seems to reflect mine, I often feel as though I'm over exaggerating how it should feel??

This sounds great but I also sometimes feel very intense loneliness, and like a existential depression - like I am overwhelmed by life and nobody understands. It doesn't normally last more than a day, and I have absolutely no desire to hurt myself but I find myself questioning what life would be like if I wasn't here etc.

When I read about these traits online, BPD crops up alot - but also mentions things like having unstable relationships and uncontrollable anger. I can imagine I would be susceptible to these kind of traits, but for the most part I have had a happy childhood and life so far - I have a great relationship and I am very greatful for the life I have. In fact I end up feeling very guilty for feeling depressed, and find it extremely hard to explain it to people.

I am quite impulsive, and have committed to a variety of career paths in my life - and I feel some kind of urgency to fit as many rich experiences and achievements into life as I possibly can. I have travelled alot and thrown myself into learning tons of new skills like outdoor sports and crafts but I am also obsessed with finding answers to things and am currently completing a science degree. I am very proud of my achievements but I struggle with the overwhelm and find it impossible to just be content and not overthink.

I believe this has been exasperated by Covid - I have recently come from a very diverse life on the move and been forced to take a comfortable office job and settle in one place for a while. I am extremely fortunate and I appreciate everything I have but for some reason I am filled with fear that I am trapped and there might be no more new experiences for me?

I feel utterly stupid and guilty for feeling this way, because I know I shouldn't. But it leads me to question why I am like this - I feel the need to understand and find logic to my illogical feelings. Please help! X"
106,Things do get better,"I don’t wish to start this on a negative note and I know I could have had things much worse etc, but I’ve had a hard life up until this year. The specifics don’t matter but I never thought I would be in such a good place like I am now.

Ever so slight tw:  about hospitals and mental health

So I’m 14 and this year here are the good things that have happened:

Start of December last year to end of January this year, I was inpatient for my mental health.

- I definitely had my ups and downs in that place but I am blessed to have been sent to one of the best facilities in my country and I met some of the nicest people in there. It was also what I needed to keep me safe.

- I spent Christmas there and it was the best Christmas I’ve ever had. It was just me and one other patient on the ward and a few staff so we just had fun and the food was really good. 

When I was discharged from hospital, admittedly it was a very unstable time. I was discharged to my grandparents house due to my parents being unfit to look after me.

- I clash a lot with my grandparents, especially my nan due to generational issues and her lack of understanding.

- But I am extremely grateful. This is the first time I have had clean housing, clothes, a stable family environment, and not having the constant stress of a toxic and neglectful household.

The end of February I started my new school.

- You don’t hear many teens saying this but I genuinely love going to my school.

- It’s a specialist school for teens with mental health difficulties and it’s a lot more relaxed than mainstream. We can leave lessons whenever we need to, we don’t get homework and everyone is really nice.

Corona has been hard. As I am classed as a ‘vulnerable child’, by my countries lockdown rules I was exempt to schools being closed and was allowed to attend.

- Lockdown school was fun. We didn’t really do lessons and as there was somewhere between 5 and 15 students attending at any one time, we were in mixed year groups and just played games all day.

In July I was very nearly made inpatient again, however we sorted it out. I’m really proud of myself for overcoming that.

September this year has been a new school year starting.

- I am really having fun with year ten and doing subjects I enjoy.

I also met my sort of boyfriend.

- We’ve had our ups and downs but I really like him and want things to work out.

- Only a few days ago did he become my sort of boyfriend but we’ve had an on and off thing since school started.

And that brings us to now. I don’t know if anyone cares about any of this but i wanted to share because life does get better. Even if you whole heartedly believe it won’t, you never know what another year will bring."
107,"My perfection is debilitating me, what should I do?","I believe perfection is real and it is a state of being to which I should aspire. I can say with a high degree of conviction that I will kill myself if I go on believing this.

This belief is axiomatic to me. It has formed the core value of who I am for all of my teenage years and adult life.

I am quickly becoming so debilitated by my belief that I think of killing myself when I make the slightest mistake.

What should I do? I can't find any resources on perfectionism that really help me so I would happily take any insight people have to offer. I try making personal efforts to combat my own perfectionism but I always end up breaking down or hurting myself"
108,Ignoring Instagram for the sake of your Depression,"Hey guys and girls,

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression. I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and ""lives"" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp &amp; Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

I would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality. I have to remember myself every time again, it's so hard when you already get fucked by your own mind with negative thoughts about the most irrational things just waking up right in the morning."
109,[UK] Lockdown and Mental Health,"Morning everyone;

With the UK going back into another lockdown next week for a month, I know how difficult it is for those with mental health problems, like ourselves. I found the last lockdown increasingly difficult and after 2 and a half weeks of it, I was admitted to hospital following a paracetamol OD. But now, I feel that I am prepared for this lockdown.

Those who struggle with ""isolation"" and ""starring at the same 4 walls"" for 4 months, please please please access the support networks you have already, reach out to family, friends; please don't suffer alone. I know lockdown is a pain in the ass, and I don't particularly see a need for it currently. But please know, there is support out there for everyone. My DMs are always open and I will do anything in my power to support those that need it throughout the upcoming shitty tough times so please feel free to message me.

There are also multiple support services/charities which are operating during these times, with the obvious ones being Samaritans, Shout etc. So should you start to find things difficult, these services are always a call away.

But as I said, my DMs are open, and I hope everyone is safe at the moment as well. Enjoy the rest of your day :)

Spencer &lt;3"

111,Lost interest in all my hobbies and not motivated in anything,"I posted something like this a month ago, I followed the advise to rest and I did. However, I still havent regained my interests. In fact, it got worse. I am now unmotivated to do anything, I dont want to play my favourite video game, I dont want to listen to the new episode of my favorite podcast, I dont want to listen to my favourite music. Nothing seems fun anymore.

I LITERALLY dont want to do anything anymore. I eat lunch at 3-4 pm. I eat dinner at 10-11 pm. I am just in my bed browsing the 3 social media apps all day"
112,"When i see others in a relationship i feel so sick and extremely upset, as well as anxious, is there any way i can control this pls",Any techniques appreciated.
113,Sister seems to be going through psychosis but convinced doctors with her superb acting she is not unwell? What could this be?,"My sister has gone through what we suspect is mania (for the first time) a few years ago. She went through a lot of euphoria/God complex, speaking about how she was in touch with God and some work delusions about a promotion that we aren’t sure was even real. She eventually came down from the high and seemed relatively normal (ok maybe not entirely) for some time. She refused to seek help however. 

A few months ago the symptoms started to show again (I think lockdown has been difficult for her). And then it became so bad she had to resign from work. She has been spamming and harassing numerous people about God doing some great work through her. That she is the chosen one. She’s also been spamming our entire family with the same rhetoric. Verbally abusing her husband and threatening suicide or self harm if he upset her even slightly. Small things like not being able to find her phone or speaking to her wrong. It got to the point that her husband (with the help of my brother) had to call the ambulance on her today because she was becoming increasingly erratic.

However...she somehow sweet talked her way out of the ambulance?? They discharged her as soon as she arrived at the hospital. Then she went rogue and arrived at my brothers house and proceeded to verbally abuse and harass my brother along with her husband. Threatening to self harm or break things etc and ‘don’t you know I’m Gods chosen?!’ Screaming etc. It got so bad my brother called the police. When they arrived she took on a role of acting Completely normal. Making the policemen laugh. Joking with them etc. Saying she is absolutely not crazy and gaslighting my brother and brother in law infront of the policemen. They were completely convinced and charmed by her and left. 

She arrived home with her husband and went on a tirade of verbal abuse. Calling him all kinds of names in front of their children. I finally arrived to maybe calm her down and her husband looked completely dejected and exhausted. She was ranting to me about how she is Gods chosen and all the narrative she had been saying for weeks. My older brother finally arrived and having experienced similar things with his wife (she has bipolar) agreed that she needed to be admitted by force. So they took her to the hospital in the car with her screaming at us about us all burning in hell for this and all kinds of obscenities. Saying to the voices she hears in her head (she hears voices) that ‘I know I know I hear you, they will’ and all kinds of things.

However when he went to admit her she smiled at him and said ‘watch this, they won’t believe you🙃. I will charm my way out of this’ and she almost did. Until my brother showed them all the texts and imessages she had been sending everyone. They reluctantly admitted her even after assessment. And once my brother left they called him again asking if he was absolutely certain she needed it.

There’s a lot that’s been left out. And her behaviour has been far more erratic than I’ve had the time to describe. The thing that gets us she is SO incredibly clever at making it sound like she is not crazy to strangers but then turning and showing us a completely different side when we are alone. She would even go as far as saying she will kill her husband for what he had done. What could this be?? Really need some insight and help. Our family feels so hopeless. Her children are afraid of her coming home even though they love her."
114,i fucking hate my life and almost everything about myself,I've wasted my life and my time and my youth because I let other people get to me and didn't stand for myself. People continue to fuck with me and the voices in my head make me want to do horrible things to them because I'm so angry because I've been thru so much pain. I'm 26. I'm getting old. I'm not getting laid. I don't have a gf. I didn't finish college. I work shit jobs and have no money. Everyone treats me like shit esp these days. I either want to break someone's neck or throw myself off a bridge
115,Finally moving on i guess,"Well i‘m finally done. He changed his number. Done chasing a guy that doesn‘t give a shit about me anymore. I didn‘t lose anything, he lost the best thing in his life. Never getting my stuff back. It‘s sad tho. Am back at sad stage i guess. I wish i could say i wish him all the best but i only wish him the worst. I really do wish karma will hit him at some point in his life. That boy destroyed me and i‘m still crying over him for whatever reason. It‘s crazy how fast people can change and become a completely different person."
116,I almost always have this bad feeling in my chest area can someone explain to me what it is ?,"So from the begining of quarantine i had a bad depression when i became to hate my self and dont want to live anymore plus suicidale thoughts and constantly sabotaging my self , as time goes on the intansity of the depresion reduced (mainly mentaly) but i always have this feeling in my chest it's like something  bad gonna happen its never goes away please someone explain to me what it is and how i can get ride of it because life feel like hell its very hard to live with it ."
117,What is wrong with me?!,"I have a great family, great friends, great life... I’ve been friends with my group of friends for over 10 years... but for some reason I feel like everyone doesn’t like me..? Even at work, I go out of my way to be helpful and kind to everyone. Feel like all of my coworkers don’t like me. I don’t understand this. Lately I just feel like I annoy everyone just by being me..."
118,Can Hardly Cope With Imminence of the Election,"I don’t think I could emotionally survive a Trump victory. I think I might actually leave the country if he wins again. When I see him talk during the debates and obviously in his rallies, I see a very evident demagogue. I see someone who knows how to expertly craft a sentence to straddle the truth with such a fine line that he can get away with saying whatever he wants. And, I see this fallacious arguments his supporters believe about why he should be President. I don’t think I could live in a country with so many idiots. So many gullible people. Such a society that can easily be manipulated and with legislators that allow it to be freely manipulated through the media. I lived in Netherlands for half a year, and I see how they convicted the Trump equivalent over there with hate speech. There are other countries where people are more homogeneously healthy, and more constructive socially. 

If Biden wins, I still hate what happened in this country and how many idiots live here. And, I worry about the rise of other politicians just like Trump, like Tom Cotton (a Presidential hopeful). I’m an entrepreneur, and I’m almost at the point where I don’t want to serve people here anymore. Is there something wrong with me? I just don’t understand why people parade massive Trump flags around. Isn’t this inherently wrong? To glorify any political leader in a free country like this, especially such an offensive one? Maybe I should invest in another country and start a family there, some place that I know will be a constructive, healthy place to live for generations. But, then I think about the dominance and influence the US has and that I may never escape this feeling I have."
119,I want to talk to my friends but I'm too shy...,"Everytime I am asked about how I'm doing I always answer that I'm fine but I am not. I will feel a little better sometimes but I'm not fine. My mind will always have a way of questioning a lot of things around me and how I didn't achieve any progress with my life this year and I'm scared that I'm getting left behind.

My friends and I have a chat room but I didn't participate in their talks because I was feeling so down and out of place. I also don't want to bother them with my feelings because I think I'm being ao dramatic since they usually have lively/funny talks in our chat. I don't want to bother them especially with the pandemic going on. They probably have their own problems to deal with so I don't want to bring the mood down there. But right now, I don't feel ok. I want to talk to them but I'm feeling shy after months of almost complete silence. Not to mention, I don't even know how to start a conversation with them anymore. (We were separated when I moved out for university)

I don't even know where this post is going, I'm sorry. Can I just have a request? Can you please share something with me? Like, what do you enjoy doing right now? Is there something that frustrated you today? Tell me something your passionate about right now? Something funny that you encountered today? Just anything under the sun that you would like to share. I will really appreciate it. I just want to take my mind off things. Thank you."
120,Does anybody know what this could possibly be?,I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time but it’s starting to get much worse. I experienced sexual abuse at a young age and I was never given proper counseling or therapy. Anyways the point i’m trying to get at is over the years into my teens  that when i’m emotionally overwhelmed I start screaming and crying hysterically. This has happened around 5 times my entire life and i’m not sure why I have these outburst so I wanted to know if anybody else had a similar experience just so I can pin point the problem.
121,The world would be a better place if I was gone,"The world would be better if I was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm diagnosed with depression, and it feels like I'm just a numb robot who sees/hears things that aren't there and believe that people are trying to hurt me with barely any evidence. I have a feeling that if I tell anyone about my problems, they'll blame it on my meds (I take fluoxetine).

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my mom I heard things, she says it's ""just my conscience"" but I'm not sure about it. I hear whispering and whenever I do something, they say ""OP is (says what I'm doing)."" and they say hurtful things. The things I see are something you'd see out of a creepypasta and horror movies.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason why I'm still alive and breathing is because of my crush. Even so, love is just an emotion that just shatters you into a million pieces."
122,"Is it possible, that my anxiety makes me confuse romantic feelings with wanting to be liked?","I have a friend, who has borderline and a couple weeks ago, she was really mean to me, I disassociated the entire day, and couldn’t go to school the next day, cuz I had panic attacks and was really down. She just said some things which really triggered me. But then a few days later, I started craving her affection, like I always wanna hug her, and be with her, and all these things you feel when you have a crush on someone. But I‘m just really not sure, if this is my unhealthy need to be liked, or if I actually like her like that"
123,Can drugs ruin your brain?,"I'm 26 (M) and I've used a lot of drugs since I was 20, Marihuana, Alcohol, Mushroms, MDMA and DMT, I quit everything but alcohol about a year ago but I keep feeling very depressed, I have a job, a car, a gf, life is ok but i keep feeling down no matter what, I always have anxiety and my hands shake a lot, I have a lot of trouble to been able to sleep amd when I manage to do it I have nightmares and I keep thinking ia because of all the drug abuse, I had 3 really bad trips, and 1 was with DMT, what fo you think?"
124,I'm so done and I can't reach out because I'm scared that exposing people to my thoughts will make them think about what I'm thinking and I'll end up causing everyone to kill themselves,I don't know if I'm looking for help or just ranting but I don't want to keep doing this
125,"If I'm not controlling the conversation, I have difficulties following and participating in the conversation!","Maybe the titel isn't that clear but what I want to say is that I found out that I need to begin the conversation or I need to control it by choosing the topic, deciding what to talk about in that topic...
If I'm not starting the conversation myself, I feel like I'm not part of the conversation and I keep out of it and showing signs of 'interest' from time to time just so they don't question me If I'm really listening or not. 
The only way to keep me active in the conversation is by letting me talk or to ask me questions, otherwise I'm taking a step back. 
Just now I had an online call chat and I figured out that the longer I wasn't talking, the less I was in the mood to talk as I didn't know what to say and didn't control the conversation! 

Hopefully someone goes through the same as me and can help me out as it's really bothering me."
126,Taking a toll on my health,"My ex and I have been broken up for almost 3 months. This last week I saw on his fb that he changed his profile pic and his relationship status to being in one. The break up has been brutal for me but he doesn’t know that nor care. He only talks to me when I reach out. He told me how happy he is with this girl and I can it’s really serious because they’ve met each other families and have known each other for years. I already still have panic attacks every morning since the break up. Since hearing this news, I now have no appetite, can’t sleep. I feel weak and hungry, but throw up the food, and my anxiety has worsened. I’m honestly not sure what to do and where to go for help."
127,"My boyfriends ex is some kind of narcissist and is making him suffer, how can I help?","Hi. This is a very long story. I will try my best to make it short without missing important points. 

I have been with my boyfriend for around two years now. When we got together, he was still living with His ex - but it was clear for both of them that they are not in a relationship anymore. The reason they still lived together was their child and the house they were still paying off. And I guess maybe some hope that someday it'll get better which it didn't.

To make matters more uncomfortable, we all worked in the same company at that time.

When she found out about him being in a relationship everything went downhill. It started with her threatening me at work. She started to be violent against him (hitting him, hoping he would hit back so she can sue him). She stalked me, standing in front of my apartment several times. Calling literally houndreds of times. Sometimes over 40 times a day. She stole my number from his phone which she looked into everytime she could. I moved into a bigger flat in march this year and even then, she stood at my door a few weeks after. She then lost her job because it came to light that she stole my adress from company data. This of course was all my fault in her opinion.

Many crazy things have happened that make me think she has some sort of narcisstic personality disorder. She was trying to manipulate me and him in many many ways, she was violent, she once even threatened to kill herself out of pure manipulation. She was literally following us in her car across the whole city for almost an hour until my boyfriend managed to lose her. She tried to turn people at work against me. She went to her supervisor, crying about how everyone mean to her at work because of me even though she caused all the fuzz herself.

It all ended ugly a few month ago when she was again hitting him violently and he finally pushed her away from him to protect himself. She then pretty much threw herself at something to hurt herself, ran to the neighbours, acting like she was beaten up. A few days later police escorted my boyfriend out of is own house because she sued him.  
She now moved out and took the kid with her since he cannot take care of him because of his job. She does because she is unemployed now so she got the right to get the kid. She now just tries to ruin him. She tries to get as much money from him as she can get. She is still acting the victim, fooling the authorities. She is trying to keep the kid away from him, not caring about that childs well being at all. She is still manipulating, she is playing tricks to make him look bad. She wants to see him lose the house which he has worked really hard for. She is just disgusting and bitter.

I just don't know what to do to help my boyfriend. I sued her for stalking but police doesn't seem to give a fuck even though I provided many evidences. Even a video where she was standing at my front door, trying to violently grab my phone out of my hand.

I see his  mental health going down while all of this is happening and I don't know what to do about it. There is nothing I can to to help with the situation. I am myself mentally unstable (depression, slight anxieties) and struggle with this a lot. It makes it harder to be always there for him.

His life dreams are pretty much destroyed by this disgusting narcisstic person. Who can blame him for being down. I just want to help him."
128,Mother in law always insults me,"I’ve always had a bit of a strained relationship with my mother in law, I’m quite edgy, with piercings, and wear ripped jeans etc, she’s very prim and proper, and much preferred my husbands ex to me. 

Anyway, today is her birthday, we all came over and I cooked her a special birthday lunch, seeing as we can’t all go out together. Anyway, I was saying how I’m going to get my upper lobes pierced, as it looks quite elegant, she said she was glad that’s all I’m getting done, and she doesn’t understand why I have my lip or my septum pierced. I said, it’s just because I like them, she said, and I quote..

”I don’t understand why you’d want them to though, they’re disgusting *pretend heaved*... honestly, that one in your nose, you just look like a pig! It’s revolting, and the lip one *dry heaves again*, why do you want to look so unattractive for?”

I don’t want to cause an argument on her birthday, as I’ll be portrayed as the bad guy again, so I just said, oh well, everyone is entitled to their opinions I guess. She said all this infront of my 3 year old too. 

She often tells me I’m looking a little chubby, (I’m a size 8-10, and used to be a size 6)... when I was a size 6 she used to mock me and say things like, will you actually be eating anything tonight? Or are you just starving yourself again? 

If I lose weight she asks if I’m starving myself to get skinny again. Regardless of what I’m actually doing to lose weight. 

I’m feeling so upset, I’ve taken myself off to another room while my husband, kids and in laws play a game in the other room. No one even cares that I’m not in the room.  

I can’t say anything because my husband seems to think I should just ignore it and not be so sensitive. But it hurts me. There was no reason to insult me, I put so much effort into making sure her birthday is special, and if I didn’t I know my husband wouldn’t. 

Am I just being stupid? Maybe my piercings really are awful 😞"
129,I need validation from strangers,"I’m a really independent female and in no way want a serious relationship. I sometimes acquire friends with benefits but often times we meet up once, it goes really well, then they either ghost me, take ages to reply or make no real effort to see me again. All I want is for them to straight up say they don’t want to meet up anymore but they just mess me around instead. When this happens, I forget about them and move on with my life, but sometimes the feeling of being ignored and not getting the validation I want really hurts me.

I did mention this to a therapist but didn’t go into much depth about it and my therapy sessions have ended now."
130,Little sister is depressed and on medication. She’s struggling academically but refuses any help. What can I do?,"English isn’t my first language so bear with me please.

My [24F] little sister [18] is in high school but lost a few years of schooling to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Last year I took it upon myself to take her to a doctor and she’s been on antidepressants for over a year now. She’s now back in school but is still struggling to keep up with her school work. I offered to help her study and she initially agreed. My mother tells me she hasn’t been attending her classes (online due to COVID) for about a week. I tried to approach her directly and asked if she still wants us to study together for her math test that’s taking place tomorrow. She changed her mind and is adamantly refusing any help. I asked why and she said “I don’t know why you still believe in me. Out of 7 tests I’ve taken, I had a good mark only on one. I’ve tried everything and I’m finally giving up”. I tried to convince her that there are still other ways she might not have tried and that I would be with her every step of the way. I even have her textbooks downloaded on my tablet and I read her lessons whenever she has a test so that I can answer her questions and help her study. She told me about some paid video lessons online and I happily paid for her and told her not to worry about the money. Our brother [21] also offered to help; she told him to not even bother because she’s “a failure”. I considered that her school might be the problem but when I asked my mother, she said that her teachers were very cooperative and even offered to evaluate her only on the remainder of the semester so that she wouldn’t lose huge chunks of her grades.

It may be worth mentioning that she has a history of recurrent relapse while on medication and has recently been put on a different antidepressant.

I’m at a loss. My mother is at a loss. We don’t want her to lose her future. I don’t know what to do."
131,Mental Health with Job Search and COVID,"I just wanted to check up on everyone. It's been a tough time throughout here in the United States. I think everything has just been stacking on each other and it affects my mental health greatly: COVID, the current election, and to add to that, I'm a new graduate in the healthcare industry (Physical Therapist) looking for employment for around \~3 months now.

So my questions for you all are: 

1. What do you do to keep your mental health sane?
2. How have these external factors (COVID/Elections) affected you and your family/friends?
3. How are you really feeling right now? 

Hope you all have a lovely day guys, we will get through this :D"
132,Self sabotage and other problems,"Kind of given up on myself, don’t have any goals or dreams and am slugging through studying I don’t like but have to do. Living but dying on the inside. Feel behind on everything and like I took a wrong turn in life and there’s no u-turn in sight. Mostly, I feel alone. 

Anytime I think to myself to want to get better, I shut that down with: what’s the point, I’m not going to feel better, I’m always going to reminded of my past failures, and life is never going to be as good as I thought it to be. 

I realize maybe shutting my self down is a coping mechanism for trying to be in control. I also realize ive forgotten so much of my recent years. I don’t recognize myself fully and feel like a character in everyone else’s life, and non existent in my own. 

I’ve realized maybe another coping mechanisms is to indulge in my own pity as a form of validation. I don’t know how to get out of this one. People say reach out and talk to others about your problems, but I‘m realizing I don’t want to be the seen as pitiful anymore. And no one is interested in that.

I also feel abandoned and alone. And this reinforces feelings of low worth. So why invest in myself. This is where I self sabotage as well. For example I want to buy nice clothes for myself and indulge in a hobby of creating things but then think what’s the point if I can’t share it with anyone or have anyone else appreciate it? So any motivation is just squashed. 

The only coping mechanism left is to just power through life at the bare minimum with no thought but to survive. But that isn’t working out either. 

I’m not suicidal but I feel that I understand a little of how someone might feel.  It feels like no one in the world truly understands or can help. 

I guess one of my questions would be how to do things for myself without external validation?"

135,Losing interest in masturbation,"Here is my dilemma:

I used to masturbate quite a lot(about 3-4 times a week) while sexting a new women every week. Used to spend tons of hours, edging during this process and oozing pre cum.

Now I seem to have lost interest in masturbation and general sex drive over the past month or two.

I have not talked to anyone in real life in over 5 years and counting. If it were not for social media, I think it would be the same for me to live in solitary confinement.

138,"Graduation pressure, I want to jump out of the window","Hi guys, may I have a question?
How do you generally deal with intensive stress?
I need a little help. You see, because of the virus, we were in school for only about one month and I will be graduating this year. My field has this long-term project in which we search for external work (like Chemistry, Physics, Biology, ect.) and work on it for about two years.
I was working on it for said two years, but I was measuring and writing down data.
The thing is, I only have the introduction, I have to study for the finals and it's taking its toll on me. I feel extremely anxious when I'm not studying, I can't sleep, I don't want to eat and my dad is acting as if I was sitting on my butt the whole time. Our teacher should have sent us some tips about how to write said work, but didn't send anything. It's supposed to have 20 to 30 pages and I don't know how to do anything. 
My parents aren helping me either with stress, mom yells at me for everything and wants me to move out and as I said, my dad thinks I do nothing and said that they will not accept me on any university and that I'll fail, because supposedly there either smart and rich or poor and stupid  people.
He acts as if I won't graduate at the first try, I'm useless, because of course we can't fail.
I just want to breathe and be okay, but if I won't be able to graduate, I'm useless for this society and I can go dig myself a grave or jump out of the window.
Please just tell me what to do.
Best wishes in these trying times"
139,app that would help therapy?,"hello everyone! I hope this is okay to post here, feel free to let me know if it's not appropriate.

I'm looking for an app that would track my mood and dreams and that I could input my feelings in. my therapist would appreciate a report of that info. I need something with nice interface but no sad smiley faces. I would really appreciate if the app would send me push notifications to remember to write down my feelings and also if it would ask me questions or show me several options to choose from.

I was looking around and read a lot about daylio and I think that's not the right thing for me. 

what else is there for me?

So much anxiety, all I can do is lie there and cry and think about all the ways I’m a fuck up.

I’m feel like I’m incapable of being objective in any situation. My brain is so fucked up I have no idea if I’m being irrational or not. I feel like no one takes me seriously until I get mad, and then it’s like, “Oh my goodness, why are you so angry? :::clutches pearls::::” As if I haven’t been calmly trying to explain myself this whole time.

I’m just so tired. I don’t know what to do anymore."
144,"Struggling a lot with several anxiety disorders lately, unsure of what to do to feel better :(","I (22F) have 4 pretty severe anxiety disorders that have affected me for most of my life. They all kind of go together, but the technical diagnoses are Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, and Panic Disorder. While I know it's quite common that these disorders all cohabitate, I often notice them separately in the way they affect my every day life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some bursts of time are better than others, but during the last month I've been really starting to crack...I've become so sad and depressed because of the severity of my symptoms. I don't smoke or drink anymore and I also don't take medications because of the negative side effects for me, but I am in therapy and work very hard on the cognitive side of dealing with the symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Some particularly disturbing symptoms lately have been:

\- extreme episodes of decrealization, often triggered while at work, in the shower, or driving, which leads into panic attacks most of the time

\- Intense intrusive thoughts and recurring compulsions to cope with them that I haven't had since I was younger

\- Bad, bad anxiety....so bad that I have trouble eating and sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so ashamed and burdensome to people around me whenever I talk about how much I'm struggling, so I try to mask everything.

I've cried myself to sleep almost every night this week and first thing in the morning for so many mornings this month....I'm so tired and just want to feel better.

What are some non-medication practices you recommend to get myself out of this funk?"
145,idk what to call this im just struggling,"i dont know where to start im just so tired of myself. i dont have the energy to get up or do anything except play games or mindlessly scroll through instagram. i dont like how i look as much as people tell me im pretty or that i have a good body i dont see it i see everything wrong with myself, my nose is too long, my teeth are slightly crooked, my skin isnt completely clear, my hair is too short etc etc. i know its stupid to compare myself to all these models that get themselves professionally done but i still do it . 

i can feel my mental health sliding, im scared of going back to the psych ward or to rehab, they both fucking sucked and i hated everyone there. i dont even necessarily wanna die i just wanna cease to exist if that makes sense. i worry that i annoy everyone even if i know that i dont i worry that i do, or that my friends secretly dislike me.

im stressed about the arts academy , i love art and i know im good at it but i don't know if im good enough to get in. i also need a character and art recommendation and the only art teacher ive ever had hated me. as for character i don't know who to ask.

im struggling with remembering things, i cant tell if things happened as i remember it or if im making myself the victim (last october-november alot of fucked up stuff happened) ive been making an effort, im clean of self harm for a year in november, clean of drugs in february but theres times i wanna relapse

im really just struggling because i dont know who to talk to i feel like i cant tell people shit ive tried before but it didnt go well 

anddd i hide all this by being 1) a sarcastic asshole 2) doing stupid shit like picking fights over small things or exploring meth dens and crack houses 3) staying in my room and doing nothing all day. yes i know none of this is okay but its how i am and honestly i dont have the energy to improve myself which i guess makes me a shitty person. 

i dont know if anyone actually cared enough to read this but yeah that's pretty much it"
146,Scared of 2021,"Soo this year has been so hell for me, last year of my high school, tested positive for covid, my first ever girlfriend took her life and passed away, my gramps passed away, tried moving on and got played, grades are getting down and I got no motivation at all.

I have to score 95%+ in my finals to get a good college thus family pressure. I myself tried to take my own life twice after I got to know what happened to my late gf.

I cry to sleep almost every single night. It's just so cold, numb and empty. I am so scared of stepping into next year after whatever happened this year. I don't got any friends and family demotivates me so no point in talking to them. If any of you got any tips how I can cope up then please share, it's my humble request."
147,Is there a fine line?,"So after recently getting married and moving in with my husband I'm starting to feel like I might be doing like 95% of the work constantly. Now prior to marriage I had a pretty good idea of this happening as my husband does have depression. But see now that's the thing, as I respect that completely (I have anxiety and depression as well so to a great extent I get it) I don't know how lenient I may be being due to it? Like even if our housework or whatever isn't 50/50 I'd take 60/40 or just a little more on his part but I don't know if I'm pushing limits then. I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. But also, I guess it can be hard taking the role of both a working woman and a housewife where I might get overwhelmed and panicky and accidentally trigger him. Any and all advice is much appreciated!"
148,What happens if i take alot of my meds? I don’t like myself at all.,"15m. i am prescribed adderall for my ADHD and lexapro for my anxiety. What will happen if i just take a bunch of them? I took like 2 lexapro and 1 adderall yesterday and i felt kinda sick. Idk. 

I just don’t like myself at all and yeah. I’m kinda really depressed and we are going on a lockdown again but we still have to go to school as well as do exams. I just can’t do this anymore. I hate myself as it is now school is getting me even more down and now lockdown. 

I just can’t do this anymore. I want to die. I’m a burden to everyone. I can’t do anything right. I don’t want to call anyone because they will probably not care. 
I’m just crying again because i’m just thinking about the bad stuff people say to me, such as “k*ll yourself” and “stupid” and stuff like that. I’m worthless and i know i am. I want to end myself like they tell me to. They are better than me i know they are. 

I’m sorry for everything."
149,There's a level of depression you can be at where everyone just gets bored of you after a while...,"I don't blame people for not wanting to spend much time with me. I can be a bit of a drain, or a ""dark cloud"", as my father described me not too long ago. The thing is that if I was just a bit worse than I've been feeling lately, everyone would be trying to help me. Everyone wants to be the person to talk you off of a ledge or to put the razor away, and you can be sure as shit if you did actually top yourself, you'd become the best person ever to have lived, but, when you're not at that stage, no one really even cares, as long as you're not bothering them any.

For me, that's the worst part about depression, when you just have to feel sorry for yourself, because no one else is really going to give a shit. Sometimes I'd rather feel just that little bit worse in order to have people notice me, than to coast along at a solid three out of ten everyday. Nothing really to look forward to, but nothing bad enough to motivate you to do anything drastic about the situation.

Covid sucks balls, is basically what I came here to write but didn't until now. It's sapping the life out of everyone, even most neuro-typicals are struggling with life right now. It fucking sucks to feel just that wee bit worse than everyone else does, everyday."
150,Anyone here taking Ketamine to treat bipolar?,I read a lot about this ketamine infusions and some good results to treat depression. Has anyone here being treated it with Ketamine? How do you feel? How long did it take you to see the benefits? How often do u week the infusions and how long does the benefits last?
151,23 yrs i'm considering suicide and counting month 29 with it,"Great month. I'm so much in debt that i Wil have nothing. I can't go on like This it will never change. I Want to do it. Rather die than starve. Being lonely. I'm so careless. That i don't care. I'm a loser, 23 yrs and a loser. I have nothing. 

Can't even express myself someone fkkng help me talking to someone don't help me i Can't sleep or anything i think about money 24/7 it's been like This For years i can't take this bs anymore. Why Can't i just live i'm not greedy or anything idk what i Will do. Why Can't no one help me. Why.

We people are useless and I'm useless you are useless. Raping someone? Does it matter? Rly does it matter, so tired. I'm gonna have some joy in 10 days i will have nothing. Nothing nothing nothing nothing. Maybe i should eat well and Don't think About and kill the debt collecter. Invite him in and kill him. What do i have to lose honestly? Prsion seems Better. Then someone might kill me. For free."
152,Why am I sad?,"Every day at like 6pm and later I get sad out of no where, everyone in my family asks why and what is wrong and I don’t have an answer it just happens I get down and even sometimes feel like crying and there is no reason. Anybody have a clue why this could be? It’s always evening into the night busy or bored, I had a bunch of family over and I was a total damper just laying down feeling sad."
153,just a vent,"for Halloween, I had a plan I was really looking forward to which included hanging out with my friends and taking pictures. I dressed the nicest I’ve ever dressed in my life, and everyone was being super supportive of me, and that made me feel the best I’ve felt in years. I come home and I see a post that the girl who rejected me (who I am still not over) made, and she looked STUNNING. Everyone was complimenting her, even my own friends. And this just shattered my self-confidence completely, and I deleted all the pictures I took. There was no way I could stack up to her in any way, shape, or form. There is no category in life where I’m doing better than her. She’s better than me in every aspect. I had been looking forward to this Halloween for months, and she managed to out-do me with zero preparation. I feel so foolish for ever believing I ever had a chance. And just to make matters worse, I hear from one of my good friends that he spent Halloween night cuddling with a girl he met (and I am proud of him for that), but it was just the reminder about how lonely I am that I didn’t need. This is the lowest I’ve felt in a really long time, and that’s just something I felt like I wanted to get off my chest."
154,Deep rooted pain,"Most days are manageable. Most days I can push against the pain and be strong. And then there are the days where the pain becomes nearly too much to deal with. It fills my chest, pushes against my lungs, and takes everything out of me. It makes me feel helpless, and it make me lose hope. 
My thoughts and feelings become even more confusing, and understanding then is impossible. It feel like nothing could bring peace or relief. Talking about what I feel is just as difficult as understanding it. Even when I truly want to open up to someone, I just can’t. Something stops me and I physically can not speak about the crushing pain I feel. 
I instinctively do what I can to hide it and appear normal. I laugh and crack jokes. I go about life as if nothing is wrong, and yet inside I’m crumbling beneath the gravity of the pain I feel. 
Of course I can’t pinpoint the cause. Best I can say is that life is painful. How do you explain this to someone who has never felt this pain? How could they possibly understand that there is no single cause, no one answer, no fix for it? And how can I possibly ask someone to walk this path with me? To open themselves to this darkness in order to help me? How could I possibly express what I feel?"
155,"Are ""voluntary"" programs more restrictive in practice?","I ask this because I have found any inability or unwillingness to cooperate in their treatments or disagreement with their methods is met with being shown to the door.

Context. I am in treatment for SI currently and I am asked repeatedly if I am 'better' when I answer honestly that each passing day bring ideation closer to planning and execution. I am inevitably asked ""then why are you here?"" and I believe they assume since I am not getting better I must not be adhering to their plan, I am, I try too, I simply am unable to help myself which seems a prerequisite to receiving help in an environment like this.

To be there is a difference between treatment resistant and obstinance, they are seemingly interchangeable to them."
156,"Who diagnoses mental issues, psychologist (psychotherapist) or a psychiatrist?","I am in a foreign country and sort of interest in having an official set of diagnoses for my mental illnesses, but I only have access to a psychotherapist, and only a few sessions.

Is this enough?"
157,"What is stress, really? Talking chronic stress w/ Dr.Sonia Lupien- Hashtag Health Podcast","**HH:** So let's start off by asking you to introduce yourself, what you do and what you study.

**SL:** My name is Sonya Lupien. I'm a research scientist. I'm the director of the center for studies on human stress. And I'm studying the effects of stress on the human brain. 

**HH:** And then I'd also like to start by just doing defining stress so it can mean many things to different people. So maybe just defining what it means in your research and I guess maybe how it differs from chronic stress.

**S:** Yeah. So the public definition of stress, when you ask her members of the public, most people will tell you that stress is time pressures. So we feel stressed, when we don't have the time to do all the things we would like to do in the allocated period of time. 

Well for us, uh, scientists in the field of stress, this is not stress. This is not the definition of stress. Because if it was, how could you explain that you're stressed out when you're going, for example, to the dentist and no one's going to throw you on a chair, but still you're stressed out? Or when you learn about the, you know, the disorder of your mother, there's no “stress” and still you're stressed out.

So the measures we’re using in the science of stress, we're using the biological response to stress. And this allowed us to much better understand what entails this stress response. So basically what it means is that your brain is a detector of threatening information. That's the job of your brain. So when your brain detects a threat that we call a stress, it will activate a cascade, you know, an endocrine axis called the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, because it involves three regions. 

The hypothalamus, which will produce a CRF, which is a hormone which will go to the pituitary gland telling the pituitary gland to produce a CTH, which will go then into the bloodstream, reach two small glands located on top of your kidneys that we call the adrenal gland, telling them to produce glucocorticoids and catacholamines adrenaline, noradrenaline, which are basically the stress hormones.

And once this is done, you will produce the stress response, meaning you will mobilize energy to have enough energy to do the only two things you can do in front of a threat. You can either fight or get away, if you know the threat is too big. Surviving for the hunt for example."
158,Tips to avoid being overly conscious,"Being overly conscious has always been a problem of mine. Now that I've experienced being home for 6 months because of the lockdown, I feel like it got worse. **I cannot fulfill my tasks when I feel like someone's watching me when I'm not even sure if they really are.** I choose to just not do anything rather than feel that way. Most of the time I mess things up when I proceed to doing something when someone's watching me. Now that I think about it, I lost a lot of opportunities because of it. I cannot really control it. Do you have any suggestions as to what I could do to lessen this feeling if I cannot eliminate it?"
159,"am lost, right?","Hi! 

Please respect this post huhu.

I'm 21 (pan guy; closeted) and no relationship since birth.

I think I am problematic because when someone suddenly cares for me (which by the way his personality to care for other people), I easily get affected haaaaaaaay. I liked it, however, I don't know how to deal with this 'cause I know and he knows that we're only 'friends'. It was hard (somehow) for me 'cause I have an attraction for him the first time I saw him and I know he has a past that I don't want to be ruined. It was hard in a way that it's kinda impossible to be part of his life, that we're just 'friends' / 'workmates'. I don't have the courage to say this to him because I also value the friendship we have built. Should I stop talking to him? Because whenever I chat him, I always feel the happiness, the care (that I am long for), but I feel like I am doing it wrong, pretending to be just friends (when in fact, I find him very attractive personally) and also feel like I am being bad to his past re not respecting that he lost (literally) his last partner (btw I am attracted to him first before I knew his story).

Is this infatuation? Should I focus on myself? Should I love myself more?

160,I seem to always want to hurt myself. Possible trigger warning.,"I've had self harm urges for years, but usually it's deep scratching or cutting my forearms. It's been especially bad this year. I thought it was my antidepressants, I would have strong urges to overdose on meds, Nyquil, alcohol, etc. Sometimes I have taken a bunch of meds to harm myself. 


I just started new meds two weeks ago, and for a few days I've had really bad urges to take all 3 bottles of my meds. Why does this keep happening? I feel like a horrible, evil person."
161,How has stress changed for us since our ancestors? Talking chronic stress w/ Dr.Sonia Lupien- Hashtag Health Podcast,"**HH:** I'd like to touch a bit more on the evolution of the stress response and how it evolved versus how it's being activated today. Would you say that we're more stressed than our ancestors were? 

**SL:** Many people ask me whether we are more stressed than our ancestors were. Well, they had different stressors than we had because in order to answer this question, it is highly important to distinguish between two types of stressors: absolute and relative stressors

An absolute stressor is a real truth for everyone. For example, someone comes in my house and says, FIRE!. And we're not going to start talking, I'm going to start running and get out of this house to save my life. So this is an absolute stress. Now we have a problem because we don't have a lot of absolute stress, nowadays in our countries.

We are in very rich countries, educated, healthy. And yet, the world health organization predicts that by 2020, which is now, depression related to chronic stress, will be the second cause of invalidity in the world after cardiovascular disorders that are related to stress. Well, this didn't make sense for us scientists because in the entire history of humanity, humans have never been in such high level of security. There's no more mammoths! You know, there's no more big, you know, animals chasing us. And yet many, many of us are suffering from stress. And we now know that it is because these stressors that surround us now are relative.

162,Should I tell my fiancé about my psychosis,"Hi everyone so I had psychosis for the first time that lasted 2/3 months, this was 2 years ago. I am now completely off medication now and have fully recovered with no symptoms. 

Back then I was very unwell and had to stay in hospital for months. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illness just first time psychosis.

I am now engaged and I am not sure if I should tell them about my previous psychosis. The most I have told them is that I have struggled with mental health before but it wasn’t major like anxiety.

Should I tell them or just keep it to myself and move on as it doesn’t affect me anymore. Please any advice will be appreciated :)"
163,"Can hardly think, imagine, remember, etc.","It's like my brain is off, the functions inside don't want to work, no matter how much I try. Thinking about things, about anything? Nope, most of the time it's just running over the same things, but little to no real thought, searching, etc. Imagining and visualizing things? Pfft, nope, I know I have the fundamental ability, but my brain just won't, I might get a brief, very blurry, mish mashed image, but that it's. Not to mention that I can barely think about what to visualize in the first place. My memory, I used to have a photographic memory, I think I still do, the problem is that even though things are still being remembered, it's like my access to the ""files"" has been cut off, so in practice I can't remember things. On occasions they work a little better, but overall it's so bad that it impairs my ability to function. I want to work as an artists/illustrator, but these issues almost make it impossible to do these things, and I'm very talented (though just like the above problems, my ability to draw has worsened, or rather my ability to engage that ability has worsened, because sometimes I can, but only briefly). I don't know what causes these issues. I've been diagnosed with Chronic depression, ADHD, Chronic PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder, all of which I think I developed in childhood). I think these have something to do with it, but so far the meds aren't working, and the impairments above make it almost impossible to do therapy because I can't seem to think or remember anything."

My family doesn’t have the money for a therapist and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this.

Hi i'm 16 and i worry that i might have different mental illnesses. I will not say what I think I have because I don't like to self diagnosis because it makes me feel like shit cause there are actually people with those disorders and I don't wanna sound like I'm just trying to be ""quirky"" or like I'm just stereotyping. I feel empty nearly everyday of my life. Not sad. Just empty. On the days I don't feel empty I either feel sad or angry or both. I don't know what to do. I wanna kill myself but I can't seem to do it. I feel like it's the ok only way to get the emptiness to stop. I know what I would do if I was going to kill myself. I actually have backup plans just in case I can't go through with my first attempt. It's not funny but I chuckle at the thought. I also worry that I'm unfeeling. I know I said I feel sad, angry, or empty but the emptiness scares me sometimes. Sometimes I can't stand hearing people cry. I know how to manipulate people to get what I want. I even fake cry sometimes to get what I want. I used to lie on my sister when I was little to get her in trouble alot. I know it's bad but I don't know I can't seem to stop. Sometimes I just say what I know is socially acceptable when I see someone cry or sad. Please help."

168,9 HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA YOU PROBABLY NEVER KNEW ABOUT," **Greater flexibility**

 The yoga routine includes muscle-strengthening poses. After just eight weeks of regular yoga practice, some people have noticed a 35% increase in flexibility! No matter what level of yoga you are practicing, you are holding poses that you inhale and exhale over and over again, which can increase your flexibility. 

 **More happiness**

 Several thinking activities can improve mental health, but yoga is useful. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that people who meditate have more activity in the brain’s left prefrontal cortex. Increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex was associated with a higher sense of well-being.

According to these findings, the most effective postures to improve mental health focus on relaxation. Try sitting on a lotus flower or practicing the King of the Dance pose as part of your yoga routine."
169,"To the people who reach out, thank you.","I was feeling horrible and hopeless and my dear friend from high school called me, we had not talked in months. When I picked up the phone, I felt an overwhelming sensation of sadness and started crying. It felt absurd because it felt out of now where. I am so thankful that he was so understanding and made me feel better despite his own hardships. We talked and I felt so much better. He made me realize the importance of keeping in touch with good friends and reaching out. I now feel motivated to finish my assignments and complete my to do list."
170,Presidential Election,"This upcoming election has me sick to my stomach. I don't see it going well either way. Trump wins, 4 more years of Trump. Trump looses, he'll find a way to get it to the Supreme Court he now has under his thumb and get in office again anyway. Even if he looses by a huge majority and can't possibly convince enough people that he should have won, I can picture his supporters doing something extreme in protest. 

Part of me actually hopes we fall down a hole and erupt into chaos. Don't we deserve it for letting this country become this corrupt and unsustainable for the average person? Our employee rights, healthcare system, and general human morals are shit compared to just about every other well established county and even quite a few we'd call ""third world."" I feel like that's why mental health is atrocious here too. We have a society that breeds anxiety and depression through high pressure expectations, and then fails to provide any kind of adequate support for these issues unless you can afford the high cost. It's a problem that's only going to get worse until the whole thing collapses anyway, so that's why I almost hope it happens sooner rather than later.

I don't usually talk about politics but I think this election is going to determine the direction of the country for a long time since we've put the executive branch on a godlike pedestal it has no right being on because I guess checks and balances don't mean anything anymore to the American people. I think the results of this election are going to drastically effect the mental health of millions long term and we need to think about that."

I have them for 2 months.

Voices say that they related to aliens, other people thoughts, hypnotics programs in subconscious and lie to me in various ways about what they are. One say they can see me through my eyes but not related to me. Other can read my thoughts.

172,Dealing with Digital Self-Harm and Possible Eating Disorders as a Trans Woman,"I'm a 20 year old transgender woman living in DFW, Texas, who's dealing with...quite a lot of pain. I'm also not typical for a trans woman in that I self-identify as autogynephilic (AGP). ""What the heckin heck does that mean?"" you may ask. Well, AGP is a range of sexual and emotional attachments to onesself as a woman. It first manifested as transvestic fetishism early in puberty and gradually evolved into pretty severe gender dysphoria.

Most of the time, I think of myself as a woman, in normal social day-to-day interactions. But sometimes, I think that I'll be found out as a fake woman trying to creep into women's spaces with my vain attempts at an alto voice and vaguely female mannerisms I've picked up from my friends. When I allow myslef to think of myself as a woman, not trans not cis, I feel great. My self-ssteem is through the roof. I feel like I can go about day-to-day activities and tasks worry-free.

But then, I have become addicted to going onto twitter and intentionally searching out posts that will trigger me and I gaslight myself into thinking that I'm nothing but a sad man pretending to be a woman so that he can feel good about himself. I've become addicted to forcing myself to listen to sad stories of detransitioning and planting in my mind that I'm a perverted sex freak who's primary motivation is well and truly to hurt women.

This bully in the back of my mind has always thought these things, but to see them validated by TERFs or other AGP trans women leads me to view myself as a disgusting abusive human being for daring to steal the valor of women who have to deal with shit like the patriarchy, periods, and childbirth.

My self-loathing has gotten so bad that I will not have the energy to cook myself dinner. I've lost about 10 pounds in the last month not of my own volition. I've always struggled with weight. At my worst point, I was 180 pounds (5'11"") and I'm now down to 148. I've dealt with stress eating or just plain not having the mental energy to cook myself food for my entire life.

I've started seeing a life coach who is also a trans woman who self-identifies as AGP. I look at her and I see someone who has learned to deal with her pain. I see someone that can literally go into the supermarket, be called ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" and be okay with either outcome, because she accepts herself, knows who she is, and who gives a shit what anyone else thinks? That's the goal I have. I want to be in a place where I can functionally in society just be a woman, internalize that, and be okay with that.

Now that I've started dealing with my shame from AGP, I want to begin the process of accepting myself unconditionally and not giving a shit what anyone else thinks."

I’ve called three times &amp; not heard back. 

My doctor says I fit the bill for Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar, &amp; PTSD. He’s never given me an actual diagnosis. I’ve never told him about my psychotic episodes. 

It started in my late teens early 20s. Things like hearing music in the back of my head. Or thinking I was hearing my friends say terrible things about me when I left the room. 

I keep reminding myself that those symptoms started BEFORE I attempted suicide in 2012. That’s important. 

Bc as I’ve gotten older, it’s been more like... Delusions than active hallucinations. But yesterday, I really broke.  

I have two active delusions that I have to rationalize myself out of on a semi-regular basis. 

Yesterday I took two big hits off a cart after not smoking marijuana all week (I’m typically a regular smoker) &amp; all hell broke lose in my mind. 

My delusion surrounding my suicide attempt in 2012 came at me in full force. Active hallucinations. I thought I was in the hospital, dying, &amp; being begged to wake up. I just kept saying I don’t know how &amp; describing what I saw around me &amp; asking why I could hear them but not see them. 

When I tried to kill myself, I thought it through. I was watching Spongebob of all things bc the episodes are approximately 11 minutes long &amp; I liked that time frame. After each episode I would eat a handful of ibuprofen. 15-20 pills. I was counting them but not exact. I did this repeatedly until I’d eaten upwards of 100 pills &amp; I figured at that point I was safe &amp; there was no coming back from my decision. I figured staggering the pills would make it impossible for them to just pump my stomach, bc they would be digesting already. I didn’t tell anyone what I was doing. My phone was dying. 

Next thing I know I’m awake &amp; aware I’ve made a huge mistake. I text my abusive boyfriend who’s across the state &amp; tell him to send an ambulance &amp; give him the address. I’m completely coherent. I go to the hospital. I cry a lot &amp; they give me a shot that makes me go to sleep. I wake up &amp; I’m in inpatient. I’m still crying nonstop so they give me another shot. I’m out within a week. 

Years later I got all my medical records from that incident &amp; find that there was no ibuprofen in my system, no damage to my liver, nothing. No drugs of any kind. I was supposed to trip that night but my boyfriend started accusing me of cheating on him &amp; said I couldn’t spend time with those people. So I went home &amp; did what I did. 

Since then I’ve lived with this alternate reality delusion. Am I in a coma? Am I dead? Am I dying? I don’t know. 

Yesterday hit me really hard. 

I have a child. I’m scared. 

I took my child to my mom’s house today. I told my mom vaguely what happened without delving into the nitty gritty of my delusions &amp; hallucinations. 

I keep telling myself that regardless of what is or isn’t real, I’m experiencing life around me &amp; I cannot escape that &amp; I need to do right in this world. 

I’m calling my doctor tomorrow. I see my therapist on Tuesday. Neither of them know I have these problems, but I’m going to tell them. 

I’m scared bc our mental health system is not the best (rural Appalachian US). I’m trying to trust my doctor &amp; trust the system but I’m scared. 

I’m scared for my child. Nothing about my delusions or hallucinations have ever told me to harm myself or others, but obviously I need to be mentally present &amp; rooted in reality to be a parent. 

I’m scared for my future. What if this gets worse? What if it’s real? What if I really did kill myself? 

I told my mom &amp; all I wanted was for her to hold me &amp; tell me we’ll get thru this together but I don’t know why I would ever expect that kind of comfort from her. I love her, but it’s just not who she is. 

I just needed to get all of this out of my system. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know if things will get better or worse. I honestly don’t even care for myself, bc I feel like I deserve this for the pain I’ve caused my family. I just want my kid to be okay."
175,How to come to terms with being a fundamentally unlikable person?,"I have three people on the planet that I would even try calling a friend, and even then I feel like we’re more of acquaintances. Any time I want to spend time with them I always have to be the one to make the first effort, and even then I’ve had the same one of them cancel on me twice in the past week. Second one of them was in town for fun and shopping (we go to different colleges) and didn’t even take 40 minutes out of her day to stop by to see me for coffee, and hasn’t tried to call me just to talk this semester even once. My roommate is friendly with me and we’ll watch TV together but she doesn’t even read 70% of messages I send her and responses to what’s seems like less than half of the ones that she does. It hurts so much to be excited to tell her about a something to do with a shared interest of ours and get no acknowledgment that they were even read, just silence for hours and then “where’s the hairspray” (I’m out of town rn). The person I thought was my best friend, the only person I’ve ever dared open up to that I was terrified of being abandoned, SWORE in long, rambling, poetic messages and speeches how she was nowhere near done being friends with me and I had nothing to fear, but ghosted me without warning at the beginning of this year. Spending any time with my family is extremely awkward because we don’t get along, so I know they only love me because they feel like that have to. Maybe my mom loves me, but that’s because she birthed and raised me for 20 years, not because she likes any fundamental aspect of me as a person, whoever that is.

My roommate has bipolar and has the same fears of being unlovable, but she has a girlfriend who’s constantly pestering her to let her come over, a friend in town who takes the initiative to ask her to hang out at least once a week, and a best friend who gets extremely upset if she goes back to her hometown without stopping by to visit. Her brother loves her and they hang out all the time, talk on the phone for hours.  Strangers will approach her to flirt with her and give her their numbers all the time, even though she has social anxiety. 

I’m not at all trying to downplay her struggles by saying this, but it just raises the question- we both feel fundamentally unlikable, so what’s the difference between her and me? We both have anxiety and are kind of introverted, so why her and not me? We both feel overweight and unattractive, so why her and not me? We both feel this way, but she has data that you point to and say “look these people clearly care about you”. I can point to it when she’s having a meltdown, and she can acknowledge it. But when I finally break, and I say the same fears, she says that’s not true but Iist all of the things above and she just says “I don’t know what to say”. Which is fine, she’s not my therapist, but again, it just confirms my data: there’s no one who truly loves me, and there must be a reason for that, and it must be something deeply wrong with me.

How am I supposed to be happy with that knowledge? I want so badly to be someone who just doesn’t give a shit what people think about her, but I can’t do that. I’m really considering withdrawing and not reaching out to anyone anymore because I don’t think I can handle how much it hurts to be rejected for much longer. I just don’t know why I even try anymore

Obviously I’m sure if I reached out to anyone with these feelings they’d try to comfort me, but I’m sure they’d do that for a fucking stranger too. No one wants to ignore anyone who comes them suffering. It doesn’t mean anything, so I won’t bother with stressing them out like that. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I’m terrified of death but living like this hurts so much, I need to find a way to accept my unlikebility and make peace with it because I have to. There has to be a way to make things better, but for life of me I can’t think of a single thing

I know probably most of y’all won’t read this cuz it’s pretty long and probably not very well written since I’m a little stressed out rn, but I just needed to say it SOMEWHERE. Keeping it inside is destroying me."
176,Health,"Two things drive human actions: necessities — food, sleep, avoidance of pain; and rewards. Any object, event, or activity can be a reward if it motivates us, causes us to learn, or elicits pleasurable feelings. But how do our brains compute the value of a reward and how is that translated into action? The answer lies in the brain circuitry known as the “reward system"
177,I wish I would stop putting effort into my ex who doesn’t want me back.,I’ll get random burts of communication where he’ll talk to me for hours and then nothing I won’t hear from him. He never initiated any conversation with me it’s usually me who will check up on him. He’ll go on about being depressed and anxious and I try to be supportive but he’s not there for me. Earlier this year I told him I still had feelings and he told nicely that he didn’t. He’s not disrespectful to me at all he just doesn’t care and I wish I loved myself enough to stop putting in effort to someone who doesn’t really care.
178,How to be more proud and aware of my accomplishments?,"Hey there,  


I've noticed that I tend to forget about my accomplishments really easy, and when I don't I always slide it off like it was nothing.  


How can I get rid of this, and be more proud of how far I've come? Of course I don't want to get cocky, but at the moment I am the exact opposite of cocky. I would like to be on a level where I'm not cocky, but still more confident.  


Thanks in advance!"

181,How do I stop obsessing over people?," I am having bounding problems along with anxiety. I am a 20 year old girl and I had this problem at it’s peak when I was 16 -when I had someone I really like-. It is not the worst maybe but I don’t really enjoy my life and I think that is the main problem here. Because when someone or a situation makes me happy I start to get obsessed over it. Mostly people though and it can be a romantic relation or not it doesn’t matter. For example I just started to talk to a guy and we mutually like each other, it is an online friend and that doesn’t help the situation because i always get insecure and overthink every single detail. Like he was talking to me all the time for a few days and I was so happy that I kept wishing the time could stop and I could be with him forever and I know it is not healthy to think this. I am always getting too ahead of myself. And today he hasn’t been replying all of a sudden, I understand maybe he is busy or just not in the mood to text, I do but my body and brain resist on not accepting the truth and I keep thinking of negative possibilities all the time. Like if he lost interest and all.. I keep focusing on just him and check my phone every second waiting for his reply. And the heavy feeling sits on my chest and I feel like I am going mad or suffocating. I feel so bad that I even consider cutting contact for once and all because I am always afraid that it won’t end well. Maybe I shouldn’t take things in life this serious but I just can’t help it and if I do this every single time I like someone I am afraid I will end up all alone. That possibility also scares me too. To sum this up I just don’t know how to get rid of this thing, I mean I understand it but still I can’t help and do it… I am so confused and clueless.. I feel so stressed and it is eating me alive.. Also I try to focus on other things but fail inevitably. Do you have any suggestions to me that could help?"
182,Do I stay with my mom or my dad?,"My parents have been split all my life. I would see my dad every other weekend, but since quarantine started I've been able to stay longer at my dads house. But I've started noticing something. I'm happier at my dads house than my mom's. I got into an argument with my mom and she told if I wanted to stay there then I could.  I dont know if I want to. I dont want to stay with my mom but i also dont want to leave them. I really love them but i cant be around them anymore. I'm just really stumped and I don't know what to do. I really dont want to make them feel bad especially my sister. I just really need some help
(Sorry for the bad grammar I'm tired)"
183,Start over?,"I have a problem of just cycling through wanting to settle down into a job, relationship, certain future and just never settling down. Just traveling the world, meeting new people, new experiences, etc. And its just such a major mess cause I can't decide which reality I want more, and that scares me. That not knowing what I want for myself. 

I just think that life is so short, I don't see the point in doing the same thing day in/day out. Like how can you enjoy your life working five, six days a week and only having one or two days to actually do what you want. Some days it depresses me so much that I don't see the point in carrying on. That I just lay around and contemplate just running away and completely starting over. And that is when I become really impulsive and end up destroying my jobs/relationships. And I don't know how to help myself. Sometimes I think im wasn't made for this world, I know its silly and irrational to think that but I just dont understand how everybody is okay with living this way."
184,Missing the mental hospital I was previously at,"Hey all, I keep playing scenarios in my head over and over again about how and what I’d do if I were to return to my previous mental hospital. I’m constantly thinking of ways to go back and what mental illness to have and everything, I miss it there so much and I want to go back and stay there for a long time. What should I do?"
185,I (15M) am having dreams constantly where I attempt to kill my family but I wake up before I actually do,"So for about a a week and a half I’ve been having the same dream. A dream where I tie up and beat my family and I wake up before I kill anyone. 

So yes, I do hate my family. For a lot of reasons, but all the detail I’ll go into is my brother (20M) and dad (53M) were physically and mentally/emotionally. My mom (47F) was just emotionally/mentally abusive. And my other brother (17M) is just annoying. This all happened from the ages of 7-13. 

But I was in therapy after my parents tried to fix their shitty marriage, they forced me into it. This was age 14 to a few months ago. I got out of therapy bc of the rona and one day the therapist had to cancel the appointment and my mom just never rescheduled.  Therapy wasn’t helping tho, but my parents made me go. 

So I still hate my family. I’m signing up for the marines the moment I graduate so I can get out of this house. 

I don’t want to go into detail about the dream but I will if yall find it necessary. Cuz the dream doesn’t scare me or anything. And I don’t think I would ever go through with it, I just don’t think it’s normal to be this way. And I think it could be signs of something. 

I’m suicidal but I always find something to push me through it and to make myself not kms. So yeah I think that’s all yall need to know but I’ll answer anything else that you have questions about. I’m very open about my life whenever it comes to random people on the internet and when I can stay anonymous"
186,Is there something else wrong with me,"*Trigger warning for self harm*

Without going into to great detail, I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and Major depressive Disorder. Across the last 2 years or so I've struggled with self harm, but something I was unable to admit to myself until recently that at times I was causing myself harm to get sympathy.

My symptoms were dismissed by family and friends for a long time and when I started self harming they started to care. Recently I've been doing more damage to myself, trying to get others to understand what I feel inside, but I know how dangerous this is and want to stop.

My doctors say this is normal for depression and I should just choose to stop now that I'm aware of my reason for self harming, but it doesn't feel that simple. Is there something else wrong with me? How can I stop doing this?"
187,"What is stress, really?","**Talking about chronic stress in interview w/ Dr.Sonia Lupien** 

**HH:** So let's start off by asking you to introduce yourself, what you do and what you study.

**SL:** My name is Sonia Lupien. I'm a research scientist. I'm the director of the center for studies on human stress. And I'm studying the effects of stress on the human brain.

**HH:** And then I'd also like to start by just doing defining stress so it can mean many things to different people. So maybe just defining what it means in your research and I guess maybe how it differs from chronic stress.

**SL:** Yeah. So the public definition of stress, when you ask her members of the public, most people will tell you that stress is time pressures. So we feel stressed, when we don't have the time to do all the things we would like to do in the allocated period of time.

Well for us, uh, scientists in the field of stress, this is not stress. This is not the definition of stress. Because if it was, how could you explain that you're stressed out when you're going, for example, to the dentist and no one's going to throw you on a chair, but still you're stressed out? Or when you learn about the, you know, the disorder of your mother, there's no “stress” and still you're stressed out.

So the measures we’re using in the science of stress, we're using the biological response to stress. And this allowed us to much better understand what entails this stress response. So basically what it means is that your brain is a detector of threatening information. That's the job of your brain. So when your brain detects a threat that we call a stress, it will activate a cascade, you know, an endocrine axis called the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, because it involves three regions.

The hypothalamus, which will produce a CRF, which is a hormone which will go to the pituitary gland telling the pituitary gland to produce a CTH, which will go then into the bloodstream, reach two small glands located on top of your kidneys that we call the adrenal gland, telling them to produce glucocorticoids and catacholamines adrenaline, noradrenaline, which are basically the stress hormones.

And once this is done, you will produce the stress response, meaning you will mobilize energy to have enough energy to do the only two things you can do in front of a threat. You can either fight or get away, if you know the threat is too big. Surviving for the hunt for example."
188,Looking for an online tool I used a while ago,"Hello everyone,
I've got a friend going through a rough patch; when I was in a similar place there was an online tool that really helped. It was a short questionnaire, designed to give you key points to talk about when seeing a GP (doctor) which was recommended by my therapist. I honestly can't remember much about it and I can't find it online - if anyone knows what it's called or can point me at something similar I'd really appreciate it!"
189,Why does life buffer?,"I was wondering if anyone on here could give me some guidance on what I’m feeling. Whenever I was a senior in high school I smoked weed for the first time and had a traumatic experience. I smoked way too much and ended up being left alone in my bedroom for several hours thinking I was dying but unable to do anything because my body was twitching. After that night everything changed. A few months had passed since then and I went to college. I remember looking down at my hand and coming to many self aware realizations. The best way to explain my thought patterns is looping constantly. Every realization I had made the segments become more clear. You could see every action lead to the next. My actions moved faster than my brain could comprehend and before I could make a decision. It didn’t even feel like I was in my body but instead half an inch out. It’s not like I’m looking at myself in a third person view or anything like that but instead my perspective slightly changed enough to where I could notice it. Even though my actions seem pre determined they still are right. It’s difficult for me to explain but it reminded me of what it felt like being high even though I hadn’t smoked since my first time. I had two more episodes one caused by hearing words repeated and the other was by becoming self aware that I was trying not to become self aware. After that it stopped for almost a year and it’s back. Currently, I’ve been experiencing these episodes everyday for a couple weeks. I question my own existence as well as others constantly. Sometimes I feel like I died that night and this is just a continuation of what I thought my life was going to be. It’s extremely difficult to explain to people and embarrassing. Whenever I express my emotions I cry before I can even end the first sentence. I’ve yet to tell my psychiatrist about this because I feel like I’m overreacting and it’s not that big of a deal. I’ve only told two of my friends that I trust. I worry about telling others because I fear they will not believe me or worry about me which is not my intention. I tried to get help my freshman year by going to a college counselor and they pushed it under the table and focused mainly on my ADD because they didn’t know how to approach my other problem. I just want to know what I’m feeling and how to try to prevent/control it from happening because it is negatively impacting my life. If you have any questions feel free to ask in comments or in dms if it helps you better understand. I tried to keep it pretty short and left some things out."
190,extreme anxiety from guilt over passed mistakes,"i've always had this problem, but for the past week or so i am haunted by so much anxiety from guilt over past mistakes. such as a time a was rude to somebody, or a time when i was cold to a family member. i have so many of these specific events that constantly come to mind, and i feel so guilty. i doubt the people involved in most of these memories even remember what happened or are still angry about it. i cant even leave my room i'm so scared. im worried these things are going to come back to me and that people think im a bad person. literally every few minutes ill remember one of these memories and feel even worse. even when im not thinking of a specific memory i feel guilt over nothing. what is this??"
191,Why do I hate myself?,Why do I purposefully isolate myself from others so I feel more alone? Why can’t I make or keep friends? Why am I so afraid to be pitied that I’d rather remain alone and unknown?
192,Hating the need to belong or be apart of the cool crowd.....social media sucks.,"I am survivor of childhood abuse. Because of that I wasn’t accepted by my peers in school. I always wanted to belong. But because of my abuse it made me socially awkward and an outcast. I get under estimated a lot. I am an underdog and as an adult I’m still longing for acceptance. Social media doesn’t make it any easier. I have survived and thrive and that should be enough. I worked very hard to get to where I am at. After being fired from job at the Veterinary clinic in 2010. I got fired for not grasping fast enough how to do things their way. I transferred to another clinic to make more money. Big mistake. 

They tired denying my unemployment benefits. But they lost and were told their reason was not valid. I couldn’t find a job in the same field. I tried and no one would give me a chance. So I even tried applying at Arby’s and they wouldn’t hire me. My unemployment was running out and I was getting desperate. So I decided to dance at a club. I hated it. I didn’t fit in and it was a scary place to work at. I saw some fucked up shit. Being a good person in that environment doesn’t earn you any friends or respect. Those that do bad get rewarded. So I was outcasted by girls and management. 

I somehow managed to survive despite all of that. I cursed my former boss because of her I ended up in there. I decided while dancing to go to school and obtained my AA in criminal administration of Justice. I didn’t want to be a sex worker for life. I started school late in life. Too late for some people’s opinions. During high school I was in trauma mode. (All I wanted to do was party to escape what I went through.) 

While I was working on my AA. 
I decided to volunteer at a rape crisis center. I did so because of everything I went through in my childhood. I want to help others. Once I graduated I got hired as an advocate and quit the club. I also decided to work on my bachelor’s degree. During this whole time I stayed away from Instagram and I deleted my Facebook. Last year I got an Instagram and it’s made me realize that it’s big circle jerk. I try to follow accounts that do advocacy work because one day I want to help survivors from all walks of life. 

But these advocates  are for decriminalizing sex work. Which is fine. I support that. Because I am no longer doing that and have a job they write me off, dismiss me or discredit me. I thought that I would be able to support and help and I’m realizing that these women who call themselves advocates are just abusive. I guess I thought I would be accepted do to my life experiences. I shouldn’t care but it all reminds me of being a child and wanting so badly to be seen and heard. I shouldn’t care what these people think of me. But I do. I’m bothered that I still think like a high schooler and wanting acceptance. As an adult who is her 30s this shouldn’t be an issue. But I recognized that this stems from my past. I’m taking a break from social media. I am just going to focus on myself. I am an anomaly and I survived and thrived. I shouldn’t be thinking about people’s opinions on social media."
193,I suddenly feel hopeless,"Long story short, things felt fine on the surfrace, but recently I've felt increasingly alone, depressed and unworthy of anything good happening to me. I don't know how to talk about it with my friends because they don't have the broken mindset that I have. No matter how much people try to convince me, I don't believe them whey they say I'm a great friend or a great listener or a human being who deserves love or anything. I would love to believe but I can't."
194,I feel as if I can't stand strong any longer.,"I (M22) come from a rich family, my dad was a millionaire and I had a good life till I was 20.

When I was 20, my dad passed away. Almost all of the money, people that we had just went off. I had just joined my MBA back then and it hit me like a train.

I had to take care of my household (my mom + all the expenses) and also pursue my MBA. I was &amp; am supported by this small amount of money that mom managed to save up and I don't know how long it'll last.

I just graduated a couple months ago and have been trying my hardest to get a job since the beginning of 2020. I've had problems with talking to people and have literally 0 confidence to even stand up for myself. 

I've been having these breakdowns in the recent months thinking I'm worthless, good for nothing etc. I have put myself under this mountain of pressure where I want to take care and provide for my family but I'm falling short for some reason.

I've applied for 100s of jobs in this week alone and not one has replied.

Today I felt this sense of being overwhelmed that I'd never had until now. I want to be better but I can't. I feel like a failure every single day. This has affected every single area of my life from simple conversations with people to dating. 

I honestly don't know if I'll ever get out of this."
195,I don’t think I’m good enough . I need help,Recently it’s been getting worse . Since my last attempt I had gotten better but after 2 months from that day it’s getting back to the same . I am not diagnosed with anything but I have been told by my school counselor that I’ve been getting panic attacks at times . Idk what I’m experiencing but it’s getting bad and all the thoughts are coming back . I don’t feel like myself. I just need  help but idk where/who to turn to . My parents are supportive but I don’t want to scare them again . I feel guilty from even thinking about taking my life bc my life isn’t that hard and I’m already stressed . My worry is that if I’m not able to handle such a simple life then idk how much more stressed out I’d be in the future when I have to face actual life problems.
196,Is this normal for a therapist?,"Ok, so prior knowledge: I have a social anxiety disorder, as well as dissociation and my friend tells me what I've gone through could count as trauma(emotional abuse, physical abuse). I stayed at a mental hospital for two days before pulling out because I was too anxious, and I can't remember anything from those two days because I was dissociating there so much.

I've had this therapist for a few months, around the time Corona started. At first it was alright, I didn't trust her enough to talk about any bad memories, but we talked about my anxiety and she told me that I experience dissociation.

But then, a few weeks ago I started talking about my past memories. I didn't go into many of them, just two actually, and it was really bad. Generally, it was hard for me to talk about it at all, and when I finished explaining, she told me my abusers were just stressed and that I should talk to them to sort it out.

I get panic attacks every time I think about those memories and I dissociate because of them a lot, my therapist knows that. She kinda ignored it, and made me feel uncomfortable for being nervous. I was behaving a little bit differently cause I was gonna talk about some memories, I didn't in the end, because she commented on it and made me feel generally uncomfortable talking to her.

She denied that those memories could've caused me trauma, which I've told her. Before I talked to her about those memories, she told me she's experienced with patients who have dissociation, but told me a few sessions later that the mental hospital I was at could deal better with it than she could.

So now I'm already anxious about our next session, which is on Tuesday, and scared to talk to her. I wanna get a new therapist, but the options are that either I stay with her, or partially go to the hospital. I'd be there for four hours instead of the whole day, which is generally better. The last option is that I could take medication, which I'm opposed to because of bad memories.

My question is if it's normal for therapist to treat someone like this, if it's normal for someone's bad memories being shoved aside like this. Sorry if this is a bad place to post this"
197,been struggling with tapering off my meds,"i've been taking meds for my anxiety and depression for almost 2 years. i pay all the fees all by myself, since my parents are not supporting me on my mental health journey even thought i'm possesed or smth. instead my online friend supports me both financially and emotionally. but surely i can't depend on him forever.

so i decided to taper off my medications. the last time i stopped taking buspirone and clobazam was a huge fight. my conditions got worse to the point i had to rush myself to meet a new therapy just to find out i actually have depression too, that the last psychiatrist misdiagnosed me.

and so i started taking alprazolam and ecsitaplopram as well. they are expensive as hell. i stopped taking it after 5 months, it was all good until few weeks later my depression and anxiety rebound, and the withdrawal symptoms got much worse. so i started taking it again. been 2 months since, and this covid situation forces me to not earning any money at all, meanwhile i have to take care of my mental health. at the other hand, my psychiatrist kinda ripped me off too. (he would charge me as much as the normal consulting fee, even though we only exchange 4 bubble chats about me asking to prescribed the meds again as im running out of meds for the month, without him asking how i feel)

so yeah, even though i may not be 100% healed i need to stop taking my meds. im just afraid of all the withdrawal symptoms."
198,Are my anxiety and depression symptoms of something else?,"I know you people cannot diagnose me and I do not want you to. I have always had depression and anxiety, and for a few years now (I am a 22 Y.O. male in USA) I have thought there was something else behind my anxiety and depression. Has anyone else felt this way? I have tried talking to my mom about it and she basically has told me that she does not believe there is anything else wrong with me. I have also talked to a psychiatrist once and he told me I was depressed and gave me a prescription for antidepressants, then literally ghosted me when I tried to refill my prescription for the addictive drug he gave me. I had to ween myself off with my last few pills so I wouldn't have to deal with a cold turkey cutoff. And also the pills didn't do anything. I know they can help people and I am not 100% against meds but I have had terrible times with psychiatrists. I am now at a point where I feel like I have a problem of believing there is something more wrong with me, when it could just be anxiety. It's hard for me to know because every time I have talked about it with people they tell me I am wrong. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel like there is something else going on with me but I have no idea how to get somebody that can diagnose me to listen to me and not just sell me antidepressants."
199,I’m so heartbroken,I know that it’s likely that nobody’s gonna see this but I just wanted to get some things off my chest. my girlfriend recently broke up with me about two weeks ago and she told me it was because she didn’t love me romantically anymore and I being an adult understood how she felt because it’s not something that you can control. We told ourselves that we’re going to stay friends. Then not a week later she told me that she had gotten in a relationship with another guy and that broke my heart again. What was so weird about it is that she didn’t tell any of her friends or even her mom whom she is really close with. And then about a week later I sent her a meme and then she tells me that she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and that broke my heart yet again because I still care about her and I thought she cared about me too and wanted to stay friends. I haven’t been eating a lot lately and I’ve been throwing up as a result of my depression. I also haven’t been able to sleep very much and a little sleep I get is restless I’m so tired and depressed and numb and hungry and nauseous and I don’t wanna feel like this anymore. If you have read this and you’re reading this far thank you you don’t have to leave like like or comment but I appreciate you reading this.
200,How do I talk about it?,"I am 13 and i been struggling with eating and weight obsession for over a couple of months now. Which includes eating under calories, occasionally skipping meals. Over exercise and losing around 9-10kg in around 3 months. I want to make a change and I want to talk about it with my mom but I don't know where to start. I don't know how to explain it to her or bring it up. Without making her to worried or stressed. But on the other hand I really do hate the way my body looks and have constant guilt around food. (I am trans so I have body dysphoria) I don't know what to do or how to bring it up. Any advice or help is appreciated"
201,I don’t like to be touched sometimes.,There’s times where I can’t stand to be touched by anyone including my wife and start getting anxious and irritable.
202,How to stray away from all the background noise?,"These things are everywhere lately - black lives matter and racism, antifa, feminism, fat acceptance, lgbt rights, abortion,  all of these. Just being exposed to all of this makes me anxious. I honestly don't care about these movements and their issues. These issues don't affect me. Seeing so much stupidity is really (literally) taking a toll on me. 

How can I stay as far away from this as possible?"
203,Im not sure if i have anxiety issues or im just a big worrier,"I don't thing worrier is word but i'm gonna ignore that

So, i worry alot. 

Its gotten to a point where i distract myself with everything i can 

I cant study, speaking answering my teachers questions (online classes) are terrifying to me and i hate sleeping at night because i end up having to stay awake for sometime before i go to sleep.

Worrying isn't my only problem tho

I do have my fare share of regretful things i have done and i end up thinking about those too

I am worried that i am depressed but i am also worried that i'm just being a little drama queen 

So what if you don't like doing anything you use to love like singing or reading

Are you sure if its not just quarantine that's affecting you

Stuff like that

While most people would say that yes i am most probably depressed

i don't think i myself will ever believe that i truly am"
204,I Hate Every Cell in My Body,"Okay, some context - I'm a 14-year-old with Asperger's syndrome and above-average intelligence (I'm not lying, my IQ is 125). I can't stand what I see in the mirror each morning.

I'm a tall, hairy teenage body with long, curly brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, and a Sephardic Jewish skintone (because I'm of largely Sephardic Jewish ancestry.) My skull is large, and my face is small. My mouth is narrow, my nose is huge, and my hairline is far up on my scalp.

Every day I wake up and I loathe what I see. I don't want to be a werewolf - I want to be completely clean-shaven with smooth skin. I want an Asian skintone like this girl in my English class named Ali. I want a larger face, smaller nose, and larger mouth.

I want long, black hair partially dyed pink. I want breasts and a plump butt. I want way smaller hands and a more feminine face. I want a vagina more than anything in the world.

For the love of God I'm so sick of wearing puffy Nikes shoes, sweatpants, and t-shirts. I wanna wear dresses, tutus, thigh high stockings, leggings, Vans, skinny jeans, sweaters, makeup, boots, overalls, crop tops, cat ears, makeup, jewelry, etc.

Why can't I ever be satisfied with myself?"
205,Toxic mom?,"Hay. I'd like to get all of your opinions on something. I'm almost 18 and I had an eating disorder, I still have some problems like emotional eating or throwing up. But I'm back on a healthy weight. And my mom doesn't believe in psychiatrist and mental illness. I was and still am depressed and have some ""anger issues"" aka i get way to angry over the smallest things and I can't control it. As an example one time my dad (whom I can't stand as a person) said something stupid about my eating. I'm vegetarian so I cook my own meals at home and one time my mom cooked a lot of food (all non vegetarian) so I cooked for myself and my dad came home and saw me cooking and said with an childish and mocking voice : ""ohh *my name* is cooking again. Don't you think we have enough food at home? Always hungry aren't ya"" and I got so angry that I wanted to gauge his eyes out and stab him until he no longer breathes. I did none of that but instead I went angry in my room and hit some things (including myself) until most of the anger was gone. And stuff like this would happend everyday (still does). And today my mom (knowing I had an eating disorder) was saying stuff like : we've been eating a lot and not moving enough, oh do you think your getting your period? You have been letting yourself go a bit don't you think. And she's been saying stuff like that quit often.
And when I tell her that I've been feeling depressed or just not good and that I want to see a psychiatrist. She'll laugh at me and say that it's not bad just work it out with yourself
Or your so week I didn't raise you like that
You are a disappointment
And I'm so fucking exhausting. The people I live with make me want to kill myself. Loose all hope.
And everytime I say something about moving out she gets angry and calls me unthankful, and that some people have it way worse and that everything is perfect here. That they give me everything. But then on the same she tells me that I need to be more independent. But is living and working for myself not independent?
I'm so confused. I want to know, am I wrong? Am I just over exaggerating?
And if no what should I do? I want to get some help because I feel like I'm gonna go crazy if I don't. But I can't get a psychiatrist because my parents won't allow it ""only crazy people have psychiatrist"""

209,Here's my life story (Hope you stay till the end because it's pretty long),"My mom and dad were not fortunate enough to afford things in life so they had to work hard for us to have everything that we have right now, Growing up was hard, Not having your parents around for school works or even events is really sad and exhausting, So I tried my best in academics and sports to be noticed by my parents,That maybe just maybe in their busy schedule they could finally attend one of my events at school but they never did, Going thru highschool I started having symptoms of depression (Not wanting to talk to people, oversleeping , not having any appetite or eating a lot, not having the willpower to get out of bed) Everyday was the same, Exhausting and it felt lonely, During this time I saved up to be checked by a psychiatrist turns out I have Depression , PTSD and Severe Anxiety, I never told my parents about my diagnosis because like every other events at school I don't think they'll actually do something about it. Fast forward to college my mental illness got the best of me that I had to stop for a semester because doing anything was already too much for me to handle. For 7 months I locked myself in my room barely eating. In those 7 months my family reminded me of how useless I am for wasting time and not going to school but still they didn't think there is something wrong with me.
When I started getting to school again my mom's friend suggested that I should be doing therapy and medication for my mental illness on the first month everything was going smoothly until my mom ranted out about the additional expenses that I was racking up because of my mental illness, I felt discouraged sad and guilty about it and stopped doing therapy and medication. I hope I could reach out to this community for help so I can have the chance to have therapy and medication. Thank you."
210,What is the Atkins Diet ? – Atkins Diet Plan,"The most well-known feature of the Atkins diet list is that it has low carbohydrates. It is stated that protein, healthy fats and fibrous vegetables should be eaten in the diet. Refined carbohydrate sources are limited.

The basis of the Atkins diet is based on fat and carbohydrate meeting the energy needs of the body. As a result of limited carbohydrate sources, it is stated that the body will meet its energy needs from fat. As a result, the thought that the body will burn fat is advocated. At the same time, it is thought that eating protein will increase satiety for a longer period of time and reduce appetite. As a result, it is thought that lower calories will be taken.

211,How do you cope up with being alone.,"I've had a fall out with my friends of 10 years and I've completely stopped talking with them at all. And it's not like I have no friends at all I have but it's not the same anymore. I had a bad break up, the person I thought I loved just broke up and that's it. There's this constant feeling of being alone. It's now becoming a habit, I'm becoming more quite as days are going by. And obviously with all this, where staying home makes you feel more depressed because there's issue going on and one is really happy but putting on a face. I'm just becoming more lonely and gloomy as days are going by and even if I'm out with people, it's not the same anymore. I just feel alone with no one to really understand me. I don't even know what I should understand about me. It's just the constant feeling of loneliness, gloominess."

214,"How do you convince someone to get psychological help? (Without them resenting you, ideally)","My step sister's father was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder several decades ago. He was a very abusive , angry and violent man who tried to control everything. 
As of recently, my sister's eldest son (20) has started showing a similar behaviour, throwing enormous anger tantrums over the smallest things, and while he hasnt used violence yet, he seems to be showing the same controlling/manipulating patterns as his grandfather. 
The thing is, he has no intention of changing his behavior. Whenever we point out that his actions are inappropriate, he yells, screams, breaks things and then stops talking to us for several weeks. Mentioning anything regarding mental ilnesses would be unthinkable. 
Does anyone here have to deal with something similar? How can we suggest him to see a psychologist? I would much rather stay on good/okay terms with him, but so far every encounter with my nephew has been uncomfortable. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells... 
Any advice would be appreciated."
215,Relationship / profession,"After my long term breakup , of me being toxic and facing anger issues , now I'm conscious about myself , I have lost bit of confidence as I used to have , but anxiety hits me hard of how toxic I was back then and it screws my inner peace , professional commitments , the goal and want in my life 
I started escaping it by fooling myself , getting into flings , smoking , porn , opening up to someone is like giving more and more anxiety to myself, if they leave ,

216,I have very dark thoughts and I don’t know why.,"I’m 12 going to my next school for a fifth time soon and and I am getting overwhelmed by pressure and I don’t know if that’s why but I regularly have very dark thoughts that I would never go through with like, stabbing people, cutting my cat in half, chopping my fingers off, getting in a car and crashing or jumping in front of a car. I don’t know why i have these thoughts but I am always getting worried about and sometimes I go into the kitchen and just get a knife and put it in my hand thinking about running it across my palm. I don’t know why but I’ve had a few bad things like I haven’t seen my mum since I was about 6 months old and I move school a lot and house so I have to adapt but I don’t know how to get rid of the thoughts and if that’s affecting it. If you could possibly tell me a little bit to help that would be appreciated but this might be normal but I guess I just wanna check."

220,Intrusive thoughts,I’ve been having so much intrusive thoughts lately and paranoia that its gotten to the point where it’s the only thing I think about. How can I help these scary thoughts?
221,I'm reaching the final line,"I don't know what to do. I'm feeling like s\*\*\* for years, but it's getting worse. I am always tired, always sad, I have no energy or interest do things that I loved back when I was a little kid. Anxiety level 1000, the smallest thing occurs and then the panic comes. Then there's the other things: dry mouth (and bad breath by consequence), many times I lose the sensibility of my hands (occasionally of my entire body), I take hundreds of photos per day of my facial defects, on what looks like a body dismorphia-esque thing. Heck, I'm 6 ft and I think I'm short - irrational thoughts always overcome my logical thinking -, I eat very little, I just want to sleep; if possible, I would sleep 15 hours everyday. I feel like I'm a huge failure. Whenever I speak, it's always slow. 

I've feeling this way for years. The difference? Now, I want to die. I want to disappear. I'm doing jack s\*\*\* here. Nobody would miss me. I wouldn't miss this place neither. Eventually, it will happen - the time passes and new things start to appear (like, dry mouth and losing the sensibility of my hands are new things).

I've been telling my mom that I want to see a psychiatrist. She's a good woman, but she doesn't take this very seriously I guess. I keep saying that I'm not ok, sometimes I even say that I'm crazy... and I can't do nothing, I'm a minor after all.

I guess the only that I will be taken seriously is by doing some nasty thing to myself - and it may result in permanent damages, but I don't care. At this point, I don't really care. Someday I will have the courage - by now, let me follow the wind."

How do I even begin that kind of conversation?"
224,Feeling like crap; idk what to do.,"Hey all.

I'm not one for sharing usually, unless asked. But honestly I feel like I need to share. But this last year has been hard on me, as I'm sure it has for everyone. To put it short, I'm struggling and I don't know where to go. As of the last few months, I've been oversleeping, undersleeping, questioning whether or not all this stress is even worth it anymore. The things I used to enjoy (which, if you need to know. Video games; Warhammer 40k miniature painting; Formula 1, to name a couple of things) are kinda numb to me now. They exist but I don't really get any joy out of them. I spend most of my day either staring at my computer screen, trying to keep myself occupied or lying in bed staring at my phone trying to do the same thing. Anything else doesn't give me any joy or happiness.

I've had days where I break down into tears for little to no reason; sometimes thinking whether or not to make it my last day. (Obviously, I'm still here. And luckily haven't been having any of those kinds of thoughts for a couple of weeks now)

I'm scared to talk about this to my friends (or friend, I guess) because I'm worried they may react badly. My family know and recognise it, but don't understand it. They see it as ""Oh, you're in one of those moods again"" and it's just hard to be open to them because of that. 

I'm not asking for a cure. But if anyone has any advice to help distract myself from any of this, I will appreciate it. I know, given current times, it's not exactly easy to go see a doctor due to other pressing matters... But if you have any methods that can help, I'd appreciate it so much because I need something."
225,Need some advice to get back on my feet,"I'm typically a pretty happy person but within the last few weeks I've spiraled down to the point where I'm skipping assignments left and right because I don't even feel the usual stress I get when I do that. I've also noticed I just want to do nothing, video games just frustrate me when I usually love them, homework seems too cumbersome to do, I don't even feel like eating/cooking, etc. 

I feel like right now nothing is causing me any joy or emotion these days. I've never been diagnosed with depression but I have ADHD and I'm medicated for it. Usually when I take the meds I can focus and get things done but these past few weeks it barely helps at all. I've been making sure to get some sun and taking vitamins etc and I don't feel any better. 

I would just like some advice on getting out of this slump, I don't think I need any serious mental help, just tactics to make me feel less drained."
226,I want to end myself. Like. Now.,"Tw// mention of wanting to attempt to kill myself and self harming. 

Hi. I (15f) don’t like myself at all, i’m a worthless thing that can’t even have a conversation properly or fkn do anything right. 

I have quite a few mental illnesses, i’m just gonna say that now, it does involve depression and BPD. 
I am medicated for almost every one, but i still feel like sh!t. 

As of now, i have Melatonin, Lexapro and Ritalin next to me. I am really fkn tempted to just take it, but likr, lots of it so i hopefully die. I just really don’t like myself.

I’m emotionally sensative, have severe anxiety, i’m scared of everything, i can literally get distracted by a fkn stick or leaf or something, i can’t hold conversations, i can’t even call anyone like a company without having a panic attack.

Tonight i cut myself again and i cried. Alot. I still am. I have tried to stop and i stopped for like 1, 1/2 days. I’m a bad person for doing it again. I really am. I’m sorry for everything. 

My parents know i’m like this but i don’t even have the courage to say anything. I have a therapist and she knows i’m hiding so much stuff but i can’t tell her. 
I just don’t like this anymore."

228,Is my relation towards sex still normal?,"Hello Guys,

I'm kinda new to reddit and not a nativ english speaker so I apologize for mistaces or breaking some rules I was not aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

I (21m) am a virgin and I don't know if my relation towards sex is still normal. I was never really active when it came to sexual stuff. It was always some sort of copy mechanism. For example I startet watching porn and masturbating because some boys were showing me porn in school and talked about it. Later I tried to flirt with girls because other dudes did it but not because it felt naturell for me to do. Btw kissing for example also feelt not naturel for me. I was afraid to get shamed by other males for beeing a virgin but beside that it has never really affected me.

But now something has changed. A girl asked me to have sex with her it didn't work out so I'm still a virgin haha. Since that day I have the huge desire to be with a woman and I'm just talking about holding her, feeling her warmth, smelling her hair and so on. It also changed my porn watching behavior. I talked already about not starting porn on my own. Well thats true but it hit me like a train. I normaly beat my cock 1-3 times a day to fucked up stuff and now I also watch some extra porn for emotional reasons. I search for categorys like ""eye contact"", ""real/loving couple"" and also some tutorials for ""real"" sex, just to sit there and look at it. Well now you know about my porn watching behavior, let's get back to my actual situation. So now I'm looking for a partner but I have some problems with that. 1. I'm afraid of a relationship. It's hard for me to have much contact with other people, if they do not live with me and I don't want to hurt somebody by not appreciate them enough. Beside that I saw so many harm createt by relationships and especially sex that I think the Chance/Risk ratio is not the best. 2. I think I have to lose my virginity to think clear about sex but that is stressing me out and I'm pushing to hard for it so that girls turn away what makes me feel disapointed by myself. 3. I hate the feeling of losing control because of this thaughts. I want to have the control about my mind and I despise people that lose control about themselfe because of their sexual desire but I fell like I'm moving into that direction. I have moments where I think being asexuelle would be a relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah without showing all the details you should have a picture about my situation.

What do you guys think? Is this more common than I think or am I just retardet?

PS: If you took some of your time and made it this far I want to thank you very much."
229,Religious illness,"

My life was great I had nothing to worry about one day I was walking alone in the desert as I usually do then I thought I’m I on the right path I was a Sunni Muslim did some research got mocked  cursed and yelled at by imams then left a year later I started going to church and learning somethings I couldn’t understand so I started but the were strong questions so the priest thought I was challenging his faith like other Muslims in my country and he kicked me out few months later I became a Quran only Muslim but some things where missing so I left as well two years later 

THE ILLNESS 

every time I try to pray to God I get a strong feeling like he hates me and wants me to get up quickly and every time I go to sleep I have a nightmare about seeing a demon reciting the Bible or the Quran or seeing a prophet crying of happiness in the dream or simply feeling at peace but when I wakeup I’m terrified so scared that I can’t go and open the lights I have been seeing nightmares it has been seven months and every day I see a nightmare what should I do if I should Go see a therapist do I just set there and tell them my problem and they would know exactly what to do?"

No matter what I accomplish, how attractive people consider me, I ruthlessly compare myself to others and hate myself.

234,My mums caused drama over my wedding and now she can't stop being angry. Im worried about her.,"So my wedding was 2 days ago and mine and hubby's friend come up to stay for 2 weeks prior to the wedding, my mum and her friend come a week later.

My mum has generally never liked this friend, but its been 10 years since she'd seen him last and his changed alot since she knew him then and I thought she'd tolerate him this time round.

Well anyway this friend has been helping hubby on the families farm with harvest prior to my mum getting here, but when his at the house he plays games in a back room and smokes pot in the laundry which is outside. My hubby and I are ex smokers and doesn't faze us that he does this.

Anyway my mum gets here with her friend and this friend of ours and my mum are getting along pretty well the first night.. the next day still getting along.. then the day after I go to get pampered for the wedding and our friend is at the house with my mum and her friend alone.

Well when I get back from being pampered at 6 in the arvo, I find out that mums been drinking from 10am and she's bagging our friend out saying he doesn't help with the kids, clean, smokes bongs when his here plays video games and occasionally comes out talking on his headphones when he goes to smoke in the laundry.

My mums friend has a go at her saying look, this isn't your house, or your wedding so you've go to keep quite and don't cause drama. Well my mums friend goes to bed because she doesn't drink. And my mum decides to stay up and drink more.. when hubby, me and friend start getting tipsy my mum starts being nasty.. friend thinks its funny and is having a joke with her thinking she was messing around. Well then she comes out with something nasty about his mum and then refers to friend as one of my useless exes who's the father of my kids, my hubby's sitting in between them and hates hearing about my ex. 

That's when I start ripping my mum qt this point telling her to go to bed, that's she's just being plain nasty. Our friends just telling her she's rude not swearing at her. So my mum goes to bed and me and my hubby being bipolar start flipping our shit at each other.

Anyway next day my mums crook and doesn't leave her room once.. but it was pretty obvious she was avoiding our friend. Then everytime she does come out of the room and comes across our friend she's being nasty to him. The house is completely awkward from then on. She's constantly grumpy being snappy.

Even before we left for her to walk me down the eisle she's still being snappy.

During the wedding she was happy for photos but because was still a bit crook she left and took the kids back to our place. 

The day after the wedding she's up at 6am, bags packed, full of beans and talking a million miles a minute, keeps trying to wake her friend up to get going who wasn't ready. They then get going and there's an instant relief that they're gone. 

It was planned to take friend back in a week when hubby had the weekend off. I rang mum on their way home and let her know that I'd be coming up on the weekend in my car instead so the kids and I could come because hubby's car is only a 2 seater.

Anyway my mum gets home and rings my hubby pissed off saying there's no way your able to bring my car over the way they went because the road was in bad condition. She then went on how she didn't want our friend to drive our car. 

I rang her after hubby had and she was still pissed off angry about us thinking of going over in my car. I said it wasn't an issue at all and we'd see her after new years when hubby had time off and go a different way. She then went on about this friend staying with us for another week. And then went on about trivial things like about not having certain foods in our cupboards for the kids.

SO this morning I rang her and she's still angry and brings up our friend again and I said she really needs to stop, she's getting obsessed and needs to cheer up. That she wasn't here and she isn't even around him. Then she yelled at me and was swearing telling me to calm down and hung up on me.

Im just gobsmacked and don't know what to do. I don't know whether to tell a close family friend go out and visit her, just leave it for a few days and then call her. My hubby's going to stay with her one night when he drops friend off in same town and I really don't want him copping an ear full from her about this friend all over again. 

I only had my mum, her friend and my dad invited to the wedding on my side due to covid and the long drive, my dad let me down and didn't make it and my mums caused the only drama.

My whole life my Mum and Dad have always controlled and manipulated people and me being their only daughter and only being at an arms reach living at most an hour away, moving up here has finally given me my independance in saying that though I do ask for their help financially and being close to my mum call her alot still as were pretty close but my dad and I have never had a very good relationship.

TL;DR - My controlling mum who im really close to came over for our wedding and had a fight with hubby's best friend, and now she can't stop obsessing over it. Im worried for her mental health."
235,Turned 18 yesterday. Now I'm scared,"So as the title says I turned 18 yesterday. And even days before something was off. I'm not a paranoid person I don't like to admit myself to those feelings.

But now, I can't believe I'm 18. I never thought I'd be alive to see it. But i feel as though I'm gonna blink and suddenly be 30. I'm scared of being older and I'm scared of all these big changes that are coming. I feel like I'm gonna regret everything and I'm scared of it all. 

I've put on a brave face and said something just seems off to the people I know. But it's getting harder."
236,Am I insane?,"It all started when I was 15 I thought it was some kind of weird adolescent phase and it was going to go away in a year maybe 2, I'm 20. I can't get angry with people/strangers/friends nor able to show any emotion beyond ""hapinness"" I'm constantly smiling in the streets/university/work, I can't cry either I'm bottling up any ""negative feeling"" because as long as I belive everything is okay that makes me happy, which is a lie , everytime I feel bad for myself or try to get sad I stop it immediatly as if I was talking to myself but as a different version, I talk to myself with 3 different voices like if I was discussing when I'm alone sometimes I do it on the street and we stop immediatly when someone takes a peek on us, I have suicidal thoughts but never will do it cause I don't belive in it, have gone to therapy but everytime I do I lie and now that the pandemic start it we haven't gone in a year or so.

3 versions of me, all different, John its extremely self-pity, if something goes wrong blames himself no matter what he has done or if he was related to it, believes we shouldn't be alive, has a constant need of trying to feel loved/liked or at least he tries to be related with other human being (which we don't). Wants to talk with people about our problem but I don't trust people for many past issues so he usually gets shut before speaking about us, he is the face I use when talking to new people since its a good small talker, polite, nice and some people say cute but we really despice most people, suicidal thoughts.

S, I just call it S, its logical/working/independent and doesn't like people he is the guy that makes our exams, does the work, essays all that stuff, when handling people he usually just sits in a corner listens and talks when he feels like it, mostly talks just to shut down someones idea/opinion or to add something they didn't know, gets mad or bothered easily by small and dumb things, example being called his name twice although he heard the first time, seeing people use big words in the wrong way to sound smarter, money wasting, jaywalking, not saying thank you hello or goodbye, not wearing a fucking mask asking for a discount or refund without any real reason, saying dumb stuff. The only reason he exists its mostly because of university.

Jack its an asshole/manipulative/liar/defense system When my therapist asks about my life jack steps up and straight up lies saying everything is fine and our life is great, she has seen through some of our lies but still, likes making people feel bad or shaming them when ""they deserve it"", feels everything is a competence, god complex, steals and cheats when he believes someone is bad but for him bad is someone he dislikes, able to use some peoples feelings to get what he wants, very intense, he is able to play off as the other 2 but have terrible thoughts while doing it, homicidal thoughts although once again I will never do it cause we don't believe in it, doesn't trust people so we can only rely on ourselves even then if they do help he believes they will never do much because everyone at the end has ulterior motives.

When we are having some sort of mental breakdown I just curled up or lay on a wall place my hands on my ears and start telling myself ""that I'm still here"" over and over, those 3 personalities don't take over me outta nowhere nor when I want, its mostly when I need it and most of the time I'm in control but it has happen that I've stolen or called out someone without actually meaning it and sometimes I even forgot the why I did it they are still here and they have been here for 5 years and their presence has gotten even stronger over time Is this normal? Am I normal? well not normal normal, I'm weird, what I mean is, Is this okay?

Probably deleting this account later sorry if you read all this and has grammar mistakes english is not my main language or if you dissaprove of it or I wasted your time"
237,Disturbingly right,"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/psychtimes/215c252ce5862ea451680f9fab760c5e3385551f-2072x3379.jpg?auto=format

The mixed part. Im not sure if mixed episodes even exist but literally I relate to all of that basically exactly which... is kinda crazy because usually I can find a way to justify NOT relating to mental health stuff"
238,Who do i go to,"Ive been in my house for 2 days now, i havent eaten and suicidal thoughts have been forcing themselves into my head. Im not swayed to act on them but i dont have the willpower to ignore it. I dont know what to do. Everyone here in my town that i was friends with has left and i dont feel comfortable talking to them about this but i need to do something because this is going in a bad direction. So im taking my last bit of willpower and effort to ask for help. What do i do? Im not prone to anxiety and have dealt with that before but i am not diagnosed with depression and all of this has come on super suddenly like a freight train that has hit me in my soul and im sad and scared of whats happening."
239,Feeling extremely overwhelmed but hate being called out?,"So what do you do if you feel overwhelmed and are used to keeping it on the low-key, but now once you start mentioning it, you get called out on getting overwhelmed about everything ? Like thank you I'm aware of that, but if you're going to say that, why speak up in the first place 😔😓"
240,I dont know whats going on,So i dont have many friends but one of them is still in contact with some friends from highschool and since I know I need to be more social shes added me into a group chat with them. since its relevant I gotta mention I have some type of trauma and was in emdr therapy for it but since it was getting nowhere im back to talk therapy. I have some severe memory repression stuff going on. but occasionally I'll get a blip of memory accompanied by some major head pain. normally I remember the fact that I remembered something and the fact I was in pain but never actually what I remembered. well we were talking yesterday and they mentioned a girl we knew that moved away. a few hours later i vaugly remembered what she looked like and decided I need to remember this time. so Ive been readind a description of what she looks like every few hours and I feel physically like shit. and on top of that while walking through my current houses I kept getting flashes of the house I lived in with my abuser through out my childhood. even typing this i keep thinking im on my old computer. normally I cant even get an idea of what these things looked like. i feel like if i let myself forget it i would feel better and stop dissociating so much but this feels the closest ive ever gotten to remembering anything. so now im sitting in my room because i didnt have my own room back then so when i look aroundi dont get confused about where i am but its so hard to focus on anything and i dont know what to do.
241,Anybody else obsess over hospitals?,"I hated them when I was younger, but now I constantly think about how I want to go there because of my mental health. I want to be in a psych ward or something, but not really because I want to decide what I do. I don’t know."
242,I'll just cry myself to sleep.,"I have nothing really important to say, just that stuff sucks and I'll probably cry myself to sleep. I've been going through a lot and none of my ""friends"" are helping or being there for me, I guess I'll be alone until I feel like I can't do this anymore and die."
243,How do you know you are going insane ?,Just as the title says
244,"18(M) anti social, failing school, very depressed, and lazy","I can’t do it anymore. I don’t know what to do. School is too hard for me. I just wanna be in my room. I’m stressed out. As high school is ending soon. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. My dad keep telling me I need to do better in school. But he don’t understand I mentally/physically can’t do it. Sitting in a desk all day. And I’m very anti social. I mumble and it’s hard for me to make eye contact. I blame 70 percent of this on my dad. He would leave me and my sister home alone for hours by ourselves When we were younger. Not even for work. Just to go meet with his friends at some place. So I never had anyone to help me with my work or anyone really supporting me. Also my dad would sometimes get mad and hit us. Nothing ever serious but that really fucked my head up. I specifically remember one time he hit me and the next night when he got home I locked my door because I was scared. He doesn’t hit us anymore. But I really believe that period in my life fucked up my mental health. And it part of the reason why I’m so depressed and anti social now.

245,I fkn hate myself. I’m sorry for everything.,"Tw// mentioning wanting to overdose. 
15m.

Hi. It’s me again. I’m probably annoying tf out of all of you guys, as i do everyone. I feel like i want to overdose on my meds or something. Idk. I just really fkn hate myself and i’m just depressed all of the time now. England is now going into another lockdown with schools staying open, which is gonna cause alot more fkn stress from homework and exams and stuff (which we get too much of). I have ADHD so i really really struggle to do stuff at home such as schoolwork. I cannot focus what so ever. I get told off for not doing it but it’s not my fault. My teachers don’t get ADHD, nevermind the other mental illnesses that drag me down.

I just want to end everything. I can’t do this anymore. I’m going to school tomorow which means people telling me to kill myself again. I just don’t want to live. Either jump off that 100ft high bridge kinda near my house or od. Idk anymore.

I’m sorry for everything."

247,"How do I not feel guilty for doing nothing? How do I stop thinking about what I could/should be doing, what needs to be done, what other people are doing with themselves, critical thoughts etc.?","I, 30/M, have extreme difficulty just sitting and doing nothing. The closet needs rearranging, the floor needs vacuuming, the cabinets need rearranging, I need to dust, I need to shop online for things I need/may need, etc. are constantly going through my mind when I sit down. I blew my knee out at jiu jitsu this morning, and went to the hospital. I got home and am very limited in my movement, and it's raining, so I'm stuck on the couch. It's driving me nuts. I think I'm running from myself and my feelings, by trying to control and perfect my external environment. 

My sister died at the end of January, and I haven't gotten therapy or truly accepted it, and I've had issues with depersonalization/derealization/dissociation for 14 years, which makes it more difficult as well. Used to be real bad, but got almost entirely better. I also have experienced a lot of trauma. And I have had actual OCD for my whole life, but have gotten much, much better with it. So, I still feel kind-of detached from my feelings and others, and am constantly introspecting to be able to reconnect to myself and others. 

I also bought a home a year and a half ago, and had never lived completely alone before, so there's always stuff to do. I quit drinking 2 years ago and have made massive improvements in my life. Like, completely different person. I used to sit around and do nothing but drink all day, so I used to be good at doing nothing. But reasons for not being able to relax aside, how can I allow myself to just relax and watch tv? How do I not feel guilty for that? Is it bad to do that? Am I being complacent? 

Thank you all in advance and I hope you're having a great day!"
248,"I don't feel ""up to par"" at all","(18 m) I've always been kind of an outcast person. No real friends besides my gut. I don't really know how to word this without sounding like complaining for attention to be honest but ill try anyway. I was never invited to any parties in high-school, every day was spent alone, my life now is just work and play video games (although its 2020 i don't get any texts ever) i just feel alone, really alone. I've always felt that I was looked at as the ""wierd kid"" in elementary school so no one talked to me. And that mentality just kinda spread to high-school. And now out of high-school I feel genuinely empty. I have a good job and I'm in a good home. But not having friends just drags me down.

249,Movember in Honour of My Fathers Sucessful Fight Against Prostate Cancer,"Hi Everyone! 2 years ago, my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was lucky to have a relatively good case compared to some other men. He went on chemotherapy and it was cured, to only come back a year later. So, he got his prostate removed this past September. It was a hard process but he was lucky to be diagnosed early unlike many other people. I decided to do Movember this year to honour his strong and courageous fight against cancer, and to honour those who were not as lucky as him. I want to help make a change and find a cure for prostate cancer, and hopefully many other cancers in the future. Anything you can donate helps, or simply sharing this link with friends and family. Thank you and stay safe!

250,does anyone else get suicidal because of school?,"every day, i wake up and i just want the day to be over

i feel exhausted and stressed beyond belief because of the workload, and even when there isn’t work, i feel like i need to become a perfect shining role model or else i’ll be a failure

according to my school board, my mental/ physical health is a joke and shouldn’t be cared about

my teacher has told me that i need to get better and that homework is a priority. a priority over my health, a priority over enjoying my childhood while i still have it, a priority over everything. 

The worst part is that i still have years until this ends.   16 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, i just want this to end

the only friends i’ve ever had have even admitted they don’t like the way i act

i just want this to stop"
251,Need to break patterns: inability to act to my romantic interest in others,"In short: I have had a very short romantic tally. I think in each of my relationships, either the other person took the first step, or third parties did some heavy nudging. I can't get myself to take the first step (and the second...), and it's holding me back.

Quick run-down of my background: 33yo male, STEM academic, reactive, perfectionist tendencies, history with depression (but well and stable currently), rational but generally emotionally muted,either not very good or not very confident in reading others, easily experience impostor syndrome.

I feel like this combination of traits has set me up for perpetual lack of success in my romantic life. Whenever I feel like I am interested in someone, there are incredibly many inhibitions that stop me from acting on it: a very deep respect for other people's boundaries that I'd never want to overstep, not wanting to jeopardise a friendship, not knowing where to start or what constitutes ""a good date"", having so much stress/work on my plate that I worry about things like having the energy to chatter away. You can imagine these are so many worries that I end up in an analysis paralysis, missing the window of opportunity (if such a thing even exists?)  or letting everyone just pass under my nose without even trying to see whether things could work out.

Ultimately I feel like a lot of my worries stem from one deeply engrained falsehood: that I'll only get one shot at things. Rationally I know it's utter BS, but so many of my actions and inactions are explained by a deep sense of wanting things to go either perfect or good enough that nobody gets hurt.

There's patterns here that I feel like I need to break. Obviously the COVID lockdown isn't going to help, but I guess that'll buy me time to reflect while I use it as an excuse to let the next interesting person slip under my nose. The big question for me is: how? There's a wall of traits and excuses carefully cemented together to keep me acting the way I do and rationalise my behaviour, but I have no clue on where to begin if I want to alter that behaviour and set myself up for success.

Is there anybody here with who my situation resonates? Advice? Or further questions? Much appreciated."
252,Overwhelmed and dissociative?,"Hey everyone, bear with me, I have never posted on reddit before, but I've been really struggling lately. I'm not sure if it's the pandemic, the weather, school, etc. but my mental health has been deteriorating like crazy. I'm at a point now where I just start dissociating whenever I am having serious conversations. Not even just conflicts, even conversations where I just am talking about how I feel and why. It feels like my thoughts are flying away in the wind and just as I am about to get a hold on them, they float away. A lot of days, I don't want to leave my bed or do anything at all. I love my job, but even when I am at work I feel like I am just going through the motions. 

This is probably one of the busiest semesters I have ever had. I am applying to different programs, taking exams for grad school, etc. I don't know if that's affecting my mood, but I do know I am at least pushing them all aside and pretending like they don't exist. I almost feel like a shell of who I was, but to a lesser extent? It feels like if I don't do something to help, I am going to become a complete shell of who I was. These feelings have been affecting a lot of my relationships, familial and romantic, and it's been so hard trying to explain how I feel and trying to get better while simultaneously trying to help everyone around me. I try so hard, but when people talk its like I can only half-listen, no matter how hard I try. 

I have no clue what's going on or how to get better. I know these feelings are temporary, but the things these feelings make me do, or rather what they make me not do, can affect me forever. Things like relationships, scholarships, and school are all so important to me, and always have been. It just feels like I'm screwing things up and no matter how hard I try, I can't even be present enough to address them."
253,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Ever since middle school I've been terribly insecure about my physical appearance. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror and absolutely hated pictures being taken of me. It feels recently these insecurities are growing stronger.

I've never had many friends, I've only ever had this one friend group that meant a lot to me. I've known them for 4-5 years. Recently I introduced one of my friends from school to them. She is very beautiful and more confident than I'll ever be. It seems that in those two days that they'd be known her they already love her so much more than me.

What broke me is when I heard my crush (who flirted with me as well) openly talk about how he'd nail her.

The past few days these insecurities have been attacking me to the point where I cried every night because of it. I felt average and unneeded. Disposable.

What's really bothering me though is that the hate I directed towards myself is now being shifted onto my friends. I started hating her because they loved her so much. I started hating them because I felt like they didn't care about me. I never felt hot enough or funny enough to warrant any attention.

I despise the fact that I hate her because of my insecurities. One part of me hates the fact that I hate her and the other insists that it's her fault. I don't want to feel this way about my friends because I don't want to lose them.

I feel like I will never be confident enough to love myself that much, however I just don't want to lose my friends because of what my mind tells me to do. It makes me feel even more unworthy of the few friends I have."
254,I feel like giving up,"I wake up feeling tired, because I spent the whole night checking the phone, being paranoid that I have slept through my alarm. I get to school only have slept 2-3 hours. I spend there about 8 hours a day on average. The whole time I just sit at my desk, because I'm too anxious to get up and talk to other people. I can't even go to the canteen to grab my lunch because of it. When I get home, I get on my phone because that's the only thing that can distract me from reality and make me feel something else than fear and anxiety. I can't do my homework. I can't study. My grades are bad. I don't have any motivation to learn, and even if I had, I wouldn't do it out of fear of failing even when I study hard for stuff. Half an hour before going to bed I start feeling the guilt for not doing it, but then it's already too late to do anything about it. Then the cycle starts over. 
The cycle has been going for about 2 years now. I can't take it anymore. I'm bawling my eyes out right now.I have thought about taking my life tonight. I only have one year of high school left, but I don't know if I will last that long. I have the worst anxiety, and it's there every minute of the day, and it's hard to handle it anymore.I don't have money to see a psychologist or anything like that. I have though about home schooling, but I don't know if my family would allow me to do that and I know I would be judged by my classmates and teachers for it."

What do you do when your partners mental health affects your own? 
I’m honestly so lost! I love my partner to death and I want to help them or at least be there for them, but no matter what I always just end up with my own mental health being fucked :( 

My partner is the sweetest and kindest person I’ve ever met and I love them to death but I can’t get out of my own depression/mental health spiral because I’m constantly surrounded with their stresses and worries too but the thing is, they struggle to open up or accept help and aren’t able to tell their therapist, or anyone really, what’s really going on and i fear they may never receive the help they need because they can’t voice what is wrong. I understand it’s a very difficult thing to do to put all you’re feelings out on the line but at the same time I don’t think I’ll ever get out of my mental health funk with this happening around me and I have no idea what to do. Breaking up isn’t an option because they’re the love of my life but I just feel so helpless!! 

Please someone, anyone, help me :("
256,I believe that one day I'll definitely commit suicide,"I'm 17(m) and to be honest, dealing with depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts for years now. I don't see myself living till I'm old, I'll just off myself way before. I've got no concentration skills or focus to study, and in this world you can't do anything without studying.. I've even failed a grade because of this problem. I have no one around me I can talk to, just a couple of online friends whom I'm close to.. I have had a long distance relationship, which was my first ever, and got fucking cheated, and now I don't think I'll ever date someone, so love is also something I don't see a future in, like my life. I've been self harming on and off since I was 9(rough childhood, filled with constant bullying everyday, and well.. an abusive family). I always think I'll kill myself tonight but I'm too much of a pussy and I still have some ""hope"", but that hope is getting dimmer everyday. Idk if anyone will even read this, I just need something to get these fucking thoughts out of my head.. I have a stupid dream of becoming a youtuber but I'm being forced to do college.. I just can't study. Probably will die someday all alone.."
257,The Release of Crying,"I(20f) recently got back on my mood stabilizers medication for my Bipolar II and although it’s certainly had an effect on my sub-manic episodes, my depressions are less effected. I’m still struggling with the heavy despair that comes with the troughs in my mood swings. 

Sometimes it gets so bad that I’ll be perfectly numb for an entire day and suddenly get completely blindsided by a wave of sorrow, and just start sobbing. It can be really hard to deal with, but there’s a comfort in it. Even though I’m sad now, I know it doesn’t last. 

I still have moments of pure joy and enjoyment in life. I still love experiencing those happy times, even during times when all seems dark. If I have to shed a few tears every once in a while in order to feel love and happiness any other time, it’s a price I’m willing to pay."
258,I actually was happy I had Covid,"I've had a moderate case of Covid and maybe it was the best thing that could have happened to me. I was and still am terribly depressed but the physical pain and exhaustion of Covid were overpowering my depression. Also it was the first time people cared. I've been suicidal for month but nobody cared. Suddenly I had a flu and people are worried? This is beyond me. It makes me want to be sick just so that I can have a break from the emotional pain and to be taken seriously. It astonishes me how people never cared when I told them I was thinking about committing suicide. But having a moderate case of the flu apparently makes me visible.

Having Covid caused me to lose money but my depression did as well. So that sucked either way but people accept physical illness more than mental illness. I would rather fall really ill and die from it and than to keep suffering mentally. I know this sounds wrong but it's how I feel."

Okay here’s the thing is that I’ve been seeing maggots in my drawer but when I tell my family and they look in it they aren’t there and though I do have slightly poor eyesight it isn’t terrible and I rarely need my glasses but my family is making me feel crazy currently because I’ve been paranoid and seeing shapes and things. To top it off I have the issue where if I don’t do something I feel like my family will die such as hold my breathe for a certain amount of time or keep completely still and tho I’ve been having intrusive thoughts and have been doing things on impulse since I was little the shapes and bugs are very new. I’m not sure if I’m just jumpy from it being Halloween but it’s been this way for a month or two now but maybe I should wear my glasses more I’m not sure it’s just stressful. It’s just been stressful. I’m not sure why this happens if you have any ideas or explanations I’d love to hear them.Also occasionally cats that aren’t real but those aren’t scary therefore I’m not concerned about that.

I’m just sick of dealing. Sick of the world expecting so much from me. Sick of a family that doesn’t care. Sick of a boyfriend who tells me i could snap myself out of it if i did more. I’m so sick of living in such a horrible world.

And no matter how hard i keep pressing the scissors the more i don’t want to die and wish the world was different. I’m going to break eventually. Why shouldn’t i just donit now and get it over with"
263,Depressive episodes,"I occasionally go through periods of depression. I just recently started feeling normal. I usually feel numb, I start having suicidal thoughts, I lose all motivation to do anything. Even though right now I feel ok, I’ll eventually feel down again as I always do. I don’t know if I should seek help or just pretend like those periods never happen."
264,Sometimes I wonder if procrastination is actually GOOD for my mental health,"Obviously when it has a serious impact on the quality of work I eventually get done, that isn’t good... and if it comes in the form of self-destructive things (let’s just drink a pint of whiskey tonight) that DEFINITELY isn’t good but idk... I’ve been feeling so fuckin low and lonely recently and I’ve been really getting into RPAN lately and making friends there and honestly? I think it’s worth the detriment to my work, provided it’s minimal... Whatever no real point here, just bullshittin’"
265,How do I ask if someone who I don’t know is OK?,"So there’s this person who’s a year older than me who goes to my school who I can see isn’t okay. Although, i barely know her and have only had a few meaningless conversations with her. I’m not sure if her friends have been talking to her or anything but I feel like I should talk to her. But I don’t want to be weird and seem like I’m stalking her or anything? I don’t have her number or anything, just her insta and Snapchat. Is talking to her weird considering I don’t know her? Advice please!!"
266,Has anyone successfully found a marketplace plan that covers therapy sessions? (USA),"How did you do it? I thought my current plan would cover some (because it says it does in the summary), but it doesn't. I don't know where to start or how to figure out what a plan will actually cover, because my experience this year showed me that sometimes the description doesn't match the reality. Any tips? Thank you in advance!"

268,I’m completely and utterly exhausted,"It hit me like a truck again. The doctor said it’s combined depression and anxiety, but why doesn’t that diagnosis feel right? It doesn’t explain the high or the good times, even if it explains the bad. 

The highs I can manage. I talk a lot. I’m restless and don’t sleep. Sometimes I’m irritable but it always feels justified. I do stupid stuff, I spend money and drink, but I feel good. Optimistic. Happy. Almost an adrenaline junkie. 

The mid feels good too. Weeks of feeling completely normal. Even if I do get mild anxiety symptoms I can deal with it. It feels like nothing’s the matter. 

But the lows. My god. I forgot how bad it felt. I can’t do anything, I feel so anxious and guilty and exhausted all the time. It’s been such a long week. I’m so tired.

The meds he gave me sent my mind out of whack. Cycling up and down so fast. They stopped the meds. Yet the thought I’d just be fine without them. It feels like a kick in the teeth - a reminder as to why I needed the meds in the first place. Why was I hopeful to think I’d be okay without them?  Nothing had changed. 

Two more months of this hell, in a best case scenario. I’m so tired, I’m dragging my feet. I’m not sure I have the energy to keep trying."
269,Depression and college,"Honestly, my current depressive episode it me like a truck last week and I’ve never struggled so much to do college work. I feel so insanely guilty for not doing as much as I’d hoped (before my mood took a turn). I’m not going to college tomorrow because I just can’t do it. I’m too exhausted and anxious. But I feel incredibly guilty. 

I’m the past, even when depressed and self harming, I kept up straight As and A*s and never missed a day. These days my depression hits differently and I feel incapable of anything. I feel guilty for not being able to keep up like I used to be able to. It feels like I’m being lazy and giving up without trying. Like my mental illness is just a big excuse because I can’t be assed to do a bit of easy work. 

How do I keep up my college work while feeling like utter shit, and how do I stop feeling guilty for being ill?"
270,My father is turning on the heat despite the fact the technician told us it would kill us,Nothing else to say then that I hate him fuck him im already feeling light headed I hope I die of poison gas thanks to him fuck god
271,Heart rate spiked by swearing and anger,So idk is it just me or does anyone else get super panicky and anxious when they hear someone raise their voice and/or start swearing?
272,My father turned on the heat for twenty mins to prove a point despite the fact the technician told us it would kill us,Fuck him I hate him why does he do this I don’t know he’s impossible I had to sit outside in the dark because his hissy fit could have gotten us killed he’s ridiculous.
273,Should I talk about this with my therapist? *I'm really embarrassed*,"I'm 17 years old, virgin and I just can't stop thinking about having sex, I'm not desperate, I don't even like the idea very much, but people my age are having boyfriends and girlfriends and it makes me feel like shit. All I can hope for is a friend but my social anxiety makes it impossible. I didn't even have a real first kiss... Is it appropriate to talk about this? Is it too late for me? How do I stop thinking about it?"
274,I have a hard time controlling my anger,"I always curse at myself and mouth words I shouldn’t say. I don’t have any intention of hurting anyone, but I just always feel tensed up. I want to change but I feel like I just can’t calm down a little bit. These thoughts that I have all the time kill me, and I can’t stop thinking about them. Family, friends, and other stuff is just so frustrating to me, I don’t even know if I should be concerned because there are times where I’m happy as well, but then I’m still tense when I am. I’m just all over the place I feel."
275,"I've been struggling with my low serotonin levels, what can I do to improve on this?","I'm 14 and I've been a mess lately, I'm very unmotivated, my sleep schedule is awful, been pretty irritable and impulsive as well. It's been messing with my OCD too, maybe cause I don't go out much anymore cause of quarantine. Anything and everything is appreciated :)"
276,kind of uncomfortable with my mom (gross stuff for warning),"so growing up i never had any rules, literally none, and it got to a point (which this is fucking disgusting my mother is horrible for not punishing us for this) where i ended up fucking my sister at the age of 8, not to mention the fact that the first time i actually ejaculated was while my sister was watching, teaching me how to masturbate, i don't even like to consider it my first time having sex i like to believe im just a virgin but anyway, it makes me extremely uncomfortable because she will straight up take her shirt off with me in the room and shit and its disgusting, and its not even like shes a milf or anything, we're trailer trash, which means she looks like honey booboos mom, she kept talking about how she knew who my favorite pornstar was and now im an adult and realizing how absolutely fucked up and dysfunctional this shit is, i want to move out but i was never tought anything, fucked up part is whenever i was caught fucking my sister all she said was ""they're experimenting"" like WHAT THE FUCK, and its not even just the incest shit thats a problem, im an adult and this woman lets me smoke weed saying the same shit ""hes experimenting with drugs"" like bullshit im not experimenting im smoking weed because in the moment I forget how fucked up my past is, i fucking hate that i lost my virginity to my sister, i hate that my mom doesn't care about this stuff and even encouraged sexual stuff as kids


i just want to be a normal functioning family, i wish I would have had rules, im just glad i was able to realize how fucked up this was


oh and to say the least, there is a reason why i am immune to overdosing on several medications (mom never watched ya boy so i got into alot of pills as a kid)"
277,Anger issues (partially to do with BPD),"So I have acute BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), for those not in the know, in layman’s terms it means sufferers have go through emotional extremes. Happiness is much greater when you feel good, sadness is much worse (and has led to depression and anxiety in my case). 

But I wanted to vent a little over feelings I’ve had, and the ongoing battle I’m having. Namely, I suffer severely with anger and have a really bad temper when I blow (something I have learned to control much more in my day to day life thankfully). But when I do suffer my explosive anger, I have nowhere to direct it outwards, namely cause it happens more so at night when I have nowhere to go. So I cannot just go for a run or something. 

But one of the ongoing thoughts that I have regarding this, I really want to just pick a fight with someone, or start being bullied again (I suffered bullying throughout my childhood and teens for some clarity). So I want to either kick the shit out of someone, or have the shit kicked out of me, or be belittled in some way. Probably to give me some outside source for my anger rather than all this emotion being directed inwards. 

I have no way to express the anger and have to cage it due to living with very conservative parents. They understand mental illness but I just have no way to direct the anger out, unlike other emotions. With sadness I’ve learned to meditate or listen to music, making it much easier to deal with. 

But anger is the one issue, and its hard to not just explode. Writing this now I can feel my hands shaking slightly, and my veins throbbing in my neck. There’s just nowhere for it to go and it frustrates me even more. Its nearly 1am and I have nothing to do about the anger. 

TL;DR struggling with anger partially due to BPD, and want to either fight someone or be beaten up and bullied"
278,What does religious guilt result from?,"I'm a Christian who grew up in a Christian community, and since about 2 years ago I've been experiencing a lot of religious guilt over seemingly harmless things. I feel guilt when I watch films or read books involving magic or demons, felt some guilt celebrating halloween, guilt over wearing gothic clothing, and guilt after wanting to lucid dream/""reality shift"". Does anyone know what this results from and how to deal with it?"
279,"I've been struggling with my serotonin levels lately, what can I do to improve on this?","For context I'm 14 and I've been a mess lately, I'm very unmotivated, my sleep schedule is awful, been pretty irritable and impulsive as well. It's been messing with my OCD too, maybe cause I don't go out much anymore cause of quarantine. Anything and everything is appreciated :)"
280,"Dont know how to handle the feeling of being ""left out"" with depression","When I was younger I saw alot of people that had mental health issues and never saw myself getting there. What could go wrong? Family was good, I had everything I need in life, etc Fast forward to about 15 years later in my freshman year of college. I had a dwindling social circle that 100 percent was not my fault, in a whole new way of life and then just more drama that I had no control over. 

A couple newer friends from back home that were slightly older than me and going to the same school came into my life. It was nice, we were similar in many ways and two of them experience the same hardships. I felt a bit more assured knowing that I can relate 

Later on I went home after not feeling right and was diagnosed with depression, it sounds bad but I was kinda getting close to killing myself and one of my friends called and said dont and invited me over to talk things out. Very big adjustment and a bit of a shock as I did not think I was that bad but I did have alot of stress built up,trouble sleeping, etc. I did be open with my mental health to who ever I could so that it was not like im being rude for no reason or look upset for nothing. I had a few others who slightly struggled help me too. 

Sophmore year I had a seizure probably from a drug for depression I was taking and was diagnosed with epilepsy that day basically. A couple months after that I find myself anxious, stressed out, upset, etc. I feel completely lost and defeated in life. The people that I met in college kind of distanced themselves from me I personally feel due to my mental health. I was never physically abusive, verbally abusive, rude etc, I just came off as too much. I loved hanging out with them because A. they helped me at a time when I felt like nothing was going to help me and B. They were genuinely interested in being friends. I never thought any of them would go as far as a relationship but who knows on that one. 

I just wish in the moment depression could not kill my chances with anything and I could see people again and make things right."
281,Self awareness and Motivation,"While Halloween already came by, and some others are honoring their deceased there sure are many scary and epic costumes for this year; however, what's most scary is the image in the mirror because you cannot run from yourself, and sometimes that's all that you have. Even though this year has been harsh on most from one way or another, is also important to remember to nurture your inner strength and will since that's the voice that keep you going; so, the next time you look into a mirror smile, and if you can't or just don't feel it then look into your eyes till you see that sparkle of joy, otherwise visualise that inner strength in you and keep moving forward step by step."
282,I came out today as bisexual to one of my closest friends and he's happy for me! :D,"Hi, to start off I'm a 20 year old male and I'm so happy to say that I came out today as bisexual to one of my closest friends because of some events that followed up before that. Basically I've been depressed, anxious and had suicidal thoughts the past few months, yesterday I decided to open up to my friendship group about feeling depressed and suicidal mainly and they were all very supportive and cared for me it made me so happy and earlier today my closest friend asked me how I was and I told him I needed to get something off my chest and I told him I was bisexual, and again he was so very supportive and even told me that he was happy for me and I cried of happiness/joy when he told me. He's the only person I've told because I'm not ready to open up about being bisexual yet to the rest of my friends, I might open up to them in about a week or so I just need to prepare myself for it.

I'm just so thankful for these amazing friends in my life and I don't ever want to lose them. Thanks if you read all the way through I'm just so incredibly happy right now, I thought I'd just share this with you incredible people on reddit you've helped me out so much with getting the confidence I need :')"
283,2020 finally made me cry.,"It takes a lot to make me cry. The last time I cried was over a year ago when I was stood up on a date by a girl who I really liked and my mom called me the worst and most defiant son ever all within 2 weeks.

Well, I finally cried today. It was difficult to let myself do it; it felt wrong. My body kept automatically stopping, but my mind wanted to scream. Everything this year had been building up like bags on a camel's back, and tonight was when the camel could take it any more and had to lay down.

I expected so much chaotic beauty from this year. Everything was set up for a super exciting time in my life. Graduation, exploration of college life, making new friends, and other big steps were lined up to be a new chapter for me. I knew a cute girl at my college. I was ready to start Greek life. I had huge plans for projects in my free time that would help me learn new skills. It was all bound to be great.

I am in the class of 2020. I had a weird graduation 3 months late. My ""freshman experience"" has been sitting in my room 10 hours a day doing online college. As everyone knows, literally everything this year has gone wrong. What would a full online student expect other than his power to go out for 4 days?

Most of my classes are fine, but one class where I barely have an A is not fine. I had very little time to do the homework due to not having power, and the professor was not very sincere about helping me. Once I had power again, I spent all of Halloween night working to complete the homework but ended up with a 30% because I ran out of time. Up until this point, I have made excellent grades, but this will take my A to a B.

I cried because it is all too much. Everything could have been so exciting yet so simple. I cried because I could have been so happy during such a fun time in my life. I could have talked to that cute girl, built those projects, and had normal classes. Even my back up plans are getting destroyed by disasters. I kept telling myself that my mental health and well being are more important than any grade in college, and it only made me want to cry more. Although my body wanted to act normal, my mind was having a meltdown.

2020 finally made me cry because it hasn't been anything close to what I had in mind. I will not have a chance to do any of this stuff again (especially that homework). It sucks."
284,The stress of being a teenager is SO underrated - it gets after highschool,"Hey guys! (21F) I just wanted to share my experience with battling depression and how the past 3 years have gotten so much better because of not having to face to immense pressure that society puts on teens!

I know everybody’s situation is different but I’m hoping I can brighten up someone’s outlook on life!

First I just wanna adress that like not enough adults talk about how hard it is to be 14-18! These years were honestly the toughest ones so far. I hear all these older middle-aged people like “oh you’re too young to be stressed out”

But society puts so much pressure on teens. Teachers and parents want you to have your career and university picked out in like grade 9, and they expect you to be on top of your game all the time no matter how hard going on in your personal life. Kids at school act as if there’s some social hierarchy that everybody fits into, employers treat teens like crap kuz they can get away with it, and on top of that social media can be so bad for mental health!

Ever since I got out of highschool my mental health has been so much better. Id love to hear your guys opinions on this 😝 There’s hope guys! Love you all 😊❤️❤️❤️"
285,I’m so close to breaking,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m starting to write this on Tuesday, October 27th. Over the last few months my already shitty life took a plunge into hell. Without going into too much detail, I lost someone very close to me earlier this year. This was not my first loss, that happened a year prior to this. In between those 2 deaths I have lost 8 other people, all of which I felt I could depend on. 
Today is Wednesday, October 28th. After losing him, my mind went to a very dark place and I almost took my own life. My mother stopped me and saved my life and I thought that was the end of it and my life would finally start looking up. Looking back, I was very gullible. Soon after my mom and my grandma had a fight that ended up getting me, my parents, and my 3 siblings getting kicked out. Now I live in a veeeery low income family so we couldn’t afford an actual house, we ended up living in a 2 bedroom apartment. Anyone who’s had to share a tiny room with even one person should know how stressful it can be, imagine sharing a room with three. 
Today is Thursday, October 29th. My dad got upset today and now I have a brand new gash on my nose. Anyway, ever since we moved in here stress has been on a constant rise for everyone in the house. Luckily, for a few months, my friend started to take care of me and let me stay in his house for a few days at a time. I would be on and off living with him for a few months, spending time with my family while also taking time for my mental health. Once again, I thought things were finally looking up for me.
Today is Friday, October 30th. I was stupid to let myself think I was allowed to be happy. Earlier this month, my friends grandma passed away and I attended the funeral. Guess what virus also attended? So I do what any reasonable child would do and called my mom to let her know I had to quarantine for 2 weeks expecting a calm conversation. Nope, I was wrong again. She blew up on me over the phone for “taking an unnecessary risk”. I didn’t talk to either of my parents for the two weeks, it was honestly the calm before the storm.
Today is October 31st, happy Halloween. As soon as I walked back into my home after the 2 weeks were up I got greeted with a glass bowl to the head followed by a screaming match. Needless to say I’m no longer allowed to even speak to my friend, and it feels like I’ve lost someone else I could trust in. 
Today is November 1st. Things only got worse from there. I’ve been home a week now and while I’m glad to see my siblings are eating well, I am not. The amount of times I’ve seriously considered ending my own life is terrifying, the lack of food going into my body is terrifying, and the thoughts going through my head even as I type this is terrifying. I need help but I don’t where to get it. Someone please help me"
286,i want someone to ask me if im ok but nobody will.,i randomly disappeared from school recently not saying much. nobody asked me if i was okay or anything . nobody said anything to me. so that means if i just was gone forever nobody would care. ive been posting things recently hinting about how truly lonely i am and how bad my depression is. nobody has said a word. nobody cares about me. im so fucking worthless. even if i did open up to someone they would end up sending me to a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts. just an endless circle of despair. i need help but not at a mental hospital. this turned into a rant so im sorry.
287,Suicidal thoughts with school work,"Just wondering if anyone else deals with this and knows how to handle it. I'm in year 11 at the moment, and honestly school just drains me like hell. Its pretty difficult, I find with homework especially I get a lot of anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts. I deal with the thoughts pretty regularly and I have self harming tendencies, though it isn't as bad as it used to be. I usually avoid homework since I don't really want to feel that way, I can work in school but that's because I really dissociate and numb myself to it. Which in itself isn't a good thing. I take therapy, but I was just wondering if anyone else had similar experiences or knows how to deal with it. I'll probably bring it up in therapy but I was just wondering. I've had to be dealing with this for years, and it increasingly got worse. I think now is a better time to deal with it though because I'm no longer living in a really bad environment. Though at the moment I'm pretty nervous about going back to school without having done anything. And with this whole covid thing, it's just more stressful in school. I feel like I'm going to break. I'm really worried I'll end up as I used to be if this just builds up more. Also sorry if I used the wrong flair. First time on this group."
288,Im just so tired.,"Im so tired of waking up with a headache in the morning from the constant crying at night and only getting like 3h of sleep at best. Im so tired of constantly overthinking everything that comes out of my mouth. Doesn‘t matter if it’s a coworker, boss, friends at school or my parents. I feel like everything I say makes people dislike me or even hate me. When I talk to my friends I feel like all of them secretly hate me. And if anything were to happen where we would have to split up it‘d be me who would stand alone since I‘m the fifth friend in our group. Im so tired of constantly being this person that im not even really sure is me. It’s gotten to the point where I question myself „wait, how do I normally react to this“ or „do I or do I not enjoy reading?“. Because I haven’t done it in months and I actually love to read, well at least I think so. But lately these past few months I have just become so tired of everything, I got tired of reading, tired of cooking (which i enjoyed doing for a while), of eating, as soon as i get home i skip dinner and go straight to bed and miss the evening i could have spent with my family but then again my parents and i don’t really have the best relationship where I think a lot of my selfdoubt has originated but let’s not get into that now.
Im so tired of life. I have barley touched the surface of why im so tired and i dont have the engergy to continue my rant about my pathetic way of thinking since I’m pretty sure this will get lost somewhere between other posts and nobody will see this anyway."
289,How do I stop feeling sorry for myself?,"How do I stop feeling sorry for myself. I’m doing pretty well in life at the moment if I look at all I’ve done from an objective lens but whenever I see someone else and what theyve achieved, I’ll just sulk and question my own self worth and my ability. It’s really bad and I lose a lot of time and energy on it. Please help? I can’t seem to get rid of this poisonous feeling even though rationally I know I’ve got nothing to prove."
290,can you develop PTSD from watching an attempt at suicide?,"a while back my ex fiance had called me in the middle of the night on video call, she had been taking pills and downing alcohol, she called me essentially to say goodbye, her words were slurred and she kept almost passing out and I remember each and every time she almost passed out I would start saying ""please stay with me"" followed by ""I love you"" to make sure if she did pass out that I love you would be the last thing she would hear, but I don't know, every time I hear the words ""I love you"" or someone asking for someone not to go I get flashbacks of that night  


though, unfortunately my ex fiance is my ex for a reason now, because after some time she ended up killing herself so yeah, i really feel i could have done something about it but i don't know, all the doctors were doing was giving a person who attempted to overdose more pills that extensively fucked her up more, now they've been giving me pills that are fucking me up and my career so i said fuck it and stopped taking that shit, they refuse proper therapy so yeah fuck me i guess, i just, i cant believe shes actually gone"
291,My wife is almost at a breaking point..,"Background.. she has thyroid disease, ADHD, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality disorder. She hasn’t been diagnosed with paranoia but she gets paranoid about crazy things. Low self esteem. She’s super hot and has a steady job, but her mind is constantly fucking her. She struggles with high anxiety as well.

She takes adhd meds, thyroid meds, and an anti depressant.

I’m not sure what to say.. she came to me a few minutes ago saying she needed help and I asked her what was wrong and she just doesn’t have an answer. She says she just can’t keep going like this, and that she needs help.

Idk what to do, everything is fine but she just isn’t for some reason."

293,How do you deal with hypochondria without health insurance?,"The majority of my day consists of being hypervigilant of my body and worrying about undiagnosed health issues and Googling them. I'm an American and don't have health insurance (because healthcare isn't a human right here for some reason), so it's not like I can just go to the doctor. (Trust me, I wish I could, but I'm in that gray area where I make just a tad too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford out-of-pocket or private insurance costs.) As a hypochondriac, I'm pretty much between a rock and a hard place here.

Does anyone have any tips on how to manage hypochondria and just anxiety in general in my situation? Going to the doctor is on my list, but I need something to help me in the meantime. I'm not enjoying my life living this way and need to learn how to cope. I know stopping compulsory Googling is my first step, but it's tough.

Please help!"
294,I want to die. Not because there’s something bad but because there’s nothing that feels good.,"I’ve told my friends about this but they just keep telling me to see a medical professional, which I have done. It didn’t help - my feelings and thoughts remain unchanged.

My life is going pretty well. I’m financially stable, have amazing friends which I love, I’m working towards a degree in a field which I love. But nothing feels rewarding. And the worst thing is - there’s nothing bad either. 

Everything is going smoothly towards goals that I’ve set throughout earlier education (aside from the few things I fucked up on purpose to see if anything bad would change my mindset - it didn’t) 

I’ve accomplished a lot through my short life. I’ve made money, I’ve won competitions, I have a few scholarships. And all of these things I looked forward to and pushed towards but when they happened, there was no pride. There was no joy, there was just nothing.

I have quite a lot to feel happy about but I just don’t. My life just feels empty. It feels like there’s no reason for me to go through with everything if there will never be a pay-off.

I have plans in place for a suicide. I’ve had these thoughts for at least 4 years now and throughout that time I’ve meticulously planned every part of how I’d end my life if I decided I wanted to. 

But so far, every single time I’ve thought about this I’ve decided to give it another go. However I feel like slowly my optimism about things changing is fading and I’ll be gone soon."
295,Close friend of 10 years is struggling with mental health and I feel it's making her self-absorbed to the point of cruelty. I'm angry enough to end this friendship — should I try harder to empathize because she's struggling?,"**Here is what's going on with my friend, who I'll call Riley:** 

She quit her job in Japan, where she has been living the last 7 years, and moved back to the States in April. Huge change. Her original plan was to live with her parents (who she has a close relationship with), take some time off to write and decompress, then look for a job. Unfortunately, she happened to go through this major life transition in the very beginning of COVID. 

When she came back to the states, she immediately felt isolated and extra anxious about finding a job.  Totally understandable, I don't know anyone who hasn't been feeling those things. She has been struggling with anxiety over the past few years, and it has absolutely gotten worse during quarantine. She has a therapist, and he has recommended she go on medication, but she's in denial about things being ""that bad"" and doesn't think she needs it. 

Since she's been home, she has relied on me and our mutual friend for emotional support. I felt horrible that I couldn't come visit her due to COVID or help make this transitional time easier for her, so I tried to set up a weekly skype date so she'd have something to look forward to each week. When things got particularly bad, I convinced my housemates to rent an RV with me and drive over 2,000 miles to go visit my friend. 

While I was visiting Riley, I was going to be staying with my parents &amp; brother, all of whom are severely immunocompromised. I asked my friend to be extra cautious and mindful of COVID protocols for the 2 weeks I was in town, and she agreed that she would, but she wasn't. She went out to eat a few times (indoors) with her parents, who don't believe in wearing masks. The last straw for me was two days before I was going to leave, when Riley went out to dinner and then to get drinks at a bar for her mom's birthday. 

It was a slap in the face to me. I told her I was disappointed and angry with her for not keeping her word to me - it was only two weeks! - especially when I had gone so far out of my way to come visit her. (Also, side note: our state is currently having one of the worst outbreaks in the country.) 

In response to my expressing frustration with her, she got mad at me. We took a break and didn't talk for a week. Point to her, though - we eventually did have a conversation where she apologized (genuinely) for not taking it more seriously. 

**Here is what's going on with me:** 

My brother entered hospice on Saturday. I flew across the country (to my hometown, where Riley is currently living) to be with him and help my parents take care of him (they aren't in the best of health, so while I am home I take on the role of his primary caretaker - all the feeding, adult diaper changing, med-giving, lifting, head-rubbing, etc). My brother cannot walk or talk, has seizures and requires 24-hour care. It's exhausting. It's heartbreaking. He has been given days to weeks to live, and it's so hard to watch him suffer. I am grieving while trying to be strong for him and my parents. 

He's in incredible pain. It is a slow, horrible death. But I know I am lucky to *be* with him right now when so many people are dying alone of COVID. (to clarify: my brother is not dying of covid - he is dying of inoperable cancer which has become necrotic and is now leaking poison into his body after a recent surgery. He was paralyzed and had a brain injury before this. I have taken care of him as though he were my own son for most of my life. He is the most important person on this planet to me.)

**Here is what happened between Riley and I:** 

Context? This was 3 days after flying home last weekend. After driving from the airport directly to the hospital to stay by my brother's side. After not sleeping more than 2 hours at a time for 3 days because I was his guardian/representative and I knew he was in immense pain but paralyzed and unable to talk, so I needed to be able to advocate for him if he needed me to. 

On day 3, knowing exactly what was going on with my brother, Riley sent me and our mutual friend a page of texts talking about how hard her life is. Literally stuff like how ""Aaron doesn't call, Mike doesn't want to be my friend, I don't have a job, I miss Japan, etc"". 

This is normal for her. These vent texts happen at least 2x/week, but sometimes more, and I normally don't mind them at all. On this occasion, though, I didn't have it in me to provide emotional support. I was absolutely dead tired, and overwhelmed with end-of-life caregiving. So I responded to her text with something like ""mhm, that sucks I'm sorry."" 

I genuinely meant that, it wasn't sarcastic. I thought her original text was tone-deaf but honestly, I understood. She's going through a shitty time, just like the rest of us (I also don't have a job and have been strapped for cash and am just generally not doing well, so I get it.) I don't think my stuff is the only valid shit going on, people struggle in their own ways and it's not a competition. I was just too tired to help her through her stuff right now, but I wanted her to know I heard her. 

She responded to my 'mhm' text with ""whenever people reply 'mhm' i think they're mad at me."" 

At this point, she's becoming exhausting. And frankly a bad friend. But still, I replied: ""oh no i'm not at all"" 

It is at this point Riley sends another venting-style text about how she just feels like a drain on everyone. 

To which I responded that I cannot do this right now. That I am going through too much right now to help her through her anxiety. I can't do it. I just can't. I'm not trying to be dismissive of her but I have too much going on to help her through this and I need her to try to do it on her own.

She took great offense to this. 

Wanting to avoid a fight with her, I tried to move on and change the conversation. But she kept. Bringing. It. Up. I told her flat-out that I wasn't mad. That we were cool. That it's not a big deal. That I wasn't trying to be mean. That I was just spread too thin right now but I'm sorry she's going through such a hard time and I hate that for her. 

I tried twice to squash it. I moved on, sent memes, changed the subject. She kept bringing it up. So I told her I was taking a break from talking to her for the rest of the night so we could cool off, but that it was NOT that big of a deal and I just wanted to move on. 

The next morning, I woke up to a long text about how I was a bad friend, how she never asked me to help her handle her anxiety, and how she feels like she can't say anything to me right now. 

That was the last straw for me. 

I told her that the fact we were STILL talking about this and she was STILL bringing this up and not letting it go (after I told her point-blank that I WASN'T MAD AND WE WERE COOL AND I JUST WANTED TO SQUASH IT) was a sign that her anxiety had boiled over to a place where she had become self-obsessed. 

I told her I was sick of coddling her and her feelings, and I can't believe she was asking me to do that when I'm going through so fucking much right now. 

I told her you don't have to 'ask' someone something in the form of a question — and the fact that my 'mhm' response was met with more neediness from her was a sign that she absolutely was asking for help and was expecting more aid from me at that time. 

She responded to that by saying ""I'm done being verbally abused by you. I guess i'm just a shitty friend who can't say or do anything right ever. I'm done."" Etc etc.

I asked two people to read over the exchange and tell me if I was blind to some form of verbal abuse on my end. They were both horrified by Riley's behavior throughout our exchange. 

Her recent behavior, in my opinion, is bad enough to be a friendship-ender. I know she's going through a lot right now, but so am I and to be completely honest? So is *everyone.* Not having a job right now isn't a Riley thing. It's an American thing. Hell, a human, COVID-era thing! (Side note: I have reached out to several people on Riley's behalf to help her get a job. I have even gotten her a part-time job with my longest-running freelance client.) 

**Tl;dr:**

My best friend of 10 years, Riley, is unable to see or admit that her anxiety is making her a bad friend. It is always, *always,* someone else not being sensitive enough to her needs. She cannot handle anyone disagreeing with her at all. My brother entered hospice this week and she tried to make me feel guilty for not being a better friend to HER right now because she doesn't have a boyfriend or a job and she has anxiety that she won't take meds for. When I told her I couldn't give her emotional support, she snapped at me.  When I tried pointing out how her behavior is out of line and hurtful, she accused me of being verbally abusive (which is just objectively not true.) 

I don't know how to forgive her for picking a fight with me and being so self-absorbed during this incredibly painful time in my life. I feel like her behavior is unbelievably selfish, but I am unable to make any comment to her that isn't 100% supportive and positive, so I don't know how to heal this wound in our friendship or move on in a more healthy way.

**Questions:**

Should I try to be more understanding because she is struggling with her mental health? 

Do you think this can be salvaged? 

Have you been through anything similar? 

Any perspective/thoughts/advice is welcome. I'm struggling. I don't want to lose what I considered to be a best friend right now, but I also feel like she might be turning out to be kind of a shitty person. Can't tell if that's her mental health or just her and can't tell if that matters."

297,"Do ""Visions"", ""Shocks"", and Noises I Hear Mean Something For Me?","17, M, and talking about something that's been on my mind.

For the past four to five years, I've been having add visions or dreams of sorts, most taking reality and fantasy combined together. Most of the recent are more so just darkness and odd color pallet shapes and sizes. They, almost make faces, masks or even things I can only imagine about. Faces that are either familiar, or made up and somehow memorable without reason. Most of them had no other expression, other than apathetic, traumatized, and neutral. Not only that, some have made me noises that were familiar or imagined by me.

These noises started from hearing a family member call for help, to eerie train brakes echoing or even a wail from some odd monster. They just, happen. No warning, no reason why, but just happen. Then came the shocks.

The shocks are what worry me a lot. They are what I fear most: Thoughts of death. Father told me recently that death is not the one wanting us to submit into their hands, but the one that awaits to help us whenever we do pass away. They guide us to the gates and stairs he said, because he himself almost met death many times at work. Thinking about death even for a moment, brings fear, and I don't know why it makes me jump from my bed and gasping for air. I don't know why, and just wish it could stop."
298,New job triggers temporary anxiety spike at least 1x/shift. Need help managing it,"So, I got a job as a wfh call center employee. The thing is, making phone calls is one of my major triggers. So I made sure that I found a job that didn't require outbound phone calls. Knew that it was still a risky venture. But my physical health demands that I switch fields and with covid-19 that means wfh due to asthma triggers. (as I only have retail experience plus HS diploma, jobs I qualify for are limited).

So, a week into actually helping customers, using a VoIP phone system, I find that at the start of each shift, when I go to turn the live calls on, my anxiety spikes and I slow down (I freeze, not fight or fright). But once I get going I'm good (I have no problem answering the phone). And sometimes this also happens when returning from a break.
I'm not used to being able to dealing with this type of regular anxiety spike. I know/assume it's not a reason to increase my meds. And not really a reason to start therapy again.
What I'm looking for is tips for dealing with the spike and working past it, beyond deep breaths. (also not pot or pot related products)"
299,parents," 

I am a 17-year-old and my parents are driving me nuts.

my parents are business owners and I usually help them out and work for them every once in a while. so they just called me when I was half asleep and asked if I could work for them because I just went on a camping trip with my boyfriend. I normally don't have a problem working for them, but when I went to ask about important details like, ""how many hours will I work?"" or ""how much will I get paid"" they wanted to act as if I was ungrateful for their offer and automatically brought up the camping trip and how I had already had a weekend. while yes I agree I already had a fun weekend, I technically have a four day weekend and a decent amount of homework to do. Monday and Tuesday were the days I was planning to get all of it done.

so I started to try to bargain with them and say I have stuff I need to do they tell me if I had so many things to do then I shouldn't have gone on a camping trip. this is not the first time they have used this logic with me. the fact that the second they allow me to be a teenager, they only use it as something to guilt me into doing things for them. they are corroding my mental health. the only time I feel like a real person is when I am with my boyfriend. I'm just so sick and tired of constantly feeling as though I'm not allowed to live. I'm over feeling like shit every time I have the chance to have fun. I'm so ducking ready to get out of this damn house."

301,"A discussion about an acute mental health event, and finding hope to get through it."," Hi all, 

i have just released some writing about my own experiences of mental health, accessing mental health services, and the early beginnings of my recovery (the rest to come later). My work is held on a non-profit blog (no advertising or promotional material), which tries to bring technical information and personal experience together. 

The situations which created my loss of hope are detailed in parts one and two, but these sections are about my experience of environmental collapse and corporate culture and do not talk about personal mental health impacts extensively.  

The third section is called '3.0 *No end game*'. This a short description of a loss of hope that occurred as a result of the experiences described in sections one and two. 

Part 4.0, 'Falling through the cracks' may be triggering for some individuals. It does contain an explicit discussion of suicidality. Every effort has been made to balance that perspective with a view from a happier mindstate, but it may still be troubling for some people. Out of respect for that fact, i will not provide a link to the pages in question, but to the home page.

The remaining three explain the hope which helped me get through this experience. The hope i describe is hope in the Australian society of today, and the capacity of technical systems to guide it to a better place.

305,Ive been bottleing up my emotions for 5+ years now and it looks like its gonna be 6 how do i fix me,"So i guess i'll just spew out my life story here.  
Im 17 living in a small town in us and whenever i was a kid i was pretty smart. Grades 1-5 i was getting all As and people were talking about moving me up grades and throwing around words like ""potential"", ""Gifted and talented"" all that jazz. I also didnt have too much of a social life, i was pretty much your average nerd.     
Then in 2015 i spent just shy of a year in a sort of group home. I dont want to get into specifics but my parents are still here and there great and loving people. Im not really sure if it started there or just before but thats about when i started getting a bit closed off, and where my depression really started kicking in. Not that the people there werent nice enough. Anyway the first thing that started showing up even before was me consistantly doubting if im making the right decision. Then once i actually got into there it ramped up to the point i could barely pick an outfit without regreting it 5 seconds later, this led my self esteem/ Self worth to take a nosedive that it really hasnt come back up from. This is where i started thinking suicidal thoughts s though i never did anything. When i finnally got out of there and back home for a few months it was good. Then Adhd just had to come crash the party  
I started missing assignments. Ecspecially long term projects where you were supposed to work on it at home. My grades dropped and i developed anxiety about basically any school work. The small fortune is that i started to develop real friends.   
The reasons for keeping it all bottled up changed over time. From ""I should be able to beat this"" to ""how am i gonna make any friends like this"" to ""My problems arent as bad as other peoples"" and finnaly to ""I dont want to be more of a burden.  
Somewhere around 2018 i started feeling extreme guilt, for decisions i made i the past, and every little mistake i was making.   
I got to highschool and unlike whats on tv, nothing much changed. Though, this past year or so everythings mmanaged to hit rock bottom. I think constant self hating thoughts i have developed this gigantic fear that i am/will fail at everything i do. I feel like im a burden on my family and everyone i know. I cant se any reason why anybody loves or even likes me. I feel like ive already wasted so many chances and i cannot undeestand why i keep getting more. My anxiety has gotten so bad it actually gets in the way of me doing work. 
Ive never really had a ""coping mechanism"" per say i really just struggle through the school day and as soon as i get home shove my face in a book, a game, or Youtube and try to hide from my problems. Its not working anymore. I need help but im so fucking afraid that ill just be more of a burden that everyone will see what im really like. I dont know what to do i dont know how or why ive managed to hold on it s physically hard to type this is there anyway i can stop myself i let go of thr end of my rope a long while ago. I just want to not have to put up the fucking facade of a halfway decent human being"
306,need someone,"I just wonder what a single life is worth in the grand scheme of things, but no matter how much I believe in that, I still can't live a day without overthinking everything I do. Could I do it better? What are people thinking of me when I do something? Why can't I do a simple task without fking it up or looking like an idiot? I always feel like I've been like this since day one but now I can't stop coming up with excuses for my state of mind. I just have so many problems running through my head I don't know how to suppress them."
307,Im a basket case,"So ive been though a pretty tough time especially this year. Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. To get past my many issues with myself and my complete self loathing. Or at least cover it from the world i had to create little personas thag i would apply mentally to get through a situation. I often talk to them as if they are someone with me and as if they play a role in my decisions. I used to go through almost weekly mental breakdowns and eventually they would only happen when really stressed or lonely. It seems my depression thrives in my lonelyness. This all bundled up to me being almost incapable of many emotions. I dont express easily and i often obsess over little details.
This year has been really rough; I was dissowned by half of what I thought was family. I ended up finding out that i was lied to my whole life about who my dad was and seeing I dont have a mom ive basically become even more lonesome. Ive also made the decision to join the military in order to get on my feet personally. With that being said my emotional unavailability had hurt my relationship and my and my gf of 3 years split. Recently i had begun talking and becoming closer with a good friend and someone I had interest in the past and of course my obsessive side had driven my feelings for her right back up from the grave and now the more I find out about her love life the more and more I hurt. Ive got two weeks till I leave for basics; in this time ive been feeling like i should be having a breakdown every night. But for some reason all of my emotions except lonelyness, hate, and sadness are kinda dead. I feel almost numb. Ive had the thought of suicide in the past and have never acted on it due to being afraid of hurting others. And even then i didnt feel this dead inside. I feel like im spiralling down, and i believe my past family issues have caused ptsd as i now have a nightmare every once in a while. I seriously dont know what to do. Someone help please, im desperate now."
308,I can’t tell if I regret moving or not,"I moved six hours away from everyone I know for college. I love it here, I love being independent and not having my parents around to judge me or ride my ass about everything, and I like feeling like an adult.

But the problem is I can’t be there for my friends. My friend was struggling yesterday and I couldn’t be there for her. I’m a horrible person for abandoning her, my girlfriend, and my other friends. What’s the point of me being alive if I just ruin things and can’t be there for anybody?"
309,How do I end everything without causing pain to people?,I've tried to get support and it's pretty clear that I should stop trying.
310,Need advice,My best friend is mad at me for something I did and is now giving me the silent treatment. She was the one I turned to talk to about mental health stuff and it’s giving me really bad anxiety. idk what to do
311,Help understanding what’s wrong,"I’ve been pretty down recently. It has been up and down for a while and now is a down I guess. But I think it’s different this time. Before I just felt really shit, locked up myself in my room and stuff. I still feel really down but also kind of empty. My mind has been really foggy, I haven’t slept much and everything feels like it’s just happening.
I finished two essays. Usually I struggle really hard to get them done. I get lost in other things I want to do like reddit. But now it’s like I don’t care what’s happening. I don’t care what has happened or what is going to happen or what is happening now kind of. But when I started thinking about I got worried about my future so I guess I do, but I quickly forgot about it. 

I just spent 2h looking for pills (not caffeine) that can make me stay awake, until I realized how fucky it was. And I think what I really need is sleep. But that feels kind of scary and I might just stay awake. I’ve also had some weird thought about self harm and stuff (although I haven’t done anything). The other day I kind of just decided I had gender dysphoria. But the day after I had no idea why I thought that. A lot of weird thought are appearing but I realize most of them are weird.

I don’t really know what’s going on and I can’t find anyone on the net that I can relate to."
312,making friends and a network,"i'm going to have to put some effort into my pathetic social life.  if i ever get out alive from my parents' house i'm going to have literally no one.  this is half by design, since i cut ties with a lot of shitty friends i had in the past plus toxic extended family.  the other half is because i've been hiding away so long i haven't given myself the opportunity to make friends in years.  even though i'm okay with tons of alone time, i'm social enough to realize that yes, i need people in my life to stay healthy.  i expect to be winning over people i don't even like just to get a foot in the door and the idea of that makes me feel so pathetic and desperate.  

it's a tremendous feeling of being on square one when people i knew growing up have families now and entire networks and i literally don't have a single friend.  in other ways, to compare our lives i'm not always the one coming up short, in fact this is about the only part of my situation where i've got nothing to show.  it's incredibly crucial though.  whenever i can, i'll be joining group activities and talking to strangers and doing pretty much anything to get some kind of social life.

i've identified my asocial behaviour as a tremendous source of failing to thrive in the past.  i've always downplayed the importance of a social network.  i'm independent and always think i do better alone but, funny enough, that's never worked out so well."
313,How do I be politically aware without my mental illnesses spiraling out of control and thinking the world is beyond doom and life has no hope?,When I was younger I always was told by therapists to not watch the news so it wouldn’t trigger my mental illnesses. Now I feel like a crap person for doing that but when I do engage I essentially become a non-functional as a person. It genuinely does not feel like their is an answer (or understanding that not being political 24/7 isn’t necessarily because you don’t care but that it’s difficult to even function as a person being engaged).
314,Can alter ego transform into distinct personality?,"I know that Alter ego and DID are separate terms. Some have alter ego is because they are living different lives and alter ego helps them to cope with it. While some have alter ego because they are intovert and cannot handle overwhelming situations on their own. Sometimes even emotional trauma triggers an alter.

But what I want to know, is there any possibility for a person's alter ego to convert itself into a complete distinct personality if their host person is triggered so much for mental trauma, depression , sadness etc. Can Alter ego take a form of DID?"
315,I’d rather die than grow up...,"Genuinely. My teachers keep lying me about “smart” I am, and that I’m not actually slow and just need to get more motivated and work harder.

That sounds like hell.

I already have a lot of suicidal thoughts, but thinking about the future and school definitely doesn’t help. At all. I’d rather kill myself than go through life:"
316,Please help me out with my sister’s weird food issues.,"First of all if this is not a right community please direct me to the one that could help me better.

My sister who is now in her mid 40s always had problems with things not being up to her taste or standard or the way she wanted/envisioned but she had this thing with food especially ever since she was a child. We aren’t from first world country so parents and family never thought that it could be a psychological issue. But she’s well in her 40s now reaching 50 soon and boy does she has problems with the quality of food, the way it smells, the way it’s cooked and what not. She was hardly happy with whatever our mom cooked and often her food issues were the first episode of her going into depression. She spent years in depression not letting anyone to help her. So going to a mental health professional is impossible. She would get angry with mom for not cooking good food that there used to be big drama every frickin’ day. Mom would literally take trays of food to her and she would throw food away. For example we could never fry egg or fish in home because it would annoy her so much that she would bang doors or close herself in the room. She has depression/anxiety issues but she never accepts it, never wants to hear about it, doesn’t want to take any medication or even go for counseling. But her behavior made our lives hell, my poor mom passed away lately and all her life she dealt with my sister’s weird eating habits. She looks for certain taste, certain quality it’s hard for me to explain but in simple words rarely happy with food. She’s married now and it’s affecting her marital life too. She doesn’t listen to anyone so giving her advice is useless m. I don’t know how we can help her so that her life gets bit easy and also she could stop making other people’s life hell as well. 

She has the same particularity with clothes, quality of cloth that it becomes so hard for her to buy anything for her. I mean I don’t know what all I can add here. Please help! Thank you in advance."
317,How can I train my brain?,"How can I train my brain and get rid of this filter in my head?
I have a filter that makes me chew my clothes, makes me socially awkward and limits me from certain things?
Is there anything I can train my brain and get rid of the filter so in the future I won’t chew my clothes, stop being socially and get rid of the limits?"
318,I can't afford to see anybody.,"I have a steady but stressful career as a teacher in a city that eats most of my pay for rent. I'm paying down student loans and a couple thousand credit debt with whatever little I can scrape together each month; sometimes that's nothing.

I've been here six years and have made no friends outside of work. I have work friends I've done things with in the past, but it's hard because they all have families and children, so even without COVID in the way, it's hard to do anything with them, anyhow.

Until this past year, I was in decent physical shape. I used to do bike racing every summer and spent a lot of time on the weekends during the school year training. It was good exercise and I felt good.

I gained 40lbs over the summer. I also started drinking a lot during some weeks, for no good reasons. Sometimes because I was sad and wanted to numb myself. Sometimes just boredom. The summer was bad because I had more time, but I've come home from work and poured myself a drink when this was previously never a thing. Yay for alcoholic tendencies (that I never struggled with before).

(That's improved at least since choosing to simply not to buy alcohol, save for what I sometimes cook with.)

My co-workers have noticed the weight gain and despite putting on my best mask, my depression, and expressed concern. I was given some names of people to see, but I can't because of money.

Insurance through work completely sucks. There are literally no in-network therapists or psychiatrists, and while my prescriptions are covered pretty well, seeing a doctor every month or so just to check in and be able to get refills can cost hundreds. I had a therapist for a while, and the price was reasonable, but last year he left the practice he was with to start his own and his price more than doubled.

More than a decade ago, I was in a car accident and suffered a brain injury that I mostly recovered from; since then, I've been on a mild anxiolytic, and that's been pretty good until this year. When I moved here, I had been taking a stimulant to help stay awake, and noone here will prescribe it to me since it's a controlled substance. For six years I've struggled to get through most days; weirdly, that didn't bother me a lot until this year, since coffee/tea helps and when I'm not depressed and during a normal school year, I can muster the energy to get through the day. Now that I'm depressed and teaching to students' backs or to a camera, it's just the caffeine, which doesn't help my anxiety and doesn't get me far enough by itself.

I feel lost and trapped and alone. I don't think I want to die, but I find myself on the worst days thinking that it'd be a nice release if I didn't wake up, or if a car swerved across the highway and hit me on the way home from work. I feel like crying myself to sleep most nights and I just don't have the tears or something. I lie in bed with knots in my stomach and butterflies until I fall asleep.

I don't know where to turn anymore and I don't think I have the money to get help in the long-term."

Ive also been definitely feeling tired, fatigued, and a need for some alone time.

Throughout all of this, there was this one girl I really loved. She was a dream come true to me, but things never really worked out. Because of the stress our situation-ship put me in, I turned into one of those douchebags who acts disrespectfully to their partners and is only in it for sex. It sucked. In the end, I did date her, but like most of my other relationships, it only
lasted a short amount of time, and now she's out of my life for good and there's a big, gaping hole in my heart. 

I don't miss her. She's too far gone from who I fell in love with for me to consider reaching out. We're both different people now, and that's okay. I'm in a new relationship now, and it's been nice. Longest relationship I've ever been in. I know it's taboo to compare your relationships, but my current relationship is seriously missing some of the emotional intimacy I had with the other girl. I don't want to engage in talk with other girls in any other than a friend way, but recently I find my brain telling me to talk to other girls. I hate it.

I was talking with my friends last night and they think I should break up with my girlfriend. I'm afraid to be a shitty guy again. I'm afraid that if this relationship ends, every change I've made to improve myself will disappear. But I can't go on in a relationship where I don't feel a deep emotional connection.

Can y'all help me out? What do I do?"

323,"Brain fog, no interest in surroundings - What’s this feeling?","Hello humans! Often after negative thoughts I settle into a mood where I can’t think properly, feel moderately to intensely tired, and lose nearly all interest in my surroundings. Which isn’t the greatest when those surroundings are friendly people, lampposts or moving cars... Or it’s the middle of the day and I should be doing coursework. Fun stuff :D  


I know how I feel, at least when I can remember, but don’t know what words to use so I can do my own research or have a proper convo with my counsellor. Is there a single term out there or is it just a common group of symptoms? Am pretty clueless here."
324,Will Medication Truly Help...?,"All of my friends say that mental health medication does wonders for them. For their anxiety and their depression, everyone says that this stuff helps.

I've tried two types of medication: Buspirone and Lexapro. I've never been diagnosed with anything, but my GP prescribed them because I had described some anxiety and depression symptoms, I suppose. Lexapro made me suicidal within a few days, maybe a week, but maybe that was a placebo-feeling? And then Buspirone made me so dizzy I could barely function normally. And neither seemed to do anything.

I'm wondering if I should try again, though. It sounds so...*good*. From what I've heard. Maybe I just didn't try long enough. But then again, I doubt anything will help. I'm just stupidly pessimistic about most things, and medication is one of them. Like, how much better could it be? Does medication truly help? Will it get rid of these symptoms, or help them:

* Complete Apathy / Emotional Numbness
* Inability to Write (I'm a writer) \[lasting weeks on end\]
* Sudden Panic \[lasting a few seconds to hours; multiple times a day\]
* Inability to Sleep
* Constantly Tense

Amongst other things, these are some of the most annoying symptoms. I wish they would go away so I could just write and write and *write* because I *adore* writing. But sometimes I can't. Sometimes I pull up the document and I *want* to write and nothing comes. I just feel hollow instead. Other days, I don't want to write and I fucking hate it. Those days, though, I hate everything.

I'm just not sure if it'll work, though. I don't want to end up *that* suicidal again. From the Lexapro, earlier. Nor do I want to be non-functioning dizzy, from the Buspirone. But I'm just...so tired of being tired. And I want something to work.

But then again, something in me says that I'm overexaggerating, and there's nothing wrong. I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. I don't even know where I'm going with this..."

326,Questions about my life,"I don’t know what mental illness I have or if I even have one but this is the first place I feel comfortable talking about this. 

I have been feeling off for about 2 weeks now, during the day I feel fine, I am very productive and high functioning but at night time (after 7:00) I become very sad and cry about absolutely nothing for about and hour before I sleep. 

Can anyone give me an idea of what is wrong with me or what I can do about it?

More info about me: I am 15 (m), I have had a good childhood with good parents, I am very active and played many sports until the quarantine when all I did was play video games and never went outside (possibly symptom/cause of illness)"
327,Is there a specific mental condition for this?,"Okay so I do this really weird thing and I don't know if it's something mentally wrong or if it's just a weird thing I do, basically I'll say random words without thinking, like I went down to grab my fox plushy and I verbally said fox even tho it's the middle of the night and no one was around me. If I feel cold I'll say, ""cold"" not I'm cold or it's cold just cold same goes for when I feel hot. It's the same with emotions I'll say sad I feel sad mad if I feel mad ect... 
     I never do it in my voice though it's always a high pitch anime voice that's small. I'll saying ow after yawing even though it didn't hurt. It's rlly weird. I have little to no control over it though. Like I realize they do it and I can stop myself but I almost never do stop myself cuz it's in the middle of the word.But I don't do it every single time I feel cold or every single time I feel mad. It's random"
328,My Brakeup,"Well I broke up with my first real SO a while ago. A lot surrounded that relationship. Early 2020 I kind of did something bad. It ended up with me loosing both my best friends and almost my SO. Shit that felt bad. For maybe a week I was just apathetically laying in my bed. 

I wasn’t really the best boyfriend. I especially realize that afterwards. I wasn’t able to spend all the time I should with her. After us being together for quite a while. Corona started and I was so stressed about school I thought my head was gonna explode. I am in nature science and and she is in social. Nature science is A LOT harder. We have 5 math courses over 3 years and they have 2 (easier ones). So I don’t really think she understood how stressed I was. Plus I’m shit at dealing with it. So she took it as I didn’t want to be with here anymore. I explained that this wasn’t the case but she didn’t listen. And she started to get jealous at my female friends. And she started talking about how other guys could be better to her. 

I’m no Alfa chad so this really hurt me. Especially since I really liked her. And in waves I became really really depressed. Not even being able to get to open my phone in bed to attend lessons. Or sleep. This went on for a while. After a time I realized I didn’t even want to meet her anymore. It was always the same shit. After sex or cuddles when I thought everything was good she always said “we need to talk”. Which would ultimately induced another wave. When things got the baddest we decided to brake up. When that happened It was like a big old chain was removed. Although I really liked her I’ve learned my lesson. We started first dating because of love and sex. We didn’t really know each other before that. Which I think was a mistake.

I’ll never date a girl again that I haven’t become really good friends with first. Even though love was there we didn’t fit all that good together. Best friends and lovers."
329,How should I feel?,"I just broke down in front of my dad and told him that I've been depressed, suicidal, spiraling out of control and that I need to see somebody. I don't know how to feel now. I don't know what I should do when I wake up tomorrow. I don't know if I should go on with life normally. He said we'd find someone to talk to but I don't know if I should wish I'd never said anything or if I'm going crazy. Any advice?"
330,"Go away, you’re not helping.","Dear Parents,

I understand you want to help, but you’re not. All you do is make me feel more anxious, suicidal, and worthless than I already feel. Please go away. Stop hovering over me. Leave me alone, please."
331,I (15M) am killing myself tomorrow night,"
I just got quarantined for 2 weeks because one of my parents got the rona. And this just happened a few weeks ago too bc a friend got the rona. And it takes a massive fucking toll on my mental health. Like most kids my age hate school, but it makes me feel better. It gets me out and interacting with people that I wouldn’t otherwise. And I love talking to one of my teachers. We normally talk about just some random topic, but I always enjoy it. And it’s like a highlight for my whole day. 

Like what the hell is the point in saying “Oh but it’ll be better in 2 weeks so I’m not going to kms”? Because it will still only get a little better and my life will still be shit as soon as I step off that bus. And if I kms, that’s end. No more pain, no more suffering, just eternal darkness and I won’t even know I’m there, it’ll be like when I was a fetus. Just nothingness and you don’t even know you exist. So then I don’t have to deal with the 2 weeks of complete shit and then the rest of my pointless shitty life. 

I have to deal with constant screaming or them preaching about some bible shit or them fucking. Literally all I ever hear is those 3 things unless I deafen myself with music. And who will miss me? And why does it matter cuz it won’t effect me anymore. And so what? They will be sad for a little bit of time? I don’t care because I’ll be gone and it doesn’t fucking affect me. 

The only reason I’ve even made it this far is bc of my dog but he is getting old and I hate to see him how he is anymore. He used to love the fall and winter, and he won’t even be able to play in the leaves or snow this year, if he even makes it to the winter. Now he literally can’t even jump onto the footstool I keep by the couch for him. 

I’m sorry for wasting your guys time. Don’t even worry about all that shit like “don’t do it man, it gets better” because every time I’ve been told that it never gets better. I’m determined I’m doing it, I just wanted to tell someone. And since you guys don’t know me, I figured it would be best."
332,"PLEASE HELP me figure out what’s wrong with my mental health, I’m scared...","This is my first ever post, and pretty overwhelming for me, so please bear with me if I’m all over the place. 

I have struggled with mental health issues since I hit puberty at 9. Since then, my mental health has been in a steep decline, and being 20 now, I worry for my future self if I continue to allow my mental health to deteriorate at the rate that it is now. 

I was in therapy from age 11-18, and while it did help, it didn’t eliminate any of the strong emotions I felt. I continued to self harm until I was 14 (started at 10) and always felt too ashamed to talk to my therapist about something so personal. Recently, I have begun to self harm again, but in a different way than before. 

Previously, it usually required some thought, like going into the bathroom knowing what I was going in there for. Now, it is completely impulsive, and something that is almost impossible for me to control. It’s happening more and more frequently lately, and it’s starting to scare me. An example being last night, I had an anxiety attack in my car and began slamming my head onto the steering wheel, seriously bruising my face. I didn’t even realize that’s what I was doing until it was over. what the fuck is wrong with me?

I am increasingly paranoid, whether that be thinking my boyfriend of 5 years is cheating on me (he’s not, and there’s 0 evidence he ever has), or closing my blinds right when it gets dark because I believe someone is going to be out there watching me sleep. I also talk to myself often, more than I believe other people do. No one ever talks back, but I answer my own questions, and refer to myself as “we” in my thoughts, and when talking to myself. 

I have panic attacks often. These range from frantic breathing to uncontrollable self harm, and everything in between. These feelings of panic often occur in the morning, when I realize I have another entire day of thought and emotion ahead of me.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD before and have been on both Prozac and Lexapro at different times. Neither of these seemed to help me very much. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist today, listing those symptoms as what I need help with, because I don’t know what else this could be. I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me, and it’s so frustrating to have that brushed off as just being depressed. Even though I am depressed and anxious, what I’m feeling now goes so much deeper than that, and I feel like I’m losing control. I want to put a name to this so I am able to help myself better, and not just brushed off as having severe anxiety or depression.

I know there’s more to it than what I’ve been diagnosed with, but I don’t know how to help myself if I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like I’m losing my mind quickly, and am scared of taking impulsivity too far. Please help me figure out what’s wrong with me."

It's hard to see the light at the end. What helped you get out of a depression rut?
335,I think I need help,"I posted this in another subreddit as well.

I have recently entered high school and I noticed that I can’t stop doing things such as overthinking and worrying. I have noticed that hobby’s I have always loved my brain tells me to quit them and says people hate me for it. I’m also trying to get into some new hobby’s which I’m really struggling with because my mind won’t rest and always wants me to stop doing them even though I enjoy the hobby. My mind is constantly focused on if I do that who will hate me and my current status with my friends. If I don’t do anything with friends for at least 3 days usually I also feel completely separated and lonely even though it’s been three days. School does not make this any better because I tend to drift off in class and that’s when the thoughts get really bad and there is not much I can do at school. I miss the days where I would just do things and not care what others thought and would never overthink things and just live life. These thoughts get really emotional draining and when I’m too drained the thoughts still enter nonstop and make me do things such as this where I seek help from others. This is something I’m really afraid to tell my parents and friends about because I feel like they might not understand and say I’m overreacting and to suck it up or they would stop being friend with me. These thoughts tend to make it hard to feel like best friends with anybody which makes me think my friend might abandon me if I do something different. My school has a schedule set up ( because of covid ) to where I won’t see my friends at all one day but see them a lot the next and the day I don’t see them at all I always have anxiety for and very lonely. During these days I can’t stop the thoughts at all and I really hate them, sometimes I even tell my parents I want to e-learn instead that day because the comfort of my room can help me a bit, but they always say no because I’m too scared to tell them the whole reason why I don’t want to go to school. When I’m with friend however I feel like the burden was lifted even though right after they leave it’s back. I really wish I could manage to escape these thoughts permanently but no matter what I try they always come back and drain me emotionally and cause me to do things such as this where I write things such as this (on a alt account because I don’t want friends and family to find this). I really want these thoughts to stop but I’m to scared to tell anybody. I’m pretty sure nobody knows I even have problems such as these, they just think I’m lonely and shy when I choose to dodge conversations that spark these thoughts. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I also don’t tell anybody because I have really bad trust issues and don’t tell secrets to anybody no matter who they are. Anything I can do that might help me out even if it’s just a little. Also sorry if this was long this is the one time I can really write out how I feel (This isn’t all of it either this is just all I chose to put in because it was the worst parts)."

All I have to do now is keep writing and explain my results. I know I'm so close to finishing but I'm having a really bad time with my anxiety, I still have the feeling that I'm going to fail and I procrastinate a lot.

341,I'm had a panic attack for the first time in years...,"In college I had my first panic attack. I was in the middle of class and was dealing with a suicidal ex the night before and I couldn't focus on class due to the awful worries in my head. He hadn't said he was going to kill himself that night but he was acting the same way he had when he said it in the past. I started feeling my heart rate accelerate and I actually excused myself from class to go to the bathroom where it got worse. I called my mom because I legitimately thought I was having a heart attack. She informed me it was a panic attack and talked me through it while I tried to calm down in the bathroom.

I had a few more over the following months and sought therapy services from my school which were free. I don't know that they helped much, but it did feel good to just rant to someone about my life and the things I felt. By the time I graduated 2 years after I had stopped having them though I was still incredibly depressed.

Ive been home for 3 years now and the past 2 I've been steadily pulling myself out of it. Despite all the crap of 2020 my mental health has mostly been stable if not maybe a little detached but I feel okay. 

Anyway I had been hanging out with an old friend of mine who I used to be fwb with and we went to a Halloween party yesterday (stupid I know please refrain from the covid comments) and as we were driving there I recognized the route... It was to a party house I had been to with my college ex. I was silently freaking out in the backseat trying to convince myself it wasn't the same house but it was... And then I tried to convince myself he wouldn't be there... He was. I immediately saw him and felt like I was going to faint. The old feeling of a panic attack set in again and I pulled my fwb aside and told him my ex was here. He said it was okay and to just stick close to him. I did and my ex noticed me but didn't say anything while I did my damnedest to avoid eye contact and was silently thankful I had caked on Halloween makeup so you couldn't see how red my face was.

now I've spent since last night basically unable to relax and unable to ease my anxiety. It just brought up so many awful things that happened to me, including being sexually assaulted by my exes best friend and roommate (he has no idea). I just need some advice on how to ease anxiety.

I need to know if these are things I should be concerned about or if I should only seek help if they begin to effect my current life negatively.

I'm not going to recount my whole life story, just some of the worrying things that my memory has dug up that don't seem to be pointing to positive things.

Trigger warning

- regularly tore out my own hair as a toddler to the point my mom shaved my head

- was sexually assaulted by my older sister at a very young age, leading to some disturbing sexual and physical daydreams/fantasies that I still carry with me to this day. (Gets better every year)

- phyically and mentally abused by same older sister throughout childhood (screaming, manhandling, pinching skin, pulling hair, throwing dangerous objects and threatening bodily harm, lying, manipulation of patents and siblings ect.)

- I intentionally became a ""buffer"" between same older sister and the rest of my younger siblings

- developed lying habit to protect myself and siblings
 
- never had freinds or played with anyone outside my family 

- developed a ""justice complex"" as my family calls it and spoke my mind openly about things that didn't seem right

- was suggested by highschool counselor to get ""professional help"" after recounting to her my day to day.... me and my mother both laughed

- have a weird need to feel ""abrasion"" on my skin, during one particularly emotional summer four years ago I walked by and ground my shoulder and arms into every tree I saw. Never drew blood, but just had a weird compulsion to feel something rough scrape against my skin. Same summer took a walk in the woods to clear my mind and whipped myself repeatedly with a raspberry vine till I was coverd in micro abrasions. I let cats tear up my hands and arms willingly and used to make sculptures with chicken wire so that my arms would be covered in scratches. I don't do this anymore since I recognized it as a potential problem but I still have vivid feelings/daydreams of my back and shoulders being whipped/beaten/slashed/shot.

- have never gotten along well with people and am outwardly emotionally/sexually repressed and inwardly sexually and emotionally unbridled. I'm getting better every year but I still feel incredibly distant from people, like I don't/can't understand their logic or reasoning.

- I haven't cried for 4 years but regularly find myself choked up over the weirdest things, (usually eating alone) can never cry though, my head begins to hurt massively and everything halts to stop the pain from growing.

- about a year ago, after a bad social encounter I drove home to my uncontrollable manic laughter. I couldn't stop, not till I pulled into my parking lot, and I was scaring myself.

So heres the thing: I am a functional adult with goals and ambitious. This stuff isn't causing me current harm or loss, it's just stuff that is. ""It is what it is""
But I am worried that if any of this gets mentioned/comes up that it will lead to me getting denied. Do any of these things seem like they need to be overseen by another individual or am I good to keep working on them myself? Should I be seeking help or should I just wait and see if they begin to negatively impact my life in uncontrollable ways?"

347,Is my partner schizophrenic? Or experiencing psychosis?,"My partner (31f) is very smart, articulate, and driven (when she wants to be) I love her and we get along great with these symptoms not getting in the way of our day to day most of the time.

She was severely abused as a child but appears on the outside (to everyone else atleast) to be an easy going, organized, and well adjusted adult.

We've been together for 5 years and I've noticed some oddities in her behavior, especially when she's stressed that are concerning to me. 

If she is alone in a room but its not normal self talk.. she mumbles and talks about things that aren't even happening or will just mumble and say certain words out loud that make no sense. She will stop if I come into the room but sometimes she does it when I'm around. 

She has a hair trigger temper and when we fight (which is rarely) its like she trys to stay calm, think things through and then makes a connection to something I've done that has nothing to do with the argument or topic and get so angry she has to excuse herself. She may or may not mumble to herself about the topic after she has left the room. If we are in public she doesn't do this and will behave normally.

She sleeps irregularly at night. She acts out violent nightmares and wakes up in sweats nightly. Often, she'll wake up and look out the windows or check all the locks. Once she told me she thought aliens were breaking in but has never brought up the subject again. If I ask her simply says she sleeps better when she's sure everything is locked up. But she needs a night light and will absolutely panic if she wakes up in a dark room.

Sometimes she crys sporadically. She will excuse herself to do this but she inconsolably sad for hours or days on end. She cannot go to work during these bouts.

Sometimes we will wake up in the morning and she wakes up but its like nobody is home. She'll either lay in bed or get up and move to the couch or the a chair in the kitchen and sit there for (anywhere from 2-24) hours without a phone, TV or book, just staring into nothing. I can talk to her during this but she reply with short yes, no and vague answers and doesn't engage in conversation. Its like she's gone. 

At my encouragement she started seeing a psychologist 4 years ago who suggested that she has severe depression and deeply rooted PTSD. Her psychologist mentioned that she hides her symptoms so well because she is a ""master manipulater"" something that was quite un-nerving to hear. 

She has active hobbies and a decent group of friends who she specializes with regularly. They do not notice any of these symptoms. I didn't notice them until we moved in together.

Her tharapist encouraged her to get on moodstabilizers and anti-depressants. But we soon found out she was allergic to SSRIs and she has been in medicated for 3 years.

During quarintine this last spring her symptoms worsened. It affected every aspect of her life. She was usually so diligent about her credit. She pays all of our bills and never missed a payment in the 4 years We've lived together. Over the course of a month all of that stopped. When she wasnt checked out, she was isolating in the house and taking to herself. Then she just disappeared on a hiking trip in the Serrias for 2 weeks and came back acting herself again. We agreed she needed to get on medication.

The new psychiatrist suggested went over her symptoms, came to the conclusion that she was not showing psychotic symptoms and suggested since she had ADHD as a child that adderall would level her out. So she did not get on moodstabilizers or anti-psycotics like we had previously talked about. She got on adderall and xanax. 

She never takes the xanax and thinks the adderall is gong great. I dont agree. Yes, she has been cleaning the house more, she seems happier and hasn't checked out mentally since she's been on it. Shes taking care of chores and her boss at work has told her that her work has improved significantly. She got a $11/hr raise as a result which is great for us since I was let go due to cutbacks. But her nightmares, self talks and erratic behavior is at a peak at home, along with some new and disturbing behavior. Her feet cramp uncontrollably and they curl inwards. It looks like the exorcist. She complains of how painful it is and has a hard time waking. She also just falls. Like just drops maybe 2-3 times a week and has no idea why. Shes covered in brusies. On top of that the adderal makes her sweaty, she smells like she's run a marathon at the end of every day. I'm worried she may be schizophrenic and the adderall is increasing her symptoms and that she is not eating as much on it causing her to experience these massive muscle cramps, body twitches and loss of coordination as a result. 

I'm worried for her and don't know how to get her help."

Me: *pulling out a box of hair dye* we dye our hair red!! 
My therapist, also with red hair: well yes but-"
349,Effexor Experiences/Anti-depressant Experiences?,I just started taking my Venlafaxine again due to my depression and I was wondering about others experiences on effexors? The main side effect i’ve experienced since going back on is loss of appetite and drowsiness. I have an appointment with my doctor soon and I’m thinking about switching meds since I struggle a lot with weight gain. I’ve always fallen off taking them due to side effects (haven’t tried any other medications). If anyone has any experiences they’d like to share that’d be great :)
350,Turning Your Life Around in the Midst of Depression/Anxiety and Burnout,"I could really use some advice on this because I feel like I keep slipping and circling around the drain. Have any of you who suffer from depression and anxiety ever suffered from burnout in your job and life and were you finally able to come out of it and be happy with yourself and your life? What was your experience. 

For context, I have been suffering through a bout of depression and anxiety for about 3 and a half years or so. While I have always had issues with low self esteem, since I have been going through this depression and anxiety, my life has gotten noticably worse. My mind used to be pretty sharp and I used to show more initiative in saying and doing things; both at home and in my job. I'm 36yo woman with PCOS. I work as a junior projects coordinator in an all-male IT office. Now, I've hit burnout in my job and become a shut-in in my office. I don't talk to co-workers or anyone else really except my husband. I've always been an introvert and never good with talking with people, but now it has turned into social anxiety.  I've lost motivation and drive to do a lot of things (at home and at work) and I feel physically exhausted all the time. It has gotten to the point that it has affected my concentration to do tasks and my mind is no longer as sharp or quick on the draw as it used to be. I also have a lot of crying spells or get agitated and angry very quickly about things. I just don't feel very happy about myself and some aspects of my life right now.

I'm really scared that I am just a ticking timebomb waiting to happen and that I am going to hurt any relationships that I currently have as well as possibly lose my job. I have been trying a few things to see if it will help, but it usually helps for a little bit and then I feel myself sliding back to where I was or worse. I am currently taking Buproprion for the depression, along with supplements for women's health and some specifically for my PCOS. I also see my therapist regularly. 

I guess I am just looking for feedback on what else I can try and do, because I am really wanting out of feeling like this. I don't know how much more of this that I can take."
351,Where do I begin? I can't enjoy who I am.,"Hi guys, I hope you're all doing well tonight.

It's kind of unusual for me to reach out like this. I'm all over the place, so apologies for anything confusing, etc. I'm feeling a bit isolated lately and just wanted to say hi and share my situation with you guys. Over the past 1-2 years, I've been struggling with accepting myself for who I am. I suffer from anxiety and low mood which has been seriously impacting my life. 

I'm doing a degree in Psychology (2nd attempt as last year was worse than 2020 for me...believe it or not!) and I need this to take priority...

From not being able to answer a phone call, to being convinced that I am one of the worst people I know. Every second of my life is riddled with bad thoughts, second guesses, and just negativity in general.

I'm spending my life questioning my own thoughts and actions so much. I feel I've become disconnected with myself (Assuming I was ever connected in the first place..). I don't have a passion, a hobby, or even the ability to relax...because I feel like I have *become* my mental health issues.

I'm losing my emotions to this disorder and it feels horrible. The only way I can feel safe is through unhealthy things. Things that bring about even more negativity. I've pretty much smoked my way through this pandemic,  I'm constantly worried about everything, yet from every perspective I take, I'm the only one creating the issues.

Sleeping is the worst. It's 5 am and I can't get to sleep. Thoughts of doubt and frustration flood my thoughts every time I close my eyes.

It's impacting my relationship, my education, my finances, and not to sound selfish or anything...but it's impacting **me**, and I want to stop it! 

How do I break this cycle??"
352,Bunbury,Has anyone been to Bunbury Psyc ward what is it like ? Can you go outside during covid ?
353,I need someone to talk to.,I’ve been dealing with some stuff in my life recently and just need someone to talk to and go to with my problems. I don’t have anyone in my life that I feel comfortable telling a lot of the stuff that I’d on my mind. If someone out there is willing to listen I would greatly appreciate it.
354,"Mind unravelling like a ball of string, and I need help to reel it back in.","Apologies in advance if this is long winded but I needed to give some context. I (28M) have suffered from various mental health issues since the end of high school and have turned to Reddit many times over the years (mostly bookmarking a selection of other people’s helpful posts and supportive threads), but recently I’ve decided to engage more and felt the need post for myself this time. I’ve been through dark times before but right now it feels like I’m in the throes of a full blown mental/nervous breakdown, or having some kind of slow-burning panic attack, and I’ve never felt this bad before. 

&amp;#x200B;

There’s a lot of background but I’ll try and keep it succinct. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and depression and have been treating them with counselling and medication off and on for years. A couple of months ago I decided to come off my small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) for good, which has been difficult but largely steady. I have been surprisingly stable this year, mainly due to being extremely busy with study earlier in the year during our worst periods of lockdown/covid panic (I’m in Australia). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I find myself partially unemployed with a lot of free time and have been trying to be more involved online, posting more on Reddit, trying to find good online communities to join etc, in an attempt to stave off the feelings of isolation and not seeing friends often at the moment, as most people are. 

&amp;#x200B;

But something flicked like a switch a week or two ago and what started as a feeling of slight gloom and depression has become a deep sense of dread and anguish that is with me 24/7, from when I wake up to when I will myself to pass out. It feels like a plug has been pulled in my brain and the vortex of chaotic thoughts and worries are spiralling down the plughole, too confused and frantic to make any sense of. I’m grasping and some kind of thread to hold onto but it just slips through my fingers every time.

I’m juggling very personal, internal worries about my own existence, where I’m heading in life, what I should do with myself, how other people will view me and my accomplishments, and feelings of being generally behind, and massive external ones like where the world is heading, how insane politics and society are and how the internet seems to be full of horrible insanity no matter which way you turn. I feel more alone than ever and at the same time, like I'm being watched and scrutinised, whatever I do.

I could go on, these are all things that have weighed on individually before, but not like this. 

My very basic self diagnosis is that this is a combination of information overload, complete erosion of my sense of self, and the state of the world in 2020 finally catching up to me. I intend to to take a long break from the internet and social media because I can’t see any other way out, but I just need someone to hear me, lend any kind of support empathy or understanding, or advice about how to get out of this mess.

I have a loving family and partner and a pretty solid group of friends, but I feel so disassociated at the moment that I just needed to try and put it down in writing and shoot it out into the anonymity of the internet. I feel like I’m really losing the plot. I want to have hope again, because right now I’d rather just end it."
355,"I've always distrusted by family, especially my mom","I remember when I was 5, I really disliked my mom. Like, unnaturally disliked. It's like I viewed my sister as my surrogate mother; I remember once crying when I was away from her. Maybe my older brother taught me, since he really hated my mom for having taken our family to America when he was 10. As I grew older, I learned to love my mom, but somehow, the suspicion always lingered. I distrusted my older brother too, since he would always ridicule me for my interests and for acting like a kid (he was going through his angsty teen phase, compounded by being in a foreign country and our poor socioeconomic status as immigrants). And my older sister was hardly even there. I felt so alone as a child, I felt like a paranoid alien.

I feel bad for my younger self. I was always too uptight, I never got to act like a kid. One moment my mom gives me a lot of affection, another minute she's screaming at me. She now expects me to do things she never taught or instilled in me, like have a work ethic. Who was supposed to teach me that? I put on the veneer of being self-reliant, of doing things by myself, but I can't seem to get my emotions or that lingering feeling of alienation in order.

I threw a lot of tantrums when I was a kid. I couldn't control my emotions, I was a loose cannon. In hindsight, I feel like I did it all for attention. I'm the one to blame, I should've behaved myself back then. I guess all I wanted was the feeling that I was wanted somewhere, and having a meltdown always gave it to me. But I was wanted. It's not like my mom hates me or anything. So why don't I feel it? What's wrong with me? Am I innately broken?

I've always felt apart from the other kids. I always felt powerlessness blanketing me. I felt like I wanted some control over my life even as a little kid. But why? That's not how a kid should act, that's not normal child psychology. But that was me, too self-conscious to live, wanting to melt in the background, couldn't control my meltdowns, too emotionally unstable to cope... I locked away my emotions and wore a thin façade. I needed to help myself, I had no one in the world. I have no one in the world.

I just want to be blanketed by the warmth of someone. I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's all going to be alright. But it won't. I'm an adult, I'm 18, yet I feel like less and less of an adult and more like a stunted man-child. People said I was mature for my age, but maturity is relative. I always knew there was something wrong with me, I was too different from the other kids (even though I just wanted to be carefree) but I was too helpless to stop it. Now all I do is wallow, maybe try fixing myself, let the discontent wash over me, and start again. What's at the root?

I'm typing this on a screen. I've stared at a screen for the vast majority of my life. It's all been screens, my escape, a reality where I could be a million people and nobody at the same time. Somewhere in which I could disguise myself, so that I could be protected from judgment, from the rot inside my soul. I donned many personalities, so many masks that I hardly know who I am inside, who I could've been, if only I had been up to the task of being a human being. I'm not sure if I really am human. If you shatter glass into a million, billion pieces, when does it cease to be glass and merely become sand, or particles? That's where I am right now. 

I want to learn how to love. I want to learn responsibility. All of the human things, away from the surreality of this screen. I want something real. So why am I so distrustful, so hollow? Why don't I know who I am? Why do I have no identity, no purpose, nothing but my own fantasies that there could be a single person I could fully trust?

I wish I was normal. My childhood counselors always said that it was alright to be different. But there's the good different, and the bad different. I'm the bad different. I wish I could love, but it's like everyone else is prickly. I'm trapped in my shell and can only see glimpses of life from here"
356,How do I fix my body language?,I usually overthink I will start acting weird. This will make others uncomfortable and I usually end up doing so. I just freak out by being to much self conscious and it's affecting my daily life even with my family.
357,CyberBullying Trauma,"Hey guys,, it's a pretty long story so I'll try to stay short. As a kid, I only had one friend ever.. the rest of my classmates ignored me and some of them were fake friends, my friend left in 5th grade I was lonely for the rest of my days at school ALWAYS. So at 11 I started making online friends behind my parents backs, taking pics of my face, skyping them etc. Those online kids told me I should kill myself s\*\*ually harassed me and threatened to come to my town and attack me. I was terrified for endless days, crying under my blanket, never told any of my family or only friend. I gave them chances to see if they could be better friends. They never did, I took revenge and spread some rumors to release my pain, and said sorry in the end, THEY NEVER DID! so I left them

   At 13, I found other friends. This time they were nice, and I was too. Until my close friend took offense of my silly jokes. I told them their drawings reminded me of my toys (because they were both drawings about superheroes, I wasn't saying their drawings look simple as toys) They were offended by something as silly as that! I accidentally swore at their friends and at them one time. I explained my mistakes were because I was a teenager and that I'm bad at talking to people because I don't have many friends!! Until one day after years of deep friendship, a lot of gifts given to them and a lot of jokes shared, they decided to leave me!! Because I lied behind their back to make a heartbroken girl feel better (she's heartbroken from my close friend) We were talking in secret about their weaknesses their unfair words! The girl said that my close friend made fun of her disease. So i had to do it to fix the relationship. I felt guilty after the secret conversation so (like an idiot) I decided to risk it and tell the truth because they are a friend! But they don't like honesty! and definitely not stupid mistakes or jokes :( so they blocked me and left me for life, even though they forgave me for about 5 times. I got better and tried my best. 

  When they did it, I started shaking from fear and crying to the point that my face aches from puckering too much. I promised myself not to use social media again to connect with people, unless it's a necessity (like here) Every time i try to type something to anyone I think too hard about my words and get scared if it'll hurt someone's feelings and sometimes I end up doing it without knowing why it's hurtful (I'm an honest person and i don't mind it if someone swore at me) So one time someone was offering to help me and i said ""You're not always available!"" and that hurt them,, no offence but people are so sensitive these days!!! I don't find that hurtful at all. in addition, I wanted to address a fictional character's height by saying their shortness is cute, but i didn't wanna hurt the author!! It ends up they weren't. I don't wanna sound rude but my close friend made me think that everyone on earth could potentially be like them! and that's why my brain thinks that everyone sucks!! (including me) and that everyone is  a crybaby! This isn't fair I wanna do social media but I don't think I can anymore. Why? Because of Trauma.

 *I'd rather feel nothing at all*  
*Than have to deal with all the pain inside my heart*  
*When she died I swore I'd never love again*  
*And it's been years, but I'm still calloused up like this* \-Nathan Wagner, Trauma.

How can I feel better and post again? I have many things I need to share with the world.

I'm also partially extroverted so it sucks to feel like this. I miss meeting people."
358,Am I a sadist?,"I went to haunted house. It was nothing special at first. I’m not saying I’m not scared or it was boring, they did a good work. The monsters look real, the actors work there putting up effort. I love and appreciate it.

Towards the end, there is this actor all tied up, her legs cut off, and she was crying, looking at me, hoping I’ll help. Of course I know she was acting but she was pretty convincing. I’m excited. To me she was the most beautiful aspect in this haunted house. 

I stare at her, I wanted to touch her but I know it’s not allowed. I even looked back when we past her. I looked and move on for like two or three steps before I saw a tall figure. I thought he was a guest. I lost focus. For a minute we just stand at each other, my mind is still on her. It hits me when he signal me it’s time to get out. Then I know he was one of the actor with chainsaw. Maybe he played as the killer. 

On my way back I began to think. Why is the only thing that excite me was the victim? Nothing more. I love rape hentai, porn, and I stopped liking the part where the girl gave in. I want the girl to fight, scream, be hopeless. Somehow it’s always girl I want to suffer. 

But I can’t stand animal being abused by human. I love the primal aspect where a carnivore eats their prey. To me, death or dying is beautiful. 

Does that mean I’m a sadist? Should I get help? 
What extent do you think I should get help?"
359,Has anyone experienced post-university depression too?,"Hi everyone,

For many people, change isnt easy. Change especially is difficult when it involves a large life-style change. Graduating university, and the change in lifestyle that resulted was one of the hardest things I had to ever experience, I got OCD (scrupolosity), GAD levels through the roof, and depression during the period I graduated until now (four years ago until now)

&amp;#x200B;

**I lived through episodes of SEVERE trauma in my childhood. I hated highschool, but i looked forward for a fresh start in univeristy. I got into an esteemed University which meant that for ONCE, i was a success.** **University was that ""free"" space for me; where I could be ME and no one could judge me. S**ociety is nice to college students; they get to be big kids basically. Now? Now im a 28 year old who is working full time... im someone who feels like the eyes of the world is on him. **Why dont I have my own family yet? Why aren't I making enough money? Why am I not a child any more? (I say this as my hairline continues to recede.)**

I'll be honest, i kinda knew those four years would be amazing for me, so I honestly did brush off alot of things. Unfortunately, brushing off things is never good for your mental health.

Its been four years since I graduated. I've experienced the worst mental health crises of my life. I just want to feel free and fully happy again. Maybe Ill get there again. Maybe I had to have had this period, to express and release my **trauma.** 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your experiences with this, if any?"
360,Is having normal weight now considered wrong too?,"Hello guys!

So, I had been a fairly skinny person almost all my life due to my fast metabolism. I'm an undergrad now and have gained weight ever since I left highschool. I wasn't studying what I like, putting off stuff for tommorow and was going through a rough patch emotionally. As a result, I started over-eating and gained weight. 

I realised my problem soon and changed my diet, lifestyle and habits. I lost weight but I'm not as skinny as I used to be before. But I love my body this way, it looks healthier and better. I'm neither over-weight nor under-weight.

I met some of my cousins few days back, they're super skinny. And you must have anticipated what happens next. They started shaming my body because I'm not as skinny as them. I have a cousin who's just two days younger than me, so we have a pretty good bond. But lately, my family members have started comparing me with her as she's quite thin. 

It bothers me alot, when people inadvertently compare and comment on my body. I absolutely adore my curves, my body looks healthier and more alive than it was before. But this ideology, that being skinny is being pretty, has been ingrained so deep in our society that sometimes I feel that even having normal weight is considered substandard."
361,Intrusive thoughts about getting hit by a car?,"Maybe it’s cuz I have anxiety and live by a roadway but I smoke weed outside and I sometimes have these weird thoughts.

I don’t think I want to die? Never have? Just anxiety right?"
362,I feel sick to my stomach around people I don't know; especially the opposite gender.,"So, the title pretty much says it all. I start feeling extremely nauseous around new people, or at the thought of meeting new people especially if they are women I'm attracted to. It kind of makes it difficult to meet people or form any meaningful relationship and I'm starting to feel really lonely. I've been single for almost 11 years(I'm 28) and the last girl I was with we didn't have a very long or serious relationship, but it was still fun. My mom died about 4 years ago of brain cancer and she was the person I would talk to about my problems like this. Now I'm either too embarrassed or I don't want to bother my friends or family with my problems. Been to a couple therapists and it didn't really help. It sort of seemed like they didn't take my issue that seriously. I guess it isn't: I'm not suicidal or depressed - just lonely and I think it's pretty normal to want to find a SO at my age. 

Is this normal? None of my friends seem to have this issue. Also it gets awkward when my friends or dad asks why I don't have a girlfriend. I said I wasn't interested, and they just stopped asking after a while. Pretty sure they think I'm either gay or weird, but honestly I'm just tired and embarrassed of trying to explain it to people and it gets me nowhere anyways.

Does anyone have any advice, or has experienced the same thing? I haven't found much about this kind of anxiety online."
363,End of times night terrors.,"This year has been a strange one and heavy on us with mental health but this kinda rocked me.


Call me crazy but I suffer from PTSD and with that I get night terrors. Usually flashbacks of violence or similar past scenarios . The last week it’s been like end of the world night terrors seeing dark figures wanting to take me away somewhere . I yell as I usually do in my night terrors and wake up in a panic . Only recently I’ve been calling out to God, specifically JC to help me please . I yell it in my dream state and just like I would yell out loud in my regular night terrors, same with these but way more intense than usual. And since the first night terror like this I’ve felt this impending doom. Like darkness is coming , like for real darkness. Am I losing it am I finally losing it? Feedback would be greatly appreciated .

I’ll try to give specific details if anyone wants to know or is curious . TIA"
364,I’m not okay anymore.,"Make it short as possible 
I’m almost 27 had success in many jobs.
But my mental state has got to the point I just don’t even want to hold on anymore there’s a hole in my heart and it has stopped bleeding. It’s just empty now. 
I have done tons of different jobs in the last years since 16 ( drop out ).
Therapist confused doesn’t think I should work anymore system doesn’t want to put me on support. 
I’ve tried just about every anti depressant and antipsychotic out there ( and I mean that literally through last 5 years trying to fix my mental state and trying meds therapy etc. ) 
I’ve exhausted my resources whether be friend doctors meds therapist etc. 
I don’t know where to go now, only reason I have a home is because of corona virus support. After this it looks like I’m going to be homeless. My mind is insanely complex, no way I can even begin describe. But I’ve been diagnosed with ocd and bipolar disease as well adhd and severe depression. I’ve been on so many meds I feel like a fucking test rat. 
Doctors are actually circling back to try old drugs now that failed previously and I’m scared to even talk to doctors at this point because all the antipsychotics and anti depressants make me very weird and suicidal and I don’t think I can slip into that state one more time. 

I don’t know what the hell to do I’m alone now girl left me friends left me family is confused and I’m just a burden. Doctors keep pushing meds that make me suicidal previously. I don’t know what to do anymore I am scared and alone and I just don’t think I’m suppose to be here."
365,"""I want someone to hug me and tell me that it's okay"" -- but what if I want a specific person?","""I want someone to hug me and tell me that it's okay.""

This sentence flows easily off the tongue. 

But what if you don't want just anyone to hug you and hold you together?

What if you want one person in particular to do that for you? That person who always manages to inadvertently and unintentionally calm you down just by being present.

Do you get me?"
366,I don't understand what is wrong with me.,"I have felt unhappy with my life for years now. I always end up thinking that this is nothing and that everything will be better next year only for it look worse. I really don't know if my expectations of life are not realistic. I don't know if how I feel hurts me or not.

I have notice how I look forward to sleep more and more, how I care less about my hygiene because I care less about going outside my house and how I paralyze when anything in my life gets difficult. It looks like anxiety or depression or something on that line but I really can't tell. And the more I think about it the more it looks like I'm searching for justification for my failures.

I really don't know what to get from any of this. I have thought about seeing a therapist. In fact I have seen one for a couple of times when it was asked of me by a doctor. I had a minor issue while I was in a stressful situation and they thought it might be related. I had nothing useful from the therapist. Everything we talked about ended up in things that I already know. And the few people that know about this have not helped either. I don't know how it would help me to see a therapist. I really don't know what to do or what to think."
367,"I'm a severe hypochondriac, could I get some advice?","So, I (18M) watched a video about a dude who cut off his lymph nodes and developed some sort of severe terminal brain injury that lead to his death around 2 years ago. Fast forward to today, and I'd honestly say many people who know me have seen my personality change for the worse in terms of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Things like cannabis, alcohol, and other brain stimulants were never really a fear of mine during middle school and earlier on in my life. At the time, I just didn't think much of them, I thought they were cool, and maybe I'd one day try them. Entering high school I'd developed a fear of that kind of stuff, the concept that I'm not in a perfect mind-state and that I'm stunting the development of my brain sent shivers down my spine. Not to mention the environment becoming more stressful, and my ability to draw the attention of my peers and lead a successful social life had diminished. Nonetheless, I did smoke weed and ate edibles back in grade 10, I remember feeling as though I was trapped in my own head, and as though the feelings I was experiencing were unreal, the first few trips I had were honestly pretty pleasurable. I've always had a racing mind that was always overthinking about things, but for once, it just felt like me and my head thinking odd thoughts. That was all okay until I had my first bad trip. This was after I had seen concerning information about brain health and other things, as well as the fact my vision had worsened a bit and my concentration also suffered some. This trip was as if all my fears had manifested into my personality. I was saying crazy things like, ""I can't feel my tongue!"" Or feeling my heart beating out of my chest... But on my right side... and it wasn't even beating hard. Since then, I've slowly felt as though I've disconnected from reality. I had a panic attack about 2 years ago, and at the time I thought nothing of it, until they happened more often. Admittedly, working out and getting sunlight helped a lot with dealing with my anxiety, but with the upcoming season and quarantine on top of having no school, my mind can't help but think of scary thoughts all the time. It's gotten so bad that whenever I see a mental disorder or any condition, I'll worry about getting it myself. I can't even get good sleep because feeling my heartbeat scares me. Even though I have a very healthy heart. Asides from the fact people around me know I'm more anxious, I'd like to think they all believe I'm a pretty loving and caring person, and I do really love my family and friends, but this anxiousness is debilitating. I want to feel IN THE MOMENT for my family's future life events, but I always feel like I'm in my own head overthinking things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a wits end. I'd never think of self-harm or harming others, but I don't know if I have the mental fortitude to deal with my own constant overthinking much longer without becoming some sort of lunatic."
368,How do I deal with thr fear of being alone,I can't handle it my fear it's not being alone that scares me but the thoughts I get while being alone like I know monsters aren't around but when being alone especially in my room with the light off I just imagine a monster running out and trying to attack me and I get a fist fast as possible to turn the light on it can't handle being in the bathroom too long or I'll say imagine something coming out the drain or wall to attack me I can't handle hospital bathrooms with their big door in a mirror and it's just too much if I'm home alone I just imagine people breaking in and I can't deal with it I want to know how I can do with it sorry if there's grammar mistakes I did not rate this I'm just using the speech to text on my phone
369,Should I isolate myself?,"I've been feeling pitiful about myself. If I'd think of the past, I remember how no one chooses me. From my family, friends, even someone special. I've always felt that it's okay for them to leave me behind. Parents choosing work over my graduation, them choosing friends over my birthday, friends not inviting me on their parties and people just drop me so easily. After some deep thinking, I decided to isolate myself, do things I want, care and expect less from everyone. It worked for a time, but now that I'm feeling it again, is it right for me to isolate myself again?"

I was on antidepressant for almost a year but i felt that i wasn’t getting any help from it, so i talked with my psychiatrist and gradually stopped the medication. I felt better. But now i am getting panic attacks again (3 weeks after completely stopping the medication). I don’t wanna spend my life taking pills. Therapy is not an option right now even tho i’d love to.
What can i do to feel better with all the stress around me ?"

375,Any tips to get out of a slump,"I am working and studying for a master's, I am currently in a slump. I am working out, eating healthy and sleeping better,  recently enrolled into therapy also for the past three weeks. 

But I feel so much loss of control, focus and feel very uncertain about my capabilities. 
Any tips for a fellow person! Thanks in advance!"
376,I think I’m beyond saving,Every dad gets worse and it’s harder to keep promises i really don’t want to break. I’m venting here because i don’t want to bother anyone (anxiety yay).
377,My (24m) fiancee (26f) said she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore,"We're both depressed and basically we are on a break, but I can't cope with this it seems.

We're still technically together and everything, I just have to distance myself from her and her from me until we can clear our heads and become mature enough to come to a final decision, which I am dreading.

I haven't slept in two days and I haven't eaten in almost five. I don't know what to do. She was my reason to get up out of bed.

We got into a big fight about how we treat each other and turns out we didn't treat each other great. That doesn't matter to me, I just wanted us both to acknowledge that and work on us as a couple but I guess it runs deeper than that. We need to mature as individuals. I'm excited to but at the same time all I want is for us to love each other like before. 

I'm so lost and alone right now."
378,"I’m not sure if this belongs here, but I have a question","So I’ve been having sleep issues for a few years. When I started taking my antidepressants (Zoloft) my doctor also gave me hydroxyzine. Taking one of them would knock me out for a while. Now, I have to take melatonin on top of the hydroxyzine, which I recently found out can cause sedation. I can’t sleep for more than thirty minutes at a time, and I don’t know what to do. I know it’s not healthy to live off of thirty minutes of sleep, but I have no idea what it is. I’m fourteen by the way, so I have to do all of my schoolwork on thirty minutes of sleep. If you know anything about what might be wrong, please tell me I’m desperate."
379,I don’t know what to do,"I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for most of my life. I never felt that I could really tell anyone so I turned to cutting when I was twelve. I had a lot of friends in high school but never felt like I could tell them about how much I was really struggling. Credit where credit is due, looking back now some of them did try to reach out to support me but I did my very best to push everyone away. I only confided in an internet friend who I befriended and who I could still retain some degree of anonymity and be confident she wouldn’t be able to reach anyone I knew in real life. She helped me through some of the darkest periods of my life and had talked me out of ending my life on more than one occasion. Eventually, I knew that I had to stop cutting. I struggled with relapsing but eventually got to a point where I didn’t even think about cutting most of the time. That was almost three years ago now. I was recently diagnosed with a chronic illness and on top of dealing with abuse and my chronic illness. I cracked and cut myself for the first time in three years. I hate myself so much for this and I just don’t know who to go to anymore. I’m terrified of telling anyone because I don’t want to put more strain on my family. I can’t tell anyone but I don’t know how to stop."

381,How do I know if I am depressed or if its something else?,"I honestly have no clue if I am depressed or just have bad self image or something. I literally have no one to talk to and I'm honestly used to it but every one in a while I see people texting and calling friends, family and loved ones and they have an actual conversation and laugh and smile. When I am texting  of calling my family its a simple how are you oh okay and a small update on what they are doing. It makes me sad that I can have what other people do have. When I'm out in public I think some creep is staring at me and I have no clue why or I hear people laugh and assume oh no I got my period and there is a stain or something is wrong with what I am wearing and they are making fun of me. I do not like the way I look either I never have but my image has been worse since I gained weight everyone tells me I have and that since I'm young still I should try to lose it. 

 I don't always feel sad just alone. I literally have a routine thats so boring school work, switch, phone to scroll on fb, instagram, redit then, repeat and add some tv and sometimes go for a walk. I  sleep around 2-4 am and wake up at 11 or 12 and by 2pm I  feel like I have done everything I needed to do. I don't want to say I'm depressed because I don't want to claim it and it not be true. Im sorry if this text is messy and kaotic."
382,"I’m a female and I’m tall, so people avoid me","I’m 5’6.  In Asia everyone’s like 5’4/5’5, even the guys.  So they just naturally avoid me.  I’m starting to feel like a boy.  I can’t even!! This is taking a toll on my mental health.  I feel like a guy/ odd one out.  Especially since I’m a rectangle."
383,The walls are closing in...,"I recieved a ticket for texting in driving in march, i decided to go to court to fight it and try to keep it off my record knowing that if i recieved the ticket i would lose my job. I recieved the ticket while on the job looking at directions for work. Well i go to court and the officer admits he has no evidence other than what he believe he seen. So i tell the truth, i looked at my phone to see if i needed to go left or right at the next block. My mom raised me to believe telling the truth is always the right thing. They stuck me with the ticket and $300+ fees... the next day my boss lets me go... this is amidst the covid pandemic court was beginning of august. I still havent found a new job, i have been summoned to court for unpaid tickets, my truck that i bought brand new and only owe $23,000 on is up for reposession, im up for eviction on my apartment, and i honestly dont know any way to save my situation and the only thing that keeps coming to mind is to put a bullet through my brain, but i know thats not the answer it just transfers my pain to someone else and thats not fair to those i love and i am just ranting to get this off my chest and i know no one will probably read it but i wish i were dead..."
384,i’m afraid i’m going to keep living my life wishing i had someone else’s,"i honestly don’t even have a sense of self worth anymore. i feel like i’m always chosen last, and that i’m just here to be an option. i’m afraid i’m going to live my entire life being jealous of other people, wondering why i don’t look like them, act like them, etc. 

i’ve had self esteem issues for a while, but after all the rejection, anxiety, and being constantly treated like an option, it has really deteriorated my mental health. my social anxiety doesn’t help whatsoever. i want to talk to people so bad but i just... can’t. it’s given me the persona of being the awkward, weird, shy, kid who stutters and sweats when being called on by the teacher. i feel so isolated. 

i hate the way i look. i hate so so so much how bad i look in every photo. i’ve made it to the point where i FEAR taking photos with people because i ALWAYS and i mean ALWAYS end up looking absolutely terrible. i’ve even made it to the point where i fear for my BIRTHDAY because i’m afraid people will post awful photos of me and i will get judged. it’s that fear of judgment that won’t ever go away. 

i hate how big my nose is, i hate how round my face is, i hate my smile, i hate how awkward i am, i hate how i can’t socialize properly, i just... hate myself. so so so much. sometimes i wish i was someone else."
385,"Did anyone of you overcome feeling like an ugly, worthless POS that's terrible at everything?","The title sums it pretty much up. Did anyone find a way to stop it? I mean, I pretty much know all the generic answers that you usually get on these kind of posts."

389,Black sheep of the family,"Does anyone deal with having parents that are kind of emotionally and mentally abusive, but only relate to you and not to your siblings. Yet your siblings don’t really see a lot of the abuse so when you bring it up to them they will side with your parents. I used to have to live with my parents and up to recently I was able to move out. I was miserable there for years and I just simply couldn’t afford to move out yet. I brought the fact that my parents are kind of abusive to me to my sister and being that she was able to move out before I was she told me I was being ungrateful because my parents didn’t have to keep me there as long as they did. Even after telling her stories of where they were being kind of abusive she still said I was ungrateful. She’s honestly the favorite in the family and my parents hold her on a pedestal so for her she sees a different image of them. Does anyone else have this dynamic I don’t know if I’m crazy but I just feel like my parents have been abusive towards me and it’s hard to come to that conclusion when everyone else disagrees. I’m 25 now and I don’t wanna relationship with my parents because how they were in the past even though they’re trying to pretend like they care now. Everyone of my family guilt trips me to hang out with my parents even after me moving out but I just feel so uncomfortable and I get anxious about having to go over there and deal with them and my whole family in general."
390,I found out my old step father sexually abused my sister. Don't know what to do but I feel sick.,"I literally cannot talk about this with anyone else in my life because she told me this in confidence and I didn't know where to post this. Wont go into detail but she disclosed this to me tonight and I feel absolutely sick. Apparently this happened when she was around 7 or 8, I would have only been one or two years old at the time. When my sister tried to tell my mom (at the time of the event) my mother didn't believe her, and told her she was lying about it. We lived with this man for eleven years. The fact that my mother didn't believe my sister and constantly villainized her our entire childhood makes me absolutely sick, and I can never look at my mother the same way. Im still a teenager and live with my mother, but I cannot talk to her about this because I would be betraying my sister's confidence and she wouldn't want me getting angry with my mom, especially when she hasn't spoken with her about it in years. I consider myself and my mother somewhat close, but I don't think I can look her in the eye after this. My sister deserved to be believed and protected and apparently my mother has never apologized to my sister or told her she believes her. My sister has moved on and said she was fine with the actual event, and only told me because it pertained to a discussion we were having about him and our childhood. How do I go on after this, especially with my relationship with my mother? I don't know what to do at all. I have no relationship with him at all anymore despite the fact that at one point I considered him a father figure and he considered me his daughter. I was sexually abused by a family member as a child and now I'm concerned I was sexually abused by him as well. I don't remember anything about my life before the age of 12 so now I'm wondering what else I didn't remember if I didn't remember these events that unfolded that she's told me about. Any advice? I don't know if I'm overreacting or how to handle this since I cannot talk to anyone about it."
391,I have no idea what’s going on.,"If your apart of everything you have ever met then all I can say is I wish I had met better people for the most part, and came and lived in a better environment. The only thing I can really tell myself is that at least I don’t live in a third world country... then I start feeling bad for the people I already do so that doesn’t exactly help. If all pain is equal then doesn’t that make everyone just as fragile. Did do people really grow up or do they just become older children. If we’re all children how can we expect anyone to be responsible or to know anything about anything at all. How can anyone act like they have everything together when no one has any idea what we’re doing here in the first place, and if everyone is actually crazy then sanity is just an illusion. If everything is an illusion then no one actually exists and nothing actually matters. If you don’t matter why do anything at all. If society is broken why doesn’t someone go out of their way to fix it? If people are flawed why don’t they just get therapy, what does it actually mean to be sentient, are we really awake or in someone’s dream do we even have free will or are we in a simulation. If gif is real why hasn’t he done anything at all. Why did we let the world move on after the 90’s why we think tomorrow is gonna be better, why do we hate each other for being different, and if the sun doesn’t rotate how do the other planets spin?"
392,"Cutting ties, closing up.","I'm going to log off of Reddit for the last time, hopefully. I feel like there's a conspiracy against me here, and I think it might be a developing schizophrenic delusion, or something very real and scary.

This is going to sound crazy, because it is. But, I feel like I might know something very, very dark and although I'm not being killed for it, my voice is being suppressed because if I did get any kind of platform, I could tell people the secret (when/if I remember what it is) and then it would cause problems.

For my own sake, maybe I should just retreat to a corner of the internet where no one can find me.

I feel like, if this post is silenced, I'll have the proof that I need to convince me that maybe this is real. Perhaps I'll be killed or drugged afterward. Wouldn't that be great?"
393,is excessive yelling reasonably a psychiatric episode?,"both of my parents have a strange tendency to trap me in rooms in the house.

If i leave they threaten to take away personal belongings that i paid for myself.

If I argue back to them, they start to accuse me of mental health, threatening me to call the police and that they will send me to a mental hospital after they call them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to my understanding they are the ones who are truly having the psychiatric episode, and i would really like to call the police on them for doing such a thing in the first place."
394,My twin sounds like she has bipolar,It’s been a while. She’s on meds and does psychotherapy but she doesn’t share anything with us. I have no idea what’s going on and it hurts to see her like this. I feel like I lost my twin a long time ago. I guess we’ve both changed and now we’ve grown apart
395,Dont feel alive,"So ive never mentioned any of this to anyone and this is gonna be really messy because i find it impossible to focus on stuff like this and proof read but like for the longest time ive had just idk weird shit like from when i was super young i used to have like this sight in my head sortve of like a snowball rolling down a hill towards me and getting bigger and i would also hear like voices that are angrily shouting but very quietly if that makes sense and sound and especially peoples voices around me would sound aggressive and loud to me and this always bought on really bad anxiety as it happened. I dont know when this first started happening but it was when i was super young around like 8 or maybe younger. I think this went away i dont really remember but then in secondary school i would have these same episodes sometimes randomly but usually in class and some classes more specifically than others like in my math class in year 9 maybe it was almost every day and i think it was more common in this class because the teacher made us stay dead silent. I also had id say minor depression during this time but while i was really young and id say that first started when i was 12. Id just breakdown in my room all the time and any argument with my mother or any thing id think about killing myself and climbing up to my roof and jumping and wondering if it would kill me or not. In secondary school i also had really severe ibs and had bad anxiety over this and got picked on for it, i also got picked on for my weight and felt bad about it but my school was a really toxic place and i was mean for no reason to alot of people too. I eventually went to the hospital about my ibs and i just lied to the psychiatrist or whatever its called because i didnt want to say i got bullied or felt bad and have to deal with all that. Anyway ive basically distracted myself my entire life with video games, about  8 months ago i met a girl online who im dating now online for 6 months and we are yet to meet, this is the first girlfriend ive ever had and shes sortve just made me aware that im not living my life, not just that im not doing anything productive with it i just literally feel like im watching myself. Im not sure how long ive felt like this, but my depression has been at its worst recently and i started self harming. Ive stopped now but like im completely 100% emotionally reliant on this person. In the first few months they defiantly made my mental health alot worse but this person also struggles with alot of issues from her past and has bpd, we're more settled now and im very grateful to have her and i think shes saved my life. But like any time we argue i just get like the worst depression of my life and if we like split up for a few days over and argument i contemplate suicide alot. Im not really scared of death anymore i went through school thinking  i was dying over a bunch of health problems i had and genuinely  didnt think id make it to  18 where i am now like i thought i had cancer or something. Anyway i dont know how much of this ive mentioned yet but i just like i feel like im not living in my own body and like im just living passively sortve i cant even focus on my computer screen anymore and that was like the only distraction ive had all my life all i do is just sit in my own head i dont even know if im thinking or not or just listen to music really loud and drown everything out. I have very few memories of my life for some reason i dont know why, ive always thought to myself theres no way the inside of everyones head feels like mine. I dont know what to do i really do not even care that much id be happy to not wake up tomorrow, i dont have the energy or emotional capacity  to tell anyone. Saying that i also feel emotionless alot like the only thing i really feel is emptiness when i feel really depressed or just  a feeling that i wanna escape for some reason. I try to make myself cry sometimes to try relieve this but i cant even do that. Like i have no idea what ive included in this post my eyes are focused on the screen but im not taking it in if i try to read it i just forget instantly. I also forgot to mention that super recently, after 'breaking up' with my girlfriend that these quiet shouting voices started again for the first time in years but they didnt stay for long, that was maybe a month ago. Im really happy with my partner and shes literally all i live for, even though ive never met her in person which will probably sound really stupid to alot of people. But like not only do i not feel like talking to anyone but i have nobody to talk to, i cant talk to my girlfriend because she has way to many problems of her own and talking to her just makes  it worse for her, i could keep going on but nobody will read this if i do so ill just stop, thankyou if you made it this far, i dont know if i even feel like this all the time i literally have no idea how i feel and its kinda scary maybe i feel normal sometimes and i just dont realize when i feel like this but thanks again for reading"
396,I feel very anxious and my heart beat increases rapidly when I..,"Feel something is wrong with my body. I tend to get stomach related problems once in a while but I end up thinking that I have a way worse problem. Last time I thought my appendix was going to burst because according to Google my symptoms were similar but it was just constipation for a week. That made me very very scared and my heartbeat increased rapidly at times, I had to call my parents everytime and talk with them to calm down. This time I had some bad food and felt sick after 5 hours and thought I was going to vomit, I absolutely hate how vomiting makes me feel. This feeling of potentially vomiting  gave me a slight panic attack and again I had to call my parents to calm down. Now the problem is I never used to feel this scared of these slight problems before, now I get scared  to the point where I have mini panic attacks because of reading symptoms on google(not just about stomach related issues)  and simply vomiting. I have been living alone in Canada  for 9 months as a international student and it's been the longest I've stayed away from not just my parents but any other family. normally I don't feel like I miss them but when I ussually get sick they're the first ones I call. I wanted to know if I'm suffering from some mental health problem."
397,How do you get a toxic person out of your head?,"It always feels like no matter what I do, they're always there in my head belittling me, one upping me, being better than me and actively making me feel worse because of it. I have so many fights and debates with them in my head and I always lose them. I always end up being the narcissist, the self obsessed one, I can't win any argument with them. Today is especially bad and it just seems like I'll never win, and I need to go to uni but I can't focus on anything but their voice in my head. 

Anyone have any tips?"

400,I lost control of my body what happened,"I was trying to sleep, I was at one point but got woken up by my dad who was screaming and wouldn’t stop (he has schizophrenia and drinks until he has delusions usually it’s just him screaming all night and bugging my mom) I was half asleep, trying to ignore him and my mom , my own thoughts weren’t even making sense at that point. I heard my mom wail and said something about him sitting on our v small and fragile dog, I thought he might’ve killed it but I tried to sleep anyways because I was so tired. I don’t remember much but I felt rage throughout my entire body. Next thing I knew I was out of my bed in front of him, beating his head with my hands and screaming, i  rushed back into my room but I didn’t feel the walking all I felt at all was the stinging in my hands and a numbness in my knees. I locked the door and got back in bed. It was almost like a reflex, like when that little doctor hammer hits your knee. I’m not sure I was in control of any of that. Did I black out? Dissociate? What was that I really didn’t want to do that. It was really like I couldn’t have stopped myself."

406,when will this pain end? it never gets better (tw: sh),"people always tell me that things get better and i did believe it, i had faith that i’ll get better and my life won’t be so fucking depressing. but it never does. everytime i think things get better, they don’t. they get worser every time. 

i’ve relapsed after almost a month and i’ve explored more parts of my body. my left arm is numb and my fresh cuts burn more than ever. 

my parents are newly divorced. it fucking sucks seeing their puffy red eyes. and you know what’s even worse? they look at my siblings and i with ‘bright smiles’ asking us if we are okay. it’s all so fucking painful. maybe my dad will give my mom the attention and love she deserves if i finally go, right? he’ll realize that he took us for granted, right?

Now things are getting quite bad for me. I haven’t slept well since Thursday because my anxiety has got the best of me. There’s about 400 different thoughts in my head all at one time and I just can’t stop crying. 

I really want to share with him my issues but I struggle talking about my mental health face to face. I clam up and just downplay everything but I just feel so alone I want his support. 

We live together so I feel like writing it down/ texting etc isn’t really an option.  I really want his help but I just don’t know how to go about this. 

Also giving me anxiety because now I’m thinking what if I tell him and he just leaves because he doesn’t want to deal with it"
408,"Everything's okay, right ?","So, to start with i suffer from borderline personality disorder. A majority of you will understand that diagnosis,  for others who don't, here are a few bits and pieces that come with that
O. Depression
O. Anxiety
O. Paranoid thoughts
O. Destructive and irrational behaviour 
O. Emotional extremes 

Lately, during this pandemic, my relationships have been a bit up and down, I'm not talking in romantic sense, but friends, family, ect. Most of my friends are now online, all from my country. 
Recently I found myself drawn to someone a little less local, theyre funny, smart, we have debates, share memes and its been great. I found myself smiling whenever I'd  see their little ID  that says online. 
But more often then not whenever I jump on, they seem to jump off. I've tried to be rational, and ask if I've done something wrong  they explained not at all, and continued to post memes ect at times that im not online.  I know life can get busy, or at least that's what I keep trying to tell myself, maybe they don't want to talk right now, maybe they're struggling with their mental health too. 
Now these particular feelings, the bad ones, what if I'm annoying them, maybe they actually don't like me, what if they're just being nice ect, are all emotions I feel most of the time. That just comes with BPD and many other disorders, and usually if my friends live near me, I catch up and can read their faces, their voices, and get it through my head that everything's okay, but in this time its not as easy, and I feel like I annoy my friends more if I ask for reassurance.  My mental health isn't their responsibility. The way i feel is on me, and its hard  
So I guess my question is, how do you stop yourself from getting these negative feelings, or make them hurt less? Im not on meds or i don't see a therapist, mainly because I have techniques for certain aspects of my mental health, but this one here is a problem, because im not my friends...I have no idea what they're feeling, its out of my control and im not great with things I can't control."

I've tried Nyquil and Melatonin but it seems to not work at all, Nyquil works but I take ALOT more then the recommended for it to take into effect and it seems almost kind of dangerous, I feel like I'm walking through a veil always because of how everything seems to drag, I don't know what to do in all honesty I just can't sleep at all and it's killing me constantly, I just don't know what to do about it and any help would be appreciated I don't know if I should see a doctor or not or what they can do to help me because this like I said above is becoming almost unbearable"

I need help but I'm afraid I can't afford many options. Anyone have any advice or should I just spend some time at the hospital?
415,People should get mental health checkups,"We get our blood checked every so often, our whole body looked over every year or two, and if you're an older guy, the doctor even sticks his finger up your butt to check your prostate.  But nobody ever thought to go for random mental health checks to see if they might be depressed or anxious and not know it.  

I tried to kill myself and honestly didn't believe that I was depressed.  So you can certainly have something going on mentally and be totally unaware.  Go get checked out!"
416,My mom gives me panic attacks,"My mom often lectures me when I do something and I cannot help but feel afraid. I start shaking and I loose the ability to think or speak. Sometimes I loose control and just run away and hide.   


It has been happening a lot and I need help to stop it. My mom does not understand my panic attacks since she expects me to act normal after one I hate feeling scared around my mom"
417,Online therapy,Have you ever tried online therapy? Which app could you recommend and why? I have been thinking a long time about therapy but something about actually talking to a person scares me and I keep postponing it. Thanks
418,Does anyone know what is happening with me?,"For the last few years I have been feeling an increasing sense of apathy and it has gotten to the point where I don't find anything I used to do interesting anymore, instead it feels like I am just doing things to pass the time and not because I want to do it. 

An example of this is gaming, I used to play video games a lot (for more than 8 hours a day sometimes) and now, I can't even stick with a game for more than an hour before getting bored. I can't even focus on a tv show/movie without mindlessly browsing my phone.

It seems like I have no sense of motivation or ambition to do anything, whether this be to entertain myself or improve anything in my life (such as physical health).

The main times I do seem to care about things anymore, it seems obsessive. For example, I have a need to check door locks a very large amount of times. I will lock the front door to my house, and then stand there for around 2-3 minutes constantly trying to open the door even though I know I've already locked it, but it is as if I am trying to give myself enough evidence that this is actually the case. (I will also do this with bathroom door locks etc.) This causes issues, as after the few minutes of trying, it isn't necessarily over, I will walk 10+ minutes to work and then just feel a drive that I need to go and check the lock again, this causes me to walk all the way back, unlock and relock the door and repeat the process.

Another example, is constantly thinking how other people view me and being unable to speak in some situations. An example of this is at work, I will try to impress the higher ups by doing different things but then I am completely unable to have an actual conversation, I just get extremely quiet and want to speak but can't. The worst this gets is with phone calls, I once had a panic attack that caused me to shake uncontrollably after being on the phone and I had to walk out of the office and get water to calm myself down. (I am also shaking a small bit just writing this out.

Both of the above have been happening for a while, and I just want to know if there is anything that could possibly be causing it, and if so, if there is a fix or treatment. I was going to speak to my GP about this (I live in the UK) but I don't know the actual services available and feel a bit scared to try and talk about it since I feel like I will just freeze and not be able to speak."
419,In Pain,I was diagnosed with depression a little over 2 years ago but I never got help because my parents were convinced I could pray it away and that it was just demons. Fast forward 2 years and I don’t think I’ll ever recover. I’m at a point where I feel little to no emotion and the emotion I do feel is immense anger and sadness. My heart physically hurts constantly because I’m so stressed. I’m always the person telling everyone else that things will be okay and there’s hope but I don’t even believe that myself. I can barely eat anything anymore without feeling sick. I sleep for more than half the day. Taking a shower or even brushing my teeth is a chore. I haven’t offed myself yet because I just feel guilty. But I always imagine how good it would feel to end it all. I want to hope for the future but at this rate there will be no future for me .
420,Why am I so bad at handling stress? Please help me.,"When I get stressed over an assignment, I either rush through it and out bullshit answers, have a meltdown, get extremely suicidal, or just give up and lie to my parents that I finished it. Why am I like this? Please help."
421,"My friend is contemplating suicide, is it wrong to tell his teachers?","My friend goes to a different school to me, and he has told me he is thinking about commuting suicide. I tried getting him to get professional help or therapy or something, but he doesn’t want to. We’re quite far apart and can only really talk through text, so I’m not in a very good position to help very much, and when I try he pushes me away. We share one of the same teacher (a distance learning thing) and I’m considering contacting him about my friend mental health, though I know my friend would not like it if I did this. I’m very worried though and I don’t know what else to do. So would this be an ok thing to do?"
422,I feel numb.,"I think i have been struggling to keep up mentally for 5 years or more and i am only 18. I have a stable family and i honestly have everything going for me. I have had my ups and downs, in middle grade due to some bullying i had severe self esteem issues- i avoided mirrors and stopped caring for myself. i have not been in the best relationships either. I moved a lot during high school and people were not the nicest.I cant make a lot of friends and any company i have is not very deep. I have had some blocked trauma with sexual abuse as a child (nobody from my family). But, i have always pushed myself to feel normal, i dont want to disappoint my parents, they give me everything, I get good grades and even made it to a decent university. I just dont see why i feel the way i do.

(TW) My parents are not ideal to talk to about mental health. My coping mechanisms are getting self destructive, i managed to get 7 months clean but now i am on the edge of an ED. I feel very inadequate as a person, people tend to eventually leave and so to avoid how it makes me feel, i leave first. I just dont know, i move to uni in a month and i dont care ? i know i will again just push through and come home with a degree that honesty i dont even care about. I dont know what i wanna do with life or if i even care but i dont feel entitled to feel like this so i just keep trying. 

I started to keep a diary to be more positive and manifest happiness but honestly i dont know if it does anything for me. I am getting tired, feels like everyday is a chore."

427,I'm just going to describe everything I'm going through,"I literally can't trust anyone in real life to handle this information, not even my friends.

So basically, my life has been going downhill for about 3 years ago till now.

My primary school score is literally 218/300, despite getting 3 As and 1 B. I thought I could try harder in secondary school and I put as much effort as I could.

But all my efforts went unnoticed since my grades were still so low. No one cares how much effort you put into the things you do anymore. The final score is all that really matters and with my final score not being much, every returned test was just another scolding from my parents, saying I didn't check my paper after doing it or that I didn't even try.

So I tried to put some effort into my other things, like my hobbies, or what made me happy.
No one cares about those either.
No one cares if you like video editing , it's pathetic, theres no future.
No one cares if you enjoy drawing, it's pathetic there's no future.
No one cares if you do anything that isn't your studies, it's pathetic,theres is no future in that either.

My happiness literally drops so quickly, and school life isn't jolly either.
My classmates are literal children. The way they talk, the way they act, so happy like nothing will ever affect them.
These children do so much better than me in grades that I hate myself for doing worse than a bunch of pathetic people who I know dislike me.


I have this odd thing where I just randomly get sleepy and I don't know why. The heat? Am I sick? There is no reason for it, and I'm getting scolded for it by my parents for it happening during my tution lessons.


I'm always getting scolded for things that have nothing to do with me. Even if it's not me getting scolded, I get the worst burn marks from my parent's anger. I get scolded for things I didn't even know why happen, but because it obviously has to be my own fault, I'm scolded for things I have no answer for. 

They say I'm lazy, I never use any effort, I'm pathetic and I have no future, and that they've wasted so much money on me I'm just burning.

Worst part? All of it is true. I am just some lazy dumb person who can't do better than his childish classmates. I'm the person who feels a pinch when I ask for help, which is why I never do.

I would have killed have killed myself so much earlier if I didn't have a fear of pain.
I no longer want to kill myself, though still I wish I could.

My goal is to make all the people who never felt the pain I felt. They are the ones who made me feel pain, and I want to punch, maybe do something more, all of them in the face and make them know how much pain I felt.

I'm not going to die till everyone feels pain."
428,Defence Mechanisms,"What are your defence mechanisms when you are going through tough times? Have you identified them, and if not, how do you plan on doing it?"
429,The Color Blue,"I want to share something that has been working for me. I know there are a lot of exercises out there, and this one isn't probably anything different than existing ones, but I felt like sharing because I have tried a lot of things that hasn't worked for me, and this one has helped.

When I am laying in bed and having dark thoughts, or even just useless ones that are keeping me up, making me feel worse, I have started just mentally repeating the phrase ""The Color Blue"". It's a pretty innocuous phrase - it both has meaning, but is also sort of meaningless, and yet it's complicated enough that it sort of blocks out any other persistent thoughts. 

I honestly don't know how I came up with this phrase. I guess blue is soothing and normally makes me  think about the sky or water. But I don't actually have any of those things pop into my head when repeating it. It's the words themselves seem to be the trick, and not so much the meaning, but the articulation of them and the weird rhythm of saying them.

I sort of use it as a mental flyswatter. I use it aggressively (not passively) to kick out the annoying thoughts in my head. Sometimes it's easier than other times. Sometimes I am practically mentally 'screaming' it, quickly and repeatedly. But the important thing for me, is that it's been working and I am actually getting the sleep I need. 

Anyhow, I am not a doctor. I am just a person trying to figure out how to manage my own thoughts and this has helped me. Be well."
430,I can't complain...,"""How're you feeling?""

Well... I can't complain...

&amp;#x200B;

I can't complain, some people have lost their jobs, their homes, their loved ones to all this.

I can't complain, a lot of people feel down this time of year, it isn't just me.

I can't complain, everyone's in the same boat right now, everyone's feeling a little down.

I can't complain, my co-worker had to deal with the same solo stress, and for a lot longer too.

I can't complain, I practically had a 80% paid for, 6 month holiday! I should be relaxed. 

I can't complain, I still have my job, my house, my family, and my physical health.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't complain, so instead I'll just sit here, quiet, thinking about killing myself."

434,Not being able to make new friends during COVID,"I am not sure if its just me but I have found it very difficult to meet new friends during this pandemic.

Group gatherings and parties are out of the question so that get rids of one avenue of meeting people. Assuming you meet someone through work or other avenues, you cant exactly comfortably ask them out for coffee or dinner. The whole temperature checks, distancing and masks make it all an ordeal. Dining out is something most people wont do for something they just met.

It's not like I can ask them to come over to my place as I live witn my parents as well.

I am thinking if I should already get a small apartment of my own just so I have a place to hang out with other people. I postponed it a lot of times thinking I can save a lot by staying with my parents but the lack of social interactions is taking its toll.

How are you guys making new friends during this pandemic? With the way things are I would be ending 2020 without making any meaningful friendship/relationship with someone."

I’m depressed and stupid and lonely and ugly and I have tests next week that I can’t study for and my psychiatrist is considering inpatient which would be miserable and Corona is ruining everything.

437,I need someone to comfort me,"TW: suicide, self harm 

I was super fucking suicidal anyways but now my girlfriend who is my only true friend and has been for years is ignoring me. I think she’s finally sick of me. I can’t live without her, plus she’s the only person I can vent to. I don’t even know how to ask why she’s mad at me because she probably wouldn’t answer. The only other friend who I feel like I can talk to is her brother and obviously I can’t ask him about this. I just want to die so bad. What’s the point? I’m severely depressed, no one likes having me around, I have tests next week that I‘m gonna fail, my psychiatrist is considering inpatient for me which would be miserable, plus my country’s on lockdown again so the only place I can go besides home is school. The one thing that gives me relief is cutting and it’s so fleeting. I can’t feel happy anymore. I have the means to do it - I’m only alive out of fear and for my parents, but I don’t know how long that will last."
438,How do you stay organized?,"I have bi-polar2, OCD, anxiety and depression. 

I am in the right cocktail of meds and I feel good but I have the hardest time staying organized and my bd just doesn’t get why. It’s like I get stuck or something. He doesn’t get why I can walk by a towel in the floor and just leave it. It’s not like I do it on purpose but I just don’t think about it. 

Does this sound weird? 

Anyways is anyone has similar problems what are some good tips to help me?"
439,I don't know what to do.,"I am an 18-year-old boy from Spain doing online school with no friends living with my mom and her boyfriend who is sensitive and takes offence to things I do in a farmhouse. I used to live with my dad in Asia. I was about to start my last year of high school when I decided to move back to Spain. I was feeling lost and bored in Asia and wanted to start my life. My plan was to move back with my mom, finish highschool online and get a job or something.

A month after I arrived in Spain my mom's boyfriend got offended because I got frustrated when I was skateboarding. Apparently, for him, me getting frustrated was enough to end it all with my mom, which made me feel like shit because I don't want to hurt her. Anyways, 5 days go by without saying a word to him or him saying a word to me and we are back to being friends. One morning I wake up to my mom saying if I want to go on a road trip. I decided to go even though that it's really tough for me due to my crippling anxiety. The whole trip and day were good except for a couple of things which I didn't find as troubling but other people did.

I used to be a very happy smiley person that would be the life of the party but that changed after 5+ really bad years. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I had really bad anxiety. This sorta changed how I acted mainly due to the really strong medication that they were giving me. Nowadays it's way harder to relate with people and have a good time with other people and I often feel more comfortable alone even though I hate being by myself. During that road trip, I barely said much because I didn't have anything valuable to say and I had a resting bitch face which is now the new normal for me. During the trip my mom would say ""cmon smile or act happy he brought us here to have a good time, he is spending his time and money on skateboard parts"". I was happy and grateful for what he was doing I just wasn't showing it guess. I ended up getting mad with my mom because it really annoys me when people ask me if I'm ok when I am. I am not a victim or someone's puppy.

Anyways, this is where started going downhill. We were at a store and he made a joke and pretended to hit my balls and then he softly tapped/punched my arm, sorta like what you do with your friends. I decided to give him a pat on the arm back which is sorta what you do in those situations. Apparently, that was disrespectful and got told off by my mom. The thing that I don't get is that he tried to pinch my balls without me being fully ok with it, but a pat on the arm crosses the line. After that, he once more thought of leaving my mom. There were a couple more situations after that similar to these which occurred after my girlfriend broke up with me. After all of this, I was really fed up and affected by this to the point that I wanted to run away or just move away. I decided not to because that would be too painful for my mom instead I decided to just act differently around both my mom and her boyfriend. With my mom, I act just like how I was 5 years ago before all the bad stuff happened. With him I just act like a whole completely different person, I really watch out with what I say and do making me extremely stressed.

To conclude whatever this, I am right now at the point where I just want to disappear, I don't care about anyone, I don't know who I am it's like I've lost my personality, my soul. I don't want to keep living like this. I'm alone and slowly going crazy. All I want to do is do drugs because when I do I feel like myself again.

Can anyone give me any advice on how to make this whole situation better? How can I regain what I had before? How do I get my personality back? Anything would help."
440,existential crisis.,"I'm not doing too well. I know that. I don't understand anything. It's not that I don't want to, I do, but I also don't. I don't know how to help myself anymore. I seem to be dragging everyone down with me. I'm trying. Why isn't it enough anymore. What is the point now? I just don't want to be alone."
441,Phosphenes and mental health.,"When I was around 14 I started being invaded my paranoide thoughts. I felt in danger: I could feel people destroying my house's door and assassinating everyone. Also I felt someone wanted to kill me. At the same time, I was having quite strong phosphenes, to the point I couldn't sleep. I still remember them: they were really vivid and complex. Somehow I also felt a tinnitus and imagined sounds were also very lively. Well, the paranoia ended and I was never annoyed again with tinnitus nor did I ser phosphenes.

With 19, during covid-19 lockdown, I started hearing tinnitus again. Then phosphenes, felt that the world was unreal, got attacked by vile intrusive thoughts, despair, hopelessness. I would stare at the mirror I would feel that my face wasn't mine. I was in a kind of dream.

However, now I feel a lot better. I'm not suspended on that oniric state nor do I feel greatly annoyed by the latent tinnitus (it diminished but didn't dissapear).

I thought this could've been a drug induced psychosis but it wouldn't make much sense: it started about 2 months after the lockdown and I didn't use any drug as opposed to before the quarantine.

I inferred from this that strong phosphenes may equal to a chaotic brain. What's the opinion of yours?"
442,what’s going on?,"I’ve genuinely been feeling really down for around the past 2 weeks. I don’t exactly understand why it started as more of a gradual decline in my mental health and I think it hit me more recently when sometime around 3?? days ago I had a complete break down over something so trivial as going for dinner. To give you some details, I had been talking about this dinner the whole day because I was pretty excited to go out in the middle of this pandemic and I changed and was all ready but as soon as I was about to sit in my car one really judgey and rude look from my mother was enough to make me start sobbing (this isn’t normal for me) and I ran back inside. I couldn’t breathe and to be honest I couldn’t even walk properly I was just generally over all shaking and I have no idea how to make sense of this encounter because nothing like this has happened to me before. My mother kept repeating I’m not mentally okay and my thinking patterns haven’t been the best recently...if you know what I mean. Then recently I’ve been fighting with my bf ALOT as well and I think most of this is my fault. It’s not like I don’t like my bf or anything no because I literally love him but recently I’m ultra reactive to everything (again it’s not common that i behave like this to THIS degree). Yesterday my bf and I had a disagreement and I don’t know I think it was fine and sorted (about smth really serious) but the next day something triggered me yet again and I’ve been having very self destructive thoughts. I don’t know if having these thoughts is justified because he’s so loving and caring but I just feel so down and helpless. To make matters worse I keep self diagnosing myself and everything just feels to overwhelming to the point I just want to lock myself in my room forever."
443,My closest friend might be dead by now,"My best friend, a person i would give my life for is now in the war. I have no info about her for 5 days, you might have heard about the war between azerbaijan turkey and armenia, well about how they are attacking armenia and that for every beheaded person sryian fighters will get 100$.
My head is worth 100 dollars. 
No one fucking cares what is happening in Armenia, everyone was so hyped up about blm but now that innocent people are getting killed because of their race everyone is silent as speaking about this situation wouldn't profit them. I could be dead by tomorrow, or even this evening, maybe next week, i don't know. But my closest person may be dead by now, and i have no fucking idea how to cope with my crippling mental health and all of this situation at the same time."
444,"I hate when people ask ""what's your biggest fear? ""","It's annoying because when people ask they always mean it playfully like: ""oh I'm a huge arachnophobe"" that's normal and people relate to it. Sometimes you'll hear a weird one like someone scared of peas or whatever. I can't exactly tell people that my biggest fears are dementia and dying alone because that's too depressing for the conversation, so I say some shit like ""oh haha I really hate dolphins"" :/"
445,Having massive anxiety before work,"I (F18) work at a daycare, and do 9-5. I’ve been doing it for a few months and thought I could handle it, but the hours are catching up to me and making me very stressed and anxious.

 I always thought after highschool I’d enjoy waking up a little later or filling up my time with hobbies I’ve wanted to try but it feels like this rules my life. I cannot change my hours whatsoever so it’s either this or quit. It’s a fairly easy job and it’s fun but I don’t think it’s for me anymore, and I’m currently sitting a few houses down from my job having a mini panic attack. 

I don’t know what to do or say, and I’m so nervous."

Everytime I start watching a show/ reading a book and I spent a lot of time on it (for example starting the show and watching 8 episodes in a row) I get really invested in it. It's not like this with all shows, but with most. I will only think about this and everything will remind me of it. And if I am not doing anything related to it, I feel really empty and sad, especially when I get reminded of the show again (by things that often have close to nothing to do with it). I also love talking about it then and I want to talk about only that one show.
I only had it once that I didnt get this kinda sadness but was really invested in the show and I talked about it all the time, it was my favorite thing ever.

I just wanna know if anybody can relate to this?"

450,I've never been more alone,"My husband is out of town until early next year and the amount of things that have gone wrong in my life since he left is insane. I've tried messaging my friends that live in town, but they're all too busy for me. I just ended things with my best friend of 5 years because he kept gaslighting me and I couldn't take it any more. My family lives far away, and it's not like I would visit them anyway. My dad hasn't answered his phone in 2 months because I finally stood up to him and he didn't like that. I talk to my in-laws, but they're really busy with their own crap right now.

And I just found out last week that my mom has cancer. I spent the majority of my childhood wishing that she would die and this feels like some kind of twisted karma. I seriously hate myself for ever thinking it. I'm almost 23 and she JUST started being the mother that I needed all those years, and now she's sick. I keep thinking that she'd want me to pray for her, but if there IS a god, I don't think I'd get along with them.

Oh, and I don't feel anything anymore. I haven't cried since the night that I found out my mom has cancer (1 week ago). I'm not afraid of scary movies, I don't cry when I watch sad things (I even tried watchin Grey's Anatomy, which has always made me cry without fail). I felt NOTHING when I told my best friend that I never wanted to talk to him again. I thought that writing this all out would make me sad, but I still feel nothing.

IDK why I'm even writing this, I guess I just wanted to share with somebody who doesn't know me and won't worry."

454,I don't know where to start but I need help (self-hate),"Please delete if this is not an appropriate post for this sub. (if this was general mental health and not outreach)

As context: 

1. Throwaway account because I feel like I can be more open.
2. I am not self-harming or suicidal
3. I am currently seeing a therapist but I'm wondering if there is more I can do.
4. I am looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations, what helped you to break the cycle, or lessen the impact, or get you out of a spiral, etc.

That being said, incoming wall of text:

I hate myself, and I don't know what to do. I told my husband yesterday that self-affirmations don't work for me because I feel like I have nothing to affirm. I am surrounded by friends who invite me to come over for dinner, who congratulate me on recent accomplishments, and try to celebrate me, and all I can see is that I am their pity friend who they just want to make sure doesn't off himself. I am going back to school for a career change because I am burning out in my current one (teaching high school) and working from home, so I am adding another stressor but to me I see this as worth it because I am going to decrease stress in the long-run.

I know what to do to help myself like working out, going outside more (to the park or just a walk), trying to find ways to ""stop working"" from home and just being home, but I can't seem to do it. I just don't care enough about myself to actually help myself. I really just see myself as someone who I hate and why would I want to help someone I hate this much? Yesterday when I told my husband all of this too I didn't say everything because I felt like I was being a burden and holding him back with my depression and didn't want him to catch any of it. Even when I went the the bathroom later I turned around to brush my teeth because I didn't want to change seeing myself in the mirror. 

I don't think I'll ever get to the point of suicide or self-harm, I have seen the impacts that has on others and I would check myself into the hospital before that. Right now though I feel like I am in the middle class of self-hate. I have and suffer from it, but not enough to go get serious help for it. Honestly, I think so little of myself I don't know if I want to put my insurance company (US) through paying for a mental health stay anyway. 

I don't know what to do, or how to break the cycle or how to start caring for myself or liking myself. I am tired of people telling me to do what, ""makes me happy"" because there isn't anything that does. I really can't tell you what I enjoy anymore, I think everything has just become an escape for me, and not in a healthy way. Even when my husband asked what I wanted to do for my birthday, I just don't know or care enough to think of something to do that I would enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any advice or whatever comes my way."

457,"I'm almost 24M, the last time I cried was 7 to 8 years ago.","As the title says the last time I cried was a while back it was because of my grandfather had passed I was fairly close to him because for the last 2 years of his life he was living with us and due to his dimentia I was his primary care taker and also got to know him pretty well.

My question to this sub is should I be going to a therapist because I didn't cry at my grandma's passing"
458,Free or low-cost mental health care?,"Hi reddit, I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, what I think is binge eating and restrictive eating. A little related story... My biological sister (we grew up in the same household as well) has been recently diagnosed with binge eating disorder. She also had been previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety. My biological brother was diagnosed with depression. My oldest, half-sister was diagnosed with depression several years ago.

I need help and am trouble finding affordable resources. My health insurance will not cover mental health care until my deductible is met and finances are tight. I want to get help but I can't invest money currently to do so. I have tried a few depression medications without much success. I am more interested in cognitive behavior therapy than medication. Any advice appreciated! Thank you!!"
459,What is up with this?,"I just don’t know who I am anymore. My personality changes so much depending on who I am. Sometimes when I’m around certain people, later on in the day I realize how strange that was and how it was not me. I just want to find my true self but it always changes. I hope you can understand. Just for reference incase it is relevant, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have had derealization for the past year."
460,How do I help students on my campus?,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post this. 

I’m a college student, and recently, there’s been a high number of suicide and other mental health problems here. Our school has done nothing and resources here are limited.

I want to help them but I don’t know how. I’m currently setting up an online, anonymous peer support group through discord. We had 100+ people in the first day. They were venting, sharing, etc. 

However, it’s gone quiet since then and I think people forgot about it. I know people are still scared because they’re venting all over Reddit. I want to create something like a distress text line. I just don’t have the money and am only one person. I’ve been calling other organizations for support and help all of last week but no one has replied.

If anyone has experience or any idea of what I can do to support my peers, please let me know. This is a very personal issue for me, so I’m not going to give up on it. Thanks :)"
461,Is it normal to have thoughts like this?,"I feel like I'm going crazy. I'll literally walk into a room with nothing but memes and rainbows on my mind and BAM! PSYCHOTIC THOUGHTS OUT OF NOWHERE! Every time I see a knife I have the sudden urge to stab myself, stick my fingers in a pencil sharpener, my face in a blender, jump into a pond, or off a roof, etc. I want to rationalize this and say that I'm fine and it's just the fact that I could do it not that I would. But it's not the thought that scares me it's the urge to carry out the thought. Is this normal?"
462,I feel like I have depression,"Hi there, I just want to make it clear that I am absolutely not trying to pretend to be depressed for karma, and I am not saying I have depression either. It's just that this year has been really tough for me, and in the past few days I've lost motivation to do absolutely anything. I always feel unmotivated, irritated, and have this urge to stuff myself with food. I also wanna sleep all the time, which is weird since I get a good amount of sleep each night, and I never had the urge to fall asleep midday before, especially not during midterms, I always had the urge to study, talk to my friends, go out, stay up all night etc. Now all I wanna do is binge on TV shows and food while I question everything. And I heard that these are signs of depression, I just want a professional opinion about my situation."
463,Can Paranoid People Have Insight?,"I've already asked this question in another post and got a very helpful response but I'm diagnosed with OCD and I need constant reassurance. If you want to know any details about my current diagnosis and medication I'm on please do ask, I'll respond ASAP. 

I have some disturbing thoughts about people following me and wanting to hurt me, even coming to my family's property, but I am able to identify those thoughts as unhealthy. This does not bring me any relief though, I'm still afraid of these people as if they are very much real and have been in such fear sometimes that I think about carrying a knife to my school to defend myself from them. I know that people with paranoia usually don't have insight into their condition. I don't know what's wrong with me."
464,These feel like stupid questions. I just need a little help,"About me:

- I'm a 44 year old male in the USA (NJ). 
- I was diagnosed with ADD or ADHD in grade school more than 30 years ago. I've never seen a Dr. about my mental health out side of school. My ADD is pretty bad but I was able to graduate collage and get a good job.
- I had some pretty bad depressive episodes in high school and I guess I've always cycled up and down a little. It's never been manic to the point of losing touch with reality or depressive like I can't get out of bed. 
- The last few years I've started to become anxious more often.
- I drink heavily daily(I would assume more by most measures). I don't believe that I'm a traditional alcoholic. I abstain when I don't feel well. I drink only after work for a few hours (probably 6 or fewer drinks) and then have no trouble stopping, etc. 

- Over consumption of alcohol and ADD run in my family. I believe my sister has bipolar disorder or similar (she hasn't been diagnosed to my knowledge).

Very lately I get really moody with my wife. I get set off over trivial things she does and stay mad for days. We argue about it and I can see how she was right all along. It's embarrassing and I fear its going to damage or relationship beyond repair. This is definitely directly related to alcohol, if anything I'm more even when I'm drinking and I can't think of any arguments that have started about drinking or while drinking. Also maybe people would call it depression, I don't know. I feel just stuck in life, nothing seems to make me feel good, life feels hard, kids are a struggle, I feel unsuccessful etc. Most times we argue after this goes on for a while and then... suddenly I feel better at least for a little while.  

I guess I'm here to ask what should I do? I assume You'll tell me to speak to a Dr., where do I start with that? I'm well aware that I should stop or at least decrease my drinking. I have insurance. Do I just call any random psychiatrist I find locally? Do I go to my family doctor?"
465,My dad's inferiority complex,"So I guess my dad thinks just because he is my dad that he HAS to be smarter than me (even though I have a Bachelor's degree) and anytime I try to say anything that he doesn't know much about, he just screams at me until I'm silent. He will stop at nothing to silence me, and every day he wears my self-image down more and more. I need to move out because I feel like this is most of the reason I've been so anxious and suicidal. I feel like a prisoner in my own damn house and I cannot get out. I have nothing so it's this mental abuse or be homeless."
466,Community/Support Group/Resources for mental health?,[removed]
467,I’m very forgetful and it’s really affecting me,"Idk if this is the right place to post so please let me know. I’m 19 F. Never have been diagnosed with anything although I do know that I most likely have GAD. I keep losing things, like rings or other jewelry. I also keep forgetting assignments for my classes and it’s affecting my grades. I’m usually a straight A student. I’ve tried to be more organized. I put reminders in my phone and other stuff but I can’t help it:(. Is it possible that I have ADHD or ADD?"
468,Feeling Lost and Overwhelmed,"All of this started when I lost my part time job last month. I'm 20M done with my 12th final exams and was working with a small company as a Graphic Designer. I live in a 3rd world country so it was hard getting a good job remotely let alone part time.

I want to continue my education to get a degree (have not decided which one or career) but I also need to support my family. I'm thinking on starting Freelancing to start getting some income asap but all of this plus the thought of what the future of my career will be is overwhelming and the more I think about it the more depressing it is getting. For the past few days I want to cry, I have tried to but I cannot and the only thing that feels like helping me is running around in circles and smashing my head on my pillow.

I am doubting myself and my skills at this point too. Thinking I'm not worth anything and overall all I see is darkness."
469,When do you cut ties with a loved one?,"After 25 years of having a mentally I'll brother I'm just so sick of it.  He goes through phases but frequently blows up.  He blew up on my father a couple of months ago and I guess my father has decided to not answer his calls.   He asked me this weekend 'Why doesn't dad answer my calls?'.  I said I didn't know but likely he didn't like it when you blew up on him so maybe you should think about apologizing for that.   Anyhow - he immediately hung up, then flew into a rage about how dare I suggest he apologize.  Then he starts to throw in anything he can think up where he feels he has been unfairly treated.   

In the past I typically just ignore him for a week or so an he will eventually apologize but these episodes are getting so old.   He left 25 messages and a few nasty emails.  Here is a sampling - this is a very tame one.

https://s21.aconvert.com/convert/p3r68-cdx67/je512-fu3s5.m4a

He has done this to his mother, father, landlords, anytime he feels like he has been mistreated.  He then will proceed to call and tell the rest of the family how poorly he gets treated.    He is smart however so plays the victim card very well.  He likes to tell me how the rest of family can't believe what we do him (whatever that is).

He will feel better in a week or two and make amends promising to never do it again but alas..  here we are.   His mental health team recently dropped him as although he has mental Illness he is high functioning and more manipulative/angry then anything, he refused to get the help they kept suggesting to manage his anger.

Just to give you an idea of random things that set him off this past summer his roommate asked him to not talk so loud on his phone as he is a shift worker...  well this set him off and 15 minutes later he jumped his roommate in bed beating him and told him 'don't you ever f%^% tell me what to do"".    He got kicked out of that place..  but like all the other times it was them not him that caused it.

I refused to help him move as I just moved him in a few months earlier and then he blew up similarly to the message above... I was an idiot always taking other peoples sides and never listening to him etc...

Anyway - after 25 years of this its really starting to take its toll.  I really feel like just cutting off all ties with him.  He has literally also ended contact with the rest of the family..  I don't know what he tells them but they have never called to ask if we needed help supporting him..  in fact just the opposite has happened, we never hear from them.  According to him he tells them all the terrible things we've done to him.  

Any else out there ever feel this?"
470,Tulpa,"When I was younger I created an imaginary friend. I've done this out of loneliness and to help with traumatic events I experienced as a child. Idk if this counts as an mental illness but I just want to share this. This imaginary friend was just normal for any child. Over time my imaginary friend take many shapes and forms. When I gotten older it started to have it's own personality and even argued with me. I started to do research I didn't want to talk to anyone about it because I didn't want anyone think I am crazy. I couldn't find anything. I heard the term tulpa many times but I didn't believe it was a thing. But after doing research I realise that this indeed sounds familiar. This person in my head takes many forms they want. Depending on my mindset. they have their own personality. Right now she has red hair, a white rabbit mask, and a hospital dress. She normally keeps me company and sometime she is quiet idk if anyone experienced this but if you have can anyone help me understand why this is happening?"
471,Dissasociative states + chatter,"When I was younger 7-22 I repeatedly had some dissociated epesodes that where very random and sparse maybe 2 a year they came to a stop at 23yo and havnt had one since.
I wanted to know if anyone had similar symptoms. I also have no family history of mental illness.

Epesodes lasted about 4-5min can be stopped by watching telly or talking to another human.
I would feel seprate from my body as if I'm watching myself do things. There would be a noise like chatter in my mind that was very loud but audiably silent.
The chatter came with a rising pressure as if it was getting louder and stronger the longer I leave it.
Trying to listen to the sound and pick out words(sounded like 100 people talking at once) I would find myself manipulating what words I would her, so I concluded I am not hearing voices just hearing my own internal monolog louder than the noise but only when focused on.


It was completely unberable occurred mainly when sitting in silence. Onset was like a Deja vu moment with super fast whispering that got louder and louder but only in my internal monolog not a adituary hallucination. Anyone had somthing like this in there youth?"
472,I feel disconnected from reality,"I (19m) have been feeling disconnected from reality for as long as I can remember. I only really started acknowledging it when I realized that I wasn’t really ”feeling any emotions”.

I cant recollect the last time I felt pure happiness and joy and with the upbringing I had, I can’t cry no matter what the situation is. It’s like i’m watching my life pass by and nothing feels right anymore and I don’t know how to cope with this or what to do.

If any of you could help me understand what’s happening or just about anything would be greatly appreciated."
473,Fiance Not Understanding,"My (29F) therapist diagnosed me with Histrionic Personality Disorder at the beginning of October. 

I was so busy, I didn't really have time for the reality of to sink in until this past week/weekend. My fiance (28M) is amazing and is always there for me in my mental health crisis', and even helps me take my antidepressant when I ""don't feel like it."" 

This weekend I started to fall into a depression over this. I spent 12 years of misdiagnoses, putting myself in horrible situations all related to this disorder. If I had known when I was 20, I wouldn't be where I am today. 

My fiance hates to see me spiral into depression, and with HPD it happens quite often. So in an attempt to try to lift my spirits he said -- I hate when people let their illness define them. 

While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think he understands the severity of a personality disorder. This stupid thing is the majority of who I am, or have been up til this point. I mean I have done horribly promiscuous things because of this personality disorder... Things I look back on and am wondering why or how that even occured. It took over my entire life.

Am I wrong to think he's wrong?"
474,Am I normal? Is it stress or am I having mental breakdown?,"Not sure how to start.. but everything’s was a build up for many years. 

Not even sure what or how should I type so here’s some scatter thoughts and information.

I grew up in a broken family, raised by my mother.
She worked multiple jobs to support my brother and I. Our life are much better now as compared to the past.

I’ve taken up most of the cleaning in the household 90%? And feel being taken for granted, it’s making me feel like I’m obligated to do so and not being appreciated. (My friends call me Cinderella)

My mom rely a lot on me until the extend I feel like I’m being abused mentally. One recent incident - I was in the toilet, and my mum shout for me for some help from the kitchen. As I was taking a dump, I shouted for my brother who was resting in the room. And instead of having his help she rather wait for me. To her it was nothing, to me I feel like she didn’t want to disturb his rest. 

Side note I always feel like my mom is biased towards my brother. (Traditional Asian mentally which boys are being favoured more than girls). I told her how I feel during one of our huge argument/my mental breakdown and she said she’s not. But here’s one of many other incident why I felt this way - I stay with my mom, my brother comes home randomly and on the weekends. On days that he coming home my mom will cook a lot of dishes, prawns fish meat etc. But on normal days just the both of us she would usually cook simple and less dish. And whenever he’s home she would always ask if she need to scoop his rice, has he eaten, is he tired etc blablabla. But whenever she came home her first few sentences to me “why didn’t you clean this, why didn’t you clean that. Bla blabla along this line.” Never have I eaten am I tired.

Also whenever I tried to talk to her be it in whatever methods - calmly, crying, argument, shouting and screaming. She always blame it back on me. There’s always smth to blame it on me and nothing is ever her fault/problem. 

Anw to cut things short, I feel very drain by my mom, mentally abused, tired of this life (not suicidal), want to escape from her but feel guilty about it as she’s growing old each day, not in good health. Random days I’ll just cry and get over it and life goes on.

So what am I? Am I suffering from depression? Or mental illness? I don’t feel like I am but I do cry by myself whenever I can’t take it anymore. And of course whatever I said above are just the tip of the iceberg but i am really really really very tired of this shit. 

Ps/ I still love her a lot."
475,Fieve-Dunner Manic Depressive Mood Scale Rating (DSM) By Hour,"I hope you had an amazing weekend!

Yesterday, I structured my notes so that I could chart my mood throughout the day. 

I did a subjective scale first but then converted to the Fieve-Dunner Manic Depressive Mood Scale (DSM). They will often use this when checking patients for bipolar. 

What I found interesting is that I was having a great day so I subjectively rated it in the range of 8. However, according to the DSM, 8 is extreme elation meaning I could be manic, psychotic or delusional.

Depending on who you are, you don't actually want to be too low or too high. A 60 is a mildly elevated mood and is a good place to be. 

As the Buddhist say, aim for the ""Middle Way"".

I've attached:

1. [Subjective &amp; DSM ratings by hour](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fieve-Dunner-Manic-Depressive-Mood-Scale-Rating.png)
2. [The scale and definitions from the DSM](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fieve-Dunner-Manic-Depressive-Mood-Scale.png)
3. [The number of words typed by hour](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Number-of-Words.png)

Using this scale now gives me better insights into the unstructured writing I did throughout the day.

For me right now is this the scale I should be using? I don't know if I'm considered a ""Healthy Normal"" now in my life or not you know?

How are you tracking mood? Do you have any ideas on better ways to track and format this? What tools do you find best for this process?

❤"
476,My mom said all I've been doing is complaining lately but idk what else to do?,"I've been getting a mega load of work hours even though I said I can only work a set amount of hours, I keep getting bad grades on my essays in my English class, and I feel like I'm getting tired faster lately. My life is getting full of repetitiveness and I just dont want to do anything anymore, its obvious no one cares about my issues and my complaining is annoying people, so should I just shut up let life run its course? I'm out of ideas man, out of them completely."
477,"im confused about my gender and my pronouns, thoughts?","from age 12 to 18 (now) ive had a complex about my chest area. im really on and off about wanting them chopped off and keeping them. sometimes i just dont want to have visible boobs, and dress more 'masculine' than 'feminine'. 

i tried to appear as feminine as i could before, because i wanted to appear like all the other girls in my classes, wearing tight clothes and padded bras, and thought it was wrong to not dress like them ( i was a closeted panromantic and didnt want to appear 'gay' from the way i dressed, like if i wore sports bras and baggy 'masculine' clothes). 

some times i feel like im kind of not a girl, but i know i am..? im really confused. i have always identified with being a girl, but i would not mind being called they/them. i tested the they/them pronouns out with some internet friends, and i was happy they referred to me as 'they', but i dont know if im just confusing myself..  im really confused about what the heck i am, and if this is just me being all confused, i have no clue. i dont feel like a he/him though, it doesnt feel right for me.

i need someone elses thoughts on this, like am i just being confused and looking to much into it?"
478,I get angry at someone/something that is not real,"So, first off, ive always been a bit of an ""explosive"" person, as in i will enter a state of rage without warning in literally any scenario. But now, the anger doesn't feel like a general frustration or irritation or a bad mood, it feels directed, as if im angry at someone. What it feels like is as if someone was constantly talking to me in an annoying voice or saying annoying things loudly, and i just want them to shut up. I can't literally hear voices, but the feeling i get is the same as if i was. I get the urge to scream or beat this imaginary being that pisses me off, and occassionally i will compulsively grunt or yell ""shut up"" without intending to. It really feels like someone is actually there actively pissing me off, and yet there is no one there, and i know there is no one there, and it still happens. I have no idea what's wrong with me. Please help. 

I don't know if this is important, but here is a list of my currently diagnosed disorders:

\-Borderline Personality Disorder

\-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

\-Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

\-Depression

\-Severe Anxiety Disorder"
479,I don’t know if I believe in anything anymore.,"I’m not religious, but I’ve been having a crisis of faith for four years. And it’s only gotten worse. Every day I vacillate between believing in god and not believing, believing Good will outweigh Evil and then believing that it actually will not, believing Death is not a bad thing and then not being so sure, etc. etc. It makes me question my existence on a daily basis. I don’t know how to end this cycle. It feels like an obsession. I don’t know what to do about it. Has anyone else had thoughts like this...? How do you stay out of the dark thoughts?"
480,"Does anyone else have bad mental health days when everything is just sluggish, mentally and physically?"," Like I woke up today and nothing is appealing, I'm moving slowly, feel like I'm underwater. Everything aches. My brain is slow. My digestion is so slow I've thrown up because my breakfast has just been sitting in my stomach for four hours going nowhere and it made me nauseous."
481,drinking too much again,"i (M16) didn’t used to want to smoke anything or drink alone. it was fun and social and the idea of doing it alone was problematic.

that’s changed. i’ve been drinking alone a lot, just went to a party and smoked as much weed as i possibly could just to not think.
i want to drink tonight too and if i had enough to get wasted i would just to stare at the ceiling and watch it spin.
where the fuck do i go from here?"
482,"(Im a 17 year old male, smoker,) Everybody talks to me about their suicidal tendencies but it seems like noone cares how i feel.","In the past week ive talked 3 people down from suicide, one was a good friend that i had a romantic relationship with but we fell off, one was a good friend in middle school and we fell off after he got into drugs and one is a girl that i just started talking to and i barely know her. Why are these people attracted to me when it comes to talking? I know it sounds selfish to say i dont want them to but i fucking dont. I have suicidal tendencies myself but noone asks how i feel or if im ok, they jusg vent to me about how thier gonna shoot themselves or down a bottle of pills and then when i help them they just fucking leave and then come back when they wanna talk about them again. Its fucking stressful because this happens all the time, i have school, work and bills now and people wanting to kill themselves just adds more stress to my life. Its like im fucking cursed to bear the burden of other peoples thoughts and it sucks. I just wanna be ok."
483,How do people jump off something and fight the instinct?,I tried to jump off something and the instincts really pick up. How do people do it?
484,Gaslighting,"I love that the it’s ok to not be ok movement is gaining momentum. I desperately want their to be more mental health education and awareness. 

But holy shit am I regretting opening up about my mental illness to anyone that’s not licensed or a true friend. I just had someone who claimed to love me and wanted me to uproot my life for them someone who was a “mental health advocate” lie to me, consciously trigger a trauma they were aware of, then gaslight the shit out of me and disappear leaving me no closure. Then two of my close family members (most have passed) gas light me as well. I have gone over every situation with a licensed therapist to ensure I am not in the wrong or be aware if I am. 

I work tirelessly at my mental health. I have been since it came to the forefront of my attention 3 years ago. Hell even in high school I was reading Richard Carlson, pema chodron and the likes. Actively trying to rewrite my cognitive functions in a healthier manner. 

But god damn if I’m not tired of being fucking gas lighted and projected onto. Is it because I am firm in my awareness of my mental health and open that people feel the need to project and gaslight? I really don’t understand it. 

I hope we get through these growing pains so people can ALL start healing their traumas and treating others as they wish to be treated and focusing on their own mental health. 

Rant over."
485,"Does this count as emotional abuse, if so what do I do","Hi, I (M17) have been struggling for a while, for years, my parents have been causing me loads of grief, they’re not horrible people but to me they seem different people, they scream and shout at me and my sister for pretty much anything we do wrong, and recently I’ve noticed it’s been getting worse, I go to college and my dad in particular has been on my back for so long about revision, for every hour in lesson we have, we’re meant to do an hour out, this equates to about 2 hours a day, but my dad has been pressuring me to do more, every single day I apparently do nothing and I’m lazy, the other day I did over 6 hours without any breaks and that was still nowhere near enough and he started screaming, he knows the effect this has on me since I’ve attempted suicide in the past due to similar scenarios, I did something minorly wrong and he started screaming and making a scene. Usually I would escape him by playing games, but recently hes started threatening to take my PC away for long periods, I’m not allowed outside as well so I would have no way to take the way he makes me feel off my mind. I’ve told one of my friends about all this and they’ve been saying this is emotional abuse and I need to get social services or the police involved, I don’t know what to do anymore, my mental health has been deteriorating for a while again and I’m worried. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? 

I’m sorry if this seems like a moody teenager bitching about non important issues, but this is really having negative effects on me."
486,Virtual school feels so defeating,"I'm taking a lot of hard classes this year but the way they're being treated with the pandemic is awful I feel like no matter what I do ill fail  , from there I don't have the energy or motivation to learn anything or try to fix those failures. Any one have advice"
487,I feel REALLY guilty when I spend money..,"I used to be addicted to spending money, on worthless shit. I mean a LOT of money.

It was money I had saved up for a long time like a couple years. I started spending money I didn't even have, almost getting into debt. I stopped doing that, because I would be broke.

Now whenever I want to buy something, even if it's 8 dollars, I still feel unbelievably guilty, Like I'm doing something dishonest. The guilt is like, the type of dishonest guilt if you were to steal something.

Any advice on how to not feel guilty while spending money?"
488,Biting tongue when thinking,"Hi guys, I have this weird habit of biting my tongue when im in deep thought/anxious. Should I be worried about it? It has been going on for more than 10 years and for some reason i kinda ‘enjoy’ the pain? It feels like when you scratch yourself when it itch.."
489,"Truly, in need of online therapy or help of some kind.","I was diagnosed with testicular cancer in February and finished treatments in April. I've been away from work and recovering at home.  Due to the pandemic, I'm worried about going back (I work at a car dealership) and dealing with possible exposure. 

I've been paid my salary while working from home (helping answer sales leads) and now I am told they will no longer pay me unless I physically go back. I'm devastated and anxious and I'm finding it difficult to go back. Of course without my job, I lose not only my modest salary but my health insurance as well. 

Any help pointing me in the right direction regarding online therapy would be a huge help. Thank you in advance!"

491,NHS - Mental Well-being While Staying At Home,"Hey everyone!

How are we all doing today?

Thanks to the lovely people of the NHS, they kindly make a list of ways to look after your Mental Health while In Lockdown during this worldwide pandemic. I believe I have posted about this before, but just to remind people and the brand new members of the r/mentalhealth. A big welcome to you! Understandably, people’s Mental Health are being struck incredibly hard during the pandemic. This sub, as it has done everyday for the past few months has been incredibly supportive, helpful and giving out advice left, right and centre for people who need is the most. So, due to that, I thank you for that. Down below are some tips from the NHS on how to look after your Mental Health during these difficult times:

- Check your employment and benefits rights 
- Stay connected with others - family and friends. 
- Get your worries out in the open. It is much better to get it out of your system, rather than keep it inside of you. 
- Look after your body. It’s not always open your Mental strength, but physical too. If you’re able to, get out there and do some exercise!
- Don’t stay glued to the news. These days, watching the news or reading the newspaper can be a depressing thought. Unfortunately, that’s all you see is negative news, one after another. Instead, watch a comedy film or read a nice novel!
- Don’t let the pandemic take control of your life and put it on stall. Continue to do the things you enjoy doing the most. Go and play some sport, video games, listen to music, watch some movies and much more!
- Give yourself enough time in the world to relax. 
- And lastly.... sleep is important. If you’re able to, sleep for 8/9 hours a night. You’ll feel incredibly fresh the next day!

Once again, thank you for the kind and lovely people of the NHS. To read up further on this: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-at-home-tips/

Thanks for reading everyone. And remember, stay safe! :) 

Love to you all."
492,i need your advice or opinion if you experienced this,"i have been diagnosed with depression and i'm on antidepressant medication for over a year this treatment really helped me but im suffering from annoying and weird dreams i know deep down inside me these dreams arent normal cause when i woke up i feel like i haven't had sleep at all because of those dreams, i dont really know how to describe it but i cant afford any therepy right now so im asking if any one of you experience something like that ?"
493,Downward Spiral,"  I'm desperate for this to end. I try dropping hints to my parents that I need help, but I can't bring myself to actually ask. I don't what I'm looking for to help me but there has to be something. It's insane. I'm so desperate for a way out of this but I can't do the one thing that could possibly make things better. I don't want to self diagnose, but I've been feeling all the symptoms of anxiety and depression for years and I'm so tired. It's ruining my life. I can't make friends because anytime I have to go anywhere I have a panic attack, which drains me almost everyday. I cheat my way through middle school because everything I read just goes right through my head. Everything I used to love feels like a chore. I'm too stressed to stay awake but too scared to go to sleep, afraid of what nightmares will wake me up in a cold sweat in the morning. I haven't been hungry in months. All my muscles feel weak and exhausted. I keep zoning out into weird vivid day dreams that I can't snap out of. All of a sudden I'm having these weird thoughts that are things like ""if you don't put on this pair of socks something bad will happen"" I don't know if that's just my imagination or something I should add to the list of things that are wrong with my brain. And I'm so easily irritated and I can't control when I lash out at my family. That's even worse than being sad all the time because I'm making them upset too. Everyone would just be better off with out me. It just feels like a constant downward spiral that's I'll never escape. I don't even look like myself anymore. And no one knows but a few strangers on the internet, even though I'm surrounded by people that love and care for me. Why does it feel like I'm all alone?"
494,Could this be bipolar disorder?,"I have most of the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Maniac episodes, though not really common. These episodes just make me do things I wouldn't normally do. These I do aren't very harmful, and can even make me more outgoing, as I  tend to be very introverted. More commonly however are depressive episodes, and sometimes its gets so bad that I start have suicidal thoughts. Usually these episodes only last for a few hours at most but it definitely has lasted for a couple days. However, I usually feel pretty normal and I try to not to let these affect me.  I also have mood swings, loss of interest in things I know I enjoyed, and more. 

One thing that is preventing me from seeking out a professional diagnosis, is that I am a teenager. I know it is hard to get a bipolar diagnosis as a teen as it could just be mood swings. Is this bipolar, something else, or just hormornal mood swings?"
495,i'm done,"its been so long. when will it get better? i cant anymore, im done. i cant do anything anymore. im not committing now, but i feel like itll be unavoidable."
496,I'm seriously debating whether or not I should go off my meds.,"I know the title shouts 'bad idea' but please at least listen to my reasoning.

I'm currently on 600mg of seroquel and 150mg of wellbutrin. 

Currently diagnosed with chronic insomnia, depression, PTSD, some anger issues, and ADHD. I have some paranoia issues, but I haven't received any diagnosis for it. I also have agoraphobia, although I haven't received a formal diagnosis either. 

I'm female, 17, 5'8, and currently weigh 245 lbs. My weight is a very big issue for my mental health, and I've struggled a lot to get it down. It took me a year to get to 245lbs from 263lbs. I eat about 1 meal a day and have been limiting my sugar intake. 

My weight makes it harder for me to do the things I love, like take walks, go bike riding, dance, and honestly just take care of myself. I have asthma on top of it (something I had before the weight) and it's very difficult to even just shower. It hurts to breathe. 

I wondered why I was still so heavy even after changing up my whole eating style. I then found many, many articles talking about how seroquel can cause significant weight gain. I seriously felt crushed. The one thing that was suppose to be helping me is causing one of my biggest issues. 

The seroquel has helped me sleep and stay calm, and I'm happy about that. I'm definitely more erratic when I'm off it, but again, it's causing one of my most serious issues.

I've been on it for about 2 and a half years, with no real change in doses. 

I've changed a lot as a person, and have stopped self harming for about a year, so for a whole year the seroquel just made me sleep. I don't think it was what helped me stop self harming. 

I'm just so angry rn honestly (no, I haven't stopped taking them yet). I was not told of any of the side effects, hell I wasn't even told it was an antipsychotic. I thought it was an antidepressant (which none of the ones I've been on have done any sort of good...) Although I'm young, I want to know exactly what I'm putting in my body. I ask questions, but it really feels like they are annoyed every time. 

My brother eats the same as me, hell probably even worse and is still thin. I'm the only chubby sibling and it's extremely obvious. I hate my body and feel like garbage all the time. It feels like every time I take the seroquel I'm hungry.

I'm basically addicted to seroquel by now (I have extreme withdrawal symptoms, and literally cannot eat because I throw everything up.) I'm not planning on going cold turkey, as I know how awful my withdrawal gets. I plan to slowly lower the dosage of the seroquel (not the wellbutrin, it doesn't have anything bad side effects from it) 

Overall, I'm still debating. I would like an outside opinion so I know it's not just my feelings getting to me."
497,"A new YouTube series a friend of mine is making, to help others deal with their mental health.","A friend of mine is working on a YouTube series to discuss her struggles with mental health and how to deal with them. I thought I would share it with all of you, in the hopes that this might help someone else dealing with mental health related issues.

498,Using an EAP program,My company offers an employee assistance program to help with a variety of things one being counseling. Everything at work along with the pandemic has really made me lose it. Should I start with the EAP to get counseling through the employer. I’ve never used this program before.
499,Are Self Diagnosis' good?,"**I don’t know if I’m depressed.**

I don’t know if I’m overly anxious. What is normal? Some days I have numb days, like today, when nothing can keep you from feeling so empty. How far do you have to stay to be mental incompetent; to have previously been sent to an asylum. What does it take to be called insane? How many itches, bruises, scratches. How can they see the ones inside too? They wouldn’t take a lie detector into a hospital, would they? No. They wouldn’t. They’d employ someone to say the worse, to rinse out all hope. For the parents to be given the worse news: we can help her. Now our systems have advanced, you, the parent, who most likely could’ve saved a lot of your own child’s innocence if the equipment we have now was around then. The diagnosis might have helped, or hindered your life. The label could have turned sour, into a scar, or it could be something to be proud of. How do we know how someone else would react? Especially our own parents.

**Or am I just insecure**"
500,How can i feel like my dad isn't a stranger if i only see him once every two weeks?,My parents are divorced and i see him once every 2 weeks for 2 and a half days. He doesn't share his personal life and we aren't allowed to share ours.
501,"I wish I could day a sick ""mental health"" day",I'm drained and exhausted and I don't want to seem weak but I just need a break
502,is this normal behaviour / way to think ?,"i cant stop checking the same cupoards/drawers and fridge multiple times. i end up looking through each cabinet everyday, and i spend about half an hour on doing it. if i dont check them, i will think about it until i check them all thoroughly. its the first thing i do when i come home. even though im not looking for something to eat, i still do it because i feel like i have to (which is basically every time).

i kinda do the same thing about checking my daily schedule plan multiple times every hour, i cant stop checking it, and if i dont check it when i feel like it, i feel like i will forget something. I think i wont show up on time for classes, even though i know when every class starts and ends, but i do it just in case im wrong, which im not since ive memorized it from the constant checking. still feel the need to check, even when it wont change. i often think 'if i dont do it, something bad will happen'."
503,Advice please,"I have a situation. I have a younger brother (43), me (52) and he has been delusional for some time but always had a job and sustained himself. (He lives alone in a different state then I). Recently he left his job for whatever delusion he's been having. My question is, how can I (in Cali and him in maine) talk him into seeing a doctor for his delusions so he will work again. Financially it is a burden on me."
504,Doctors please help!,"I don't really know how to start this, I just need some help in shedding some light for myself. I'm 21 and as far as I know I'v been depressed for a good chunk of my life, I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 14 and anxiety is also in the mix. When I was 13 my father got full custody of me and i was made to leave my mom and live with him. When I was with him i always had extreme difficulty communicating, it happens when something is brought up it can be a little issue and I will cry uncomfortably. It doesn't matter how much I prepare myself it always happens and its frustrating and it makes me feel angry and ashamed, embarrassed too. My mind goes crazy I can't really get anything out how I need. My mind is racing all the time I feel like as soon as I get my words and let them out they aren't the same thing that I thought of. This happened so much when I was with my father I'd get into trouble and when they'd confront me sit me down or whatever  the same thing would happen freeze up and not be able to get anything out or if I was able to get anything out it wouldn't make sense. 
Half of the time I'm depressed and little go away I'll have my okay time and it will hit again. I've been in a relationship for 2 year now we have a beautiful son together and I'm expecting my 2nd child with him right now, my struggle with communication is straining things in our relationship. I just need answers it's so expensive for mental health care and we are barely making ends meet. 
Not until recently I was trying to think back to my childhood and there are parts I don't remember. I've considered a lot of things for my mental issues, like bipolar disorder or bipolar depression. 
When I was little probably like 7 or 8 I think it's hard to remember but I was riding my bike one day, I had learned without training wheels like some months prior I think. Well today i was riding and we lived down a kinda gravel road and I'd go to the last house and back but that day the lady at the end of the street was out with her dog. Idk if she let it out on purpose or what but that little rat came bolting for me on my bike ran in front of me after I had turned around and picked up speed I hit it but it stopped me and flipped my bike I landed on my head and I don't really remember what happened after that I just remember there was blood dripping down my face and I had an indentation in my skull for a long time and is still partially there now. 
I was doing reading sometime at the beginning of the year about serial killers and head trauma and It dawned on me that what If I did really get messed up when I fell and now it's the reason behind my mental illnesses and my difficulties communicating. I didn't go to the hospital after that I can remember.
I can't say for certain weather I have bpd or anything I'm not a doctor but I just need answers and or some light."
505,"People that consider themselves “cured” of whatever mental illness they had, did your perspective on life change? If so,how?","The world is so complex that it’s scary sometimes, when I was suffering from body dysmorphia and I was crying daily, the thing I was afraid of the most was that I was going to be fighting this thing my whole life and that my suffering wouldn’t have a payoff."
506,Redeveloping habits and routines,"Many habits and routines are destroyed entirely from depression. I can't seem to find effective help on fixing routines and redeveloping positive habits.

Commonly the instructions are quite scripted. Get better exercise, eat better, go out more. Etc. These are unrealistic since no one magically starts a new habit. For some people even getting out of their bed is a struggle. I, for example, try to set a new routine and almost instantly the routine failed. I have a hunch the way to get to building these habits and routines realistically is related to the use of the CBT model. I cannot, however, figure out if this would work or even how it would work. Maybe I'm wrong. Either way I would appreciate help on this topic. Advice, information, experience, it doesn't matter to me how you support me in this issue since all would be helpful. I'm thankful that you did manage to read this and I hope you respond."
507,I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I (17m) am a senior in high-school. I believe I struggle with mental illness but my parents refuse to help me seek any treatment in fear of “no one wants to hire a retard”. I sometimes get so frustrated with my life it makes me just want to hit my head against a wall. But instead I cut myself because it’s quieter. I feel so overwhelmed all the time and I feel like i’m truly never all there. I am scared to go driving sometimes because I’ve almost gotten into crashes simply because I zone off. My lack of attention has made me struggles severely
in school. I simply can’t keep focused. Last night I woke up at 4am and I went to go grab a drink of water. My entire body felt foreign and numb and as I looked around I had a strong sense of unfamiliarity. I made my way back to my bedroom. I am incredibly tired, but it felt like my head was yelling at me and my thoughts were so loud and they couldn’t go away and it didn’t let me sleep. If i’m being completely honest I’m not suicidal. I wish I had easy means of killing myself because the thought of going to sleep forever sounds like heaven, but I can’t do that. I have 2 sisters who I love and I want to be here for because I know my parents are emotionally unavailable. I’ve begged them for help, to take me to a therapist. They refuse. I told them how I feel and they’re telling me it’s just puberty and my hormones and that they felt this way too. I overthink everything, I can turn an innocent conversation with a friend, to something they’re plotting behind my back. I get mood swings everyday but I bottle them up and very rarely do I have outbursts, but I can go for motivated and excited one second to nihilistic and depressed the next with no real cause, I know this sounds like i’m bipolar but i’ve been like this my entire life, and i’m not sure if being bipolar is developed or inherited. I believe my mother struggles with mental illness as well. She would tell me stories about how when she was younger she’d see a little ball floating in the air, and it would move closer to her and get bigger and bigger. And that my grandma took her to the hospital and the doctors told her it’s because she’s not studying hard enough. And that it’s the fear of being unaccomplished. 


There’s a lot more but for the sake of not typing too much so more people are willing to read this and respond, what would YOU do? I just want to feel normal. I don’t care about myself honestly, I’m just worried if I don’t fix myself soon I’ll end up killing myself and I won’t be able to be there for my sisters. This is the main reason i’m reaching out for help right now."
508,We’re going into lockdown again,"When it was announced, I felt fine- I live in the UK and, with the way our cases are going, it’s clear that more measures are needed to help keep people safe.

It’s just hit me now how sad I am by it. I’m an introvert and normally love any reason to stay in. Now, I miss feeling safe out and about and I’m concerned and mad when people tell me they are breaking the rules. I mourn for the little luxuries like popping out for a proper cup of coffee or having the family round. And we haven’t even started the second lockdown yet. 

I’ve made a list of all the things I’ve learned from the last lockdown and how I can support myself better this time so I don’t spiral into depression again. I’ve haphazardly tried to create a better environment. I can now better identify when I start to get carried away with depressing thoughts, but I still get caught up in them. I’m dreading the winter."
509,i wish i had known sooner,"im 20 years old, and a few months ago i was diagnosed with ADHD. im medicated now and i feel like a new person. school is, for the first time, not the most difficult thing in the world. i wish more than anything that i couldve gotten treated when i was younger. i developed horrible self esteem issues and i thought that i was stupid because of how hard life was. my parents always said they thought i had ADHD but played it off like a quirky personality trait instead of a mental impairment that made life harder than it needed to be. and because of that, i was always told to just ""apply myself"" and to ""try harder""

&amp;#x200B;

i also grew up with people telling me that i ""was super ocd,"" again like it was some weird personality trait. since i didn't actually have OCD, i just thought that i was a freak. now my therapist is saying that she thinks i have OCD, which is giving me a potential explanation for a lot of things.

&amp;#x200B;

i know that diagnoses are good because they provide answers, but i spent so much time feeling like an outcast and being told that i was just weird. i just wish that mental illness werent labeled as personality traits and arbitrarily thrown around. if i had been diagnosed at a younger age i feel like i couldve spared myself from a lot of self hatred."
510,"My friend goes off on these random-ass. Incoherent tirades that I can’t follow, and I had to raise my voice because he has a terrible habit of interrupting me.","
Does he just like to hear himself talk? He always goes on about ‘Logic’ but weirdly enough he wasn’t making any fucking sense last time we hung out.

One time I brought up a flashlight I think
I used to have, and he started ranting about something in his life, I asked him how the fuck does he get bad vibes and angry from me bringing up a fucking flashlight."

513,"My thoughts on anxiety, fear, depression-this is how it truly feels like for me","   


It feels like you are trapped. Like You are being crumpled into a ball and thrown around a room. It feel like chains are holding you to a hot iron. You can’t escape. You try, but every time it fails. You feel alone. You feel like there is no one there and you tell yourself, “I want to go home.” More often than not you are telling yourself that at your home. But you want to go home, to serenity, to peace, and to be free from these chains. It feels like you climbing a ladder and before you can reach the top someone takes a knife and cuts off your fingers. You try to fight back every time, but you can’t. You just want to go “home”. You bleed, and while bleeding you hold yourself high, trying to stop yourself from breaking down and vomiting blood. You cry, you cry waterfalls. You want to get on with your day but you are scared something will kill you. You can’t move. You begin to scream-yet you don’t. Your mouth opens wide and you scream so loud only your mind hears it. You begin to realise you are losing a battle. That a dark force inside your brain is taking over you and your armies, your heart, you, are trying to fight back but it fights you and kicks you to the ground. You try to get up when you hit the ground but you can’t. You tell yourself you are going to be ok, something inside your head agrees yet the dark force sends another horde and defeats you. You begin to hang on threads, making steps and efforts to save yourself. You don’t know if you will live today or live tomorrow. You start to die inside. Your heart, once red and bright dims to pitch black. You begin to have tears, hot sizzling tears drip from your eyes. You take hours in the shower because you are horrified to get out. You try to fight the dark force but you cannot. For the dark force has chained you, and you can’t break free. Each day the force grows stronger sending another arrow, another bullet through your head. Your arms, your legs, your mouth dies. You feel dead. Yet you aren’t. You tell yourself, “is it worthwhile to live when I might die.” and you think you are losing a battle, and you can’t fight back. You want to surrender. You want this to end. But you don’t know how and you resort to thoughts so morbid they scare you. Just as you are about to take the weapon to put yourself to rest you think to yourself, “Why did I seek to end my suffering.” something inside of you screams no. You drop the weapon, your scream and cry but you are still standing. Have hope. You can fight through this."
514,I feel like my anxiety is getting worse,"I (14f) feel like my anxiety is getting worse. at school there’s this group of popular kids that are known for making fun of whoever, it could be their own friends or some random kid.but they’re in my math class and no matter what I feel like when ever they talk bad about a girl it’s me or when ever the teacher calls my name they’re thinking about how much they hate me and it makes me want to cry and I feel like I can’t breath when I hear them talking bad about another girl. Idk if I’m just over reacting but I’ve started telling myself everyday when I’m around them to keep my head down get out of there way and don’t speak. I just feel so scared all the time around them."
515,Lack of support from GP about seeing a neuropsychologist,"I've been wanting to get a proper test to see whether I have ADHD or ASD, as I have been diagnosed with both of these, but I feel like it would be a good plan to have a solid confirmation of them as I have been floating in limbo for the past ten years - not on any ADHD medication and no strategy to manage symptoms of either. What I know for certain is that I've struggled with numerous cognitive and psychological issues my whole life. Trouble paying attention, trouble maintaining interest in anything, trouble with motivation, getting fixated on activities or thoughts and forgetting things, right down to washing my hair while I'm in the shower. I go into suicidal depression over things like if a twelve year old on the street insults me. 

I'm just kind of frustrated by the lack of support from my doctor. She has been acting as my psychiatrist doing mental health check ups and supplying my medication - I'm on SSRIs currently. I brought up this topic with her once or twice before but she talked me out of it somehow. Or she told me to think about it and of course I forgot. I wish she had my back on this. I feel like I could be missing out on living on a more functional level. Time passes by and I have a ton of ideas and things I want to do, but I get distracted, I get tired, can't maintain interest or motivation to press on with my goals, and can't stay on track."

Any time I go to mental health they keep making me take either lithium or seroquel sometimes both, and the weight gain side effects are too bad for me to function because I have body dysmorphia.

I’m thinking I’m going to get fired but having seen the mental health system since I was seven they haven’t been helping much and I haven’t been able to keep my work or school attendance full time at any point in my life and I’m scared of what’s going to happen to my life if I can’t do that."

518,"Dissociative personality disorder - sufferers, how did you realise you had more than one personality?","I realised today that my alter has a name - he's Freddie. Yes I am a girl in 'real life'. Freddie is a depressive, whilst the real me is also depressive, but in a Robin Williams type way. I like to prance about and make fun,  but Freddie snaps me out, he doesnt recognise my children or husband, and has poisoned by life these last few months. He makes looking at my husband as if I give him affection, it makes me gay...

I'm currently off sick from work, struggling to keep Freddie at bay. I hear voices sometimes, see shadows, and Freddie wants to hurt strangers. He didnt have a name until I had a revelation when driving alone today. I'm waiting a mental health assessment but with COVID, they arent seeing anyone on the hurry up.

When did you realise you were more than one person?"
519,Does anyone else apologise for everything?,"I have this horrible habit of constantly apologising all the time , even if something isn’t my fault I will break down and cry and go into a deep depression and apologise over and over  . My friends constantly call me out on it because it gets to a point where I am practically begging for forgiveness when there is no need .

Like the other week , I was supposed to meet a friend but as the Covid laws got stricter we both decided it would be wise to rearrange . A few minutes after we cancelled a deep pit opened in my stomach and I felt sick with guilt and shame and anxiety. I began to sweat and cry and panic . My brain was going a hundred miles an hour “I’ve let her down , she doesn’t like me anymore , I’m such a horrible person , I don’t deserve her . I’m such a dick I’m gonna die alone because I abuse everyone who loves me “ . She told me so many times that she wasn’t mad and it was a decision that was best for both of us , but all I could say was “I’m so sorry is there anything I can do , let me buy you a McDonald’s, do you need anything “ . And there was literally no need for it , she said it was fine but I was petrified she was going to hate me . I do this with everyone I know .

Even small things like forgetting to call a friend and see if they are ok . I go into a deep depression because I’m terrified they are going to abandon me or shout at me or hurt me . By the end of the conversation I’m a jabbering wreck just saying “sorry , I’m so sorry , I really am sorry “ . Then I self harm about what a peice of scum I am and appreciate every soul who has ever had to spend any time with me because I don’t deserve them . If you are wondering I did have a very rocky upbringing (verbal and emotional abuse ) I often wonder if that contributed to me being a nervous wreck of an “adult “ .

Is this just me ?"

521,My anxiety is about to cost me another job.....,"I fucking hate that I always do this. I get a good job and then my anxiety causes me to question everything and all the people around me. I start to think they hate me and are constantly talking about me, and i always quit. I can't take it anymore. I can't keep a job because of my own problems so I can't make it any further in life. I just wanna die and get it over with. I'm so tired of struggling. 24 years and i have literally nothing to show for it. I'm starting to feel there's no point. I'll always be like this, so why am I even still trying."
522,Looking for some help coping with Mother’s mental Illness.,"TLDR at bottom

So my Mother has been diagnosed with OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder) multiple times by multiple medical professionals and has absolutely refused to even consider that she has a disorder. My little brother and I’s early childhood is filled with her screaming, name calling, and even being abusive over the most minor infraction of her rules. Her OCPD just scratches the surface when it comes to the well of personality disorders she suffers from, I think she may have some mild schizophrenia in there too. EVERY DAY my mother regales her friends and family members with stories of her direct conversations with God, Jesus, the Saints, and people who are dead/dying. I believe she suffers from body dysmorphia based on comments she has made about herself and her extremely low self esteem since I was a child. There has never been a period of my life where she wasn’t mad a my father for something. My parent’s marriage is in tatters over things that happened 30+ years ago. Mother WILL NOT let the hurt go. My father is worn down and has no empathy for her anymore. I can barely leave my room for fear of breaking down every time I see her. I am torn between being hurt from her words/actions and feeling bad for her because her disorders make her so unhappy. I honestly believe she will be miserable until her death and that breaks my heart. Part of me is just waiting for her to die because then she wont be sad anymore. I need help. 

TLDR: 
My mom suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Body Dysmorphia, and possibly mild schizophrenia (she talks to god and he talks back). I need help coping with all the pain she brings me while also being less co-dependent on her happiness while I am forced to live at home."
523,My new psychiatrist kinda sucks-advice plz,"So I’ve only met with this psychiatrist twice (via video chat), but I’m honestly kinda fed up already. She’s been late to both appointments with no heads up given (15 min late and she knows I’m doing these appointments during my workday so I only have an hour). She also doesn’t call prescriptions in until you pay the invoice for the appointment, but the thing is there was no invoice in my account/I got no notification about it the day of the appointment, so I didn’t get my meds. Now I have one pill left and have called the office twice, they’re saying they’re going to “remind” her again to call it in. For reference, the appointment was on Friday at 1 pm. I haven’t heard from her and have no direct line (she told me to call the front office so that’s the only contact I have)."
524,I need help on getting work done,"I'm a 23 y/o Engineering student who specializes in IT. Recently, I've been given a semester-long work that's supposed to be done by groups of three. The problem is, the other two members of my group haven't done nearly enough work and I've been forced to pick up the slack.

Several graded updates have gone by and I've been falling more and more behind. I've reached a point where I can't even look at the code without getting an anxiety attack and just breaking down.

I've talked to my teacher, but he hasn't helped, despite laying my situation out in full.

Please help. What do I do?"
525,My fiancé made me feel like an idiot,"So me(M30) and my fiancé(F29) was talking about my therapy session I had today. I brought up that I didn’t feel too excited about buying a new house (she is ecstatic about it and telling everyone, while I’m not feeling too much about it). 

Then she said that she had ADHD while my condition just made me just sad. 

Well, thanks. Now I’m spiraling downwards again thinking I’m not good enough, feeling even more foolish and worthless than ever before and hating myself for being such a sissy. 

Depression sucks...."
526,i don't know why i feel so bad,"I just feel stressed. i know i'm lazy about my homework but i still feel stressed out for not studying. i know my  girlfriend loves me but i am afraid of annoying her. my life is fine but there's something wrong.

527,"unresolved trauma, or just past memories?","im having trouble figuring out if some things in my past are trauma related or just things that have happened to me. 

i dont want to mention exactly what happened because im afraid i’ll trigger someone, so that’s probably an indicator that this isnt something normal people go through.

it doesnt keep me up though. it just confuses me. why did i go through that? why did i forget about that? did that affect me then? did that change me then? 

i just wish i knew what my triggers were. im trying to figure them out now but theres just so much i dont know. 

and obviously i also wish i knew what in my past is trauma. i guess thats the hardest part."
528,i can't think straight,i just keep going over what i think are delusions in my head. i keep thinking that my girlfriend is cheating on me even though i KNOW she isn't. of course i never asked her if she did but there's no indication that she has. i feel so depressed because i am failing one of my classes even though i NEVER study for it. i know i am 100% to blame for my problems but i can't seem to muster the strength to do anything about it. i can't think straight.

531,Ocd restricts me from fulfilling my purpose,"I never do this but I’m just looking for an answer or a solution.. 

I’m an artist; a musician and a writer and I’ve been haunted by mental issues my whole life. I know how to deal with them because I use them for the art and do it cathartically but my ocd which I struggle with the most doesn’t work this way.. It restricts me from my work, for example this novel I’m writing, normally lately I can only work on it for about half an hour a day which is very little but my ocd gets in the way, I start repeating the buttons while typing re-reading, re-typing the same thing pressing weird things going to wash my hands and my body is in agony. 

 because of this I start obsessing that I’m not doing enough and wasting my potential and at that point I can’t rest at all but I can’t work either  and I’m stuck and I have no idea what to do ?"
532,What can I do to stop being anxious,A week ago I watched a fucked up video and it’s been a week and I can’t get it out of my head. When it gets dark I just get worried and anxious that I may be killed or kidnapped and I don’t know what’s wrong with me can anyone help me feel normal? Please?
533,Is it normal to feel alone and lonely?,"However, there were a lot of people trying to be friends with me but I always find an excuse to push them away and feel very alienated again."
534,People say why kill yourself but I say why not,"Because there's absolutely nothing in life that brings me happiness besides smoking pot anymore. I'm trapped in fucking shit ass jobs and I also hate being told what to do, I'm 26 years old yet still somehow ugly as a horses ass so getting tail is out of the question, I only have one friend , my parents are getting old and once they die I've thought of killing myself anyway but I might just do it early, there's no love in my life, there's absolutely fucking nothing in my life and honestly I spend so much time being angry at people that hurt me and continue to hurt me that if I did what I want to do to them I'll just get locked up anyway. I'm running out of reasons to stay alive and starting to crave there being some sort of end to this stupid painful meaningless thing we call life. Tell me something good about my situation because I'm out of ideas"
535,"I can't sleep for the past 6 nights. I don't know why, I need to know where I can find help.","I don't know if this is the right place, you can direct me to a better one if you know of it. I (18F) suffer from insomnia. I can usually control it very well. I have even learnt to control it enough that I could take on a small job from 6-8:30 Am 3x per week.  It does require me to go to bed at 8 Pm, for me to be able to sleep at least 7 hours by falling asleep at 10:30 (yes, it does take me at least 2 and a half hours). 

However, there are some anxiety triggers which make me lose my rythm for a few weeks. last week I had a falling out with another employer. She was quite abusive, and got very aggressive, started screaming at me 30 cm from my face. I quit immediately and left. However for the next few days I was experiencing quite bad anxiety attacks and stress from it. After two days, my emotions normalized, so I thought that the lack of sleep was over.

 However, ever since that day I have not slept. Usually, my insomnia will cause me to have a very hard time falling asleep, but then my sleep is solid until 8 Am, when regardless of when I went to bed I will inevitably wake up.  This time, it is not just harder to fall asleep (last night it took me 6 hours!) But my sleep is very light. I wake up at every single sound, my parents turning in bed on the other side of the apartment (their bed is new and doesn't creak or even my dog sighing in her sleep). And I cant sleep past 5 Am. 

I get horrible migraines which make me unable to see for a few seconds. And my heart during the night is constantly racing. It never quits. I have been trying to go to bed at 8 in evenings like this, but I won't be asleep until 2 Am.
I have no idea what I should do about it or if I need advice.

TL;DR. I have been sleeping 3 hours a night for the past week and don't know why."
536,I'm done!,"I'm done trying, im over it all! I've been suffering with mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts for year. No one can help me, I've tried tones of medicines and I've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses and im weak and I can't do it, i can't end my life because as much as i hate life, i hate being perceived as selfish even more! But im done, so i decided today to fight for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) for the mentally ill . I'm fuckin done! I'm 31 years old and im tried of suffering, Im sick! And its about time the world takes mental illnesses serious, as seriously as they do physical illnesses.  i created a subreddit r/MAID4mentalillness, i created this subreddit because i dont know much about it, i stumbled upon it as i was searching for euthanasia. Please help me learn more about this, because im done and i deserve! YES DESERVE to die with dignity."
537,im planning suicide again,i want it to end as soon as possible
538,I feel like I SHOULD be cutting,"I am not currently seeing a therapist because of Covid and I don’t think anyone in my family actually knows how I’ve been feeling. I don’t think I’d ever actually kill myself. I don’t think I’m capable of it but, I have been thinking about it a lot recently. I’ve always self harmed in minor ways. When I was younger I’d pull out my hair, scratch my face, bite my hands etc. In recent years it’s mainly just scraping/picking at my skin. But recently I’ve thought about what it would be like to cut myself. Would people care enough to notice? would it help? I am well aware that this sounds dumb. I obviously know that I shouldn’t cut. Another part of my Brain is saying that I SHOULD be cutting because I’ve been this way for so long. That other people do it so are my mental health issues even that bad? If I do it does it prove how much I’m suffering? (makes no sense, I know) I’ve already noticed that  isolating myself from everyone but, I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t really know what to do anymore 


TLDR: I feel like I should start cutting because it would prove to myself how much I’m suffering."
539,Random feelings of severe butterflies in my stomach,This generally could just be me actually being physically sick but I’ll ask anyway. Every 20 minutes I get this feeling of butterflies in my stomach. Expect its way worse then any butter flies in my stomach I have ever had. It only lasts for 5 seconds before going away. It then happens again 20 minutes later. I currently don’t have anything that’s causing me stress so I don’t know what it is. Does anyone know at all as I can’t find an answer online and this is the only place I can think to ask.
540,Idk what’s wrong with me,"I think this has been occurring for a while but they were previously very mild but now recently I’ve been having this feeling  in my chest, I’m uncertain about this particular feeling but it feels very heavy similar to maybe sadness or fear? Like sometimes my heart would beat very hard and it makes me feel like I’m guilty or very sad. Is this depression? Also lately I’ve been very bored, like I get bored very easily and frequently very apathetic to things. I just want people’s opinion of what I might be experiencing, since I think I’m kind of depressed but I’m not sure and I don’t want to inadvertently misdiagnose myself And prolong an issue that could possibly be something else."
541,Not sure about my mental health,"Hi, I am 18 years old and I have pretty much been in a job since I left high school, some jobs didn't go as well as I hoped but all of them were good, no major complaints. I had a pretty bad breakup 2 years ago but I dont think this affects me any more. 

I was just wondering if anyone feels the same way or what to do about it. Recently I feel like I'm really tired (although I'm getting over 8 hours of sleep every night) and fed up with pretty much everything. I seriously lack motivation and dont feel like doing anything. I feel like quitting my job and just doing nothing. I cant seem to shake the feeling that everything is pointless and in the end nothing I do is really going to be worth anything. I like to believe that I am quite logical and maybe this is why I feel this way because realistically all of us will work a 9-5 until we retire and then spend the years until our passing doing nothing because we are not as physically able.

At the end of the day I dont feel like I am depressed but for about 2 years I just haven't really felt comfortably happy, of course there are odd things that create temporary happiness but in the long run I probably would say I'm not happy."
542,What is this a sign of?,"Okay so i’ve just been wondering this for a while now. I do some pretty weird things that i’ve learned are often signs of mental illnesses and disorders but i don’t know for sure. 

I do intend to ask my doctor or therapist about these things, but i find it hard to explain to them. Btw, i’m a teenager with anxiety and possibly depression, thought that might be important. 
Please answer if you might have an idea, it doesn’t matter if you only answer one or all. Any answer is needed :))

1. Repeating things
—————————————————
So the first thing i’m wondering about is that i constantly feel the need to repeat things. Not because i think others can’t hear me or anything like that. I often repeat it days later. But i always need to repeat it. Like, i’ll talk about my week plans and then i’ll have to list what to do over and over again throughout the day and talk about that several times. It may sound normal but it’s so hard to explain. I NEED to repeat it over and over in some form to be satisfied. 

2. Obsessing
—————————————————-
This may seem normal as well but i’m still a bit concerned. So i often come over something interesting, like a celebrity or a movie or something like that. The more i learn about it the more interested i get, obviously. But i’ll obsess over that thing for months. For example, right now i’m obsessing over the fact that i need to live my life in Greece. I’m also obsessing over a celeb. I search up pictures and posts about the thing im interested in and spend hours every day just thinking about it. It’s all i think about. And it connects to the repeating thing. I feel the need to mention and talk a LOT about these obsessions over and over even if i say the same thing again. Again, may seem normal but it consumes my life so much and it doesn’t feel healthy.

3. Daydreaming?
——————————————————
This i know is not very normal, at least i don’t think it is. Ever since i was little, i’ve had my own little world with my own characters that i visited when i went to bed. I’m a daydreamer, basically. As i got older, my dream worlds started to get more.. realistic? Not quite but i can’t find the word. Well anyways, i often base my daydreams on my new obsessions that i mentioned. For example (this is very embarrasing but oh well) i’m very infatuated with a celeb right now. I base my main daydream on me being married to that celebrity, or possibly just a good friend (i alternate) i often do this with other celebs or fictional characters as well but this is the main dream. So for these daydreams i listen to music while i look at photos of the person i’m daydreaming of to get ‘material’ for my dream. Then i act out videos and tiktoks and made up scenarioes as the character i’ve made myself to be in this world where i’m married to that celebrity. 
I’ll spend hours on this every single day. In fact, whenever i’m out with others in school or just hanging with friends or family, i think about which videos i’ll act out next. 

I’m very concerned about the last one. I’ve done it for years and it consumes much of my time. I would like to add that i would in no way pursue the actor in real life, and this is purely in my mind. It is quite therapeutic to me and i feel stressed or depressed if i don’t do it for a while. However, i know that it is not normal and i need to know what this is.

If you finished all of this, thank you so much. I hope this was understandable. I apologize for some of the terrible spelling, English is not my native language. Thank you if you answer!"
543,I think i need to talk to someone again please? Or someone to distract me or something?,"[15m]
Tw// mentioning self harm 

Hi. I kinda think i need to talk to someone again please. About literally anything. I just need a distraction. I feel like i want to end myself again. I’m just crying alot rn and want to od on my meds or something. I don’t like myself at all, i self harmed again last night after 1.5 years and all i feel is guilt and hate towards myself. I am just down. I don’t have any motivation anymore. Exams at school are this week. I’m fkn stressed af plus with ADHD and my depressed self i just can’t take much more. It’s hard as f*ck. i just want everything to end. 
I’m sorry."
544,"I'm normally the one giving the advice, I don't know how to take it now I'm in a dark place.","Over the last three years I have been through hell suffering with aniexty, panic attacks and just overall trapping my self in my own mind. I've always been good with helping people out even if it's just lending an ear. This is the second time that it has been bad enough for me that people around me notice I'm not my normal self. I felt like that was behind me and I had conquered  it but this time seems worse and i know I won't be able to fight this time alone. I just have a hard time accepting the help even from the closest people in my life."
545,I’m worried about doing something- I don’t want to but I’m so scared,I’ve written notes in case something happens. I have absolutely no plan and I don’t want to go but I’m scared for what’s to come. I’ve spiralled and feel worried. I have some ptsd coming up and the fear of reliving it is causing a lot of fear. I feel like everything I’ve done is my fault and I’ve had enough pain to present opportunities to change and I never have.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me and how to ever feel part of this world and to feel loved like I am. Cos trust me. I am loved by many and know my impact would sadden so many. This is so hard.
546,Really need to rant/possible advice,"I feel so disconnected from the world. 
I feel lost.
I feel suck in the same place. 
I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm falling apart. 
I have no idea who I am anymore. 


My partner left me and I feel so empty. We were together for so long and I just know they are the person I'm suppose to be with but i ruined it. The love I have for this person is so strong and we have built so much of a life together as it is. I want to marry him, I want to have kids with him, I want to own more animals, have our own land, support each other, grow together, love each other unconditionally. 

I've ruined it all because I refused to help myself for years and never follow through with healing. I have bpd and I've let trauma affect my relationship and picked up on so many toxic tendencies and pushed my partner away. I hurt them so bad and I hurt myself. I have become a toxic person and hate myself so much for not seeing how bad I have gotten.  

I want to be better and get better and try again so badly. I've ruined the only good thing in my life and I didn't even see how bad it was until it was over. 
I don't know who I am. I need him. 

I keep apologizing but i keep fucking up and I don't know how to collect myself to be ""normal"" and just get better. 


This doesn't seem real and it feels like I'll wake up and he will be there but I know I need to fucking try and help myself before that is even a possibility.

I don't know how I can get over this and forgive myself. 
I want to get better so bad but it is so hard. 
I have no support and don't know how to start. 

I feel so broken. I am very on edge and feel a little ***TW*** suicidal but if I want any chance of a better life I NEED to keep going. 

I just feel stuck and don't know how to find the strength to better but want to so freaking bad it's killing me. The biggest issue is I don't feel real and I don't remember the last time I truly did. I have this thing in the back of my head saying ""it's not real, everything will work out just fine"" but I KNOW that's not true but I can't fully explain it. 

I'm sorry if this was long or all over the place, I just have no one and feel so lost in my own head and need help so bad."

548,Realization,"Hi it’s me a 22 year old college senior and I need some advice probably from someone older. I have never had problems making friends, but I do struggle with relating to certain types of girls that feed off of social climbing. I joined Greek life hoping to meet girls that wanted to make friends but now I’ve realized I’ve just coexisted with these girls for four years now and they couldn’t give two shits about if I’m breathing or not. I’ve caught them talking about me several times and they all kind of clique up into smaller groups which I never really fit into. I have never had thoughts of suicide in a way that I actually could go thru with it, but I dream about killing myself a lot lately. I have just come to the realization that I have absolutely zero friends and the only “friends” (aka my roommates) I did have I lost because one of the girls in the inner group was talking about a bunch of girls and I called her out and said that it was inappropriate to be talking about people all the time and she basically said no one likes or trusts me and then spread a bunch of lies about me to all of my roommates so they think I’m crazy. Anyways I know it seems like all dumb girl drama but I need advice on how to move past it and not feel like a waste of oxygen every time I walk into my house full of all the girls who hate me. I’m graduating in May but I don’t have a job yet so I don’t know what the hell im gonna do and I just need a little hope rn."
549,Having trouble moving on from a past job.,"A few months back I was put into a forced resignation situation at my old job. It was from a small mistake that I made, but after seeking legal advice, I found out that it was something that could have been avoidable and was unlikely a good enough reason for a forced resignation. When I had found out about my mistake, I instantly made an effort to try and fix it but at the end of the day, I felt like I was being treated as a disposable employee since the employer made no effort. I was instructed not to contact the other person involved. 

The industry I am in has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19. There are next to no jobs available, which is making it next to impossible to find new work in my industry. The friends I had at this old job, have completely shut me out and no longer talk to me. Its been very tough for me to move on, and knowing that I won’t be able to do what I love for a while is making me hurt. 

On top of that, I have a tremendous fear of a lack of future job prospects due to the fact that this will come  in interviews in the future. I do not defend the mistake that I made, but I worry that future employer’s will simply look at what happened and not consider all the details and the fact that the relationship did not need to end the way it did. 

I won’t be seeking legal action against the company for various reasons that I will not go into. 

The combination of the treatment I got from my old employer, on top of the a stress about the future is really upsetting. I’m not really sure how to describe the true feelings that are going on inside of me. But it feels like I want to cry, but cannot. It feels like I really want to move on, but I’m having trouble."
550,Help? Anxiety induced procrastination?,"I have anxiety, mainly social but it frequently bounces around. Most of it comes from school and now as a college student there is much more work to get done, especially since classes are now online. I almost feel as if I stress so hard about getting it done before the deadline that I begin to procrastinate? I can’t focus while reading, it takes me 3-4 hours to read something that I should be able to read In an hour. This takes a huge toll on me because I have to spend much more time “doing” my schoolwork when in reality I’m procrastinating and getting very little done in increments, because of this I spend almost all my time on “schoolwork”, it just feels like a never ending cycle of “Get work done by Saturday, on Sunday do it all over again.” If anybody has some tips that would be greatly appreciated!"
551,Potential OCD,"Hey. Looking for anyone who knows what they are talking about. I have dermatophagia (biting skin around nails until bleeding) along with **many** other compulsions caused by intrusive thoughts. I would like to get diagnosed to help some of these issues, especially because of the constant pain of the dermatophagia. I'm 15 and want to know who I should ask for a diagnosis. Also, is the medication safe? I don't really trust myself with some things anymore, such as holding knives or driving a golf cart, because of the intrusive thoughts. I especially want some help considering I'll be getting my license next year. Thanks for any replies.

552,Just struggling,"My dad had been an alcoholic for years never angry or violent but he used drink to keep his own mental health issues at bay and he increased his drinking so much over lockdown and went into hospital because it made him so ill and he decided he wasn't going to drink anymore and the entire family was so happy and we were preparing everything for him to come back home out of hospital as he was getting better but he passed away the day before he was meant to come home

I feel like I don't even have a chance to mourn because my younger brother, sister and mother are coping/dealing with it worse than I am and even though I've said my good byes to dad at the funeral I still believe he'll come home from the hospital even though I know he's gone and I just want to get away from my family but I'm too worried to sort myself out in the best way for me mentally because of what will happen with them when I'm gone"

It just feels like a huge block of rock over my head. I am not able to get better/ good in anything. I don't know what to do. I have been trying to get back but everything just seems crazy hard and needs so much effort without any great reward.

When I think about something traumatic or when I listen to a sad song I shake my head or make a silly face. I might grind my teeth or tell myself to block out any negative feelings in my head. I usually make a fearful face and shake my head for a minute.

Does anyone else do this?"
557,"I am very insecure about my looks, specially my nose and it affects my social/dating life?","Hi reddit peeps, I wasn’t quite sure what community fits my issue so please direct me to a more suitable one if you know any.

I am an almost 30 year old woman and have unfortunately always been quite insecure about my looks. I am not superficial about other people but I am superficial when it comes to my own looks and can be quite hard on myself. 
I hear compliments that Im quite attractive/pretty. However to me, i feel good enough at least when someone is facing me, I am tall, thin, I have long black hair and defined eyes/eyebrows but my nose UGH just takes away all of that. When you look at my side, I have a longer than usual pointy nose,not like the wicked witch of the west (I hope)but its quite prominently pointy and to make matters worse, I have small dark freckles on the tip of it. 

I pushed myself to be a model for a couple of years to improve my self confidence but I wasn’t casted a lot, probably because of my un-petite nose and I was even told by a makeup artist that my nose is “difficult” to work with. Ever since I was young, I’ve felt super insecure to the point that I would avoid large crowds or social clubs because I didn’t want people noticing it. Until now I can have some nice clothes on and have my hair and makeup done nicely and then I look at my side and feel disgusted and like I want to hide it from people. I constantly put my hand over it if some people are walking past me. I was really insecure with my ex boyfriend because I thought he’d want to be with someone who looked like today’s bloggers and whatever you call them with their perfect petite noses. I really want to have a nose job but I can’t afford it and never could plus Im also scared because I know these things can go wrong and I also have a mental phobia where I have panic attacks when I feel like I can’t breathe. 

I’m trying to love myself just as I am even with a shitty nose and all. Any advice on how I can stop obsessing about this silliness and just embrace my beak for once and for all?"
558,Hate myself,"Why am i like this?

I shared everything with this guy what i couldnt with anyone else, he used it against me. Making fun of me or callin it fake and that im living with my mind in an fairytale. But i do suffer from anxiety and more, suicidal thoughts all the way. He said horrible things to me, said so many things what made these feelings of me worser. But i’d still fight for him and choose him. I know i shouldnt and i know that its my fault to get hurt again and again and again, but i cant be without him, even if he doesnt want me as a partner i want him to be my friend forever. I know a lot about him and he about me. Was it wrong of me to trust someone so much that i shared too much, couldnt he handle it? He says im psycho and stuff, which im not im just broken and damaged, trying to survive. He doesnt go thru it so ofc he doesnt understand me. But am i that stupid that i still care and got love for this person? Knowing that im crying for 2 days straight in bed, didnt even move, my eyes and face swollen of the tears for somebody who doesnt even give a f about me or my mental health. He went thru some things, i always listened and cared and NEVER judged. I know everything, but my heart wont let me my mind wont let me. I know for some reason how bad things turning around, or how dirty he does to me. I’d always care about him or tryna help him. Im not weak, but when its about him i loose my mind. I have a weird connection with him, cant be without him or be with him. Its not fair, having the right person but the wrong timing. 

Am i gonna survive this? All the things he said the last past hours really made me upset and broke me even worser. I feel so insecure, i feel like i dont deserve anything. It also made me feel that i never want to be on social media or stuff or even anybody else to love."
559,"Our mind is home to three distinct voices: • the parent • the child • and the adult. When you're caught between the impulsive child and the punishing parent, here's how to find that reasonable adult within.","Lately, I have been spending lots of time on Twitter, following many fine minds as they think out loud and share fantastic ideas. Being relatively new there, I feel like a kid in a candy store. So much *idea-candy.*

An hour passes, and I have since forgotten why I even logged in in the first place. Why?

Let’s track back for a second.

You’ve probably heard of this idea before.

&gt;Our minds are home to three distinct voices:  
the **parent**  
the **child**  
and the **adult**.

The concept comes from *Transactional Analysis*, a theory in psychotherapy that helps identify recurring patterns in human behaviour.

So what do the **parent**, **child**, and **adult** voices say, and why does that matter? 

Here’s a simplified explanation:

    The child wants, and it gets.

It’s driven by curiosity and desire. If it doesn’t get, it complains. It might even break stuff. It doesn’t know self-control.

    The parent reprimands and punishes.

It’s self-righteous, and can be condemning. It’s got high expectations.  
*“You always do this…”*  
*“You never listen…”*  
*“How could you be so \_\_\_\_?”*

You get the idea. It tends to demand too much self control.

    The adult voice is balanced and reasonable. It understands.

It’s how we might comfort a friend after they’ve made a mistake.   
*“It’s okay, sh\*t happens. Don’t beat yourself up.”*

The adult gets it. It doesn’t judge.

#### All three voices work within us at different times, and triggered by situations.

Personal examples:

**The child.**  
It doesn’t matter how many unread books sit in my Kindle library, the moment I see a big price drop in my wishlist, I’m *so* tempted to buy it.

They call it a ‘felt concept.’ Meaning, the child is really innocent - it just follows the feeling. Whenever I feel upset because I don’t get something I really want, it’s often the child in me.

**The parent.**   
Well, I am a parent, and I hate to admit this - my expectations can get the better of me, and frequently do. I almost instantly regret it but it’s like a pre-set reaction.

The parent voice is a ‘taught concept.’ Sadly, many of us were taught this way as kids, and it may take years or decades to unlearn.

**The adult.**  
Being reasonable is a learned concept. Isn’t that encouraging?

For me, during an upset, sometimes it just takes a few deep breaths and thinking out loud. By expressing the problem clearly, I find myself looking for a solution in a more reasonable way.

&amp;#x200B;

We can learn to rely on the inner adult voice by invoking it when the other two are out of control.

This is the part I want to emphasize on.

Let’s say, you find yourself standing before the open fridge and thinking,  
*I don’t remember why I opened the door, but now that I’m here, I’ll eat something.*

That’s probably the inner child who’s often ‘hungry.’   
Instead, put a little sticky note in the fridge that says: **“Adults only.”**  


Suppose you’re spending too much time on social media.   
You don’t realize when getting sucked in but at some point you’re going to notice it.

That’s the time to say:  
***“*****The adult in me is here now.**   
**What would I rather be doing at this moment?”**

The adult within will gently point the way. No blaming, angry parent needed.

### Invoking the adult doesn’t take effort.

It’s not about self-control or resisting anything. It’s just about becoming aware.

When we sit down to eat, when we unconsciously grab the phone, when we enter the candy-store (or the amazon wishlist), it just takes becoming aware.

We say hello to the inner adult and we become conscious of how the inner child wants to take over.

Becoming aware gets easier as we ask for the adult’s help more and more.

The more we do, we realize how much of our behaviour is just a set of unconscious programs triggered by situations.

By becoming conscious we find it easier to get off the willpower-and-subsequent-guilt cycle. The power of consciousness starts to take care of it effortlessly. Try it today.

560,How do people deal with the fact that one day all their loved ones will die?,"I can accept the fact that one day I’m going to die.  I’m agnostic myself and not really a big believer in the afterlife, but I’ve never died so who knows? Even if there isn’t I can accept it because I’ll still be part of the universe or whatever even in death even if I’m not aware, it’s just a change. But when I think of the idea of how my family or a potential significant other will one day die (god forbid before me) it just sends my stomach into a twist. I’m disturbed by the fact that there will be a last time I hug someone dear to me forever. The idea that they just won’t exist as them anymore is horrible."
561,Strange sensation.,"I randomly experience this powerful feeling where suddenly everything feels unreal. I look at my hands and it's as if they aren't my own. I perform an action, such as walking, and it doesn't feel like I'm the one walking. It doesn't even feel like I have control over my own thoughts when this happens. I start thinking absurd things like ""Am I real? Is anything real?"" But now I'm wondering if those thoughts really are absurd. It used to happen maybe once a week, but now the feeling arises multiple times a day. I feel like I'm losing my grip on what the hell reality even is. What should I do?"
562,Question about occasional auditory hallucinations,"To preface this, I'm a 26y guy, I know I suffer from at the very least anxiety and depression, but unfortunately have been unable to be properly seen and honestly don't know when I'll be able to get seen (covid, no job, no insurance, etc)

I started experiencing occasional auditory hallucinations maybe a year ago? When I had a very extreme case of insomnia that caused me to stay awake for three days, when I fell asleep I heard a woman whispering and what sounded like metal scrapping against metal. 

Since then every few weeks I've heard some sort of auditory hallucination, usually it's a sound rather than voices, such as metal or glass crashing, or some sort of mechanical/machinery type noise. The only time I can think of that I heard voices (beyond the first) was me coming back from grocery shopping later in the evening, upon reaching my door I could hear what sounded like a conversation between two people, I couldn't understand what they were saying but somehow I knew they were talking about me. It was so clear and loud that I thought for sure I'd left the TV on but I hadn't, and my mother who was with me at the time told me she didn't hear anything.

I understand no one here could diagnose me - I'm just wondering if this is something that is normal? Can anxiety/depression cause this?"
563,I am always sick,"Hello, I’m a 17 year old female who struggles with many different disorders. I’m not quite sure what is going on with my body and it’s gotten to the point where I’m so used to the feeling of being sick, I don’t even worry about what’s going on.

I’m not sick as in, I get colds or other illnesses spreading around. I’m sick in general. I feel like I know why, but at the same time I don’t know how to help it.

I apologize if this is hard to read or jumbled, I have DPDR so I can’t really comprehend what I’m typing to the best of my ability at the moment. 

I don’t eat much, maybe one meal a day at that. It started months ago because I struggle with reflux (I have medication) so I often can’t swallow food without throwing it right back up. I already have to take around seven pills in the morning so I try not to cause my reflux much more reaction, as I don’t want to throw up the pills.

I’m healthy, healthy weight, healthy skin, everything is normal. I do have low blood pressure but it isn’t too bad, it just means I have to stay hydrated. But I have a problem with that, ever since I was a kid I really only get through half a water bottle a day. It’s been an ongoing issue and I have reminders on my phone to remind me to drink, but it seems like no matter how much I drink I’m still as sick as I was before.

I can’t stand for long or I start to see black spots and my head becomes wobbly. The world already looks so off from my derealization that the effects I’m getting from standing don’t change much, but they add another layer of difficulty. I can’t drive anymore nor leave my house, I’m falling behind in class and I can’t shower unless it’s cold and I have a chair to sit down in.

I’ve had leg issues for years, did physical therapy because they told me that my muscles were abnormally weak. They still are weak and feel strained, so it didn’t help much at all. I have balance issues because of this so I can’t balance on my feet well, often wavering, limping, or tripping as I walk.

I have horrible tremors in my whole body, my hands especially that it looks like I’m absolutely freezing my ass off by how much I shake. Though all test results come back negative and say I’m perfectly healthy.

Doctors like to say that anxiety is my issue, but I’ve had GAD since I was seven and I find it hard to believe that my anxiety is making me faint constantly when I’m not in the least a bit anxious, I’m more frustrated if I’m being honest.

I’m really struggling, nothing hurts (except my legs that ache) but I’m always in a state where I need to sleep so I don’t throw up or faint. I try to eat what I can but it just comes right back up. I never had an eating disorder either, so I have no idea what’s going on. 

This has been going on for around 2 years now. My derealization started around 2 years ago as well but I don’t know.

I just need opinions and thoughts, I want to get better because honestly I’m so worn out I can’t get anything in school done nor can I even do basic tasks."
564,nightmairs,so i recently started taking antidepressants so i’m doing better now but i still have nightmares of my previous step dad coming back into my life and they’ve been increasing lately. i think maybe because the three year anniversary of when i had him arrested is coming up. is this a sign of something? i spent ten years being tormented by this walking pile of trash and sometimes i forget he’s not around and freak out inside if i leave the fridge open to long or i’m a little late to feeding the dogs or whatever. he’s gone physically but he still lingers and i can’t wait for him to die so i can be at peace.
565,"DAE feel like despite how motivated you may be, that your life is just a wait and see because you never really know when your illness will creep in and wreak havoc?",Feel like im walking on eggshells
566,Feeling numb,"I've (19) been feeling either sad or numb for a while now and I have noone to talk to or feel like noone listens to me.
It's getting hard to get my obligations done like studying or doing my chores. I have a hard time responding to messages and I started to lose people's that I'm (or as it seems was) close to and I have no idea what to do or how to explain it to them as I don't know what's wrong with me.
I have noticed a change in my eating habits too, I eat less like once rarely twice a day and lot eat sweets when I'm alone and noone sees it, but I know that I should be losing weight I just can't stop. 
I kinda wish I could cry but can't.

I tried to talk to my mother about it a while ago and she said that it's only in my head and I should get over it. 
Don't know what to think about it or what to do."
567,Confused,"I suffer from many mental illness and I’m not on medication for any of it ,yet soon I will be anyways, I have this thing where I like to harm myself not because I wanna die but because I like the feeling it gives me and I know I don’t and shouldn’t do it but yet I continue to. I’m not sure how to stop or what exactly I should do about it or if it’s even that bad of a thing to do to your self, I’ve always done it in some way if it’s burning my skin or playing with blades n at first it wasn’t even that bad but it keeps escalating to worst marks that stay longer n that’ll scare badly 
I really don’t know why I’m talking about it i guess to see if anyone does similar things or something or just to be and feel open to actually talk about it I’m just confused on it all my brain pushes me to do it n I fight it but then I’ll give In and do it I can’t control it n most of the time I hate what I did or I enjoy it cuz I pushed myself to feel more and that I’m happy cuz I wasn’t weak I could handle it"
568,I’m living a lie,"Hi, everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I apologize in advance if this is too long or boring to read. I just need to talk, even if nobody responds.

I’m a 16 year old boy in the USA and my mental health has been all over the place for years. I have such a comfortable life— supportive family, some nice friends, an easy middle class lifestyle, a safe town, and enough wits and strength to carry me through life. Everything should be going well for me, but it simply isn’t. I’ve been depressed since I was in sixth grade, and I’ve been tumbling in and out of suicidal ideation ever since. I simply can’t explain how it all started.

I only ever told two people that anything was wrong. The first person I told was this girl in middle school who I really shouldn’t have talked to in the first place. I was an idiot looking for someone who wanted to talk to me, and she sure did want to talk to me. In fact, she was a bit of a stalker. I didn’t even care. I let her get close to me. I would tell her how nothing in my life could make me happy for long, how I wanted to die. She used that weakness to manipulate me, making me do all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to do.

I experimented with self harm. For the next 3 years after that, I would semi-regularly cut my arms. Then I met the second person I told about how I felt— a girl who I became friends with in ninth grade. She had problems much like mine, but was much more chaotic and likely to get hurt. All of that weighed down on me so much, until eventually she became like the first girl and it all went downhill from there.

Nowadays I have friends, but none of them get it. I can’t bring myself to say anything to anyone— not my friends, not my family. I always keep up a façade of being happy and energetic, of being extroverted and motivated, but I really never want to do anything at all. My family is proud of who they think I am, but they don’t know who I really am. That’s why I’m living a lie. I’m so afraid of either being manipulated or being exposed for who I really am that I just wanted to vent to the internet. 

What puzzles me the most is exactly how I feel. I’m really bad at staying in touch with my emotions, and I am afraid of showing anyone how I truly feel at any time. There’s so much I can do, but I never want to do any of it. I just spend my time forcing myself to get out of bed and pretend. I’m not really a danger to myself, it’s just dumb and it just feels good to say.

So, yeah. That’s kind of it. I’m not really expecting anything in particular to happen by posting this, but if you read this thanks for listening. Sorry that this lacks actual structure, I’m just writing this in one go."
569,Are these symptoms of an ADHD episode?,"I saw a video once of someone having what the video called an ""ADHD episode"". The symptoms in the video happen to me frequently and I thought they were totally normal. Here's a list of symptoms I've compiled on my phone mid ""episode""

(1) its difficult to focus

(2) difficult to follow a train of thought

(3) difficulty think of the word you're thinking of

(4) its uncomfortable if im not moving, tapping, scratching, or chewing something

(5) zoning out for minutes at a time

(6) losing train of thought seconds after having it

(7) stopping mid sentence because I couldn't say the word I was thinking and forgot what I was saying

(8) uncomfortable urges to move or shake my hands

(9) difficulty reading, feels like my eyes are heavy, almost makes me sick

(10) can't make decisions or plan ahead at all, or its very difficult to

(11) can't remember the time or day

(12) over obsessing over a thought to the point of being depressed in a lot of cases

I cant think of all of them at the moment. They are very noticeable to other people, it feels like im not present but I am at the same time.

I cannot find anything on Google about ""ADHD episodes"". Just symptoms that I've got but they never touch on the other ones im experiencing.

Its really frustrating me and affecting my relationships/work. Could someone give me a clue as to what this is im dealing with?"

572,Just wanna rant,"I really struggle with my mental health with my appearance and how anxious I am, I just think I’m such a sensitive crybaby and I have an extremely negative mindset and always think of such bad things when I try my hardest to be positive and my own actions always seem to be the downfall of realationships and friendships and I don’t know what to do anymore how can I be more positive and mentally strong and happy and not think everyone is out to get me or mean things in a negative way all the time"
573,Anxious over the smallest things,"If anyone has a clue on what I may have, please do chime in. 

&amp;nbsp;


I've gotten yelled at as a child before for leaving the sink on a little bit (did not shut it off all the way) and ever since that day, I became very anxious on whether or not I did everything correctly. For example, even as an adult now, every time I use the washroom, I press down on the faucet handle hard to make sure it is 100% closed. I will then walk to my room and lay in bed to get ready to sleep. The thought of whether I really turned off the sink completely or not crosses my mind and I will feel uncomfortable even though I know I shut it off completely. Since the thought lingers in my head, I will feel very uncomfortable and will not be able to sleep until I go back and check AGAIN even though I know I turned it off!

&amp;nbsp;



I do this with almost everything, not just the sink. Am I experiencing childhood trauma from being yelled at for the sink incident? The same happens with the garage door and the stove. Once I leave the house and drive to where I'm going and ask myself if I really did turn the stove off or not, I will drop what I am doing and drive all the way back home, even if it's 5 miles away, and check if I turned it off even though I know I did!

&amp;nbsp;

576,Today is the first day I didn't feel like killing myself,"After a live filled with trauma, where the only options were to overcome or quit I finally managed to get out. And not just that, I had friends, a house, purpouse. Then I decided to risk it all, to do something I truly gave a shit about. Ended up joining the military where I fit right in, my buddies where awesome, I was good at my job. So imagine my surprise when a training accident forced me out of my unit, having to live with 50-70% of my mental capacity for over 6 months, totally lost myself. Still I kept doing my job, until I just couldn't go on anymore and talked with someone, I got the help I needed and now after months of therapy and medication, I finally got that hint of what it feels like to know that life is worth living. I don't really know why I'm typing this out, but if there's someone reading this that feels like shit just know that it's possible not to feel like shit all the time...."

578,I believe I won’t live for long,"I am a 20 year old law student in Germany (F), and I think I might commit suicide very soon. 
So many things are happening to me right now, I can’t take it anymore. 
A war in my home country, because of which my best friend died. Some others as well. Another friend badly injured. Some family members.
On top of that, the person I loved more than myself or anything in this whole entire world broke up with me exactly a week before the war started. Just because he fell out of love with me, because I am too much. 
I have helicopter parents, that do not allow me to breathe without their control. I live in a 2 room apartment, both of them have cameras, so that they can just see what, when and why am I doing something whenever they please. We have a horrible relationship. I love them to pieces, but I can’t take it. When I cry, they get angry from it. Physical, verbal and mental abuse was a part of my life always. 
Coronavirus was the smallest problem of the bunch, but still, I haven’t seen a friend or in fact anything except for my home and a shop for 3 months already. 
My depression is going so deep, I am desperate, I can’t take it, i can’t do it anymore.
Today I was walking outside, in the night, under the rain, drunk and high. There was no one outside whatsoever. There is a train railway right next to my place, under a bridge. I was seriously considering to jump under the train, for 30 minutes I was standing there, debating if I should die or not. Somehow made myself go away and back home. 
I don’t know what to do.
I live in a small town. There are not many psychologists or therapists I can find there, that are good. They are always so busy, that the first day they can take me in is in like January. 
I need help, I don’t know what to do. 
I am so lost."
579,How do you get out of a bad mindset?,"I’ve been a rather pessimistic person, to the point that I don’t believe I’m worthy of affection or love. I have a bad habit of putting myself down or saying I can’t do something at first sign of time or ability constraint that makes me feel like I can’t do something that is difficult. 

Things are starting to be more strained for me after I lost my cool when I was talking to someone I’m seeing (not necessarily dating). After that (something like this happened before), I told her that if I ever become abusive or a “bad person” to just forget about me. I didn’t think about how saying that would have hurt her, especially after how close we became. It feels like our relationship strained to the point that I don’t know how things will be between us after. We tried to talk it out, to some success but the relationship between us is still in question. The only thing I really left that brief conversation with for the short-term is that I gotta fix myself, especially my mindset.

I’ve been in the process of getting a reference for a psychiatrist, which has gotten complicated after the first psych office was closed down and currently in the process of finding another one. Came to the conclusion that therapy is necessary and that I’m still struggling with depression. Though, I probably need to change my mindset if I’m really going to get out of this rut. 

TL;DR - How does one start getting out of a pessimistic mindset and stop beating themselves up over failure?"

582,Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M24 almost 25) had problems caused by my mental health,"Because of government rules and stress I stopped going to my therapist (technically I should go when I feel the worst so I can fix the issue but I'm dumb) so my mental health got super bad, and it hit hard my relationship with my boyfriend. I've caused him a lot of stress and I love him so I don't want that to happen anymore. But it happened again and again. Today it was caused by my fear of abandonment and the fact that it happened so many times already caused even worse anxiety. I'm scared he stopped loving me because of this or that he's just so tired of me that he won't talk to me anymore. I don't wanna leave him but at the same time I don't want him to suffer because of me. And I can't stop feeling so bad. I have physical pain (it's about a month now and the doctor already told me it's the cold and the humidity) but I still have anxiety about dying alone from some rare complication. The fact that I'm hurt both physically and mentally and emotionally is so difficult to handle, and I feel alone, especially after having this issue with my boyfriend (he tried to be supportive about my mental state in the past -even tho he doesn't quite understand not controlling your brain-  but it caused so many problems between us that I feel he's over it)

Thank you for giving me a place to vent, I really appreciate it"
583,How to support a friend while incredibly busy and dealing with my own issues?,"I (21M) recently became a lot closer with an old friend of mine (21M), which is appreciated, but also, now it seems I am his only support structure/the only person he shares his feelings with. To be fair, the reverse is also true.

Dude has a lot of issues that I won't get into here but they bother him constantly. He also only works part time and I'm a full time student taking 17 credit hours with two part-time jobs and trying to manage grad school applications somewhere in there. He wants to hang out pretty much constantly which I would be okay with, but I'm super busy. I already spend pretty much all of my free time with him and feel a bit like I'm neglecting my other friendships. Also as the December 1st deadline for grad school comes up, I have much less time than normal as I scramble to finish up all of my applications. I told him as much and he seems pretty understanding.

But, again, I'm pretty much his entire support structure, so I get constant updates about his mental health. I really want to be able to drop everything and help him when he needs it, but it's getting to the point that I'm just very overwhelmed and I'm butting up against some hard deadlines that I can't miss and I really don't have time for it. I do feel like such a shitty friend though.

Again, he is most of my support structure too, but I'm a bit more stoic than him. My issues are mainly depression and suicidal ideation, his are more along the lines of PTSD. I noticed that he tends to stress over my issues as well so I've ""gotten better"" on that front in hopes of reducing the stress on him so he won't have to rely on me as much, but it doesn't seem to be working that well.

I'm frantically trying to cram for an exam tomorrow morning and he's having a mental breakdown. I'm not doing very well in this class (calculus) and I need it to graduate next semester so I really need to do well on this exam. Every fiber of my being just wants to grab my gun and end the whole ordeal right now but 1) he would be in a real fucked place without me, 2) it would really fuck him up if I died and 3) it would really, really fuck him up if I killed myself, so I suppose that's off the table. I just feel trapped right now.

He asked me if he should stop telling me what's up with his mental health right now since I'm really busy and I'm not sure what to tell him. It feels shitty to say ""well, school is a bigger priority right now so yep, I'm going to need you to keep your issues to yourself."" But I'm also just not entirely sure I'm capable of supporting him right now.

I also can't deal with his current way of ""not bothering me about his issues"" which mainly involves texting me about how he's hungover since I wasn't available to talk last night so he got drunk. This is especially stressful for me because my now-ex girlfriend did the same thing to me before I broke up with her, except with self-harm instead of drinking.

I feel like I don't have enough time for the whole interpersonal relationships thing. I do want to support my friend but I'm running out of steam and I just feel nauseous all the time. Any advice on what to do or what to tell him on the whole issue of ""whether or not he should bother me about his issues"" would be greatly appreciated."
584,Coffee increasing anxiety????,"Does anyone else get extremely anxious when they drink coffee? I have anxiety, but for some reason, when I drink coffee it makes me anxious and my heart beats quicker."
585,roommate made ignorant comment,one of my roommates made a comment about me today while laughing saying that I “spend my life in my room”. this really rubbed me the wrong way as I struggle with really bad depression and I am going through a lot of things in my personal life at the moment that have been very difficult to handle along with school. she knows this but still decided to comment anyways. I already am hyper aware of my actions and this just seemed like an insensitive thing to say. am I getting too offended?
586,I really can’t do this anymore. I’m sorry for everything.,"Tw// alot of things. 

15m. It’s me again. I know i post on here alot. I will hopefully not post as much. I’ll try to stop.

I feel really depressed. Like all of the time. 
I hide everything from everyone. 
I have multiple mental illnesses that effect me massively and my social life. 
I don’t have the motivation to do anything anymore. I literally get told to kill myself. I self harmed last night after all of that time. I did again tonight. I’m a bad person. I’m a burden to everyone. 
I have been crying for about 2 hours now but it feels like a lifetime and i’m still crying. 
If i do go, i would probably try to OD or Jump. 

All i feel is guilt about myself. Hatred. I fkn hate myself. 
According to my doctor, i am showing signs of autism and BPD. I already have ADHD which is really similar to autism, depression and severe anxiety.

My father. He is out of my life now and has been for about 4 years. He was a narcissist. He used to get into my head and tell me things that made me think bad about other people and stuff. He mentally and physically abused me. He has completely destroyed me mentally and i kinda have flashbacks of it and i get really scared if someone looks like they are going to hit me. I’m scared to answer a yes or no question because of him. If i said an answer he didn’t like, he would hit me. 
One time, i didn’t eat and he literally dragged me upstairs by the collar on my shirt and threw me onto my bed and he acted like nothing had happened. 
I did / do have a social worker but i don’t see her much now. 
He made me not be able to speak out.
(I shouldn’t really have mentioned the stuff about my father.) 

I am scared of almost anything and scared mostly of my friends leaving me. My mother is awsome and i couldn’t ask for more but i just don’t have the courage to speak up to her. 
I can’t even call (e.g.) a bike shop or something if my bike needs a repair, i go into mad anxiety mode and freak out. 

For the last 2-ish months now i have had really bad depression and i have been hiding it. I have -almost- od’ed twice but stopped myself. 

I don’t need help. I need to fight myself. 
I’m sorry for everything. 
I’m going to try and sleep now and see how i feel in the morning or something idk. 
I don’t want responses, it was more of me venting and stuff. 
I don’t know what to put for a tl;dr, i’m really sorry. My adhd is playing up and i can’t focus. 

Thankyou for hopefully reading or skipping to the end part atleast."
587,What do y'all think,I was wondering other people’s thoughts on my options? Idk. So i can function normally and still do everything the same. I have no trauma I can think of. The only thing is everything I do is more or less a reflex like on auto pilot. That is because everything is pointless and it’s just true. I would never purposely harm anything or myself. I don’t want to die but I’m not scared of it as I’m assuming it’s inevitable and it’s the unknown so it could be worse than living. Basically dying is as pointless as living. The only way I can think to put it is I’m in a constant state of existential crises but I don’t stress over it never had anxiety or anything it’s just my thoughts i guess. I don’t want any medications and I don’t take any currently. I do on the other hand want one of those psychological evaluation things just to see what/if something is wrong with me. I’m a minor though so if they found something I could be forced to take medicine or even thrown in a mental asylum and I don’t want that. So I’m just going to stay on autopilot until I’m 18 as I’m totally able to function normally it’s just slightly harder as I have no reasoning or motivation todo anything but it’s fine not like I got anything else todo. Was wondering what others thought.
588,How do you stop ruining everything that's good in your life?,"Last night, I had a breakdown, which was not nice, but it made me realize that I've started to ruin my current relationship, like I've ruined many in the past, romantic or not. 
The thing is that my bf is a wonderful person, much much better than me, and I feel like I don't deserve him and he believes that I'm better than I am. He does so many for me and makes me so happy, but my stupid brain just goes into self-destruct mode and even when things are perfect, it finds something that it doesn't like and we start arguing.
My bf keeps telling me that it's okay and that he understands, but I'm scared eventually he'll get tired and frustrated with my issues and leave me. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I don't wanna lose him.
I know that I've got to change something and I really want to, but I don't know how, I don't know where to begin."
589,Boyfriend of 2 years mental health episode,"(f20) Woke up this morning with my boyfriend (m23) after a nice evening of lying in bed and eating takeaway. He found a mug that I had squirted a dash of tooth paste into while I was holding my brush over the mug and sitting on the toilet, I had then lay it on the floor before having a shower,l. 20 minutes later he saw it and picked it up and then just blew up, yelling and grabbing at me and screaming saying that if I didn’t have an explanation for why there was tooth paste in a mug then I’m insane, messed up and I need to leave. He repeatedly asked me why it was in there, and at first I didn’t remember because it was such a mundane incident but then I remembered and explained although I thought it was bizarre and I was obviously very bewildered. He wouldn’t accept my explanation saying normal people don’t do that. He kept exaggerating how much toothpaste was in the cup too. 20 minutes of yelling at me saying I’m ill and if I can’t explain it then I’m messed up and he can’t trust me. He then threatened to ring my parents and his mum and I of course asked him to go ahead! Because of my enthusiasm for him to call his mum or my parents however he then put the phone down and said that no one would be on his side and they would just think he was crazy. That’s when he really went off at me. He broke up with me and reminded me that I was losing him because of the toothpaste in a mug and that I was crazy little c**** who could have just explained herself. I got an Uber home, and I messaged his mother. He takes quetiapine regularly and smokes weed, he has been prone to paranoid delusions and when similar things like this happen he will later apologise and say he’s “ill”. His mum is trying to get him to the GP ASAP. 

I just really want some perspective or advise. I’m really tired, he’s an amazing, smart boy, but he struggles with this “sickness” and I am tired of being hurt badly just because he is “ill”. I would like any indications of what it might be that he’s experiencing? The whole concept of toothpaste in a mug eluding to some greater plot orchestrated by me really baffles me and is obviously related to extreme paranoia but why?"
590,I don't know what to do,"Hi, I am a student in San Francisco, CA. Lately, I feel lonely. I tried reaching out to my friend, but he hasn't been answering back for a while. Plus, I can't easily connect with other people due to the pandemic. I just don't know what to do at this point."
591,Schools can make mental health so much worse,"If you’ve ever gone to a school therapist, how good where they ? Exactly

Schools and people need to be more aware of people’s mental health, a teacher could scream at a student which they didn’t know had mental health problems and that could have a long standing effect on that one person for weeks, maybe even months. And as for school therapists, Jesus Christ what a mess. The only thing they succeed in doing is making it worse. Letting everyone know that you have problems even though they have probably not have experienced as much as most people in teenage years.

Teachers need to be more knowledgable that everyone has their own life, their own story’s which can be dramatically different to there’s. They can scream at a student for not bringing in homework but for all they know that student might be having bad family issues

And to any teachers out there who do acknowledge student mental health, I have one thing to say to you 

                                Respect"
592,Help please,"Forgive my English, it’s not my mother language.

I hope at least someone whould read this, but if you don’t I would completely understamd. I might delete it later, as I made the stupid mistake of using my real name as username, and I don’t want anyone who knows me to know this.

Anyway, I’m 20 yo, male, living in a third world country.

I’ve been bullied my whole life, either for my looking, my tastes, or just because I’m not too good at socializing. I come from parents who at first didn’t believe in mental health until now. But it is maybe too late. Since I was 15 I suffered my first mental breakdown with suicidal thoughts and all the stuff. My parents and sibling always madr me believe it was just me, that I needed to grow up. So that’s where my depression started. My mental breakdowns started to come along with anxiety attacks, and I or course suffered every single time more, until the point where I started to physically hurt myself infront of anyone watching me as I was habing this episodes. So my “friends” started to run away. Some just made fun of me. And some even treatened me not to get close to them.
Right now I have no friends, and no one to talk to.

Anyway, that’s the least of my concern.

As I mentioned before, I come from a poorly developed country, with one pf the mayor murder rates in the planet, especially with women. So I consider myself a feminist (something many developed countries have interpretised wrongly). And here’s where my biggest concern comes. I’m obsessed with a girl. So obsessed that it’s killing me. She was my friend, and I couldn’t imagine my life without her. To the point that watching her kissing other boys made me harm myself. 

I can’t finish this, so if anything AMA.

Please, any psychologist could help me? As my family or friends never did"
593,What are the most common early symptoms of schizophrenia,"
To start here are the symptoms I think I have

Confused thoughts and disorganized speech: occasionally I’ll say the wrong things or the wrong word 

 Trouble concentrating: it’s very hard for me to concentrate on something for long periods of time 

I have a really flat way of speaking and speak in one main tone

Lately I’ve been kind of isolating myself from everyone 

I have a lot of trouble staying on task as well

And lately my memory hasn’t been the greatest either 

I don’t think I’ve had any kind of Hallucinations yet or grandiose delusions


I’ll add I’m on the autism spectrum as well"
594,How do I know if therapy is for me? / How do I know a therapist is worth my time?,"Kinda rambling here, TL;DR see title.

I had therapy as a kid, and I gotta say these folk didn't leave me with a good impression of the profession. Sure I hear plenty of stories of therapists doing a world of good, but I can't shake the feeling that those are few and hard to find. 

Thing is, I get in my own way a lot. I think I have a pretty accurate view of what's ""wrong"" with me (wouldn't be surprised if I'm labeled as somewhere on the autism  spectrum and possibly some depressive stuff too) and I have an idea of how fixing it might look like but I can't seem to make it work. 

I've been dealing with me creating my own problems for years now and I'm starting to think I should try finding a therapist, but I feel like I'll be wasting time and money trying to find someone that works for me. I don't know, maybe therapy isn't actually what I need anyway. 

Curious about your thoughts on this from anywhere. I live in Arnhem, the Netherlands, if you know anything specific that might be helpful.

Sorry for rambling."
595,A weird one.. speaking in voices?,"So, it only occurred to me recently that it's not normal to speak in voices.   


I've done it for as long as I can remember.   
Under stress, frustration, extreme emotion I burst out in this weird language, idk what it is.   


It's 100% fabricated but when I do it, it seems to come from my lungs and lower chest, and it's like I'm saying something I already knew, there's no active thought it just blurts out.   


Not super sure why it happens, like it's not like I can't control it but when it happens I want to do it, it's coming right from the centre of my body, an unplanned but understood spiel of weird noises that imitate language.   


Any ideas?"

597,Couldn't stop crying over nothing today,"A very small annoyance made me start being extremely pessimistic, stressed and anxious. And although I kept telling myself there's no need to be upset and explaining logically what happened, somehow in my head it blew out of proportions. So today I woke up crying, cried in the park, cried on the tube, cried at home... and eventually it stopped in the afternoon.

I've had this in the past, due to a severe depression episode last year, but I thought now I should be fine, after working from home and finally feeling happiness again for a few months now. It feels like my brain is in pain or has a cold (if that makes any sense) and it just needs to cry for a day or two to get better!? I wonder if I'm getting stressed and tired due to the lockdown, and if so I'm not sure how it will go later in the year.   I even had that moment again on the tube staring at the tracks a bit too long.

I can function fine when I get like this usually, but the pain in my head is tiring and it's difficult walking around in public with tears in my eyes. 

It's just odd how probably some stress manifests itself in these irrational thoughts and long crying spells. I probably should've gone last year to a professional to get it better rather than 'solving' it myself. And plus, before that issue 1-2 years ago, I barely ever cried even with my old anxiety disorder or eating disorder, so I'm really hoping to be able to get back to that. But I guess before I had a family that could support me, but now I've been quite alone for a decade, apart from having some friendships.

Anyway, just thought I'd vent here a bit about my stupid head."
598,I'm barely holding on with everything going in the world,"Hello everyone,
this is my first post here. I feel so scared living half of the month alone while my bf is working away. I can't help myself feeling afraid being alone in the middle of pandemic, earthquakes and terroristic attacks. I keep having panic attacks being alone in the apartment, too scared to go outside even to take our dog for a walk. Thank you for any advice you might have, I am frigtened."
599,TW: My Abuser is Back,"X-POSTED TO r/CPTSD I could only add one flair, so I’m going to add some extra warnings: Child sexual assault, physical abuse, emotional abuse ... yeah. 

I (F20) was raised in a very sheltered environment. I didn’t have many friends, but I did have a family that I was allowed to see sometimes. They had a daughter around my age and a son that was a few years older. They also had two (much) younger children. 

The boy - we’ll call him Corey - took an interest in me from an early age. We were pretty close, and he was always complimenting me on my maturity and flirting with me. I should note that this started around age thirteen for me, age sixteen for him. Our parents thought it was cute, and they even joked that we’d get married one day. 

As I grew older, the behavior escalated. He would gaslight me into sending him nudes (“Please, I need this to be happy.”) or to touch him inappropriately (“You’re the reason I’m so h*rny, so you have to fix it.”) and other things in that lane. One day, my friend (also an awful individual, but that’s another story) dared me to go down on him. It hurt really badly, and I was in pain after because he was a little rough with me. He made me drink water and stayed by me the whole night. At the time, I thought that was super sweet. However, I now know that he was trying to cover his own ass. 

We were friends with benefits up until I started dating one of his friends. I dated this guy (Liam, we’ll call him) up until the end of my third year of high school. Our relationship ended after he forcibly took my virginity. I know what you’re thinking; I sure do know how to pick them. 

We ended up reconnecting when I was just finishing high school. He would visit me sometimes, or I would stay the night at his house and ignore his girlfriend’s stuff. I was barely eighteen at the time, and I was starting to notice that some of the girls he was courting were all the same age, if not younger. He always seemed scared to actually do the deed, but he would touch me and I would preform sex acts on him. I was really messed up at the time, and I thought I loved him, so I let him do anything he wanted. Subsequently, what he wanted was to beat me and choke me in a way that was violent and beyond dangerous. One time, on the rare occasion that he wanted to have sex, I had just gotten off my period and my cervix was very sensitive. He pushed himself inside me, but I started to cry. He pulled out of me, commented on the fact that I was bleeding, and left me on the floor of the shower. 

(I should also mention that he displayed other signs of being sick-minded and sadistic. He would scream and hit his animals if they misbehaved, and he would always blame other people when he struck them or acted in a way that was violent or abusive. He had a thing for guns and left them strewn around the house. I was very afraid of him, but I didn’t want to admit it at the time.) 

I would always justify his behavior, and he would always make up for his acts by being really nice and gentle afterwords. I’ve been assaulted several times throughout my life, so I never really knew what intimacy was actually supposed to look like. He would buy me dinner and rescue me when my parents were acting out. I thought that we were just into some really kinky sex, and that he had some issues he was slowly working through. 

I started to realize things were very wrong when he told me that he was attracted to younger people. He admitted that he didn’t see the harm in having sex with underage girls. Hearing him confess that made me feel sick, especially when I considered the fact that he’d hung around my younger siblings. I also started to get the feeling that his younger siblings had been abused as well; I don’t have any proof, but I used to be close with the whole family. I observed some behaviors that made me really uncomfortable and suspicious. 

I cut him off completely, and I ended up connecting with his ex, who is FTM transgender. This boy told me a shockingly similar story, and we really came to the conclusion that what had happened to us wasn’t okay. Recently, we both heard that he’s having a baby with his girlfriend (who knows about and condones a lot of his disgusting behavior) and we’re both terrified for the child. Neither of us has any proof about what he did to us, but we’re scared for the well-being and safety of his child. It wouldn’t surprise me if he abused his child. 

Side-note: I think his family knows but doesn’t want to admit how insane he is. A lot of people know, but no one really wants to admit it. I’m scared and insanely triggered by all of this. I could really use some advice/support."
600,He broke up with me today because of my OCD. I was so dependent on him. I’ve never felt more alone in my whole life. I’m in so much pain. I need help.,"Me and my boyfriend were together for about a year. We were so close. He was my best friend. I told him everything and he told me everything. We both have mental illness. It affected things a lot. At times things could be toxic. I was so scared of him leaving me and it happened. He was the only reason why I was trying to get better. He just broke up with me a few minutes ago. It hasn’t processed yet, but I haven’t stopped sobbing since it happened. I can’t get off the phone with the few friends that I have. I’m afraid of what will happen if I do. I don’t know how I can go to bed tonight, I might have to sleep in the same room with my mom. I need some kind of advice or something. I’ve never felt this much pain. It doesn’t feel real at all, nothing does. I didn’t think this would happen the way it did. It’s like my biggest fear came to life. He just explained why and said bye and that was that. It’s over now. He said that if my mental health gets better than maybe he will get back with me later in life. I don’t know how I can wait for that. I can’t imagine myself being happy with anyone else or by myself. I feel as if I need him. I am so lost now. I feel like I am no longer anything. It’s so painful."
601,Questioning,"My mental health has never been stable, infact its like a rock slide that just doesnt stop. Iv tried talking to friends or family but people only seem to hear part or simply dont understand. I have a diagnosis for PTSD and depression umong othe things i know of but i still just dont feel right. 

Intrusive thoughts are a constant battle to ignor or brush off, night terrors are common place, dark thought patterns take over frequently. Thoghts of suicide are often but actions are not taken towards this avenue as i have 2 small human beings that need me day and night. 
 Iv taken note recently that i have lost time often and have blank patches in my memory, i dont know why. I just want ideas i guess, theres a whole lot more stuff and symptoms but typing while busy with a little one who wakes often is hard."
602,I'm a lost cause and need the kind of help I can never have... there's no way out,"I have had to cut ties with my abusive family. I moved to uni in 2018, but couldn't make any friends because the social groups were not run at all. I moved uni this year in the desperate hope of meeting people because I can't handle just being stuck in a one bedroom flat alone with my thoughts doing nothing but passing the time any more... but covid happened and I can't make any new friends here in these circumstances, we fundamentally can't socialise. It doesn't seem likely covid will end before I leave uni next year, but I can't make friends from work colleagues because I'm autistic and only 20% of autistic people get jobs... and that was before the covid economic crisis
So I'm going to be alone in this hellish place forever... there's no way out
My friends from school are lovely and mean so well but they all live in other cities either with their non abusive families or flatmates who are way closer friends than I could ever be... as much as they are sweet, what will happen is they'll go through uni with their uni friends, get houses with them, make partners of them, settle into a permanent home with them or move back to their lovely families, and just in the chaos of adult life and jobs and busyness they will forget to talk to me and I'll be left alone... with no family or flatmate friends I live with to support me, and no way given covid to make more
I'm such a lost cause... all I've ever wanted is to live with loved ones and not be so lonely as everyone else on this planet does, it's not a big ask, but everything in the world has just come together to say very clearly that I can't and I can't live like this forever, it's so fucking painful
My brothers, all my old friends stopped initiating contact with me and stopped replying when I tried to reach out so those relationships all died despite my best efforts and that is going to happen with all my current friends when they get busy too... I can't cope with this"
603,How is everyone doing today?,"I am in a bit of a rough patch myself, but I always find solace in the fact that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, even though it may not feel that way. Hold on guys, you are loved and you are strong. Feel free to let out what you feel right here. Sending encouragement to all."
604,i don’t want a diagnosis i just want some advice. i’m 20 years old and i don’t have any insurance,"over the past 6 months i’ve considered putting myself into a mental hospital over 5 times because i honestly feel so fucking disconnected from reality. i’m stuck in my head. i don’t know how to talk to people, and often in social situations i don’t speak because i honestly forget that i’m actually there. my mind is so loud i get stuck in it. i honestly always expect the worst out of people in my life and i go through periods where i’m so paranoid that i keep a note on my phone of random license plate numbers that “seemed suspicious”. i feel like nothing ever bothers me for a while and then as soon as it does bother me its really intense and i get overly dramatic because it just hit me the wrong way. i can be really toxic because of this and i don’t wanna be like this. i want to be better but i don’t even know where to start."
605,How can I tell my dad I want to die?,My therapist told me i should tell him about my suicidal thoughts and the plan I put up. But I don’t want to hurt him. Does anybody have a way to tell him that would limit his pain? Thank you.
606,"Last time I was suicidal, the police were called to me. Now I'm mildly in that place, and I'm tempted to go to the police.","I dont know what to do. I know I'm able to keep myself safe, but I also know I'm about to fall into a depression.."
607,Sibling of someone with Bipolar and Depression. Any kind of information will help.,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible and I apologize if this shouldn’t be posted here.

My brother was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 with severe depression about 3 years ago. He has been on multiple different medications and has yet to find something that helps him because he (1) self medicates and (2) claims that everything makes him tired and left with no energy. 

My big concern is that he had a manic episode Thursday and today. Both times he called my mom asking her to come see him and both times when she or my dad got there he was screaming in their face calling them awful names, putting words in their mouths, cocking his arm back to punch my dad, and claiming he would kill himself if they were to put him into a hospital (he was admitted once during his first manic episode). He also would lie on the ground and act as if he was having a seizure trying to get a “demon” out of him while yelling in tongue.

IS this a manic episode? He has never acted this hostile to my parents. His manic episodes usually involve religion and the Bible and what not but he has never gotten THIS bad nor had two breakdowns within a few days of each other. 

What do we do as family members to help him? We all have jobs and have bills to pay so we can’t take the time to watch him every day to make sure he doesn’t go out on the street freaking people out or getting himself arrested. 

Our only thought is that he self-medicated (marijuana, over the counter stimulants) and it turned him manic but my mom also thinks it could be split personality because he would refer to himself in the third person, such as saying “if you put me in the hospital I will kill your fucking son”. 

ANY kind of information will help because we don’t know what else to do besides talk to his doctor and that isn’t until tomorrow afternoon and anything can happen until then."
608,memory loss / personality change,"sup guys, i have had a problem since the first lockdown ended, i started realizing that I forget things, and cant remember important events, or just stuff that I have experienced, and what also came up the last weeks was, a big personality change, out of nowhere. 

Im actually afraid.

It kinda makes me panic, and I cant talk to anyone, I had an appointment tomorrow with a psychologist but it got cancelled cuz of corona

please help me"
609,Do I have some sort of childhood trauma?,"Ok I'm a teen but I'm wondering if it's possible to experience childhood trauma and repress it so bad that you completely forget about it. I kind of doubt this would happen to me because it would have to be really bad to be completely repressed right? Its possible the feelings I'm about to describe are a result from semi-bad parents/family setting, genetic mental health problems and just not a great overall childhood environment.

In certain situations, I get a really sad lonely hopeless feeling all around my body. Not like the 'I just got broke up with"" or ""my family member died"" sad feeling but like a ""somethings really wrong feeling"". I always get this feeling when I'm on the swings at the playground, especially near sunset/night (rarely during the day), whenever I wear super exposing clothing or when cold wind hits my bare skin outside. I've also been recently getting this feeling when hanging out with friends. I don't understand why I always suddenly get this really horrible feeling. I don't want to jump to trauma because it could be totally coincidental but it just feels like somethings wrong. I was wondering if it could be childhood related because I don't remember most of my life until I was around 10 wish other than a couple of memories here and there and I started having this feeling around then. 

Just in case this would help, I want to elaborate the feeling more because I think it might not be clear. It makes me feel really small and alone like I want to curl in a ball and protect myself until the feeling goes away. It also brings this unfamiliar feeling of my childhood. It's sorta weird to explain. Maybe it's because I feel like a child again or I just feel the same feelings I felt in my childhood."
610,Intense sadness out of nowhere,"Ive always been a very happy and optimistic person and I’m currently in a great place in my life. But since about last Sunday, Ive suddenly been overwhelmed with sadness and existential thoughts about death and emptiness and I feel so isolated. I can’t be alone with my thoughts so I just have to distract myself with things but it hardly works. I feel better when I get out a bit and see people but Im scared of nighttime at this point because the dark makes me feel so sad and existential. I just keep having horrible, irrational thoughts about death and the pointlessness of existence. I have no idea where the hell this came from. It’s so sudden and intense. Im beginning to forget how it was to have the happy mindset that I had before already. Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Will it go away?"
611,Toxic family,"The title pretty much sums it up. I was somewhat relieved when my stepparent died. Tried to offer help to the other parent, but when live gave them a tiny bit of happiness (new relationship), they turned against me too.

I'm struggling with undiagnosed mental health issues, and I'm unable to hold a steady job due to them. My family just can't understand that I need help or I'll choose the easier way out, and the whole economic crisis due the Coronavirus doesn't help to improve the situation at all. 

I'm 25F, without a job since 6 months. Every day feels like I'm just struggling to survive. I am losing the will to live. I tried to read, playing games, doing things in the house, everything to distract my mind a little, but these all seem to fail.

And all I get is that I'm not doing anything, I'm lazy, I'm acting out, etc."
612,Is this even allowed on here?,"I’ve been seeing a lot of students on this subreddit trying to play scientist by having us filling their surveys for their classes like we’re lab rats to them. 

And also a bunch of ads (from users) who wish to offer their “services” to us to make a quick buck.

What a great way to take advantage of our suffering huh?"
613,How do I stop becoming emotionally attached to everyone who is kind to me?,"I'm a 23 year old female, diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression (I say diagnosed because I suspect there may be other stuff, which I have yet to be tested for).

I had a difficult childhood - I grew up very isolated with a narcissistic mom and a narcissistic brother (yeah, a double whammy). I remember constantly trying to seek their approval, whether that be in my hobbies, or in life. Their reaction was always more important to me than the result of whatever I was doing. Very rarely did I get the reaction I wanted. By that, I mean my brother couldn't have cared less what I did, and my mom simply didn't know how to give sincere praise. I often felt a sense of failure, like no matter how hard I tried, I was never good enough.

I remember when I was 11 years old, I experienced my first 'emotional attachment'. I had a maths teacher who always praised my work and made me feel proud of myself. I struggled to tell whether I simply admired her, or if I had a crush on her.

However, throughout my teenage and adult years, I pretty much got attached to anyone who took any kind of interest in me, whether that be teachers, neighbours, family friends, etc. (Just to input, this was all innocent - none of these people ever did anything bad). I guess the best word for it would be 'infatuation'. 

I've struggled to find any solid answers to why I'm like this. It takes a huge toll on me mentally, because with infatuation comes the inevitable feeling of rejection. For me it's not in a relationship sense, it's more like I'm trying to find someone to fill a parental role.

Does anyone else feel this way?"
614,Just an offer..,"I am always open to talk to anybody in need. Please feel free to reach out, anytime. 🖤"
615,I'm bipolar,"I made this post for r/SeriousConversation, so I felt it was appropriate to post here too.

I was diagnosed with bipolar II back in late July after having invasive (or uncontrollable) thoughts of suicide. My mood became heavily unstable, shifting from extreme highs to extreme lows. My memory &amp; concentration were pretty much gone. I literally felt like I was losing my mind. So much so that I voluntarily put myself in a mental hospital to keep it from getting any worse. And I'll be honest, it wasn't the best place to be but I was getting help, that's all that mattered. Since I've been hospitalized I've been taking meds for it and now I'm doing fine. 👍

So here's how bipolar works: there are manic episodes, hypomanic episodes, and depressive episodes. Bipolar I is split between manic &amp; depressive, whereas bipolar II is split between hypomanic &amp; depressive. Bipolar disorder is also sometimes called ""manic depression"".

A manic/hypomanic episode is the ""high"" mood, with 3 or more of the following symptoms: having an unusual amount of energy, inflated self-esteem, racing thoughts, being more talkative than usual, decreased need for sleep, being easily distracted, increase in goal-related activity, and ""reckless"" behavior (making decisions w/o thinking about consequences). Manic episodes can last about a week or more, whereas hypomanic episodes can last 4 days or more. Hypomanic episodes are also less intense than manic ones.

A depressive episode is the ""low"" mood, with 5 or more of the following symptoms: feeling sad, hopeless, empty, or tearful, lack of interest in things previously enjoyed, significant weight loss/gain, sleeping too much/little, feeling fatigued, having excessive guilt, decreased ability to think or concentrate, and recurring thoughts of death (suicide). Depressive episodes can last as long as 2 weeks.

Bipolar is an emotional beast. One minute I felt like I was on top of the world, life was great and I was ready to tackle anything life threw at me, then the next minute I felt like I wasn't doing enough, life was hopeless and I would've rather cried in bed than did anything else. When my mood was constantly throwing itself around, it became difficult for me to perform simple tasks and I could barely concentrate on anything. This affected my performance at work, my relationships with other people, and especially my self-esteem. I only ate once a day maybe, and I lost a lot of sleep. I never harmed myself physically but I definitely did both mentally and emotionally. Fortunately I'm taking meds for it now and I had an awesome group of friends who looked after me and regularly checked on me to make sure I was okay, or else I probably would have physically harmed myself or worse: became a statistic.

So why do I write this in the first place?

Because I think bipolar is something that needs to be more recognized. According to the [DSM-5](https://cdn.website-editor.net/30f11123991548a0af708722d458e476/files/uploaded/DSM%2520V.pdf), people with bipolar disorder are 15 times more likely to commit suicide than that of the general population. In fact, people with bipolar I may account for a quarter of all completed suicides, and a third for those with bipolar II. Bipolar is a very common disorder and I don't think a lot of people really understand what being bipolar actually means because it's not talked about very often. As a result, there's this gross misconception that being bipolar simply means to be indecisive, which if you've read this far you know is obviously not the case. Indecisiveness can be a part of it yes, but bipolar is so much more complex than that. So please, if you know someone who's bipolar, just be considerate around them and be there for them. And if you're bipolar yourself, I know your struggle. Keep it up, you're doing great! 😁👍"
616,Help. I don't know what's wrong with me,"I don't know how to put this into words.in fact I can put anything into paper even In the exams ,given that I have studied the topic and well prepared.i don't know what to call this.this kind of anxiety lack of confidence and self esteem has been around with me for a while. But now I've decided to address them 
But I can't really explain to someone what I am going through. I also feel like absorbing the negativity around me .ocassional panic attacks are common but I've heard the word panic attack from the last few years only ,yeah I really don't know what I am going through .from where I am from mental health is not a big deal ."
617,Do people like soft spoken introverted girls?,"I’m really soft spoken and feel like I come off as insecure or boring or don’t have a personality. I’m perfectly comfortable with it on my own and accept that it’s how I am but when I’m in social settings, it’s not seen as a good thing to most. It makes me feel like people don’t like me or they’re not interested in what I have to say. I’m actually really lonely and talkative when I finally have a friend or someone I’m really comfortable with. But I don’t open up easily at all. People at work describe me as calm and really quiet and soft spoken. But when I do try to talk more, they don’t care or I get talked over especially by the bosses."
618,I have a question about something weird that happened today and idk if it’s related to anxiety or what.,"I was sitting in my bedroom on a zoom call for school and I had to speak and I am always very shy and nervous, but usually I’m fine. Idk why today was different. Anyway, before I had to present I stated to feel dizzy and hot and cold all at once. Like I was shivering but also sweating and it hurt to breathe a little and my legs felt all shaky. Afterwards that didn’t stop for a while. 

This whole day I felt on edge and then later tonight literally every sound made me want to scream or cry.  I’m pretty sure I could hear my heart beat and the lights in my room. I don’t know why and I’m scared.

Does anyone know what either of these are or wha they could be caused by?"
619,Suffering without meaning,"Am i the online that has trouble accepting that there can happen so much fucked up shit in your life at any time, for no reason, and with no purpose? I have had so many random, out of nowhere shit happen to me and when i was at my lowest points, i always hoped that it would somehow mean something. That somehow, later, i would find some merit in all my suffering. But after each low point, i would notice how life 'just goes on' and i really hate that. Like i can complain to people about my problems, then they will feel bad for me, but you can't get more than that. Also today i have had some really stupid happen to me that makes me really sad, but i know that tommorow there will just be another stupid day where i have to study for my tentams, and i know that nothing special is going to happen because of my problems. I don't know if this is understandable but do people here also face this kind of problem?"
620,I know I'm human scum but just dont know what to do.,"I'm scum, I'm the lowest of the low,I do drugs, I lie, I steal, I use and manipulate everyone, I know how much of a shit I am yet I dont make an effort to change it, I know that what in doing eventually will come back to me but I just dont do anything, and honestly i dont know where to even start.
I dont know if I even want to change but sometimes it bothers me."
621,How does suicide affect the greater community outside of close friends and family?,"How does it affect aquaintences? I know there's a ripple effect, I just don't really understand it. Like, how does the suicide of a coworker affect the workplace or the other employees or bosses? If someone was a regular attendee of events or participated in a community like a local art community or a hip hop scene, how does it affect others in the scene? If the deceased has a large following on the internet, do their 'followers' feel it (for example, if they were a content creator or influencer or blogger)? How about the former people in the deceased's life, like former co-workers, or people that went on a couple dates with them a long time ago? Or if the person was a regular at a certain diner or bar, does it affect the other customers or staff?

How far does suicide reach?

I'm trying to understand who all can be affected outside the few obvious ones like parents and best friends."
622,Im in so much pain,I can’t do this anymore and I wanna go. Hotlines dont work nothing works. No one really cares if I go so nothing is holding me back other than my bird. I booked a counselling appt with my university a week ago for this wednesday and its a bit too far and all this waiting isnt doing anything good for me. I don’t wanna go today but if I continue I have so many responsibilities and interactions that I have to continue in this double life I’m living. I been telling myself I’ll get through it for years but why haven’t I gotten through it yet
623,My great escape from hospital yesterday,"So I'm a naughty patient, don't be like me.

To begin with I thought I'd only be in hospital a few hours and then I thought no more than a day. When I found out I had to stay longer I guess I was a bit upset, and also bored and lots was going on in my head so I decided to see how far I could get.

I didn't take any of my stuff with me, no phone, no mask, no purse and no shoes.

I was surprised to make it past a certain point outside the hospital and after that I just thought I'd keep going, nobody was stopping me. Plenty of people were staring at me because I was walking around the wet streets in socks and also maybe noticed my cannula and hospital bracelet.

At one point I thought wow I've gotten so far I'll go to my flat. I was almost at my flat when I realised I had no way to get in because my lanyard was locked in a cupboard next to my hospital bed which was around 2 miles away.

Realising I had nowhere to go I went to the police station which was nearby and I think the woman misunderstood me because I was smiling and stuff but I told her that I left the hospital and that I was going to see how far I could get and then I thought I'd go home but I couldn't get home because my stuff was at the hospital and so I needed to get back to the hospital. She told me I had to walk back. I pointed out that I had no shoes and she just repeated that I would have to walk back.

So then I left the police station and whilst I was working out how to get back to the hospital with no money, no phone, no shoes and very sore feet (I did sit and cry whilst figuring it out) the firemen came and helped me because the fire station is right there and they took me inside and let me wait whilst they called an ambulance.

Apparently everyone at the hospital was worried about me which I didn't expect. I kind of thought they were just going about as normal. The old lady in the bed next to mine gave me a massive hug and made me promise not to go off again.

I was seen by doctors and the psych team and have been discharged now. I'm doing better. It definitely helped being in a bay with the sweetest ladies ever. The one kept saying she wanted to adopt me and have me as her daughter or granddaughter and take me home with her. Usually when I visit hospital I find it puts me off old age because all the old people seem miserable and not with it but this 80 year old and 92 year old were relatively fit (despite being in hospital) and aware and happy, very very happy."
624,"People in the US, how is your mental health?",Im just curious if we're all anxious and worries about what the future holds. I feel paralyzed by the weight of what this election means for our nation and citizens.
625,Fear: one against many,"Lately I had notice something and it begun to become a growing concern for me. 

To set the scene:

My sibling and his wife are in their mid 30s and my husband is 31 while I am 24. Yes there's an age gap but I learned or learning to work around it. My husband and I been together for a few yrs now.

We went to visit them recently and there was issues but we sort it out. However it got mainly me in trouble and I feel like my husband would side with them in seconds. Because of everyone ages and I know it sometime easier to relate to those closer in their years.

We plan to move down there soon and I'm worried that he going to be consume with the adults closer to his age and scold me every time I do something he doesn't like, disagree, and his usual: nitpicking.

I would love to hear some advice on how to talk to him about it in case it hit the fan. 

P.s. I get the feeling they still view me as a child. So I have to be careful not to display too much emotions or they write me off who unstable and not bother to listen to a damn thing I gotta say.

I do have some issues but I have been working my ass off to change that and if anyone asks my husband he would agreed.

Thank you for reading"
626,Can you help me put a name to what I experience? Is this disassociation?,"Sometimes I get completely out of my mind and start thinking the whole world is a lie. 
The other night I had an “episode” of this. I just couldn’t stop thinking that no one actually has feelings and it’s all a lie and I’m the only person who experiences feelings, everyone else just pretends to. 

Also I get into a head space where I can’t stop thinking I’m just a brain. My body isn’t really part of me. Just an attachment. How can I experience addiction if I’m just a brain. Then in my head I see people as faint outlines with only brains. 

I just get convinced of these irrational situations. 

As a child I thought “my mom just lives on the next road but they drive around for an hour so that I won’t know she lives close by”

It’s recently becoming worse and more frequent and I’m unsure how to bring this up with my therapist because I don’t even know what to call it. Thanks for reading and input"
627,I am in so much pain,Can I like talk to someone? I dont think anyone cares about me and I could really go without anyone noticing. Everyone has someone that can replace my role in their life efficiently. Idk i just cant do this anymore
628,Constantly thinking about an abuser from the past,"An emotional and sexual abuser from the past has been on my mind recently. It’s gotten to the point where I’m constantly thinking about how to destroy them. But until the pandemic ends, I can’t do anything at all. I can’t afford therapy. I can’t speak with anyone. I’ve been left alone with my thoughts and it’s driving me crazy

It’s been distracting me from my work. I can’t even finish my academic work anymore due to it. I just can’t erase them from my mind. I would seek therapy if I could afford it, but I can’t."
629,When to go to hospital (UK),"When is the right time to go for hospital for depression? I've been debating it because I've been self harming and feeling numb and dont want to be alive. But if I went everytime I felt like this I'd be there every other day. 

I don't want to waste their time with it when they can't do anything as I'm already on waiting lists for help and on medication. Also when I leave hospital I'll still feel the same numbness as when I first went. 

Should I just speak to my doctor? Or should I go to hospital when I feel like this?"
630,I don’t want to exist.,"TW: depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts 

I’m not suicidal nor do I have a plan, but I’m getting really dark thoughts. I’m just so tired of life. It’s been the same routine every single day for the past 11 months and I can’t handle it anymore. I’m so behind in uni and my grades are suffering bc of it. Everyone in my courses are doing so well while balancing extra curricular and work but I’m STRUGGLING and I feel like shit and like a failure compared to them. I’m so mentally exhausted from school and work life. I can’t even have peace at home b/c my family members are so loud 24/7. My face has broken out way worse than it’s ever been and won’t stop. I gained a bit of weight and I can’t stop having mini crying breakdowns. I know there are worse things happening in the world right now and I tried to stay positive but I’m so tired. I just don’t want to exist."

632,My Mom is Living in a Fantasy. How can I help her?," 

Hello everyone. I’m looking for some advice on how I can help my mom. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

So, just for some background. She has always been the fun, eccentric, hippie kind of mom, always very supportive and loving. She has always been into “woo” stuff, would give me herbs if I was sick as a kid, ect. Ever since she and my dad split up, it seemed like she had this pattern with men, where she would become infatuated and completely lose herself. I’m pretty sure this stems, at least in part, from the fact that she never really had a father.  It seems like in the past year she has become an even more extreme version of herself.

It seemed to have all started when she met this man, who I’ll call Z. Z was a regular customer where she used to work. When I first met Z, my mom invited him over to give me health advice about healing my chronic illness. I was open to hearing what he had to say, but I did not like his vibe at all. He gives off very “guru” kind of vibes, definitely into some deep spiritual stuff, and claimed to have helped many people heal from chronic health problems. It was clear at this point that there was some flirting going on between them. After that, my mom would tell me just to call him up if I was having symptoms. She was very convinced that he would have the right answers. I honestly felt pretty creeped out by this guy, so I refused. 

Fast forward about a year, during which I can’t recall her talking about Z very much. My mom decides she doesn’t want said job anymore, and quits. I’m not really sure how she has money, but it’s been 10 months since then, and to my knowledge, she is still unemployed. During this time, she also lost a lot of weight, and started doing several hours a day of yoga and meditation, journaling, and other things to improve her health.

Now she has gotten the idea somehow, that she and Z are soulmates. She has given away most of her belongings, including her bed and most of her furniture. She is absolutely convinced that any day now, Z is going to ask her to move in with him. For a while I thought, maybe they do have a relationship, but at this point I’m pretty sure he thinks of her as just an acquaintance or maybe a friend. 

After about 6 months of my mom saying this, I reached out to Z and asked when the last time they’d spoken was. He said they’d texted a few weeks ago, but hadn’t seen each other in months. My mom admitted that they didn’t see each other, but they were always together in her dreams. Now it’s been 10 months. When I ask her about this, she will just say he’s busy building their house, or healing people or something.  I think she kinda sees it like “when I’m enlightened enough, we will be together”.

Along with this, my mom also talks a lot about spirits, her ancestors, angels, and her father. It does seem like she is digging up deep emotional wounds and attempting to heal from them. On the surface, she seems happier than ever. Manic even. Talking with her, there are times when I forget about all this, then she will say something completely off-beat, like that something is at the “new house”. She appears to be very in touch with her spirituality, but she also doesn’t appear to be living in reality anymore. My family doesn’t really know what to do, and just thinks that she will eventually realize she’s living in a fantasy.

I live out of state so I can’t check on her regularly, but this behavior has me pretty worried. It almost seems like she’s getting ready for her own death. My sister and I have both suggested therapy to her, but the thing is that she doesn’t see a problem. 

Should I tell Z what’s going on? I know I shouldn’t try and diagnose her or anything, but I really don’t know what to do, or if there’s really anything I CAN do. How long can this really go on? Has anyone known someone to go through something similar? Any advice at all would be really helpful."
633,What is happening to me,"

Hey, I’m a 16 year old boy. I notice that randomly out of no where I’ll randomly lose all motivation in what I’m doing and a sense of dread and sadness will come over me. Most of the time I have no idea why I’m even sad. It makes doing day to day things hard. What could be the cause of this?"
634,The more I learn electrical/chemical/computer engineering the more I feel like a computer,"The deeper I dig into programming the more I see the human brain as a piece of hardware hosting our software DNA. The more I learn, the more I understand that the percent of actual knowledge known by humans is less and less. The probability of living as a human, at this particular time in the universe is so small I find it absurd to believe things are how they appear. Humans are run exactly like a program, beta version, possibly make it to release ..."
635,Psychosis?,"I just went through a rather intense change of consciousness that lasted about 4.5 months. It was brought on by extreme stress. It came when I started decompressing muscle tension on my cranium/neck, revealing that I had clearly cut off blood flow chronically from stress for a sustained duration.

It felt subjectively like I began experiencing visions of something like ""Divine Revelation."" Compulsive fantasy and vivid mental images. As I recovered physically from restoring blood flow, I regained technical thinking and some functioning, but I persisted in heavy mystical obsessions. Saw patterns in religious text seeming to indicate marketing strategies used with belief/moral discipline. Lots of thoughts about my sense of identity/behavior/ideas being culturally informed, thoughts about logical reasoning being ""cosmic language,"" thoughts of genetically manifested drives being trauma based and dominative, like evolutionary game theory... and that my epigenetics could communicate to me with ""vitality reward"" which behaviors triggered positive adaptation.

This is the 3rd time I've experienced a state such as this. The last time was a year ago when I stopped smoking. Had thoughts of being chosen by some dark cosmic force for ascendance with machines... obsessions with crowd control and body language... mystical interests.

Thing is... every time I go through these experiences I am constantly ""fact checking."" They feel very real and profound, and I want to believe them at the time, but I always say ""prove it or lose it."" There are mood crashes after each episode. I'm handling the decline from this one well with health upkeep, although I went through a phase of dissociating most of the day for a couple months.

Do these experiences warrant concern as psychosis, or am I misunderstanding the condition?"
636,Anyone else feel this way?,There is something very wrong in my brain. I don’t know what it is. I can’t be around people for too long before I get very overwhelmed and I feel a way that is almost indescribable. I can’t function. I can barely speak or move. It makes it near impossible to go out in public or work. It feels like someone poured acid on my brain. It feels like acid runs through my veins. It’s not just anxiety it’s more than that. I don’t know how to put it into words. I’ve dealt with this for over a year since I got off of my meds. I got back on them but it still persists. I’m all alone in this hell. I’m pretty sure that the only way out of this is suicide.
637,The voices is in the back of my head,"For as long as I can remember, I've always had this nagging pestering thing in the back of my head. Its anxiety induced. But I keep convincing myself things are incorrect and I need to go back and check them. 

For example, I convince myself all the time that I didnt lock the door to my apartment! The feeling of ""i need to double check the door"" hit me and at random times as I'm driving to work or going out and about somewhere. Or that I forgot to turn an appliance off at work or something like that. The feeling/voice is 90% of the time wrong.

Im struggling with it. I've always had anxiety. My anxiety attacks aren't terribly frequent these days, but anxiety is still always there, im always ready for fight or flight mode.

But I just can't deal with these thoughts anymore! The other day at work i totally had myself convinced that my parking brake wasn't on, and that my car was gonna slide down this ever so slight hill it was parked on. I tried so hard all day not to go check my car. Cause I dont wanna feed these voices anymore. My parking brake was on. It's always on, even if im parked somewhere flat!

Those are just a few examples. But I can't get over the overwhelming urge to go back and check things SEVERAL times. I dont have enough money to go to therapy right now, I totally plan on going soon though when I get a pay increase.

Does anyone else struggling with this? I've explained it poorly and I apologize. I just recently came to the realization of how bad its been affecting me. I'm so tired of my brain telling me I didn't do this, or I did this incorrectly, and having the extreme urge to double check everything. I'm guessing this is a byproduct of anxiety.

Sorry if this post is flared incorrectly or a violation of rules. Thanks for reading!"
638,I'm a 16 y/o who's sexually attracted to a 13 y/o,okay so she's 13 and I'm 16. I think I'm only attracted because of the risk of being caught and how innocent she really is. she is down for all of my kinks and shares almost all of them. idk if I should continue talking to her or if I should ghost her. we haven't done anything physically but have talked slot about it. am I normal? am I a pedophile?

I live with my mom and him and everytime I here his voice it triggers me. I have no idea how to work past this or or through it. Does anyone have any suggestions? Anything really would be helpful.  P.s I am working on moving out, I just need a way to deal with it till I am able to move away. Thank you"
640,Losing my will,I have lost all hope in life I have been fighting my depression for six years now.  The love of my life left me I'm hollow and I'm grasping for something to make me feel like I'm worth it.  I don't want pity I just want to feel whole again I'm still fighting but I can't keep going. I give myself a month or two before I stop. This pit is going to swallow me and I can't stop it not this time.

642,looking for advice on interacting with troubled teen,"TW: mentions of suicide, eating disorder, potential animal abuse

I'm in a unique family situation right now and also at my wit's end. I live with my boyfriend and his family consisting of his mother and younger siblings. The youngest sibling is the one we've been trying to help for months now and every thing we've tried has been met with outright hostility and dead ends. 

For some background, my boyfriend's (I'll call him B) family has a very troubled past and they moved from their old home town to a new city at the same time that I moved in with them. It's been rough on them - new school, c-vid restrictions, no personal connections in the new town. B has stepped up to try to care for and instill good habits in his younger siblings since his mother does not do much outside making dinner occasionally and paying bills. She does not discipline bad behavior (physical/verbal fights between them) or check in on them regularly. As B's girlfriend I have always felt I was in a weird position because of this. I am also not in a place to discipline them the way a parent should in cases of ignoring their chores, not taking proper care of the pets, or fighting with each other. For me, I encourage B to talk things through with each of his siblings before taking more serious measures like restricting video game or phone use. So B is, again, the only one trying to enforce consequences for misbehavior. I want to care for his siblings as well - make them dinner, help with homework, pick up snacks or treats for them on grocery runs. However, they aren't very fond of me, which is okay, I understand they don't know me personally and are very shy of new people. The youngest (14y/o) however has shown that they have intense hatred for B and me. 

Things were okay for the first couple of months after I moved in, actually. We all would go out shopping together and the youngest would talk with me and B. In the recent months however, we've seen an extremely negative change in behavior from them. They spend a lot of time in their room alone, on the internet, which B and I think might be part or all of the problem, but we cannot rightly restrict their internet use. We also don't know who they talk to online or what they engage with. We know they show signs of having an eating disorder - more from my own intuition since I also had an eating disorder around their age - they don't accept any food B or I have prepared for the family, even when I make things specific to their desired diet (vegetarian). The suicide attempt from them was several months ago but their mother has done little to help them recover from it. I strongly suggested therapy, I have been for months, but the therapy that was set up for them fell through because they didn't want to go. Their mother doesn't seem to care about any of this and hasn't made an attempt to go with the youngest to the therapy session or encourage them to try again. I see a lot of myself in them and while I know that not everyone would benefit from the path I took with therapy I also want to get them professional help. 

The main problem now is that the youngest will not speak or respond to B and me, and if they do it's very hateful. They've been keeping one of the dogs in their room all hours of the past several days without taking it outside on a regular basis - the one thing we tried to encourage them to do. This morning B tried to take the dog outside himself and when he came back in the youngest screamed at him to give the dog back, grabbing the dog. When B tried knocking on their door asking to talk, or asking why they hated him so much they replied he was a b-tch and said nothing after that. We've tried interacting with them in several different ways - knocking on their door and not speaking unless they answer, knocking and talking to them even when they don't answer, speaking to them if we see them in the kitchen. I've encourage B to keep a cool head and say please and thank you when asking them to care for the dogs and he's been successful at talking with them very respectfully despite their hostility. But them screaming at B and calling him ugly names and neglecting to take proper care of the pets consistently - it's wearing on me. I don't know how to move forward. B has tried talking to his mother but she seems annoyed when he tries to get her to take action. 

For now, we've told the youngest that we aren't going to interact with them at all. B told them that they can still talk to us if they want but we aren't going to say or do anything extra for them anymore, that we are going to focus our energy on the rest of the family. I don't want it to be this way but it feels like we've tried everything we know to try. If there's any sort of advice anyone can give about building a relationship that's at least neutral with such a troubled teen, I'd love to hear it. I've done some research but again, we're in a specific situation where we aren't exactly their overall caretaker and they hate us to the point of not talking to us at all."
643,Do I actually have a problem or am I just lazy?,Most of the time when I sit down to work I feel ridiculously tired as soon as I start. I can’t tell if I actually have a problem or if I’m just subconsciously making up excuses to not work. I’m always at least a little tired so I’m not really sure what’s going on. If it helps identify anything I’m also diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety.

646,Body Image Post &lt;3,"Hey guys

So I've been having some issues with body image lately. I used to be this little 5ft 8in athlete who weighed in (on a bad day) at 125lbs. Since I stopped playing and retired, I have gained weight and I'm now 139lbs. I haven't been exercising as much because I'm in professional school. I won't lie it's really been stressing me out because I haven't been able to get motivated and it quickly turns into an anxiety flare-up. Do you guys have any thoughts about getting motivated/ seeing yourself in a more positive light? I know so many people go through this and I want some opinions on how you've conquered/are conquering these fears and dilemmas. Thanks for reading &lt;3"
647,Is reading Jung safe for lost person?,"Can reading Jung help organize my mind or psyche? I went through the dpdr, lot’s of spirituality nature thoughts, years of thinking because of depression and emotional numbness (depressive realism). I am type of thinker person (infj, 7 number in numerology, hsp). I have a huge mess inside me. Is it safe or rather bad direction?"
648,I am loosing hope,"I am so tired. I can no longer sleep and the nightmares won't end.

I lost my brother at 17, it traumatized me, I sought help for my grief but was told to ""deal with it"" and was ignored.

I needed a job after school and got into healthcare but the following years were not kind, I saw so many people die, so much death and sadness that haunts me every day, 

I lost my father to cancer at 22, the only person who seemed to tolerated me. Once again I sought help and was ignored.

I was cast out by my family at 23 and was left homeless, were every day was a struggle until I managed to drag myself out with every last favour I could call in.

With nothing left for me in my hometown, I left early this year to study and build myself a future.
then Corona hit and all the way until now:
I couldn't get a job, schools closed down and I was denied any help or benefits.

I now sit alone in an apartment with the risk of becoming homeless again and I feel like I am loosing hope, I have tried everything, done my best to keep my spirit up but I don't think I can anymore.

I can even sleep anymore and I just want it all to end."
649,"Today, I went to the hospital for attempted suicide, tomorrow, I go back home to my dad to seek help.","I've posted about this, many places. Many many places, in very slight detail, or maybe not to the length I wanted to. I want to get it all out, despite anything, I just want to tell my story and maybe someone out there can read this, and get the help they need, or maybe just say some kind words to me that I need. 

I wasn't the kind of kid to have tons of friends, in fact, I can't think of a ""best friend"" I really ever had. So I grew up, mainly online. I met most of my ""friends"" there and got truly used to being social, via the internet. I think that was my first mistake, and it led me to a whole lot of problems later in life. I started dating people I met online, and my first ""real"" relationship lasted nearly 3 years via calling everyday and being with each other as much as humanly possible, via the web. I grew to adore this girl, I needed most of my moments, if not all of them, to be with her. For the first time in my life, I had felt loved and accepted. My family wasn't bad, so I never had a reason to not feel loved and accepted from them, I just didn't really feel in place most of the time. I felt so out of place. But all I know, is I couldn't go a few hours without talking to this girl and or being with her. It made for some really unhealthy encounters, as she started to work and want her own time.

&amp;#x200B;

3 years go by, we break up, I join the Navy. Well, while waiting to ship, I go and meet another girl online. I am currently still dating her, and yes, I did meet her online. It's been 2 years now, and I don't feel okay without her, still. I feel like I need to be in a call with her, I need to be talking to her in order to feel okay. I need her to be there to be at peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I start this online relationship, and then I decided I didn't want to do the Navy anymore. I want to make this work. I drop it, move away from my home in North Carolina to be in Virginia with my mom. Worst mistake I ever made in my entire life. I moved into the hood, sharing a house with 9 people and 4 bedrooms. Turns out, my mom is a crack head. I slept in the living room, on the couch. I stopped everything. All exercise, brushing my teeth, showering, and taking care of myself. The only time I ever felt okay, was with her. I got so sad. I started smoking weed, every day, all day. I'm talking like $120 dollars every 3 days, to satisfy my addiction. Thousands gone, and I don't even work. I don't think I will share how I obtained so much money, but, I was buying dumb, dumb shit. I have a $200 toothbrush, Calvin Clein clothes, a good computer, and everything, and none of it worked. I was never happy. Not after the airpods pro, not after the S20 Ultra, not after any of it. I never felt happy. I continued to smoke and be unhealthy, falling deeper and deeper into it. Then the men begin. First it's some Trinidad, and he just sits upstairs all day, eats our food, and smokes. Looking back on it, that's all I did. But my mom allowed it and housed him, fed him, and etc. He used us. She finally leaves him, a year later almost, and well, she only did it bc she found a new man. From here, life gets darker than I could ever imagined. This man was 25, and my mom is almost 40. He came in talking about gangs, crips, and etc. He brought crack, cocaine, meth, molly, and probably every drug in North America into this house and fed it to my mom. Turns out, he's a woman beater. I didn't know at first, she would say things like, ""He pushed me"" and she'd have bruises and none of it made sense. One day, I caught him in the kitchen, pushing her against the door, and I told him to him stop. We start arguing and stuff. He's all drunk, he threatens to smack the shit out of me. I lose it. I absolutely lose it. I've all these men in and out, treating me and my family like shit. I stand up, I say, ""Smack the shit out of me"" and we start yelling at each other, in front of kids. Little kids. I thought that was it, that's the worst of it. I was wrong. One day, him and my mom are arguing, he comes downstairs and as he begins to walk out of the door, he says something along the lines of ""You need to your mom to get her shit together"" and I say, ""I don't need to tell my mom shit"" and he loses it. He starts calling me a pussy mommy boy, this and that, he walks outside and my mom locks him out. He beats the door, over and over, and over. I call the cops, they come, make him leave. Everything was fine, until, she moves him back in. She said he ""got better"" and he comes back. We move out of the hood, to a normal home, and from there things just take off. I start cutting myself, a lot. I start getting really emotional and grabbing knifes and threatening to hurt myself, despite not truly wanting to. I didn't know what else to do. They argue all the time, all the time, and I try to stay in my new room. I try so hard. I get a job and life begins to look up and then one night, I'm playing my game and I hear 3 loud pops. I thought someone had been shot. I go to the door, the other kids are screaming outside, ""mommy"" and stuff. He storms back in and they go downstairs and begin arguing. I immediately hit the record button and start recording. He shouts at her, says, ""Fuck this family"" and stuff. And then, he grabs her by the shoulders, throws her on the bed and begins to choke her. I call the cops, she says nothing happened. I show the video, they said they can't do anything unless she speaks up, and from there, I can't even be happy or normal. I can't go a single second without being scared, I start barring my doors at night, and being so scared all day. I don't even want to come out to eat, and I also don't want to go home to my dad, because, I don't want to lose time with my girlfriend. I forgot to mention, she is here for me through everything despite the distance. She stays up with me when I need her, she writes me, if I don't have money and haven't eaten, she feeds me. She absolutely just means the world to me and I don't want to need to spend so much time with her. Anyway, a few nights go by, and I hear strange voices outside my door one day. I got scared. I grabbed a knife, went outside to confront them, and there's ambulances and fire trucks all in the yard. My moms boyfriend attempted suicide, he cut his arms all up, and there was blood everywhere. Everywhere. He leaves, and my mom and I agree to get better. I stop smoking, limit it to once a day, at night. To do better for the children, and everything goes good. We start to walk, hang out again, and when he isn't there, cool. Today I woke up to a text saying, ""He is here"" and I come out of my room, and this man is standing here. I was so mad. I felt betrayed, I felt lied to, used. I beat the fuck out of myself, like punching and punching and punching and punching, and then I grab a knife and go into my room. I put the knife down, decide it's not worth it, and call my dad. She calls the cops. The cops come, talk to me and my dad, I go to the hospital. I talk to the nice lady, and she provides me options, and help treatment places. She gives me a number to call. My mom messages, ""Call your dad and leave"" and I don't want to. I start typing back and saying how could you do this, I'm just scared. He beats people. She tells me I'm so mentally unhealthy and I'm ruining the family. I tell her all of this is wrong and she knows it, I have to report what happened here. There are kids in here and you're a crack head, laying up under some man who beats you. The kids hardly go to school, they're suicidal, it seems. They've wrote things in their journal about giving up and how much it hurts to see this man (the kids). Yet, she decides to bring him back, every time, anyway. She tells me that if I report it, I will be the reason her kids go to foster care and get raped and abused. That's hard to hear, I love my siblings. She proceeds to tell everyone I am a drug addict and sit here all day smoking weed and I never do anything to get better. That's not true, none of it. She says she doesn't do drugs, despite being an absolute crack head and makes me out to be some evil person. Some mentally deranged, suicidal person. Sure, I'm unhealthy and I self harm, but I never beat anyone. I never made these kids watch me do drugs, I never said, ""Fuck this family"" to them, ever. I get discharged. And yet, I feel crazy. I come home, all my shit is packed, and he and her are standing in my room. She just kicks me out, because I threatened to speak up about what happened to me. Everything changed, everything. I became her greatest enemy the moment I threatened to destroy her way of life. She wanted to destroy me, to make me seem crazy at all cost, and control the narrative. I am glad to finally be forced to go home, because I wasn't healthy enough to make the choice myself and fuck this place. I'm so scared that once I go home, I won't be able to maintain this long distance relationship and the things my dad expects of me. I will be forced to work a 9-5, full time, and live by his rules. They're no t bad, just not what I want. But going home is good and I am truly excited to do so, but so scared. I hope I can get healthy and be better. Going home feels like failure, but it was so nice to talk to someone. To not have to hold it all in and pretend I'm okay. I just cried and was real, and honest about what I felt. The hospital people were super nice, they really made me feel normal and okay. They just, I don't know, they really did a good job. I felt normal again, I felt safe there. So yeah, I will be returning home tomorrow to start my recovery journey. No more self harming, no more gangs, no more fights. It's back to good ol' country life, waking up at 9 am and getting it. I hope my family recognizes me. I hope that I don't manage to act a fool, because, I don't think I'll ever unsee what happened to me here. I've watched my mom throw her children away, go to drugs instead, and to let a man beat her and talk shit to me all the time. I hope that I can heal, and learn to live with what I've seen. Thanks for reading, and hearing my story. It feels good to tell it, it feels good to talk about it."
650,Realised an issue I have and am looking for a way to define it so i can work on overcoming it,"After a recent break up (on my behalf) i was thinking about things that repulsed me about my partner.

One such was being kissed, particularly when I was not aroused or having strong feelings. They felt i was very cold and distant when i tried to avoid this, didnt reciprocate or show this affection independently. It was concerning me today as I wondered how other partners would perceive this as I believe there is nothing wrong with a little affection now and then.

And then it hit, as to why i dont like it. It feels intrusive and disgusting especially on my lips on when theirs is wet. I dont even care for kissing much during intimacy or in porn. And i realised when i have experience this feeling before

Being one of the only males born on my dad siblings side i was always an “icon” of some sort to some of my aunts and uncles. Especially an aunt who had 3 daughters. She always insisted hugging and tickling me, trying to spoil me and make me love her. Nothing was ever sexual but for me it was way too much. I was a quiet kid, and i know how kids can go from “hee hee stop tickling me” to “fucking stop im scared and upset”.  i think maybe her daughters responded well to this behaviour from her but not me for this woman i only saw on holidays. (I realise now i am rambling but it helps) 

ultimately, when someone is being too close in my relationships i push away because i get that feeling of my aunt shoving me between her huge boobs and saying how much i loved it, or kissing me all over my face. I know she didnt mean to hurt at all but i genuinely feel like it has scarred me.

So i am here to ask if anyone has a way i can classify this so i can simply seek some help via google. Or if you have your own advice. Because, while i am comfortable with how i display affection, i would like to be more open and reciprocating in the future"
651,Perhaps I will “Stop making everything about mental health” when my mental health receives the care and understanding it needs from YOU so that I can actually function enough to get something to talk about that isn’t automatically sorted into “Dying” and “The Pain I Have to Deal With Until Then”,"What other BS have the people who are supposed to support you and help you get better told you? The above and my subsequent thought came from both a few family members who claimed to understand what they were going through as they have dealt with depression like I have and (ironically) my first and only therapist I had in high school.

Another wonderful gem includes: “You need to stop obsessing over your past.” ~aggressively, and as a way to cut me off, my first psychiatrist. Yes, thank you, if I could stop and let it go, I would’ve, which is why I came to you. Thank you for your words of wisdom, O caring, compassionate, empathetic psychiatrist. Your words that day truly made me a person who shares my feelings with figures of authority and totally did not make me refuse to talk about anything I was going through for the next two years."
652,I’m (15M) finally getting help for my mental health issues and I’m finally putting cigarettes in the past!,"Ok I just needed to tell someone. And not to be like narcissistic, but I honestly need like validation I guess. The only people supporting me right now is me, my teacher, and my guidance counsellor. Those are the only people that know and are supporting me. And although it feels nice, I wanted to tell other people. And I just kind of want to talk about it, or anything really. I’m just really happy and I need to tell someone I guess. And like I said, I’m willing to talk about any of it, or anything, just kinda want someone to talk to I guess bc I’m so happy and I can’t really keep it all contained"
653,I probably should see someone about this.,"I dont really know if I have some type of mental illness or something but I just lack the drive to do anything and its been like this for most of my life, if im not  immediately good or decent at something ill just give up on it also im not really happy with myself but I kinda don't have the will power to actually do anything about it. I have heard about people like me and it most of the times turn out to be some type of depression, im able to go to work and hold conversations so basically im a functioning person but im not not really happy but not really sad. I really dont know how to explain it."
654,Something isn't allowing me to make a post about what is happening to my brain and I need help help help help,Idkkk idkkk idkkk is indeed too fill up this space someone please DM me I will talk less insanity there please please
655,Holding back from a therapist?,"Should you hold back from a therapist about your future plans that are good for you? Like people say keep some shit to your self or don’t reveal your plans too much. I wanna explain to my therapist I’m not suicidal because I have future plans about my career and shit but I don’t wanna break some rules about keeping shit to your self.

People always find ways to judge or criticize your decision which is probably why they say not to reveal your next plan."
656,Inpatient During the Pandemic?,"Hey, so I was wondering if anyone is willing to share their experience being in inpatient care during the current pandemic! 

I have been admitted many many times and know what to usually expect, but I’ve been teetering on the edge of crisis and would like to know what to expect if I get to that point.

Are masks worn at all times? Is group therapy still a thing? Are meals still in a dining room together? 

Any input would be helpful, as I overthink and like to know what to expect in all situations"
657,Looking for 18-25 year olds to interview (can be anonymous),"Hi everyone! I'm a college student and I'm taking a class this semester on writing about mental health and addiction. For my final paper, I'm hoping to write about the issues that 18-25 year olds may encounter in speaking to their parents about mental illness and asking for treatment, and whether this has been a barrier in their ability to receive professional care. The situation for this age group is particularly interesting; although they are technically adults, many people are still on their parents' insurance plans, so they are forced to speak to/go through their parents to obtain care. As such, I'm looking for people in this age group to interview about their own personal experiences talking to their parents about mental illness and mental health care and how this has affected them. Also, if you know a specific person I could speak to who specializes in care for this age group/has particular insight into this issue, that would be helpful as well. Please comment or DM me if you're interested, and thank you so much in advance! I really appreciate any help I can get as I want to make this piece as strong and expansive as possible."
658,My crush self harms,"Ok so my crush cuts herself, on both her wrists and thighs. This is making me sad as shit,because she really doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish I could just help her and make her problems go away, but we aren't even that close. When ever I think about it I nearly start crying, and I don't know what to do."
659,Is it normal to cry and feel like it was all a dream afterwards?,I get this feeling sometimes when I cry for a few minutes and then act normal. It's almost like it wasn't me. idk
660,I had a very bad start today,"Very first thing I went to the bathroom and glanced at myself in the mirror and was literally embarrassed at what I saw. I felt so absolutely ugly.
My wife found me sitting on the bed looking at my hands and I said ""I'm old and ugly now""
I'm only 44. I was always fat even as a teenager. Now I'm getting into shape but my hair is mostly gone. My features just look worn.
I realized that I was never attractive and never will be. And I cried.
For the first time in years I cried.
Then I got my kids ready for school, and helped my wife get ready for work.
I found the strength to work out.
I folded some laundry.
I made a healthy meal.
I accomplished small goals one at a time today. I got to work. I worked my evening shift and updated my resume.
Maybe I am ugly. I don't care anymore. I ate healthy today and worked out.
Tomorrow I'm going to do it again.
By December I'm going to be ugly but 10 lbs lighter.
I'm going to fight this depression one small victory at a time"
661,I wish I wasn’t mentally ill,It sucks
662,Is Pedophila a mental illness,¿
663,Just some really fucked up shit I do/think,"I couldn’t stop thinking of all the ways he *could* hurt me
So I started thinking of all the ways I *would* hurt him

I feel like a truck stop, you wanna pop by and buy some shit, no problem. Ill clean up after you when you leave. 

I just want to look on the outside how I feel on the inside

I’ll never not be tired

I stopped telling people how I really felt because I knew there wasn’t anything they could do

I think I should just get over my trauma

I try to mimic other people’s hobbies so I can see if I’m really as hollow as I think I am, I always do well with the hobbies but I lose interest.

I need so badly to be in control that self sabotage feels like a way I can get back the upper hand

I’m not cynical about the world, but I’m cynical about myself

I love chaos because it’s a distraction from the emptiness and the boredom 

I’m only here because I think I’m supposed to be

I’m way too good at lying

I prepare for the worst even when I expect the best"
664,I hate this time of year for me.,"Its filled with anxiety and depression. Pretty much every year since 6th grade I had to leave the middle of year due to depression and anxiety causing me so many issue that I have been unable to move. And this year, I think trauma from my past is coming back.

I don't want to dwell on my trauma, since I don't want to think about that. What I can say that I have horrific nightmares  that often stick within my mind. They can cause me to feel like I have blood on my hands when I wake up, and often I legit think I did kill someone. But, I had around 4-5 panic attacks today and I couldn't focus in school. I love learning and I like school a ton. But, when ever I look at the zoom screen and I see the faces of my teacher is get this overwhelming thought that goes like this, ""I don't like it when people are faceless, it feels like I killed them and I don't want to know that they are dead... Did I kill them? Are they gone? Are those dreams not actually dreams, did I kill people? I don't want to murder! I'm scared..."" And then I need to lay down and breathe cause if I don't I get so incredibly nervous that I stop responding to normal stimulus reaching a state of disassociation. It fucking is a mess. But, I really don't want to go back to classes cause I get scared and I feel like a murderer. I'm afraid to tell my family. 

To those who are willing to help, what can I do to stop this. I really want to stop feeling like a murderer."
665,Is there something wrong with my head?,"I feel stuff like love and affection, I get insulted and I feel sad. But I don't feel morality in a genuine level if that makes sense. Like, I know that hurting = bad and so on, but it never triggers an emotional reaction. It's more of a ""what a dummy, thinking that there will be no consequences"" or ""this dumbass got caught doing x lmao, what an idiot"". 

Even when people kill one another, I just go ""huh, that's an interesting way to do it I guess, still got caught"". It's like I understand morality, but I don't really feel it. I understand that no one has the right to end someone's existence, but on an emotional level, I don't care. Seeing racism, homophobia (I'm lgbt myself) and stuff like that, I see it as stupid and irrational, but it doesn't make me angry.

If a friend is on the verge of suicide, I'm supportive, but deep down, I go like ""well, I can't stop you so you do you I guess, I'm gonna stay here even if you leave early"".

If I hear that someone I know has died, I act sad because I think people are supposed to feel sad when a relative dies or something. If they're reeeeally close, then sure, I'm sad for a while. But I can only think of a few people whose deaths would affect me at all. 

I often find other people's reactions and feelings as simply interesting to watch. If people get mad, I'm instantly amused. If people get sad, I'm interested. I feel sympathy, but extremely rarely.

I'm 19 and I've only recently realized that maybe this isn't normal. I did a few antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy tests and the results were pretty high. Sure, they were online so that's why I decided to ask some random internet people instead haha"
666,Taking some time off,"Hello,

This is my first post and I’m unsure if I’m doing this correctly. 

I haven’t been taking care of myself properly since I started this office job almost 3 years ago. It has especially gotten worse since the pandemic started. My student mentor had suggested I go to my doctor about taking a leave of absence from work so I should have about two-three months to try to help with my depression. I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I haven’t had much of a routine in the past three years and if I did, it hasn’t been a healthy one. I plan on taking long walks every day and trying new things but I’m not sure what other activities will help me. Can anyone offer some suggestions or ideas of things I can do to help me while I take time off? I just want to be happy and healthy again."
667,How can I help my sister who clearly has mental health issues but refuses to seek professional help?,"My younger sister and I had a very traumatic childhood. We're both adults now, and we live in the same apartment building but in different apartments. She has a 6yo daughter. To preface this, my sister has never harmed anyone but herself, and has never put her daughter in any kind of danger or neglected her in any way.

The majority of the time my sister seems like a perfectly healthy person, to the point where it's as if she doesn't even remember the abuse we suffered. In this state, she's never even mentioned abuse or trauma or anything like that. Sometimes, it just seems to consume her. It can happen pretty much instantaneously, she'll just suddenly be terrified and hide from everything and not be able to speak, or she'll be confused and overwhelmed and hit herself in the head or scratch her arms and legs and physically trying to stop her makes it worse, or she'll be really blank and unresponsive, or she'll straight up wander off and I have no idea where she goes.

When these... episodes(?) happen, she always knows to bring her daughter to me or let me know I need to pick her up from school that day, and I look after my niece until my sister is better, which can be anything from a couple of hours to a couple of days. She even has reminders on sticky notes and her phone background etc that remind her to bring her daughter to me or text me. From what I can tell she has never once failed to get her daughter to me safely. 

I don't remember when this started but I'm pretty sure it's been since she was a kid, but it's hard to tell as in all my early memories of her she was pretty much catatonic, until we found ourselves in a decent foster home where she started sometimes being happy and and normal, but would also get upset and scared a lot, like really severe mood swings. Apparently it got bad after I moved out when she was a teenager and our adoptive parents put her in therapy, but she refused to go after a little while.

Since then she's completely refused to go to therapy or seek any kind of help, and sometimes just my suggesting it sets off an episode. I don't really know how to help her. She's clearly suffering but when she's in her happy state she doesn't even admit there's something wrong. I'll mention her literally sobbing and hyperventilating and hitting herself and she'll just shrug and say since it only happens occasionally it doesn't matter and I'm overreacting."
668,"""A hug wouldn't fix your problems,"" -my mum","See, funny thing about that, is that pre-pandemic, I was legitimately happy for the first time in my life and would go so far as to say that on some days I genuinely felt like I was free of depression. And then, you see, pandemic hits, loneliness and touch-starvation soon follow, which causes a relapse into depression. So, you'd *think* that since touch-starvation and loneliness caused my relapse, receiving a hug from my boyfriend to deal with my touch-starvation and loneliness would deal with my relapse. I mean, just logically speaking. But by all means, Mum, keep denying what the source of my problems are and keep making things worse, do whatever you need to do to feel like you're being ""responsible"" by ruining your child's mental health. Whatever floats your boat and sinks mine, I guess.

Anyways, thank you for joining me on an episode of, ""Things I couldn't articulate during an argument that I can't bring up now because I'd be told I was just picking fights"""
669,Reactive attachment disorders,Anyone have experience with these? I seriously think im fearful/avoidant due to my traumatic childhood. I push everyone away. Ive been in counseling before but it seems harder to get into now.
670,"I need some thought or opinion on my situation. Please, anything helps."," 

So I recently got into a relationship and my eyes have been open to a lot. I realized I have abandonment, commitment/intimacy, and trust issues, as well as constant anxiety and signs of depression, although my main focus here is the anxiety aspect as it controls my life the most. I have constant anxiety and sometimes have severe anxiety attacks that make me come to the conclusion i should not be feeling the way I am and am not good enough for my girlfriend. Right now i started to worry about how compatible we are and and if we are meant to be. It drives me absolutely crazy - i do have feelings for her and when I am relaxed and comfortable it is amazing. Most of the time though i worry about little thing like compatibility and if even though I love her if she is the one, blah blah blah. The only time the abandonment issues comes into play and makes anxiety worse is when I need verification from others and am not comfortable with self verification - adds oil to the fire. its like just the thought of her sometimes gives me anxiety. i figure its triggered from my fear of relationships which then triggers my anxiety. If anyone has experience with a similar experience please let me know what helps and how to know what it really is. I love her and desperately want to love her; after all, I am suffering from all of this to try and get to be mentally healthy for her. Constant doubt and anxiety that she is the one completely destroys my mind and i am getting sick of it. Please, anything may help, even if its not a solution. Just your story , methods that may help ease the mind and all, anything really. Thank you all very much."
671,I'm so self destrutive I need help,"Im a 16 year old male who has high functioning autism (diagnosed) along with adhd (also diagnosed) and extreme anxiety. I spend hours each night overthinking and tearing myself apart. It's so hard for me to think normally. All I can ever think about is what I did wrong, or how much everyone hates me. I only get into these mindsets at night and they often end in self harm or nights with no sleep. I can't take it anymore, my days are fine but the moment the sun goes down I'm scared, I don't know what to do, all I feel is fear, guilt, sadness, and pain. Every night its getting worse and worse and I have no idea how to stop it. I'm at my breaking point and I can't take it anymore."
672,I'm jealous of my friends. How do I get over it?,"I'm not into judging financial conditions. For me no matter how rich or poor someone is, it doesnt matter to me very much. What matters to me is seeing people succeed in life.

I had a couple of friends back in high school. We were pretty much the same in all respects, be it intelligence, behaviour and opinions. We were not very hardworking, just average.

Two years later, things changed drastically. My friends are now studying in some of the most prestigious colleges in my country. They're travelling abroad, giving speeches, are about to bag a very important position in a renowned company. They're spending their time with their partner and enjoying a rich happy life. On the other hand, im just studying in an average college, my parents are paying for it, and there's nothing to boast about in my life yet.

I understand the difference in lives occured due to them putting enormous amounts of hard work, but what I dont understand, is that two years looks like nothing to me. How could they do so much in so less time, while I'm lazy about completing my homework.

I'm happy about them, but at the same time, want to be more sucessfull that them, otherwise I would feel like a failure. I do want to put in the effort, but I succumb to the fact that I am At Least better than half of my batchmates.

I feel like this idea of AT LEAST has the most deteriorating effect on my life. Im at least better than something. Then I fall below that something. Now Im at least better than another something and so on.. this way I'm losing what my original dreams and goals were. I'm losing what I thought I was.

The thought of me being a nothing and the closest people I know becoming the some of the most important people in society haunts me every night.

Do you feel the same sometimes. If yes, how do you get over this feeling and force yourself to do better?"
673,I feel like im becoming crazy from keeping it bottled in,"I cant afford therapy. My view on my life is very negative. This post is an example of how i portray myself to myself and others.

Im very lonely, 27 and never been with a woman in my life, cant get myself to be with one. The other day I asked the girl ive been thinking about 24/7 and she rejected me but hey she said she appreciate me asking her out.

Im a shy person with social anxiety, i look very intermediating due to my big built and resting face. I have a problem where when im with people i have nothing to say, this made people avoid me thru out my life.

I dont have friends, last time i really talked sincerely to someone was years ago.

Lately ive been getting quick episodes where i cry, want to smash something, feel very sorry about myself and then immediately calm myself down.

I managed to control any negative emotions since i was in college, i kept telling myself that things will be better, that im the only one who can better my life. But i never managed to feel loved or have someone listen to me. The idea of ending it all keeps floating around me but i always manage to push it away.

Everything around me talks about love and sex and happiness and its making “living” like hell to me.
I wish i dont exist.."
674,How Do I Ask My Parents if I Can Get Therapy?,"I was normally a very upbeat and happy person (""the funny person"" in the friend group) but over quarantine I realized how truly alone I was. On top of that, I've been feeling so incredibly hopeless about my future. I have a feeling Donald Trump is going to be elected and we're going to be stuck in this endless cycle of hate (don't comment with political opinions please) and I feel so powerless. My parents have made sure my entire life is just solely centered around my education and making sure I become rich in the future. I don't know for sure but I have a very strong feeling that I am going to be feeling like this for the rest of my life, kind of robotic, isolated, and hopeless. I've noticed that I've been more and more withdrawn from activities and not enjoying the things I used to love doing (gaming, art), have become very socially withdrawn, and I've been feeling terribly unhappy for the past time. (I even re-watched Pewdiepie's wedding video because it brought me a lot of joy the first time I watched it but then I couldn't finish it because I just kept thinking ""that's the happiness you'll never have"")

Trump's presidency (I'm not here to have a political debate please) had a lot to do with the development of my mental health problems, and if he gets re-elected I know it going to get a lot worse so I'm planning on asking my parents (I'm a minor who still lives with her parents) if I can see a therapist. The thing is, my family is basically perfect. My siblings have never had mental health problems and it's never even been thought of. Even though we're doing financially well, I don't want to be an inconvenience and a burden to my parents because they worked extremely hard for their money and I don't want to spend it more that I already have. In addition, I don't know if I'm exaggerating it or if it's all in my head, and I would hate to inconvenience and worry my parents over something that doesn't even exist. If I asked, they would say ""you can just talk to us"" or ""you're on social media too much"" or ""it's because you haven't been making friends at school, let me email some parents to set up a playdate "" (I'm going to a new school but it's online so it's tough to make friends and I'm in high school so I refuse to let my mom do that). That's not even all, but I think this post is very long. Does anyone out here have advice on how to approach my parents to ask if I can get therapy?

TLDR: I think I've been experiencing depressive episodes and want to ask my parents for therapy/counseling (or a diagnosis) but have no idea how."

678,The sound of AC helps me sleepp or else I go crazy,"Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? I cannot sleep without the sound of air conditioner. I don’t even care if it’s working or not I just need the sound of the compressor to put me to sleep. Been going on since i am 7 and now i am 22. 
Whenever the compressor sound stops, I used to wake up in the middle of the night, walk towards the AC and decrease the AC temperatures till I hear the sound. ( did this more than 20 times a night) and before i realised it was morning and I hadn’t slept at all. This lead to my insomnia which stayed foryears. 
I still dread the sound stopping and i stay awake till i can turn it on again. 
And when i turn it on, i again can’t fall asleep because i KNOW IT WILL STOP AGAIN. 
I go crazy without the sound of it please helpp me. The silence without the sound drives me even more crazier!!! Help me :("

680,Hopeless,"I am so tired today. I've been fighting with insomnia for the past few weeks yet still need to cope with online classes everyday. So tired. Burnout. There's still lots overdue assignment and works that I didn't hand in yet. So stressful ;( . I just want to run away. Run away from everything, from everyone. I hate everyone. I just want to be alone. But obviously I can't bcs I still got class everyday. Would it be better if I die?"
681,When I was about 4-11 years old I would get voices in my head,"When I was that age I was battling stress and anxiety because I was failing in school and my step-mother abused me. Whenever I got extremely anxious or stressed I would get this overwhelming voice in my head that would tell me that I was just a mistake and didn’t deserve to live and that I should just give up. I would curl up and cry and tell myself it wasn’t true. I’m still scarred by it to this day. However I am doing better now that my father divorced my step-mother and am now acing my classes.

Anyway thank you for listening. It feels good to get that off my chest after so long."
682,Am I autistic?,"Well last night. I tried killing myself repeatedly with a belt multiple times. I am unemployed. Awkward socially, but the reason i really did it was because there is this Japanese actress i like(no she isnt porn). I cannot handle her being with other men, i cannot stand being without her. She is on my mind 10 hours a day on average and has been for 3 months now.

I dont really see much of a future for myself , but am I autistic or?"
683,I feel like I’m drowning,"Tl;dr: any tips on battling multiple pressures and not being able to rely on my social circle? 

Things have been hectic. 

I’m 32f, live in the Bay Area, and feel like I’m losing everything. 

Work: I was so overwhelmed at work because I’m one person doing the job of a full team and it’s not coming together like I need it to. I found out someone who was supposed to be on my team and help me really had been making it more difficult for me, took credit for my work and is getting paid more than me. I do the work of a Director in IT, but I’m getting paid as a Coordinator. 

Home: I am really down on myself, lost some traction, and my spouse and I are really not on good terms. I don’t want to stay with my partner, but I feel like my family judges me because I escaped a really brutal relationship a few years ago. I appeared pretty put together but inside I’m really torn apart. I don’t want to be in this relationship but it’s hard to get out. 

I’m stressed at home, I’m stressed because of multiple responsibilities with my family, and I don’t feel I trust anyone enough to talk to them about it. 

Either my friends are single or have kids and are handling their own battles, or their happily married and settled in. I don’t know what to do or what my first step is when everything feels completely out of control. 

It’s pretty stressful and I don’t know what to do first."
684,"DAE see/think of things that ""trigger"" you but it doesn't really bother you?","Yesterday I read something and afterwards I went into a thinking pattern of daydreaming dark and upsetting things that lasted several hours and disrupted my sleep, but I don't think all that's a big deal? Like, I am not bothered by being bothered. And I'm not all that troubled by being kept awake longer than I would have been by my thoughts. I put trigger in quotes because I'm not actually being reminded of a trauma or anything, it's just one thing that causes another. I'm not all that broken up about being distressed."
685,i just realised some of my triggers,"so I was talking with my drunk friend about random life stuff and talking to them gave me a massive realisation about my trauma.

turns out I avoid watching any movies because [redacted] would constantly quote different movies and such and I don't know what movies all the quotes are from, so I've been subconsciously avoiding movies altogether. it also made me realise some specific series that are triggers for me, and it all makes so much more sense now that I think about it. it's a good thing I've realised it but also I don't know exactly what to do with this information now that I know it. in the least I know what to avoid to try prevent having panic attacks constantly."
686,When is it time to ditch your current therapist,"A few hours ago I spoke with my therapist. We talked about me having self identity issues because I really don’t know my parents well. I told her some concerns I had about my parent’s I did not like. My mother or “dad” did not give me my first name, my “ dad” is not on my birth certificate, and when I recently spoke with my mom recently she acted like she didn’t know I graduated but acknowledge my nephew and niece graduating from high school. I told her that I felt neglected by my mom. Her response was “you need your mother! You can only get one mother”. I’m thinking to myself as she saying this “ so it’s okay to endure verbal abuse (or maybe physical abuse), neglect, and lack of support from your mother but still love and communicate with her because it’s your mom?”  

Aside from that she used the R word (Retard) to express something. I corrected her immediately because I know it’s a derogatory term. It’s also a term that haunts me. 

I’m thinking about discontinuing pay for her service because I felt she questioned my judgment of my mother by saying “ it sounds like you are assuming, what if she don’t know how to talk to you (when I explained she speaks, praise and recognize her other children perfectly fine. I also explained that when I address something she get offended, laugh it off and call me crazy when my feelings are valid) and etc. The R word made me extremely uncomfortable. Is it time to give my current therapist the 🪓?"

688,I think I have Pure O (rare form of OCD)?,"I fit the descriptions and examples of Pure O well and I am scared that I might be just blowing it out of proportion. Pure O is an ocd that is mainly mental and causes the person to think extremities and obsess over ""preventing "" them from committing these acts. Not a day goes by without these intense thoughts of murder or insane acts. And I think these randomly during even the most mundane situations. This would be normal except for the fact that it feels like an urge I need to hold back and it occasionally makes me uncontrollably fiddle and cry while rocking back and forth. It feels almost like suppressing this evil inside my head and I feel so guilty for even fantasizing of murdering or other extremities. I take precautions and avoid situations that may enable these thoughts or actions all the time. I might have Pure O or maybe some other issue-or maybe I'm just being overdramatic."
689,Need help figuring out my condition; Dysautonomia or something Psychogenic?,"Long story short a series of very bad weed trips have landed me into a spot where I have reoccurring panic attacks months after.

The last trip before I stopped THC prominent weed fully was extremely fucking terrifying, leaving me with 3 weeks worth of vertigo and disassociation; my hypothesis is that I most likely released the flood gates on something underlying genetically in terms of my mental health.

But one thing I don't get is my nerves. These panic attacks usually occur randomly or when I am peacefully driving down a road. BUTTTT! They never occur first. It's always this tightness/icy stabbing pain near my heart and chest in general, then the fucking bulging and aching of my neck and temple veins/nerves, followed with pains on the left side of my body (arms, leg, foot, hand). 

I have been having all sorts of nerve pains or tickles/sensations ever since that final episode, such as a weird tingling cold sensation running up my left knee/leg to pressure and pains on nerves both on top and on the sides of my cranium; these are very passive, and don't trigger anything at all. They have occurred so to where it is now just regular for me to feel such sensations and brush them off. 

Before you ask, yes. And before you ask again, of course. Every test under the sun has been conducted and I have successfully been negative for Corona, whilst doing EXTENSIVE blood work and going to all these fucking specialists, wasting my god damn money for them to brush me off healthy in a country that rather you die then live to see another few years; I love you Canada, and other places where healthcare is included in the taxes you pay lol. I wouldn't feel so bad about wasting these people's time if I wasn't sacrificing my hard earned dime.

My neurologist was unhelpful, but he has me testing for something called Fabry disease...? I know for a fact it is gonna probably be another goose chase as that test comes negative, so I wanted to ask if any of you could help me figure out why these episodes have now given me such physical and mental abnormality. I just turned 20 on the 2nd of Oct; I am a fucking tank health wise. I do not get how I got an ""anxiety/panic disorder"" being a possible diagnosis from a dumbass ""green out"". I am someone who never really let any of that over power me. All I had prior to this was very mild chronic depression an at least one anxiety attack that was triggered by extremely unpleasant people being at the same mall as me. 

Please, anything that you all could give, would be very helpful. 

Oh, and vote safely please."
690,"When I truly care about something, I either actively avoid it or self-sabotage and eventually fail at it or miss my window. What could be the reason behind this behaviour?","I’ve noticed this about myself. If I care about something, I avoid it. I don’t do the bare minimum to make it work well. If I don’t care, I don’t care and I just do the task. For example, I care about volunteering for a specific NGO. What do I do when I finally get in? I miss meetings, I don’t log hours, I don’t write the pieces that I’ve been dying to write for a while that could actually make a positive change in my community. And I’m aware that I care so much and at the same time I avoid and intentionally miss opportunities to be involved. It seems like the more I care the more about something the more I want to disassociate from it.

How do I go about understanding why I do this and fixing it?"

B. I feel terrible about what i do creatively, ranging from shutting myself up when i start singing to tearing apart barely started artwork

C. Just kinda empty, where i dont know what to even try to do to make me happy so i sit around doing nothing

692,Growing up in a cult,"Growing up in a cult

The Jehovas Witness religion has left some deep scars in my heart. Growing up as a Christian was a joy because we were close to God. Growing up as a jehovas witness, that was the worst thing that could have ever happened to me. My mother has been in the religion for 35+ years and she is still happily a part of this religion. I was born and raised jw however never decided to get baptized despite the deep pressure all around me to do so. I saw friends get baptized young, around 13 years old and then get disfellowshipped over very petty things such as dating “worldly men” or having friends outside the “truth”. These control tactics went so deep that many friends ended up depressed and suicidal. To be gay or lesbian was out of the question and the youth slowly withered away into alcoholics to numb the pain. The friends I grew up with would marry very young just to be able to get out of their parents house and have sex. The only option was to marry in the truth. 99% of those marriages no longer exist and one of my friends even committed suicide. I would go to their yearly memorial of the death of Jesus Christ to please my mother once I became an adult but other then that stopped going. I was abused by a family member, with inappropriate touching and nothing was done about it. I was just a rebellious youth who wanted to start troubles is what the “elders” said. I moved away and started a family, once again finding the jehovas witnesses at my door 1000 miles away i would go every once in a while with my kids and husband. When i was 24 years old, my 19 year old brother had a hiking accident and passed away. My mother who was gone to this church for over thirty five years was denied a funeral for her own son from the church because he was not baptized and was not “doing good in the truth”. Quote from an elder.  The pain and frustration I felt at the time it lingers to this day making my blood feel like it’s rushing and I just want to release my frustration in some way. Who denies a family the most humble, basic of rights in a tragic situation where a 19 year old hard working young man has a hiking accident? The jehovas witnesses. I’m thankful i have found Jesus Christ and he has helped my heart heal. My amazing church family who are very supportive and loving, they are always there but especially during the tough times. I’ve had to learn that God isn’t the author of confusion. I’ve learned to love my neighbors as they are and let go of what I can not control. I was saved and baptized for the first time in my life last year after going through so much pain from another religion. If you are in that cult, there is hope I promise! The hardest part for me was realizing that maybe there is a heaven after all and that my brother will be waiting for me with open arms when the time comes after being a faithful disciple and ending my journey on earth. Stay blessed ❤️"
693,How do i gain courage to get help?,"For as long as i can remember, i’ve felt like an outcast for my whole life. Within my family, my friends, school, everywhere. And i was never good at a sport, so for someone who’s fairly anti-social, i can’t just be appreciated for being good at something, because im not. When i told my mom about panic attacks that i would have at my friends house out of nowhere, she took me to the doctor. When blood and vitamin tests came back and said I was perfectly healthy, she just dropped it and acted like nothing happened. When i try and tell her i’m anti- social and have a horrible self-image of myself, she just straight up denies it because, “I was always her happy little boy” I want to talk to doctor, one on one, and try to see what i can do. I just find it really hard to talk about and can’t muster up the courage, and on top of that, i dont even know where to start."
694,I finally feel excited for the future,"I spent the last 5 or 6 years fighting against depression and anxiety and things are really better now.

I used to think that I would always be the person watching other people live an amazing life and would remain a loser forever.

Now I'm in my last year of high school and I've never felt this excited for the future. School sucks and I hate going there, but knowing that once I get my diploma I'll be able to make all of my projects and dream come true fills me with motivation and happiness, it makes me have goosebumps and tear up. I have so many plans and I can't wait to make them come true!

Life is an adventure!

I'm happy that I can, after years of feeling dead inside, feel genuienly happy and work to make things work out. It's an amazing feeling.

Please don't give up, things really do get better :)"
695,Idk if it’s just me,"I compare myself to others so much, it’s so bad. I get so much anxiety from this. For example if someone is taking more classes than me or they are answering more questions that me in class which is stupid would make me start to question myself. I compare in a way that’s so unhealthy, I start stressing out when I can’t solve something or do something, it’s weird, this anger starts to build up inside me which results in me crying every night. I don’t know what’s wrong. Everyone around me compares so they always have this standard and expectation for everyone already nested inside their head which stresses me out so much. Like for example, for exams I start stressing out if I feel like I don’t meet these expectations and I start stressing out when people that aren’t expected to meet them meet them faster than I’ll ever do. Idk I feel like I’m being mean, but idk.  Especially because my school went online recently, it’s so awkward when u answer something wrong and the environment so competitive. My self confidence is so bad, and my insecurities are getting worse, idk what to do. My anxiety is so bad and I just can’t feel relaxed, I’m always overthinking about everyone and I care so much about what others think of me."
696,Been pushed away / ghosted,"I used to be very close with a girl. After a few months I noticed things started seeming a little off with her. Things started going downhill and she has mentioned to me that she's got depression and has been hurt so many times in the past.

As things went downhill she still was close to me in a way but not the way things used to be. There are times where it's like she pulls me closer and then pushes me away because she doesn't want to be attached to me. I am not sure if it's because she is scared I would leave her if we got close or if it's just because we can't really be together since we are long distance. I told her we could be friends but she says she will want more than that and her mind will get attached.

When I try having conversations with her to talk about issues that are affecting us, she usually gets upset and tells me to leave her alone or tells me to go away. She became really toxic after things started going downhill. Has this got anything to do with mental issues or is this really the person she is? I feel like she tries avoiding conversations with me because maybe she knows she's the one that's made things bad? 

It feels like I have stuff trapped inside me that I can only get out by talking to her but she doesn't want to talk to me, she got more toxic and started being a little immature towards me. When we were close it seemed like I meant a lot to her and she wanted to have so much to do with me. I can't trust anything that comes out of her since she's lied about so many things and once again I don't know if all the lying she's done has to do with her mental issues? She has lied about so many things that aren't even necessary. She's lied about how she was going to be in hospital because of her depression for  4 weeks but was only there for a few days, I still don't know if she actually went or not. She lied about getting close with someone which turned out to be all made up in her mind. She lies about a lot of things and sometimes when I questioned stuff she got upset because I thought she was lying.(which she was) I remember when she used to say she loves me and that she cared. She changed so much and it really sucks to see someone change like that. Oh well..
 
Does anyone know why she's become more toxic over the months? Is it due to the past relationships that broke her? Is it her depression? Has her depression worsened maybe? Did she not expect me to stay and care for her for that long so she just got rid of me?"
697,My mother's ego cost me my mental health,"I believe my mother is a narcissist.

She will do whatever it takes to have 'one up' over everyone, even if that includes mental and emotional sabotage through intimidation, passive aggressiveness  emotional blackmail, gaslighting, basically anyway she can, but she's a master of it, so she does it so subtly and because I'm her son, she abuses her role as a parent.

Nothing stands in-between her and 'winning'.

I have read up alot on narcissism and she fits the bill completely. It's basically do as I please or I will deprive you of love.

It's been ongoing for my whole lifez but I am only beginning to address it.

The other night she started flaring up, trying to embarrass me with personal questions, invading my personal space, stomping her feet really aggressively on the floor when she walks past me, watching me eat when she knows I hate people doing that, coughing whenever I talk.

Basically ended in me completely breaking down and her saying that I need to go to a mental institution. 

She said it with such a cavalier attitude and ease though.

It's like she's only happy when I'm not.

What do I do?"
698,Maybe I’m overreacting,"Idk what’s wrong but I have so much anxiety to the point where it’s hard to breathe it’s stressful to breathe. I feel numb to feelings but my I have this stress deep down that’s hurting my heart and making it hard for me to breathe, but at the same time I feel sad so sad and it’s so stressful."
699,I don’t want to go to school and I feel like a failure,"I had a math test recently and I failed HARD. I’ve made all my homework (on time) and I have studied for the test well, but I still failed. It felt like I wasted my time making all the homework because of the horrible grade I had. The worst part is that I understood everything in class, but I still have a bad grade. 

I also feel like a failure in the sport I play: golf. When the lockdown restrictions where lifted in May, I went to practice almost every single day. All the competitions I’ve played (except 1) went quite bad. My parents were furious and disappointed in me. I was disappointed at myself because the work didn’t pay off.
The last competition I’ve played was in September and in the month of October, I only visited the golf course twice because I didn’t have the motivation to go and practice, because I know I won’t improve.

Now I don’t want to go to school either, but my parents still force me to go. 

I feel like trash. Especially when I see other people achieving things and hanging out (I don’t have close friendships by the way). I just want to lay down in my bed and don’t do anything because I feel like shit.

Well, this is the end of my rant"
700,"Can I (17M) check myself into a mental hospital without my parents knowing? If so, should I?","I’ve been dealing with depression for about 2 years, I have friends and a family that cares about me, but I can’t talk about it because I feel like a burden. I’ve been feeling more suicidal recently. I don’t know if it’s my meds or what but all I can think about is driving my car into a brick wall or jumping off something tall. I just want it all to stop.

701,Temporary firearm removal tw:suicide,"So I shoot for fun but I'm going through a lot right now.  I'm not really in a place where I'd hurt myself but I don't really want guns lying around my house.  A friend of mine seemed perfectly fine then walked upstairs and shot himself.  I don't want to risk that snap decision.  I basically want to know how to take them to one of my parents without them completely freaking out.

702,Am I creating a false memory?,"Hello everyone. 

I have developed a fear of having cheated on current boyfriend, however I don't remember doing so. For this past month I have created a conversation that I had with a guy in my head and after I could get access to the messages I could see that many things were not correct from what I thought. My mind is now thinking that some stuff that I assumed that happened in that conversation happened, in fact, in another conversation that I cannot remember about. 

What should I do when I feel like something is real but cannot remember it?"

704,How can I help my brother,"My brother is 30 and has extreme anxiety and mental health problems, He is currently living with my best friend who took him in. His anxiety is so bad he can't hold a job long enough to get health insurance so he can get help. My friend is moving soon and can't afford to keep taking care of him. I dont have a place of my own or make enough to help him. He told last week he won't be homeless, that he will kill himself instead. I lost my sister recently. He lives in Mississippi any help please"
705,I'm willing to do the hard work and work on my mental health.,"So, after a long battle with mental insanity, crippling depression, and a lot of pain, I finally came to term that I actually don't like myself, I might even be hating myself so much, I forgot my sense of self-worth and I settle for people who don't care about me, thinking that it's what I deserve and that I can't do better than that, because I'm unworthy of being loved, I think I'm oversensitive, I take offence too easily, especially in a situation where I give all my best, and I don't receive anything in exchange other than disappointment and complete carelessness. 

Well, I came to the realisation that instead of loving people deeply and caring about them, I should be giving that love to myself, because I deserve it more ( I know that at least ), however being kind to myself and forgiving myself is THE HARDEST THING I have ever tried to do, I still BELIEVE that I'm just a disposable human being, unworthy of love. 

I actually can't afford therapy, So I was wondering if you have any advise for me guys, or can refer me to any helpful books or videos that might help me in my journey to recovery."

709,Just some suggestions needed,Hi. I'm posting for the first time on reddit. I am in the midst of a very overwhelming situation right now. I'm a college student and I've got placements coming up and my final exams and all these submissions and it's just driving me crazy. I'm not able to focus on anything. I've got so much to study but it just feels impossible getting anything done. I would really like some suggestions about how I could relax a little bit and prevent my mind from fucking up so much. Also not something very time consuming because I don't have much to spare. Any suggestions will be more than welcome :)
710,Confused at my own life,"Hi. Just feeling down lately for some reason.

I am a loner type of girl. I am a Filipino-American who currently lives in the Philippines for almost 14 years now. Its been good and bad. 

I have this conflict-like feeling because when I was young, I usually kept that ""American"" identity hidden because I always felt like people will belittle me. I've had classmates and people around me go ""You are such a bitch you're always speaking in english"" but at the time, 7 years old me who just arrivde doesn't know how to speak in Filipino. Once they found out i am from California they go ""Oh, so you're rich. Treat us English speaker."" I hated that. I always felt alone. I had a hard time trusting others so i always kept my identity hidden. Until now I try to keep it hidden but online or talking to my cousins in america or to other foreigners i can open up a bit yet unfortunately to filipinos who spent most of their life in the philippines i can't since i get the image that these people only see me as a ""meal ticket"". sorry but most of the time that is true in my experience.

I always felt jealous of the other ""Filipino-American"" kids or at least the people who are ""half-filipino"". Rich, life seems to be going well for them, smart, has a family that supports them, able to travel and bond with friends and family, able to do what they want, learn what they want to learn... I was always told by my parents ""when you get older you'll be able to do what you want."" or ""God will provide"". The more I hear those things I feel even more frustrated. I'm almost 23 years old and I don't have a job i am still studying a program that my parents wanted me to take. I say ""I wanted to take Nursing because I wanted to help others"" but in reality I was just trying to fit in a old that doesn't fit me. I am more interested in makeup and interior design anything that makes my creative juices flowing. I wanted to model once but i am too fat even though i am 5'7. No, my parents pretty much wanted me to take this because ""Nursing is a high paying job and has lots of benefits. Look at your aunts and cousins. They have a nice life because of nursing"" True, I liked this program but I quickly realized it was not for me. I feel bummed out trying to force myself to finish this. My teachers were right. ""Nursing is not for everyone. If you wanted this, congrats. If you were forced to take this please think many times because you will just get burned out and not deliver holistic care to your patients.""

I just feel stupid and confused. I don't want to bother my ""friends"" and ""family"" because I know they have their own problems. Its just easier for me to open up to strangers. 

I do admit, there are times that i wanted to take my life away but i never did because of my family. Yet, I dont think they understand how i feel most of the time. I'm just in my room, playing around various games or watching youtube videos but deep down I just want to break free. I want to get away. I feel trapped for years I want to learn more about life on my own terms. I see the neighbor's kids at 11 learning how to ride a motorcycle and I can't yet my brother can? Come on... I wanted to try my luck at modeling in malls but i can't because ""you'll do it when you get older and lose weight."" Jeez.... what a way to boost my confidence. I wanted to learn how to play guitar and play the drums but nooooooo my brother gets to buy his own musical instruments and gadgets and i don't because ""we dont have money"". I'm so sick and tired of this environment.

I don't know what I am typing anymore. I just want to breakdown and cry from this frustration. I know things will get better soon. I know I have to divert these feelings i need to cope i know i am doing my best and get over this i know all of that... 

I am just confused and don't know what to do anymore."
711,What are your ways of managing when you’re getting “bad” again?,idk maybe it’s just because it’s night but i’m picking up on what’s going on with me mentally and physically and it seems like the start of a depressive episode. I can’t go through being another acute case and depressive episodes always seem to end up going there. So I am asking you friendly peeps how you deal w easing into an episode :)
712,I know something is wrong with me and I feel helpless.,"I am noticing this
Crying episodes 
Hard to focus
Sleeping alot or not at all
Eating when stressed 
Hard to make a decision 
Feel like giving up
Feeling like a complete failure
Not talking to friends
Isolating myself
Not able to talk to someone 
Clueless

If anyone can help that will be appreciated"
713,I’ve become completely disconnected from my emotions,"So the story starts in 2018 when I was 24, this was the start of the most difficult time in my life and I had hit rock bottom.

The pain of living through this situation was unbearable to the point i wanted to escape my situation by any means necessary and thoughts of running away and/or suicide crossed my mind many times a day, and had made plans that if it came to it either could be carried out.
However after many sleepless nights I saw this wasn’t the answer to my situation so I pushed forward through my bad situation as best I could.

But I still couldn’t live with the pain this situation caused me on a second by second basis. So to combat this I tried to distance myself from my emotions so I would no longer feel the pain it caused me in the hopes that I could go back to the life I had before. This strategy worked, however by trying to distance myself from my pain I also cut off all connection to every other emotion. 

Now 2 years later this situation has mostly pasted but I’m still haunted by it, but my action of distancing myself from my emotions has had a lasting effect on me which  left me unable to feel anything: happiness, love, sadness, hate, anger, fear, I feel nothing except indifference and now I wonder if I will be able to feel anything again."
714,I hate everything,"My friend called me toxic. Made me out to basically be abusive when I have serious mental health problems.

I guess I’m always at fault. Who cares anyways? I’ll just kill myself and be done with it all.

I hate everyone"
715,At least THEY are happy.,"I have to admit that I’m sick and tired of seeing all of my friends and family having fun, taking pictures with friends, and getting into relationships while I’m here overthinking the way I said good morning. I feel completely alone and I’m afraid to ask anyone to do anything because of my crippling fear of rejection. I just want someone to love but I guess I can’t."
716,Hello am I even Human?,"The reason I am here is cause I need  advice
I don't feel human ever since I was 8 i have had  zero to nothing on a emotional scale I have to force smiling, and crying as well as laughing at the right times. I can read emotions on people to spookly good 
I am not above saying it I use people to not be bored anymore I treat them like toys/puzzels to play with. 
The reason why I am here is cause the past 4 years  I have some how found myself dating of most nicest people In the world she so pure and innocent that I feel like she an angel or something and  we live together and she tells me she loves me and I say it a back but it doesn't mean anything to me. Now yes I would protect her because she is mine, but I still don't feel anything when she says I love and I say it back, but I don't know why she into me I have completely been honest with how I view people but she just says she wants to be together forever with me and she says that she  doesn't care, please understand i don't feel human, more like a monster i never let go of any slights of people who have wrong me, I may smile a pretend like everything is fine but I will literally wait 10 years if I have to get back at people, I feel nothing for my family the only person in the world that I want to be happy is this girl and no matter what I say to her she won't change her mind about me she proposed to me and I don't no how answer

I am sorry if this seems dumb but I have hurt her in the past and i just don't want her with me when I feel like all I can bring her is misery and pain"

719,Burden of Sexual Desire,I am struggling to deal with the burden of sexual desire.
720,Realising I'm Emotionally Dependant to an Extremely Destructive level,"This is a burner account because I just feel so hopeless.  
I pushed away so many people without even meaning to over the past few years, just being too much wanting too much, possessiveness, jealousy. I dont even know who I am and I hate that. I dont even know what I'm doing. how am i supposed to give myself a direction, how am i supposed to heal the damage I've done.   
I'm just tired. not suicidal just tired, tired of feeling empty, tired of hurting people."
721,I had enough,"The last week all I did was took pills, drink and cut myself. All if this just so i won't kill myself. I'm disgusted and afraid of myself. And i'm so tired. I'm tired of constantly fighting with my brain and loosing. I 'm tired of always being alert and afraid, terrifyed what might happen if i loose control. I don't really want to die, i just don't want to exist like this. I wish i believed in heaven or reincarnation or whatever, then ji wouldn't be so afraid to die."
722,I can't even cut myself properly anymore,"I've been cutting myself for a bit now and I fucking hate it, but now when i do it (with scissors)  nothing happens apart from a few red marks. The fact that I know I cant do anything is already hard enough, now I cant even do something as simple as this."
723,How do you deal with the death of someone close to you?,"Last Friday my grandma died from coronavirus. It happened so fast that it still didn't really truly sink in. She was the closest thing to a mother for me, and one of 2 people, her and my dad, whom I considered close family. I moved to another country a few years ago, but I tried my best to stay in touch and take care of her. I would call her on Skype on a weekend and sometimes for hours just listen to her stories while knitting. Or show off a cake I baked, or any small thing. And now I am just not sure what am I supposed to do. Do I tell people around me? If so, then how do I start this interaction? How do I deal with my feelings? Whenever I feel sad, it feels selfish and fake, but if I feel happy, it seem inappropriate. Everything I do and feel seems wrong and hollow. I don't want to inconvenience other people by my grief, so I try to just be normal, act normal, but nothing feels normal, and I just can't find energy to pretend convincingly enough. I never lost anyone before, and I have no idea how to deal with it."

725,help me,
726,Lonely,"I’m so so lonely, I have no friends. I had a falling out with my old group of girlfriends about 4 years ago as I felt I needed to distance myself from them as they were hard partiers and influenced me to do a lot of drugs and drink heavily which wasn’t good for my mental health. Now I have no one to hang out with. I’m in my late 20s and people already have their established friend groups and people just don’t seem willing to meet new people. I ask people to hang out and they don’t reply. I’ve also never had a boyfriend, boys only ever seem to want to have sex with me but don’t actually want to date me. I’ve always had a feeling from a young age I will always be alone and never get married which bring me so much sadness. I’m finding it harder and harder to have hope for the future. I don’t see how my situation will ever improve, I really want to give up. I want to die, what’s the point in living when nothing really brings your happiness anymore?"
727,Workplace,Have you ever experienced mental health issues due to your workplace?
728,Need advice. Feeling discouraged,"So me (F20) and my boyfriend (M23) have been together for at least 2 months now, I use to know him before (we met 3 years ago) but decided then before that it wasn't a good time to for either of us to be in a relationship so we didn't talk for 3 years until recently this summer we had reconnected again and it really hit off once again but this time we decided to pursue each other. We have a really good connection and I really care about him but recently this summer he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder which sent him into a spiral and me not hearing from him for 3 days straight, after that whole ordeal he told me he'd try to be better at communicating and that hearing that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder just made him freak out hence why he disappeared for a bit but it really freaked me out since we are sort of doing a long
distance thing so it wasn't like I was able to check up on him which made it even worse. As of today marks the third day I haven't heard from him again. I feel really anxious and I'm not sure what to do, he won't
answer phone calls or text I literally hear absolutley nothing from him until I'm assuming he feels better enough to text me back. Do I stay and try to be there for him or is someone like this just not ready for a relationship? Also if anyone has better insight about
bipolar disorder could you give me some advice? Thank you.

TL;DR: boyfriend recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, sometimes I do not hear from him from days (not answering calls or text messages) it’s starting to give me lots of anxiety and I need advice."
729,abyss,"I ask my myself almost entirely every day, how to be happy? Sometimes I feel like I cannot live anymore I feel like I cannot breathe that the world is going too fast and my brain is too slow to process anything. I spend time lying on my bed thinking about how life could be about how I could be happy but the thing is I don’t how to feel that I want to get rid of my body sometimes and become someone else because this mind is never positive and it’s making me go crazy because I feel like I cannot hold anymore."
730,I feel lost,"Ever since I was really young, I was often punished for making mistakes e.g. getting hit with a belt when i tore the curtain, getting strangled for accidentally taking something that’s not mine or getting both words and things thrown at me for not performing up to standard. After the age of 9, my parents stopped doing this and instead simply replaced this by showing their disappointment and etc. I’ve been taught from young that mistakes=failure=punishments. However the punishment aspect was lost for a moment making things feel disjointed. As a result, I sought a twisted sense of comfort from self-injury whenever I made a mistake or i did something that can be perceived as a mistake. Up till the age of 17 which is now, I would cut myself, purposely put my arm against the hot iron, hit myself repetitively in the head or punch myself until bruises will form and etc. It’s been getting worse to the point that whenever I feel angry or upset I will just keep punishing myself until I feel like i’ve made up for the mistakes I have made or have yet to make. Furthermore my emotions are incredibly volatile, on some days I’ll be as happy as anyone can be and i’ll feel so free and then in the following moment i’ll feel so upset and irrational and there are days where I have almost jumped off the balcony for no good reason. As I will be sitting for my A-levels next year, I predict that things will only be getting worse from here on and i’m scared. Idk what’s going on anymore I think i’m just rambling. I feel like I need help but I don’t deserve any because my problems definitely do not hold as great of a significance as compared to the problems faced by so many around the world today. Besides that, living in an asian society, mental health is kind of seen as taboo and if I were to ever approach my parents and ask them to let me seek help, they will definitely not allow it and blame it on me not trying hard enough and compare me to the people around me who are able to cope with living. I don’t know what to do anymore, i guess i just want to have control over myself but i can’t seem to have this control"
731,My anxiety and depression problems are getting worse and i don’t know what to do,"So i’m struggling with anxiety disorder and depression issues for roughly 7-8 years. I used to get psychiatric help in the past, but i couldn’t afford the therapy since it wasn’t covered by the insurance and i felt that the meds only helped me hide my negative feelings and also made me gain weight in the process (i also have serious body dysmorphia and body image issues, so that was definitely taking a toll on me), so i stopped taking them. I was doing fairly well before covid too. Getting used to quarantine life wasn’t so hard for me at first either, i’ve never been a social person and even before the lockdowns i was mostly home so i don’t have a lot of problems with that. However i have a long distance relationship, it’s been 8 months since i last saw my boyfriend and i’m not allowed to enter his country (his country also banned unnecessary travels). I miss him a lot but apart from that i feel like we started to have communication issues. I know that his life is undergoing some changes even though im not aware of the details (i only know he’s gonna start a new job, he’s very busy nowadays etc) and he is a reserved person in general and i certainly don’t wanna be a burden. But at the same time all this triggers my anxiety and i often end up crying over the scenarios an possibilities in my head. I don’t wanna tell him that i’m crying though, i’m afraid to be considered dramatic or weird or whatever even though he is actually an understanding person.
Apart from that, crazy things happening all around the world, second wave of covid, terrible economic state of the country i’m living in etc just started to become too much for me. I am pushing myself to have a routine, be somewhat productive and take care of myself as much as i can but it’s getting really hard and i’m losing my motivation. I don’t see a single happy face around me. Normally i’d be happy to help my friends or people around me (actually i cover my anxiety and depression very well, so it is more like ‘high functioning’) but now they just add up, and i don’t think people can see that since they don’t know about the severity of my situation. I’m not seeing anyone and barely go out (only for groceries) for 4 months or so now, all my friends are abroad and i feel so lonely. I don’t wanna cut ties with the existing ones either even though they’re kind of putting their burden on me because they are all i have.
I seriously don’t know how to cope, any help would be much appreciated."
732,What’s been your experience with duloxetine or other SNRIs?,"Hi all! I’ve been on bupropion/Wellbutrin for many years just at baseline. Lately I’ve been struggling with more anxiety/panic, and a new psychiatrist I saw is recommending that I might want to try adding duloxetine or another SNRI in addition. I’m also going to be seeing a new therapist who does more with trauma/EMDR, so I’m hoping that’s effective - but I’m reluctant to try a new med since I’ve had really negative reactions to SSRIs in the past.

Anyone with positive, negative, or neutral experiences? I think I’d like to try just working with therapy first, but I also think sometimes the right meds can help make therapy more effective.

Thanks in advance!"

**I have engaged in frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, and I have a pattern of unstable relationships.**

During my time in elementary school and all the way through high school, I have consistently felt as if my friends and family were going to abandon me. I would always ask them, “you love me, right? Are you going to leave me? How can I make you stay?”. When I began to feel as if my friends would rather not have me around, I would become consumed by the fear of being left behind. My mind would race with thoughts of being left out, even if it was something as simple as one friend staying over at another’s house for a sleepover, or one friend being invited to a stranger’s birthday and me not being able to tag along because I don’t know the other friend.

Currently, my closest friend and roommate, Britanie, is slowly being pushed away by my behavior. I completely understand why a person would want to distance themselves from someone who has explosive outbursts of anger, but I also become extremely distressed when she brings up the possibility of moving out on her own. My outbursts coincide with my own perception of her not caring enough or doing enough for me. One example is food. When we buy groceries, we always purchase enough food for the both of us, and it is a rule that one is not allowed to touch the other’s without permission. I normally eat up all of my food much faster than her, and when I do, I demand that she give me some of hers. She will calmly explain that this food belongs to her and that I shouldn’t have eaten up all of mine. I become extremely angry and question her as to why she would do this to me, and why she doesn’t care enough about me. 

Arguments like this have happened an innumerable amount of times, and after each and every argument, I break down and cry and beg for forgiveness. I then go on to portray the “woe is me” attitude and begin to despise myself.

**I have an unstable identity and a constantly-shifting sense of self.**

I have changed my interests and vocational goals a multitude of times. I remember dedicating myself to musical theory and composition in high school when I joined orchestra. My entire life became music, and I wanted to be a music teacher. However, after months of this, almost instantly, every single piece of love I had for this hobby vanished, and I felt hollow, like nothing could make me happy. The same thing happened with visual art. I joined many art classes in school like sculpture, drawing, and cartooning. I worked my fingers to the bone painting and drawing many things, and I even had applied to Ringling for illustration and game design. Now, I can’t even bring myself to pick up a brush or a pencil and create something. It just bores me now.

The same thing has happened with wanting to be a lawyer, then doctor, then language teacher, then chemist, then medical researcher. I have an outstanding passion for something, and then, almost instantly, I have absolutely no interest in it.

This kind of behavior isn’t limited to vocational aspirations, as I have also experienced a need to constantly change the way I look, talk, and act to fit my own ever-fleeting desires of self image. I have no idea what my actual voice sounds like anymore because I have been trapped in a never-ending cycle of change

Those two are the main one from the DSM-5 that I experience. Other minor, but  still bad ones, are suicidal gestures, feelings of hollowness, dissociation,  splitting, and impulsivity."
735,Something else ive now realized. Share and consider it.,"If you have pyhsical behavior that you act based on your mental health like i do such as constantly talking to yourself, walking back and forth,excessive hair touching and tapping your foot,make sure or at least try to not have anyone see you do it. Those who aren't your relatives or friends can easily mistake you for someone under the influence and can accuse you of being a drug user. Without having to say much i ended up hearing a conversation of two people talking about me thinking i was on something. I was just stressed and anxious about something and without realizing  i think i ended up talking to myself and scratching my arms which to an untrained eye seems like a clear drug addict. I dont do drugs , i drink very little on my days off but nothing excessive. Bummed me out tbh."

738,"I'm a self sabotager, and Im very aware of it! So why do I still do it?","I'm very self aware and honest with my headspace.
Which is why I'm so frustrated that I constantly do stupid shit on purpose to get in my own way!
I feel like if I didn't know this about myself it would be heaps easier to accept it. But I can literally be thinking about this while I'm doing something dumb that I know I'll regret later!

Anyone ever experienced the same and can suggest anywhere to start?"
739,Is there any good way to deal with feeling like you were “meant to be somewhere else?”,"This is actually really hard for me to talk about (which is why I’m on a side account, sorry!) because I feel like I’m being too edgy and get embarrassed when I admit it, but I’ve always struggled with this feeling that I wasn’t meant to be here.

I remember even feeling like this when I was really young, and I latched onto fantasy creatures as a kid as a way to explain why I felt so displaced. At one point sometime when I was 7 or so I think I legitimately believed I must have been an alien, and I went through this phase where I kept asking my mom if she had adopted me from aliens. That lasted longer than I’m willing to admit lol

Now that I’m older I obviously don’t think I’m an alien, but the feeling still bothers me. Just kind a never-ending yearning for ‘something else’ that’s always in the background. 

Does anyone else feel this way, and how do you deal with it? It’s not like I’m lonely. I *do* struggle to make friends (I’ve been told I come off as weird and blunt) but the ones I do have a cherish and I have no shortage of hobbies. I’m just kind of stuck with this feeling it seems no matter what I do."
740,Brain Can't React Properly To Good Thing,I recently fixed something that has been a problem since I was 14. Most people in my situation pretty much stay the way I was their entire lives but it made me greatly unhappy. It contributed a lot to my depression and was probably the main cause since I felt so inferior to others. It took years to fix and sometimes my progress meant nothing to me and other times it meant everything.  I feel like my brain grew and developed around the depressed chemical levels and my brain structure reflects that. I keep on naturally trying to think of ways over and over again in which I actually failed when I know I didn't. It's like my brain recognizes it as too good to be true. I still can't believe it actually happened.

Sometimes I feel i have to obey and believe whatever other people tell me. I believe this comes from childhood experiences where my father would threaten me with violence if i did not listen and drained my self confidence and self preservation. All help and experiences welcomed. Thank u"
747,I'm stuck.,"My family doesn't believe in mental illnesses. I keep trying to ask them for help, but they just don't believe in therapy. They say there's nothing wrong with me, nothing at all, when it's not their goddamn call to make.

I experience moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or ADHD/ADD at every given moment. Either I feel utterly desolate or restless or bored as all hell or worried to death over nothing at all. It's midterm season and I can't focus - I have my textbooks in front of me but I get distracted easily and the next thing I know, the day's over and it's 11 PM and I have to sleep.

My mother told me to read some books, for ""positive thinking"". Then she told me I looked utterly normal, there was nothing wrong with me, that she'd called a psychiatrist (yes, she did, only after I'd pleaded for it for weeks while having a mental breakdown every night) and told them I was a teenager who had mood swings which made them just disregard me.

My dad doesn't even give a shit anymore, but the last time he did, he just told me to ""think happy thoughts"". That's all he gave me. He told me he didn't believe in therapy or medication for mental illnesses. ""Think happy thoughts.""

I just want to have someone to talk to without feeling like a burden. Someone who understands, and doesn't just go ""that's tough, buddy"" or nod without really getting it. I want to know what's wrong with me, if there's a reason I'm as dysfunctional as I am that I failed my math midterm to day. I want to get help, actual help, before I fuck up and do something I regret.

But as a 16 year-old in an Asian country, there's nothing I can do except talk to school counselors - who... are useless - and my homeroom, who's my only source of unbiased support but who I don't want to bother and burden, because he's busy too.

751,How do I get rid of Super Curiosity Syndrome?,"I am a college student majoring in BE Information Technology. I suffer(suffering of a type for me) from Super curiosity syndrome (as I call it) where I cannot focus on a single material of study. I have a lot of fields of interests in computer science like web dev,game dev, cybersecurity etc and the problem is that I cannot focus on any one of them. Even I cannot focus on any subject while studying. For example if I study a single subject in computer science I suddenly get idea that I should study another one as I find it fascinating. Even sometime I study history, physics, maths or anything but in long term I am not able to focus on any one of them just out of pure curiosity because I find others interesting.

754,Dating during mental health crisis..,"I honestly was doing really well in life, therapy was a thing I hadn’t done in a couple of years. I felt more in control of life’s ups and downs. 

I found love. He has his own mental health issues but doesn’t seek help, and that’s his choice honestly.

Fast forward. I put myself in a bad predicament and agreed to sex when i didn’t want to one day. Often i felt his insecurities coming to the surface if i refused affection and i didn’t want him to think i didn’t love him. I’ve been dealing with overcoming that feeling of not loving myself enough. In that time we also found out I’m pregnant. Naturally my anxiety is heightened because of it. I decided to take some space away from him because i felt i had so much on my plate. I was falling into a depressive episode.

I’ve since started seeing my therapist again and I’m trying to make things more manageable and be there for my partner more. The bad part is in this space he hasn’t been ok with it, everyday I’m reminded of how sad he is and how what I’m doing is hurting him. At this point I’d rather break up then him continue to tell me how much he is hurting in hopes that i will just fix myself. 

How am i supposed to date and have boundaries when i struggle with my mental health? Is it even possible :("
755,Anyone else experiences random manic episodes?,"Note: I'm not clinically diagnosed, I may be using the term manic wrong, please correct me if so! This isn't a triggering post, just a thought I wanted to share and see if anyone else experiences this too.

Topic: mental health, anxiety, careers, finance

There are days in which I tend to set ""over-achieving"" goals for myself. If I see something that sparks my interest, I immediately think of ideas I could implement in it and I create scenarios in my head in which leads me to have upbeat, joyful energy throughout the days. At this point, I feel like I'm on top of a mountain with a cape and my arms tucked, ready for liftoff. I feel an immense amount of energy, a go-getter like I can do anything I want. \*These ideas that pop in my head are often career-related, starting my own business, investing, etc.\* This leads me to have days where I would be glued to the computer, learning everything I can about it only to abandon it the next few days because I start to feel the hopelessness of what I want. Or I find something else that sparks my interest, I abandon my old ideas and I pursue this new interest that just popped it, then I feel hopeless again. An ordinary person may think ""oh they're just exploring their interest! nothing wrong with that!"" to me, It's really tiring and I don't know if this is manic, bipolar, heck, i don't know if this is even mental health-related because it is mentally exhausting. I do suffer from anxiety almost daily and these racing manic (or not idk) really put me in a crippling anxiety mode where I question my ability to succeed financially. 

Anyone else experiences this?"
756,Could these be signs of some mental health issue? in need of advice.,"tw// mentions of self harm and suicidal thoughts

this is a throwaway, also on mobile. i am not sure where to start but one of my friends got worried i might be bipolar and i wanted to come here to ask if any of you have had any similar experiences, have any advice or if i am just over thinking and it's just mood swings and nothing more. 


so around 2 years ago i started to have a really bad depression and anxiety. i stopped getting out of bed at mornings and stopped taking showers. at some point i started to self harm and started to have suicidal thoughts but fortunatly i never acted out on those thoughts. i never got professional help or reached out to someone in real life but i found some good friends online. 

than around the start of this year, i started to get better. i still felt pretty sad but started to have a lot more energy and motivation to do art. i started doing better in school aswell. everything went pretty smoothly imo until the middle of this summer.

i slowly started to feel more and more depressed and went into the same rut of depression i was in couple years back. than the end of august/start of september was the worst. i went back into self harming and having suicidal thoughts. i had a serious conversation with one of my family members around the end of september after having a mental breakdown but we never discussed about getting professional help. 

a week or so after that conversation with a family member i got very hyped. there wasn't any particular reason i just started to feel very excited and full of life. i'd pace back and forth in my room without any good reason and i felt like i was on top of the world and i wanted to try out bunch of new things ive never tried out before. i had a lot of racing thoughts and i also started a bunch of art projects (some that i never got to finish) and i remember painting 3 different realistic paintings in under a week. at some point i didn't sleep for a day straight and kept drawing. i pulled a bunch of all nighters without any caffeine. id send a lot of stupid stuff and ideas to my friends and i also felt invincible like i could do anything and not get hurt. i felt so for around a month and a half I'd say. one of my family members noticed how i was very energetic but didn't think much of it (i also spent most of my time in my room.) 

after that i slowly started to feel terrible again. at the moment i feel pretty easily irritatable and i feel like i still have a lot of physical energy but i don't have any motivation for my hobbies or art anymore. i feel pretty dull and sad most of the time of the day nowadays. I've been starting to do terrible in school again, such as not being able to pay attention in classes or not doing my assignments/homework. 

i feel that if i'd tried to talk about someone on what i feel like i'd not be taken seriously by people for whatever reason. i am underage aswell and can't go to a professional myself. i don't wanna burden people but i don't wanna go back to how i was feeling couple of years ago if that makes sense. i also was abused as a child at some point so that mightve made everything worse. i don't wanna disclose too much private info but i am in my mid teens. any advice would be appreciated!"
757,i dont know any more,there something wrong with me but im telling my self other wise i have no self of steam and im always worried someone gonna hit me for no reason im still thinking of suicide i just wont to talk to someone but im scared of them telling some one or regection.
758,scared that my trauma is shallow and not real,"JUST WANNA VENT!! LONG READ AHEAD 

i dont know what happened in my childhood that made me the way i am today. but i prefer to isolate myself from people and build emotional walls as i feel like such a big burden and annoyance. i always do this. even if people treat me as their friend, i still feel like they're not so i keep a safe distance. all in all, i'm a depressed anxious loner with low self esteem and an inferiority complex.

my mom is nice as she provides the things that we need and does things a kind mother does while my dad was working abroad till now. but growing up, i've always felt like i had no ""saviour"", no one to understand me. 

i swear that my mom is a good mom though i think she was not able to provide the emotional support i needed. i love her but i feel like i have this pent up anger built from years ago because all i wanted was for her to listen to me when im sad and understand me. not correct me and say that i only need jesus :(( 

i tried explaining things to her that i know i was not abused and all like kids out there but i know that my childhood wasnt smooth either. she just tells me that i'm only thinking and making up all the bad things in my mind as i am a negative thinker. 

i remember her getting mad at me whenever i get mistakes. i remember her only noticing my flaws and bad points. i remember her comparing me to better kids my age. i remember her dismissing my negative feelings. 

still, she says that i'm just very pessimistic and im the one who distanced myself away from them ( which is true because the past few years, i felt like they saw me as a bad kid and so i embodied it) 

i know i'm not a perfect daughter and i'm trying my best but it still pains me because i'm damaged. and i'm scared that the cause of my damage is not real."

761,"My journey with mental illnesses, in a book","10 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and 4 years after that, anxiety joined in and all this time I refused to take medication but preferred to self-medicate with opiate painkillers until my body crashed in 2018 and I was hospitalized before starting medication, both SSRIs and beta-blockers. 

Being a writer and graphic designer, I always spoke about mental health whenever I could, and before being hospitalized, I started working on a book in which I illustrated and manifested my personal experience with depression and anxiety using photography, poetry, and haikus.

Thank you for your time."
765,I need help and I don’t know if it’s just me being selfish.,"I (F20) feel like I cannot handle my life at the moment. I go to school full time, and within the last couple months I’ve started to work full time too. Warning, this will be long.

I work from home, and it’s taking a huge toll on me. While I’m super grateful to not have to deal with the general public during a pandemic, I’m still at risk since my younger brother isn’t really cautious, and I know for a fact that where my mother works it is CROWDED, people are sweating, and NOT wearing masks. It makes me not want to be home. I do have a boyfriend, who’s the best guy ever, and we are looking into getting a place together sometime next year, but I’m a bit anxious about it because I would be going from home straight to cohabitating with someone else. It’s not the cohabitation I’m worried about, we actually work really well together and I lived with him for the entirety of the summer and it was a joy. I’m worried that if we ever (I really hope not) break up then I’ll be left to figure out how to be alone for the first time. I’m not going to let that stop me because we are very serious about each other, I’m just a worry wort, OCD and all. 

Another thing is .. there’s a lot of financial strain from me living at home.. I contribute $300 a month towards bills, but I am also kinda the ATM for my family. Anyone need gas? Ask me. Anyone locked themselves outta their car? You know I’ll give it. I’ve given my family so .. much .. money. I am lucky if I can afford to spend $10 a day for myself, and I never get it back, because they can never afford it. My mom is prepping to sell our house, and fixing it up has been pretty pricey. My mother doesn’t want me to move out but I feel like I could actually save more from being away, and they aren’t respectful about me working at home. My mom literally talks on the phone, on speaker phone, in the next room while I’m trying to focus. I’ve asked multiple times for some consideration.. at this point I feel like an asshole for wanting it to be quiet in the house. I wouldn’t have taken this position if they didn’t assure me over and over that it’d be fine. 

It’s making me really nasty and resentful inside. The position I’m working is really new for the company, and I don’t earn my final wage for a couple of weeks, so while I do work full time it’s only for 8$ an hour. So while 300$ a month looks like nothing to most people, it’s a good portion of my check, plus whatever else I have to contribute towards, I’ve had to get office furniture (chairs are not cheap!) and any emergencies. I am poor. It’s stressing me out. I work more than anyone else in my household, have nothing to show for it. I have to keep up with my pets, who I kinda regret getting now, and that makes me feel nasty inside. I’ve had my dog for 9 years and my cat for two, but these days if I hear my dog licking himself or my cat crying I want to crawl in a corner and rock back and forth. They require money, groceries require money (I’m pescatarian in a red meat loving household), groceries with my boyfriend cost money (I don’t have to contribute but id feel very very bad if I didn’t), I feel like I’m hemorrhaging MONEY. My temper has gotten so bad, I have to bite back nasty thoughts and feelings constantly (also weaning myself from a nicotine addiction and that could be contributing), I’ve been feeling suicidal, not understanding the point to life if I will always be drowning trying to catch up, I don’t want to do anything but there’s always something to do. I didn’t even touch on school but .. 

Am I just selfish? I should be grateful  I have multiple places to go, but I feel .. disconnected and sad a lot of the time. I’ve gotten insurance with the new job but it doesn’t kick in til next year so I can’t talk to anyone, and I don’t really feel comfortable opening up to friends or family, I feel burdensome. My family is a bit dysfunctional, we don’t really deal with feelings. I feel like a function for my family rather than a person, and with my partner i see him dealing with the stresses of life and feel guilty for having my own to add so I am reluctant to talk. I love my friends but they aren’t therapists and I don’t want to lean too much. I feel alone. Sometimes I don’t want to be here anymore."
766,Should i stay at university or go home," I flew halfway across the country in september for university. I had the best last two months, barely got home sick. I met this girl who is basicalg me in another body and we become bestfriends so fast
We decided to move into a dorm together so i put in a residence transfer application. 
Just this weekend i started feeling home sick, then everything in my head changed. I dont know why but now everything my bestfriend says annoys me. Like i just wanna go home. My familys gunna be so dissopointed in me, even though well be saving money, they are all very comservative and proud people. 
Its just like i ginxed myself and cant change my mind now. Now all ive been thinking about is home and getting out of this dorm agreement with the girl.

One of my source of stress is my family. I'm the only in our family one who has a stable job and I am quite pressured and stressed at the same time that I need to work hard for my family. I feel burdened. Am I selfish for wanting my parents to still work?

With regards to my friends, I don't know whom I can vent to. I don't know who has a stable mental health to share this burden with.

768,Do I go to primary care doctor or psychiatrist for antidepressants?,I've been going to therapy and my therapist suggested that medication might help rewire my brain since I go through loops of depression and anxiety. This is my first time seeking help and wanted to know if it would be better for my to see a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist?
769,I called my friend out for her bullshit,"I was on a discord call with a group of 3 and we weren't talking at all, just doing our own thing. and she came and joined and said hi so I replied and said hi back. she said nothing for a solid 5 minutes and then she yelled ""you guys are bad friends"" before leaving the call. so I did what any impulsive guy whose sick of people's shit would do and I messaged her going ""hi we did acknowledge you in the chat sorry if you missed it but calling us bad people is immature and not it because it's more or less emotional manipulation"" and this motherfucker was like ""no I was joking haha"" then changed her story and went ""I heard my mum swear so I left abruptly"" and then went ""it wasn't directed at you"" so she 100% was lying to us and this fucker tried to turn everything onto me and how I was being the asshole when she deadass was like ""no y'all are horrible"" and then she messaged my other friend and was like ""he hates me now and he thinks I'm a horrible person"" when I literally said to her that I'm not mad at her and that I just wanted her to think before she spoke and this bitch just decided to turn everything onto me about how I'm awful and shit when she blatantly lied to my face about it. she's done stuff like this before but it's the first time someone other than me was there to witness it and oh boy I'm so fucking sick of people trying to manipulate me into thinking that I have to pity her or whatever the fuck."
770,Is there a good channel to watch election coverage without all the hype?,"Obviously as an American im extremely anxious about the election. I want to watch the coverage tonight but it seems like all the major news channels hype it up so much like its a bug sports game or something and they make it way more stressful.

Is there a network that covers it and shows results roll in without all the hype?"
771,"I’m going to give myself amnesia, if that doesn’t work. I’m ending it","I’m done.  It’s been months of switching meds over and over again, I’ve seen multiple fucking therapists,  and I’m only getting worse.  I’m fucking done.  And my psychiatrist refuses to answer calls or respond even on his urgent line.  What a sack of shit"
772,Severe anxiety and distorted thoughts about a relationship with a girl. Feeling like I'm going to go insane. Please Help.,"I posted here a week ago asking if anyone else out there had distorted thoughts about relationships with any girl who shows them friendliness or kindness. 

Right now, a girl I've been talking to online got into a relationship with someone else. My head was filling up with distorted thoughts about her already (getting sad if she didn't reply, thinking I'm worthless etc), now that this happened, a billion explosions went off in my head. 

It's quite difficult to write down in words the sort of feelings and sensations that are incinerating me from the inside. I feel like I've been **betrayed by a person I'm very close to, I feel like I'm worthless. Anxiety pangs and spasms are raging inside my body, my stomach, chest, hands and head. I feel like someone splashed acid upon the fabric of my being.** 

**But I objectively know she isn't someone close to me.** I know we only talk online. I know I have no right to become jealous if she dates someone else. **I know it's stupid and laughably absurd to feel what I'm feeling.** 

**But my brain is distorting everything out of proportion anyway.** It's been a while since my mental health was this bad. I think I'm going to go insane. CBT isn't helping that much. The torment is too much. Please help. I want to feel just a bit better again."
773,My life went to shit the other day and I feel nothing.,"All in a 48 hour period my relationship ended after two years, I lost my job from Covid, and I hit a dear and totaled my car. I won’t be able to get a loan with no income for a new car, I’m gonna have no income until I find a new job and I broke up with the person I was closest to and was my main support. But for some reason I have no reaction at all and it scares me. Could I still be in a form of shock?"
774,Alternatives to therapists,"I can't trust or confide in a therapist. I can't connect with them, I can't trust them enough to explain what's really going on with me. I've been to several therapists and got nothing out of it because I couldn't get myself to be honest with them. I don't know how to or even if I would want to. 

I understand that they're professionals and want to help. I understand they may have a different perspective or something of value to teach to help me deal with my shit. But I just can't do it. 

How can I fix myself without a therapist?"
775,Can I request an MRI due to dissociation?,"Trigger warning: Self harm

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, if it's not please feel free to point me in the correct direction.

I've been struggling with mental issues for a years. But specially dissociation and self harm. But I've mostly had it under control for a while. Three weeks ago I had an encounter with an abuser over a call.

The encounter triggered extreme dissociation. I ended up cutting my arm open with a steak knife. I barely remember anything. I remember my hands covered in blood. Then, being in a car with my friend repeatedly telling me to stay awake. I remember the nurse, asking me with what I cut myself. I remember thinking, ""What? I cut myself?""I tried answering her but I couldn't speak. I remember feeling something stinging my arm (perhaps the nurse giving me stitches?). My memory is more solid when I was sitting in the reception, with a plaster on my arm. How did I get there? My friends took me to the ER after hearing me scream. 

This was by far my worst episode ever. Now I'm struggling with my memory a lot. I'm also disoriented quite easily. I've lost my cellphone, wallet and keys all in one week. By lost I mean, I literally have no idea where I've put them and I had to get a new cellphone and a new bank card ect. I'll end up going to the store and then, upon arriving, I 'll completely forget why I went there in the first place. I'll take my medication, but then I'll forget that I took them. One time I took too much and I don't remember anything of the sort. I always feel like I'm forgetting something. My therapist told me that it's stress induced, that I just need to be patient and that I'll recover.

But it's been three weeks, and even though I'm not depressed about my episode anymore, I still have these memories/cognitive issues. It really bothers me. Can dissociation or an episode like that cause neurological damage in some way? Can I request a MRI scan?

Not sure if it's relevant, but when I was in high school and early twenties (I'm mid-twenties now) I used to bang my head really hard as a method of self harm (quite frequently). What's the chances that I sustained some sort of damage to my brain?"
776,Having trouble slowing down and taking time off work. Today I ignored a call and nearly ended up panicking.,"I haven't worked in over a month. This kind of dry spell with my job is normal this time of year before the Christmas rush. I'm a casual who's on call. Today I ignored a call from work. I saw it and chose not to answer. I listened to the voicemail and it was for only 3 hours of work so I felt OK justifying it. But as soon as I did my hands started shaking and I started hyper ventilating.

I really enjoy my job but have also found that I needed the break of the last month. Im terrified of being perceived as lazy so I make sure I am constantly working or doing chores or projects. As much as Ive worked to change my mindset, I still believe, deep down, that my time is worth less than others and unless I spend it doing something productive for other people. I see my peers say no to shifts and overtime all the time. But when I do it I end up panicking and getting a headache or even a migraine.

Ive been putting off getting my blood work done so to avoid completely breaking down and quickly got dressed and went to the clinic instead of staying in. My head is killing me but at least I can pretend I ignored work for other plans."
777,I’m worried about my mental health,"A little back story, 
I (28F) believe I’ve struggle with anxiety my entire life, but as an adult I’m starting to realize there might be something wrong. 
Raised by a single mother left me alone a lot of the times with my sister. As a child I was molested by different people. I became sexually active at 13. 

The first time i heard the words your having anxiety was from a doctor. I was having an unrelated visit and I kept asking her questions, and i don’t know what she picked up that she said “your having anxiety, you need to breath through a paper bag” I didn’t take her serious because I didn’t know what she was talking about. I never used a stupid paper bag. 

Anyway, marriage and 3 kids later I’m finding myself dissociating quite often. I’m trying to get to know myself and listen to my body. I’ve come to realize that I disassociate after having panic attacks. I feel like i need to be able to have some type of control to be able to feel ok. That’s been a problem and I’ve worked on that. Besides that’s and a lot of anxiety I’ve always been a shy person. 

What’s been happening lately have me worried and thinking a lot. I’ve been hearing a couple of voices here and there... sometimes it says my name or recently i heard “Camila” In a men’s voice I’ve never heard. I don’t know anyone by that name. it seems like someone else’s thoughts are in my head. So i think that’s odd. There have been a few nights where I feel like my mind is completely awake! Thinking but not my thoughts? 
Yesterday I was feeling very tired. My youngest is 5 months old and there’s no way I’m taking a nap. All of the sudden I feel what it seems like my head is being filled with air, very light, like some sort of high. (I don’t take meds I just drink coffee  and the occasional beer and marijuana in the past but it’s been years.) I
Didn’t think much of it and went to bed. As I lay there, my body doesn’t seem like its my mine. I’m starting to get scared because I’m thinking is this real? Or am I dead? What if I’m about to die? I really wanted to curl up and cry but I didn’t want to scare my kids. Again, my mind felt like it was awake all night. 
I have a doctors appointment coming up on the 23rd, but I figure I ask if anyone is or had gone through something similar? I feel like I’m loosing it sometimes."
778,Have I developed PTSD? Or is it just anxiety?,"About a year ago my mom received a phone call from her stepmother informing her that her father had a glioblastoma and only had 3 months to live. I was in my room taking a nap and the way she came into my room to tell me is something I'll never forget

Her footsteps could be heard before she even reached my room, which means I was woken up and was on high alert wondering what was going on

When she walked in, her entire body was the color red. Face, arms, chest, everything. Her eyes were swollen and had a steady stream of tears pouring out of them. Her entire body shook in a way you'd only ever see in cartoons. Her hands covered her mouth while she paced the room hysterically screaming and hyperventilating. When she tried to speak nothing would come out. I had never seen her like that before nor have I ever heard a human being make the sounds she did, so at that point I was shaking and on the verge of tears, bc I didn't know what was going on. I tried my best to calm her down and after about 10 minutes she was able to (barely) tell me what was wrong

Ever since then being in my room has been a fucking nightmare. I spend every waking minute worrying if today is the day I'm going to see her like that again. It fucked me inside, especially mentally and I've never recovered from it. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. Losing my grandfather is what you think would have effected my mental health the most, but no, it's my moms reaction and the state she was in. I can't get it out of my head. Her face, her screams, her tears, her body, the color of her skin, the way her mouth opened and nothing came out when she tried to speak. I relive that moment every single day and I don't know how much more I can take before I lose it. It's too surreal to handle

I'm scared to sleep, bc that's what I was doing before she came into my room. I'm afraid of being woken up like that again. I haven't gotten a good night's rest, since that day, bc I'm so overwhelmed with fear

I have constant nightmares about that day. I've woken up a few times in tears or with my bedsheets soaked with my sweat

At first it was just the memories, sleep deprivation and nightmares that ate me up, but then I developed something else

Any time I hear someone walk by my room I panic. Not like a ""oh, shit!"" panic. My chest tightens, I feel like I can't breathe, the world around me feels like it's slown down, my body shakes, my hearing intensifies, bc I'm so hyper focused on where the footsteps are going and the urge to cry or run overwhelms me, bc I'm deathly afraid she's going to walk into my room at any second in the same state she was in a year ago

When someone actually walks into my room, which is usually my mom, I try my best not to lose it, bc I don't want her worrying about me. I fight my emotions as best as I can, but I can never stop my heart from dropping into my stomach when she walks in. Even when I can tell she's okay, everything just stops, like my entire world is crashing down around me. Sometimes I find myself holding my breath or fighting the urge to vomit while she's talking 

When she leaves tears immediately pour out of my eyes that eventually turns into me silently screaming until my chest feels like it's going to burst

I don't panic or have these reactions anywhere else, but my room. My room is the only trigger to these emotions. The memories? Those occur anywhere I happen to be at. My mom isn't a trigger unless she walks into my room. My nightmares are at their highest in my room and I can usually get a decent amount of sleep when I'm not in my room. Basically, I'm fine as long as I'm not in my room. My room is what sets everything into motion. The anxiety, the depression, the paranoia 

I want to get as far away from that room as possible. Being in there is a living nightmare. I'm all fucked up, bc of it

Is what I'm experiencing anxiety/panic attacks? Is there any way I've developed ptsd? If not, is there a word for what I'm going through?"

780,Antidepressant or Tolkien Character?,[https://diasp.org/camo/a8836a87201ce89e7d0b78edcafbcccf65d66d45/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f387362637543682e706e67](https://diasp.org/camo/a8836a87201ce89e7d0b78edcafbcccf65d66d45/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f387362637543682e706e67)
781,Sensory overload?,"I first noticed it when I worked at a doggy daycare where we had them inside. This one dog consistently barked and nothing I did ever stopped her. It got to be so much that I broke down and started crying. Next instance I was severely overwhelmed at my old job at another animal place working the late shift running dogs back and forth to be picked up/stay the night (boarding) or whatever else and broke down again. Now at this job, I can’t handle my boss talking to me. He never shuts up. I’m a very social person, but lately I can not be in a conversation. He comments on everything I do (in a joking manner) and I’m general just doesn’t leave me alone and I can feel the rage just building up inside of me every time he opens his mouth. He’s never mean, he just has to constantly be talking and I can’t take that anymore. I don’t know if it’s what I titled it or if I’m just overwhelmed in general, but I can’t stand anyone talking to me anymore. It immediately puts me in a terrible mood and I give half assed responses all the time."
782,i’m probably gonna do it,"i got a plan and everything, i got nothing to live for. there’s no point in living i just drag others down"
783,does anyone else in this sub have a social worker?,i just wanna know if having one is common or if it’s not common
784,I'm doing a survey for an independent study on teen mental health. Can I get a few people to fill the form out and spread the word? Thanks. (Survey is in the description),https://forms.gle/SqBJXoz9R66WaywR7
785,I want to help myself and others,"I have been to a psychologist about 4 years ago because my parents were forced to take me there or else they would loose me, but I didnt go for a very long time and I didnt feel any better from that. At the moment I cant go to therapy and help myself since Im not 18 and my mother doesnt let me go, so I decided to make a discord server that people who are in my situation could use to get closure and support untill theyre able to go to therapy. If you have any questions, feel free to message and I hope things will be better soon ^^"
786,Now its just a waiting game,"I finally have an appointment for a psychiatric evaluation and counseling! Hooray. The counseling intake appointment is next week, and the psychiatric is two weeks out. I would prefer to know what I need counseling for first, but, as long as it happens eventually, it will work out. 

I need help hanging in there when I feel at my wits end as it is. I have known I was mentally unwell since I was 8 years old. I am 30 now, FTM and been on HRT for over 18 months. Well aware the hormonal fluctuations are part of the terrain now. If anything, I feel more stable from feeling much less violent. I am still angry and depressed, but, the violent fantasies are pretty much gone, thank god.

I quit a job for the first time in my adult life before having something else lined up. I can barely walk from the fatigue from the job, I was doing 60 hours over 4 days, with scoliosis and flat feet. I have a doctors appointment next week for physical therapy. I usually hike or walk to cope, and I can't even do that.

I tried looking into animal shelter volunteering to keep myself busy, but Covid has put a hold on accepting new volunteers. I am in the States, in AZ, so its awful here. 

I feel safe in my house but its just roommates here. My partner is doing his best to be there for me. My mom is checking in on me daily. We have a plan to go up north this weekend to a retreat center she frequents. I reached out to a couple friends, phone only contact. 

I guess I need a safe place to vent and chat and perhaps get some ideas on what other things can get me busy, when my depression keeps me from wanting to enjoy the things I usually do (art, music, writing, reading). I hyperfixate and try to turn those things into ways I can feel connected to other ppl, and not with myself first.  I grasp so tight it slips through, and just end up focusing on media to distract myself from my feelings. My anxiety has been so bad i can barely drive, and i just want to sleep all day. 

 There is only so much help deep breathing can do. I guess I am upset that because my breakdown isn't ""on fire"", that I have to wait. Just here with my hazards on... I don't know how to ask for help or really what I am even looking for here. Help me hang in there, please."
787,Help I think I'm hallucinating memories?!??,"For some reason I remember things that never happened to me.
I remember things but they never happened, I'm afraid I might be crazy.
For example some guy once talked about anorexia and a memory crossed my mind about not eating anything but 2 Apples for 3 days and vomiting right after I ate a real meal, problem is it never happened, but I remember it every single part of it, I remember how I felt when vomited and how it looked and everything, like every other memory.
How can I know if memories are real?
I'm not sure if I have more like this and that's what scares me the most that some memories I have are completely fake but I think are real, and I have no way to validate it."
788,"This isn't really much of a vent or that important, I would just like to ask about it","IDK how to explain it it's odd. Like I love videogames I've played them all my life, but recently I just can't play game and it's not because I'm bored of them it feels more like an anxiety to play them. If I launch a brand new game I'll play it until I stop and I cannot launch the game again it fills be with anxiety and discomfort (There are 2 games that don't have this effect but I've played those game so much I don't enjoy them anymore.) And when I decided to take a break from gaming I felt even worse (Like more depressed) and I just go back to videogames only to not enjoy it, and i'm just wondering why. It might be because I'm afraid to launch those games because I'll lose progress but this happens with any game I play and one of those games that don't cause these feelings is Rocket League which I only play competitive which I've deranked so many times so I just don't understand. (If there is incorrect spelling or grammar Im sorry :)"
789,Hate myself for wanting the attention too,"All I have are reddit, memes and Minecraft. I get depressed all the fucking time, others I'm just empty for no goddamn reason, maybe cause I'm alone, no one freaking cares about me and it just makes me feel like I'm not worth a thought, everyone knows I'm going through some major shit but no one fucking cares how I do it as long as I ""make it"". I hate everyone around me. Yes I'm not all pretty and perfect but goddammit I just want a hi and feel like I matter and an actual conversation, nothing forced. Just a reason to be happy to get out of bed.
I wanna cry and I hate myself more for being this weak. I don't want to care about anything anymore, I want to embrace the void and get used to it so nothing ever gets to me again.

 Karen says she ain't having a nice day and boom!! Her dm gets flooded with ass kissers and I know that cause Karen is such a show off,she posts the replies she gets too, but a picture of myself tearing up and depression quotes no one gives a shit. Fucking stuck up pretty karen!!
Stupid friends, telling me they'd always be here but no one fucking replies my texts and I come off too needy screw you guys. Yes, I want and hate the attention, yes, I'm clingy asf cause I can't be alone in my fucked up head. If you wanna go then fine, but never make promises you can't keep you POS but then you see cuts on my arm and get all sympathetic... I don't need your fucking sympathy...what is wrong with you guys???


I am so pissed;sorry about the swearing"
790,Please tell me what to do. (Trigger Warning),"So I've never been good with asking for things and confrontational situations but I need help. I've been struggling w/ self mutilation and I have walked around the house with my scars showing, my sister knows I do it so I'm sure she told my mom. My mom knows I struggle with things and she's been trying to find me a therapist but she hasn't actually been TRYING. It hurts me that she hasn't been taking my mental health seriously because that's all I ever ask for (I'm only a tween) but I'm pretty mature for my age and people will always underestimate me. I also understand her side because she is struggling with things right now and she is a single mom, but I*sn't a mother at least supposed to consider her Childs happiness? I'm thinking about showing her the rest of my scars to maybe show her  the full picture and motivate her to help me. I keep getting in a mindset that they are just okay with me hurting myself but I also know that they don't know everything. Please tell me what you think I should do? Also sorry for typing your ear off I guess. (Plus I couldn't the italics to turn off so yeah.)*"
791,Can Abilify cause RLS?,"I. Can. Not. Stop. Moving. My. Legs.

And I'm still depressed"
792,I'm ill and I hate it!,"My entire sense of identity has been bamboozled because my anxiety has decided to rear its ugly head. As a result I'm questioning everything about myself: my identity, my worth, my life choices, my abilities, my ambitions, my relationships. Its not me, but right now I don't recognise myself. 

I'm able to take basic care of myself but the thing is I feel like a corpse. And old coping habits are becoming more and more tempting each day. Smoking, drinking, cutting, all the things I used to do years ago that I thought I'd gotten past. I haven't done any of it, in fairness, but it feels awful to feel like I've lost all that progress I made and I've dropped right back to where I was a few years ago.

I'm ill, I need to accept it. But I'm just having trouble accepting it. I need to surround myself with nice things and not worry about the future. Most of all I just want to sleep. I don't want to keep crying and worrying and hating myself and being tempted to do things I'll regret."

794,University causes my 'depression',"As per the title, I am quite certain that the cause of all of my mental instability is university, but I haven't really been diagnosed with clinical depression. I also don't think I truly have depression and I feel much better when I am not in school, but I am a bit confused about my mental health and if there is even a solution to my problems. I would really appreciate it if someone has any advice for me :) 

I have always hated university, and I hate most of the courses I have ever taken in my entire university. I hate the process of sitting and listening to a lecture for 75 minutes and I lose focus very easily. However, in high school I had great focus and loved school and didn't struggle with studying like I do now because I was interested in my coursework. Since online school started, I cry every time I even think of sitting at my desk and doing work. My grades have been dropping 20% lower than what I normally get on a regular term. I have always cried over school and how I did not want to study, but this term it's getting out of control. My grades dropping discourages me even more from studying because even when I prepare decently well I have started to blank out on the tests. 

Now when I forget about school and take a break to read books or watch TV I usually don't feel suicidal, but when I think about school I get violent intrusive thoughts of TW: &gt;!wanting to cut myself or hang myself etc. !&lt;

I can't understand if I am just being overdramatic in my hate for school, or if my mental health is actually deteriorating. I am losing hope in the future ever getting better and I don't see a reason to live. Deep down, I feel like I just need to get through school for things to get better, but that seems so difficult for me right now. Dropping out or taking a break is not an option for me because I want to hurry up and finish school with my friends, I know that re-doing the term all alone will make me even more unstable. Also, I know that I do like electrical engineering based on my internship experience, so I just need to get through school, which forces me to take many courses which I have zero interest in. Thank you for listening. 

TLDR: I hate school and studying for courses that I hate. When I think of studying, I get violent intrusive thoughts, but when I take a break from school I don't get these as much. Any solutions?"
795,"What does it mean when someone calls you a ""dead kid""?",It really bothers me but I'm ashamed to ask them. Is that a sign of something bad in me that I'm not aware of? Is it because I look and feel empty? Is it that I look depressed?
796,"Maybe it's not even ocd, but my self-doubt?","A month ago my brain started thinking that everyone hates me, including my best friend. I told my best friend about it, of course she said that it's not true, but i can't stop thinking about it and it always ruins my day, cuz my mind trying to remember every quarrel or shit which she or i did. IT'S JUST DEFINITELY TRYING TO EMBROIL US. These thoughts gives me a lot of anxiety, stress and anger on my friend and i always trying to shift the blame during this condition, but then when it calms down i feel akward and shame in front of her, because i can hardly understand why i was acting like that.
 Maybe i'm just afraid of losing her.. because she's my only friend. 
What kind of ocd is that and how can i start beating it? Maybe it's not even ocd, but my self-doubt. 

I already have hocd, but i think i almost get rid of it."
797,Need help ASAP!? Should I be scared to tell my therapist about this part of my past?,"So, I met with my therapist for the first time today. I technically met with him months ago, but I wanted to try to find a new therapist closer to the college I am moving to, so I stopped seeing him after one session. I didnt find anyone, so I got back in contact with him. 

I am going to link my posts at the bottom (or you can go to my profile and see my posts). I do really like him, and he immediately gave me some solutions to work on for my anxiety and depression (meditation, breathing, fixing my sleep schedule, building tiny habits, etc). I am just concerned about what he will think/say if I tell him about my past. 

Most (if not all) of the people who have responded to MY posts have said I am overreacting and that I need to let this past go. But after scouring the internet (which I now know does more harm than good), I have seen people who despise and think that people with my past should be judged very harshly. I even saw one comment that something along the lines of ""your therapist is probably saying that, just so he can keep lining his pockets"", when the op said his therapist didn't think it was a big deal. I am really scared of this, as well as him just outright calling me something I know I am not.

So my questions are:

1. **Should I be scared to tell my therapist about this past?** I really want to work on it, and I have been obsessing over it for more than a month. I used to think about it all day, but it has gotten a little better. I told him that I am struggling with something, but did not go into detail. It is affecting my life alot, as well as my grades, relationships, and health.

2. **Is it okay to bring this up on only the 2nd meeting?** I NEED to get over this, but I dont want him to get uncomfortable or think badly of me because this is only a small part of who I am (but it would be one of the small list of things he knows about me).

3. **Is it weird if I email him and try to get another meeting this week to talk about this?** I asked him If it was okay to meet up twice a week, and he said absolutely. But I told him I would think about it, and make the decision when we meet next week. I really feel like I need to work on this asap.

4. I dont think I can say it outloud to a stranger, without possibly breaking down and crying. **So would it be weird to write down my story and/or link my reddit posts so that he can read about it? Instead of me having to mention it outloud?** That way I could actually explain myself, and what made me get to that point, without leaving anything out. 

I am sorry for such a long post, I hope I made it easier to answer by separating the question into 4 parts. Thank you to anyone who answers. Here are the posts, and my other account I used to ask more questions. I know it is a crazy amount of posts, sorry. This is why I want to get better, because I can tell that this is not healthy and that I am filled with an unhealthy amount of self-hatred and obsession about others opinions.

798,"Multiple thoughts happening in my head at once, making it difficult for me to think straight","I am able to think about simple things just fine but when I am having some things on my mind that I am trying to decide on then it feels like there are multiple people talking in my head at once, some (only a few) aren’t even talking about something even remotely related to what i am trying to think about. what does this mean and how can i fix it?"
799,My neighbor talks shit about me for being a loner and it fucks me up,"Im the ultimate Loner and prolly even schizoid. I work from home and I study at home since the beginning of the year because of Covid. I rarely go out (except for working out, groceries etc.), not even on the weekends. I never have friends or women over because I dont have friends and im happy af being alone. Now a couple weeks ago I heard this son of a bitch neighbor talk shit about me on the phone cause the walls are thin. And I already knew he was talking about me and I knew he was talking to people that I used to hang out with long time ago.  As a matter of fact he does it all the time. Maybe like a running gag or whatever...I heard him today again. ""Poor fella hes all alone all day, AALLL DAY, Every day!"" I NEVER even fucking talked to him! I dont know wtf this retard wants from me...  before he moved in we met through associates but as I said, there was never real interaction. And I know im not hallucinating. Im no loony. Because a week after he started talking shit about me one of those old associates visited this motherfucker even tho he never had that person over, ever. I also heard this associate jokingly shout my name. I rarely give a fuck what ppl think about me and I know I shouldnt care at all. This dumbass is totally irrelevant. Whats the worst thing that could happen if these nobodies think im a loser? Literally nothing. The fear of being rejected or judged is irrational and primal. Its bullshit and I could easily kick his midget ass. Yet this shit gives me severe headache. Im being judged for being at home. Its torture for me. I feel uncomfortable as hell for being me in a place where this shouldnt be the case! I dont even piss because I dont want him to hear how the toilet is being flushed so he doesnt know that Im at home again. The thing I fear the most is that one of those old associates visits him again so that they can knock on my door and to talk to me. I dont wanna explain myself. I live how tf I want. Suck my dick if you have a problem with it. Please give me advice how I sould deal with this. Thanks for reading"

801,Inpatient counseling recommendations,"Hello Redit,
I'm trying to find good affordable inpatient counseling for a friend who has had drug and mental issues for the past decade. They would like to turn things around and I dont want to miss the opportunity. The issue is that the facilities I have come across are extremely expensive. Not sure why they think an addict would have 30 to 60 k lying around..... I'm going to help out. But would like recommendations from someone that has gone through a program that was worth it. And is affordable. 
Thanks."
802,My mother literally drove me insane,"Everything is a competition to my mum and when she's not winning she'll do whatever it takes to win, including sabotaging her child's mental health.

I've been back at my parents home since April due to COVID and my mental health has deteriorated to the point where I can no longer cope - because of my mother.

Everyday is a judgement, do something wrong or minorly inconvenient, then she treats you like a loser. Of you don't do anything wrong then she'll find something and go to town. All to make her narcissistic self feel better. She LOVES IT.

I got to breaking point the other night because of her band flipped out on her, she gaslights me and then says I need to go to a mental asylum, then, in the midst of all this, PROCEEDS with such a cavalier attitude to tell me that I'm drinking too much and not helping around the house enough. WTF, I literally broke down in front of you, BECAUSE of you and you bring this up?!

Funny, the morning after, she was as happy as Larry.

She enjoys making other people feel insignificant and not valued, it makes her feel valued, she cannot live in harmony with people whilst feeling valued, her value comes from knowing that other people are feeling de-valued.

She enjoys the power she has as a parent and abuses it. She puts her child in situations where they lose their dignity and integrity and then attacks them for the loss of said attributes.

She's a master manipulator and destroys your sense of self through abuse of power so she can control you - do as she pleases, even if it conflicts with your morals and sense of self and your rewarded with love, don't do as she pleases and she'll send you down to emotional hell until you break.

My mental health is so bad now that the thought of moving out or going back to work fills me with dread.

Because of my outburst the other night, she has taken away my individuality and she knows it, she says my mental health is bad, even though she knows she caused it and this is her way to control me. She has control now and won't relenquish it until I tell her I'm fine and don't want her help - to which she will reply 'ok' and then become emotionally cold to the point of cut off - which she has done before. She only wants a relationship where she can control.me because beneath her narcissistic, manipulative self is a scared child who can only gain self esteem through the obliteration and/or emotional control of others - (Where there is no threat to her self esteem)"
803,Struggling to understand my (F30) boyfriend's (M30 mental health.," 

My boyfriend has…what I believe is some combination of anxiety and depression. Usually he manages it well; sometimes not so well. 

Recently I triggered him by asking why he doesn’t use a glass container instead of aluminum foil to cook his food, as I’m worried about sustainability issues…the thing is, I’ve brought it up several times before and I guess this one really really set him off. Saying I’m making him feel bad etc.

And then he went unresponsive, had to shut himself up. Trying to talk to him doesn’t work. Usually, he slowly gets back to normal in a few days…but I just feel so overwhelmed. I’m not without my own anxieties/stress. 

I know he can’t help it, it’s a mental health thing and he’s acknowledged and felt guilt that it stresses me out before (I’ve assured him it’s okay, but encouraged him to see professional help) but it just feels   
 unfair. How am I supposed to know a relatively simple nag would spiral him into this? And am I supposed to prostrate myself in apology now? 

I feel angry, which isn’t fair to him, but I can’t help it. I’m so frustrated. Talking to him, being sympathetic, *just doesn't help.* 

In a way, I don’t really understand what’s happening to him. I don’t really understand why people become literally unresponsive to anyone trying to talk to them. Can anyone help me gain some understanding?"
804,Help with doctors,"I submitted an online form for my doctor as I have anxiety over the phone detailing my current issues and they responded saying they can't do anything and calling is the only way even though I have seen them in person during the lockdown due to my anxiety of answering the phone. 
When they call tomorrow I won't be able to answer and I won't get any help. Is there anything I can do?"

807,Critism and trauma response.,"When people try to give me criticism. I can't take it. I get filled with aniexty and defensive about my disability. I spiral, and dont know how to deal with it. I know its partially a trauma response, but why do I have this and what should I do?"
808,I clenched my teeth so hard last night when sleeping that my teeth hurt today,"My anxiety flared up the other day. Took an anxiety attack in bed and couldnt breathe. It eventually passed.


Last night i must have clenched my jaw super tight, cause today my molars hurt to chew."
809,I don't think I can be a functional adult,"I realized that I had depression and social anxiety at an early age only when I was already close to being an adult.

The earliest I can remember having an episode of depression was when I was still in elementary, I can vividly remember having this intense feeling of sadness for no reason at all, and because I didn't know the reason why I had the urge to cry I would hide in the bathroom until the urge to cry was gone, I thought that everyone else was going through the same thing so I didn't tell anyone. This would happen once in a while but the frequency only increased until I no longer cried, I instead felt down for the whole day. It was great that I no longer had to cry but it also made it difficult to express myself emotionally, to everyone around me I seemed like a cold person who thought I was better than everyone.

When I was a teenager I kept hearing the word depression but at that point I still didn't know what it meant but it was hammered into my head by the adults around me that people who claim to have it only say that for attention so even I laughed at the idea of someone having depression. When I was 16 I decided to finally look up what it and it clicked, I realized that I had depression all this time and I thought it was completely normal.

So since I found out that what I was going through was a bad thing I decided to tell my mom about it, but I couldn't properly convey what I was going through so in she ended up just telling me that it was just a teen phase and what she went through was worse and I was lucky, so I never got any form of help, and I decided that I was all alone in this and I doubt I was ever going to receive any help so I continued to pretend that I was fine.

When it comes to my social anxiety, I was always terrified of presenting infront of everyone, I would get these ""visions"" of what would happen if I made a mistake(imagining that I would say something wrong and everyone in the class would laugh at me). I chalked it up to stage fright and eventually got over it by presenting and performing many times. What I could not get over was being outside where there is a large crowd of people. It made me really sweaty when I was in really cold places, my senses would feel so overloaded, but the worst of all would be that I begin to feel like I was no longer in my own body, I would see myself as if I was an onlooker staring at myself, and that just made me feel more conscious.

I tried alot of things to get better I picked up alot of hobbies (i.e. painting, drawing, sculpting, baking, exercise, gaming) hoping I could find something that I could be passionate about and maybe it would help me get over my depression. I continued to do all of these hobbies for years but non of it helped and now that I'm 19 I've lost all passion to do any of these

For my social anxiety I did alot of exposure therapy, performing, going out alot, did part time jobs where I had to meet new people. But all I learned was how to pretend that I was fine when I'm in a crowd.

I had to drop out of the university that I really wanted to study in because I couldn't handle living in my own country where it was way more crowded and getting around was a nightmare because I would be surrounded by a huge crowd for hours because that's how life is there, I endured it for a while until it began to effect my performance in my uni and I had my very first mental breakdown.

When I tried to talk to my parents about it their solution for it was to ""just be happy"". It was then I realized that I was pretty much all alone. They quickly enrolled me into another college, in a course I don't feel any motivation to do and my anxiety makes it even harder to attend classes. And now I don't know what to do I can no longer enjoy anything, movies,videos,music irritate me, I no longer enjoy games, and I lost all passion for the rest of my hobbies.

Sorry for the long ass post but I just wanted to talk about how this has affected my whole life and I didn't know and also how it made college life the most difficult thing for me.

Oh and I don't think my parents are bad people, my childhood wasn't even bad Ive had the same classmates from elementary all the way till highschool and we are still really close now. And I've always been active and close with my parents and siblings. So I don't really know the reason why I have depression and social anxiety."
810,Does anyone have any advice on how to take care of yourself?,"Today, I had a long talk with my mom, about taking better care of myself. I don’t feed myself like I’m supposed to, take care of my hygiene. I normally don’t take care of myself, till my parents step in and make me. I’ve always chalked it up to being REALLY lazy. I recently started really thinking about why I’m like that.   Then, it hit me, I really don’t like myself. And, it’s not reasonable to except yourself to care for, something you don’t care about. So my question is, does anyone have any tips to help me do, at least the bare minimum of what I should be doing?"
811,I recently interviewed a Mental Health Master!,"Hey guys!  My name is Candy and I recently interviewed Quinton Clawson from the youtube channel Mental Health Master.

812,A Recount about my Behavior at Work,"Hello. 

I just wanted to document an anxiety/panic attack I had at work today. 

I am often alone in the office at work. I started to think about the traumatic things that happened to me, and obviously, it triggered something. I am diagnosed with PTSD, and I've been neglecting my medication. I also don't have enough money to see a therapist or my psychiatrist. I've already borrowed money from family to pay for tuition. I can't ask for more. (Negative thoughts noticed, will stop) 


Anyway, I began to breakdown with the stress of work and flashbacks. People noticed but didn't pry, nor did I mention anything. Once alone again, I did some nonlethal self-harm. For example, I scratched at my arms, like I used to do. The bad habit is rearing its head. Not to the point where I left wounds like I used to. I also slammed my head on the walls. 

It hurt a lot. Don't do that again, even if your emotions overtake you. You are at work. 

Luckily I finished the day. I'm heading to a friend's house to talk to her and hopefully let out my emotions in a more healthy matter. 


Thank you."
813,My antidepressant is making me less studious!,"This is actually good news! I generally have an anxious perfectionism that causes me to study without breaks for hours and hours straight, burn out, and get depressed. When my depression stays manageable, I end up getting astoundingly good grades. But it's so painful mentally! 

It's been about a month since I started taking lexapro and it's working for me. I can tell I'm less anxious because I actually can push school out of my mind- I legitimately feel like doing other stuff. It's actually GOOD FOR ME to start getting B's instead of A's for the sake of my mental health so... Wanting to procrastinate is a win, funnily enough!"
814,Seriously convinced to quit my job. I can’t take it anymore and I want to kill myself.,"There’s been a lot of negative things happening in my life right now. But I think the biggest one has been my recent breakup. I don’t want to go into it. It was my fault, that’s all that matters. She matters so much to me and I lost her. I’m so tired of hurting people....

Yesterday I was supposed to work from 5:45pm to 1AM but I called in and said I had a school assignment due at midnight. Which was true, but I was too depressed to do it...anytime something rough has happened in my life, I would quit my job without notice. So I tried something different for once and just called in. I thought I’d feel betterish today. I don’t. I’m fucking miserable. I don’t have any motivation. I’ve always been emotionally vulnerable I suppose. But I just don’t care anymore. I just don’t have a reason to live. It feels like I’m just suffering and I want that suffering to go away. It’s always been like that. My whole life, I suffer on and off. And it’s destroyed my mental state. I want it to be over for good. I know I need this job because I have to pay my attorney $1200 by January for a fucking court case. But even that I don’t care about. At least not as much. 

I’m so over everything. I feel like I need counseling. I don’t feel like I can do both."
815,Does everyone feel like this at some point?,"I've never felt this in my entire life. it's that feeling when you realise that you're basically worthless. 

i was talking to my mother about what i was choosing for my career and i told her that i wanted to become someone who works in the healthcare sector, i mean a doctor. she stopped me and told me that she wasn't taking any risks for a career like that because it takes too much time. 

i then asked her what she wanted me to become and she said it's my choice. i asked her again and she said that she thinks **I'm not good enough in anything so she doesn't know what she wants me to be**

that made me very very sad. i feel like my future is a burden. and I'm only wasting my parent's money. i really want to give up, just stop living at this point. because i don't want to face my future. i don't want to end up like a failure and a disappointment to my family but for some reason, I don't have a reason to get up and fight against my problems because I'm going to lose neither way.  

does this make sense?? I didn't know any other place to vent so i thought this place might be my only choice. I'm so sorry if i said something wrong."
816,Need advice,"A person I'm close to has been struggling with her sense of self worth for as long as I can remember. She constantly believes she is less worthy of any form of love than those around her. She pushes herself to do the best for us, but refuses to accept any kind of appreciation since she believes she doesn't deserve it. I have tried everything, from reassuring words and reminders to acts of kindness to gifts, but nothing seems to work. 
Any ideas/suggestions about what I can do to help ger out would be appreciated."
817,Just venting...,"I've been experiencing physical and mental abuse for the past few years... first from my mother but now even my older sister has been doing the same to me. Since i'm asian it's been normalized and I couldn't vent to my friends... and even if I did my sister would get mad at me telling me ""Why do you need to share our personal business to other people?"" and I didn't know ranting and asking for help was bad... I realized I might have been gaslighted. I act badly to her, I'll admit. I tell her mean stuff as I call her out, because who wouldn't be mad? She used to beat me up before... I ended up going to school with my bruises, and a broken iPad. I normalized how destructive she was... because she had anxiety and often had panic attacks, but I never knew I had to put up with her abusing me too... I once brought up that one time we had a fight, because she was curling my hair and I felt so ugly... and I cried for hours before going to school, I told her how much I didn't want to go... yet she told me (in our language) ""You're so sensitive..."" and I have realized now that I might have suffered social anxiety... and she suffers anxiety too... and it just doesn't sit right with me that until today she calls me sensitive for experiencing anxiety like her... I never ONCE told her that nor have I invalidated her feelings... and everytime I tell her our past, she keeps telling me why I can't move on from her hurting me... and I thought how could I ever forget that?"
818,Seeking advice for living with an alcoholic.,"In the past my father excessively drank. He raped my mom, would get violent, and would disappear for days. I have severe trauma not only from him drinking, but the secondhand effects it had on the rest of my family. I'm 25 now but I always felt it was my fault cause I was the troubled child. Anyway, I just found out after becoming clean for 15 years he began drinking every night. 

I still am stuck at home and literally have no outs. I dont have a place to stay. I cant afford to move out. I cant afford a therapist. And talking to him about it is impossible and a whole other mess that i'd have to create another post on. All i've been doing is drowning myself in work in hopes it will go away..."
819,I just want to stop existing everything is just fucking awful,"I was gonna see some friends this weekend for the first time in ages because of corona 

And I stayed away from parties and all that shit (not that i was even invited in the first place lmao) but others didn't and everyone fucking ignored the rules

And now the rules got stricter in again and I just can't anymore

I miss seeing my friends and im pretty sure I just failed my first exam and being home is fucking tough and literally nothing fun has happened in so long and I just want everything to stop"
820,I really don’t fucking feel like voting.,"I mean politics is all bullshit. I don’t feel like choosing between dickhead #1 and dickhead #2.

What am I supposed to say is my friends claim “oh you can’t complain because you didn’t vote herp derp”. Well… Maybe not for choosing between a pedophile and a narcissist. Or some other random ass group third-party candidate I don’t fucking know probably is also a piece of shit"
821,Random bursts of energy,"Normally my energy is pretty low but sometimes I get random bursts of energy at random parts of the day and it brings my heart rate up. I dont mind it and I try to take advantage of it by getting up and cleaning but the energy dies quickly and I was to lay down and do nothing again. What is that? lmao 
I've heard bipolar is longer periods of time of highs and lows so I wasn't sure if it was that. 
My question is what mental health disorder is associated with random bursts of energy and followed by lethargy and not wanting to get up or do anything?"
822,How do I tell my professors my brain cells rotted?,"When I began school I entered an abusive relationship which is hard enough to ignore for the sake of concentrating on school. After it ended I got extremely sick and developed pretty severe PTSD which completely destroyed my ability to articulate and especially destroyed my short term and working memory. Although with therapy, meditation, and brain work my cognitive abilities have gotten better but they’re still messed up.

Thanks to my short term memory being impaired I fail every written test despite knowing the material. How do I explain this to my professors professionally? What accommodations might help me articulate my ideas easier? What would be a good suggestion for extra credit to regain grade points?"
823,Feeling apathetic,"I’ve been feeling apathetic for awhile now, and it’s particularly bad today. I love sports, but watching football this weekend I just felt like I didn’t care. I wait all week to jam with some friends and when the time comes, I don’t even feel like going, and when I’m there I feel like I’m dragging the energy down. I want to play golf, but when I’m out on the course I’m usually just counting down the holes until it’s done. I wish I had the passion and energy I used to have, I feel more and more like I’m just going through the motions. Just had to get that off my chest."
824,"Is having serious doubt about my worth, actually diminishing my worth?","I have continous and persistent doubts about myself, if I'm a good person or a skilled worker. But I'm wondering wheter these doubts are actually detrimental. One day I remember one of my professor said that one alumn was aggressive because he knows that he's not worth it. What if this same reasoning can be applied to me? I have a strong fear to appear in public (and in few weeks I will have to) because I fear people will feel my doubts about myself, and won't see me with respect. Idk if any of this makes sense"
825,We broke up yesterday but i was very dependent on him and i’m overcome with the weirdest thoughts and feelings. very empty and alone.,"i already posted about this right after it happened. i don’t really know why i’m posting again i just feel very alone. i guess it’s kind of an update on what happened but i’m sure the same people won’t see this. he broke up with me yesterday because of my mental health being so bad. he knew it was best for both of us and i agree with that. i am trying really hard to think positive thoughts about this situation. earlier today i couldn’t cry or feel anything. i just sat there like an empty shell. eventually i listened to a song that means a lot to me, it hit me very deeply and i started to cry and didn’t stop for a while. it was the type of crying with screams and just a lot of pain. i still haven’t processed this. i put together a playlist of songs that i can listen to without crying, it’s one of the main things bringing me comfort right now. i have friends and a mother who are here for me and care about me, but my mom works and my friends haven’t talked to me much today. i am having trouble eating but i did eat a couple light things today. i really just have never felt so empty and like there’s nothing for me to do. it’s worse than boredom. i have gone through many periods of time where i felt depressed but this is beyond how i felt then. i keep accidentally going through everything that happened over and over and hating myself because i could’ve done everything differently. i know this is best for us but i wish it wasn’t. i really don’t know what to do at all. i have just been sitting here all day and not doing anything, i watched an episode or two of an old Disney show. I feel very childish right now. I used to hold a stuffed animal that he bought me to go to sleep and now I can’t anymore. It used to comfort me to hold it whenever I was having really bad meltdowns and panicking and stuff. I no longer have anything like that whenever I need it the most."
826,I don't know how to accept being autistic,"TL;DR I hate myself because I have Aspergers syndrome. What do? Thanks in advance

I am 22 years old. I have high functioning, low social autism spectrum disorder (once classified as Aspergers syndrome), anger management issues, chronic depression and various self-sabotaging patterns that my subconcious uses to justify my depressive moods.

I am on my final year of study and plan to start working next year, whether I get my degree or not. I have a loving girlfriend of 4.5 years who I plan to propose to. I provide tutoring lessons to highschool students and I find it very fulfilling.

I hate myself. I want to die. I want to stop existing. Every waking second is psycological warfare with myself to ensure that I appear ""normal."" To ensure I don't cause unnecessary problems with my unique way of doing things. I'm so tired. I'm so so fucking tired.

I have to gauge every emotion, asses every response, count every individual syllybal of. Every. Fucking. Word... FUCK!!!!!.......... I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate having to control myself. I hate having to be aware of everything I do. I'm so tired and I want it to stop. I want this collar and chain I'm strangling myself with to be gone. I want to be free.

But I can't. Because that's not how life works. *I'm* the problem, the rogue element, the difference. Not other people. I need to conform to them, not the other way around. And I want to. I want to be better than my base desires. I want to be better than my autism. But I hate it. And I hate doing shit I don't want to. 

I'm only studying to get a job to survive, not because I want to. I hate BSc. I hate science. I hate having to pretend I care just to get a job I'm going to eventually hate. I hate caring about people that clearly despise me, especially my girlfriend's narrow-minded, hateful, judgemental parents. I hate hate hate hate hate being forced to conform.

But I want to be better. I want to make myself proud. I want to be something more than an unempathetic, unmotivated blob of hate and desire. I've come so far. I've grown so much. 5 years of therapy.

I need to know how to accept what I am. I need to accept I'm going to be fighting for the rest of my life just to be ""human"". How??? How do I make peace with that?"
827,Weird thought/opinion ⚠️ TRIGGER WARNING⚠️,"When I was 11 I watched 13 reasons why. When I saw the controversy surrounding the show I was extremely confused. At the time I wanted to kill myself and I did try to but then I saw the show and it changed my mind because I saw how it affects others. I don’t know if I’m weird for this but the show helped me more then it hurt me. Like when I saw the suicide scene, it calmed me because I knew what it felt like to feel hopeless and lost. I felt a weird connection to Hannah Baker because growing up, I had no one to talk to nor relate to when it came to mental illness and thoughts of suicide. I am now fully aware years later on how the show can and might be triggering to others but at the time and still to this day, the show makes me feel like I have someone to relate too and has given me motivation to not go through with the toxic ideas that come to mind on dark days. 
         This has just been a weird thought on my mind that I thought I might as well just share."
828,I need to be help and support but it's making me feel terrible.,"TW: S*icide and S*lf H*rm


With a weird long complicated event that's recently happened to some of my friends that I don't need to get into, it's badly affected the lives of 2 of my friends. Since these friends both have terribly broken households. One is transgender with a family who doesnt support him. They also seem to blame him for the death of his older brother and they get mad because my friend isn't his brother (if that makes sense) so they take that out on him. And the other lives alone with her horrifically abusive and alcoholic mother, who constantly says vile things to her. Both these friends have self-harmed and attempted suicide in the past.

Obviously, as a friend, I'm reaching out and offering as much help as they need during this time but it's getting to a point where my mental health is suffering severely. I literally feel like I can't help them anymore. But if I don't then I'm gonna feel even worse and I don't know what to do. Both are seeking professional help which is obviously much more difficult with everything going on in the world. And I'm just stuck. I need everything and everyone to be okay."
829,How to stop the need for approval and fear of being judged?,"I have so many things that I want to do but my fear of judgment and lack of confidence prevents me. 

Although, I know why I feel this way, and I know that no one really cares and that judgment might come anyway but it shouldn’t prevent me from doing what I want, as long as I’m not hurting anyone. I should put myself first and not worry about getting other random peoples approval.


I know this in theory but it’s hard to actually understand it. I’ve been subconsciously programmed to think this way, with this need of constant approval.

When I want to do something new or something that might get someone’s attention, I stop myself from even trying because I visualize what-if scenarios where I get ridiculed, criticized etc. I know these negative thoughts are not real and I want to accomplish this new thing, but the thoughts still hold power over me and discourage me.

How can I truly convince myself ?"
830,I’m scared that I’ve fallen for someone please help,"Overtime I’ve been talking to someone and they live very far but we click so well. we’ve talked pretty much daily for almost a year and everything goes so well. we’ve opened up to each other and everything. we talk all the time. I feel such a strong connection and it scares me. I’m scared because we’ve had similar plans of moving but that would take years and I guess if it were true then it would work out right? But what if it doesn’t I don’t understand why I’m feeling this way. I’m not lonely I have friends and I talk to other people as well but there’s something different about this I haven’t felt this way about anyone else ever even when I was in relationships I never felt this way. I’m scared because I want to be with them I want to treat them right I want so much but I doubt I’d ever have it I don’t know why I’m feeling this way and I’ve tried to make it stop but I can’t they’re so great and I try to let them know that as much as possible I’m so fuking scared of these feelings because they are so irrational but I still feel them 

Can anyone offer any insight on this? Whether similar situation or just someone to talk to about this? Please message/comment if you can"
831,I pay for sex then feel bad only to so it again every friday,"i thought this was gonna be a ont time only thing , this ks what I get for being curious"
832,How do you deal with fear of being replaced?,"Long story short- I am extremely insecure about my self-worth. I'm ready for my closest friends (who I value way too much probably, I'm probably way too available to them) to replace me at the drop of a hat, so when they make a new friend and get close to them fast, or they stop talking to me to talk to them, I get *extremely* anxious

It's a gut-wrenching feeling that I'll be replaced, in my brain it's a certainty. Thankfully I'm controlled, and I trust my friends enough to talk about these fears with them. They are great people so they don't mind putting my mind at ease.

But to my eyes, actions speak louder than words, and seeing them be so friendly towards each other in ""public"", and announcing how they love the other makes my skin crawl. I don't act on my jealousy, I have no ill will towards their new friends, they are actually pretty cool. 

But I feel like **I** am intruding on their friendship, and that it is just a matter of time before I'm tossed aside and forgotten.

(and yeah, this fear comes from experience of actually being replaced in the past ahaha. I know I need therapy but I can not afford it atm. I'm looking for any sort of tips that might help manage this rot. It gets so bad I can't sleep or I get bowel problems over it)"
833,Can't get appointment with my therapist - Need advice,"A few years ago I saw an amazing therapist for almost 2 years. I left on a great note, in one of the best places I've ever been in my life and was so grateful for his help.

I then moved country, travelled etc.. and life inevitably happens all over again. In the past few months a lot has fallen apart and I'm going through a break up with the girl he helped me with years ago. I'm really hurting. I've also just moved to a new city, can feel myself struggling and know that I could really use a few sessions from him to unpack what's happened.

I emailed two months ago saying if he has any appointments and he told me that he's extremely busy with COVID but will let me know. Since then, I've emailed again asking even if there are any cancellations to please let me know and I can take work off for it, but I'm still waiting and I know it could be a long time before anything frees up.

I know I will cope without it, but in my new city I don't have a support network and I'm struggling not being able to speak to him. I'm worried about myself over the next few weeks.

Does anyone have any advice or experience on waiting to see your therapist? even if it's weeks or months?"
834,I’m tired,"I’m tired, nothing is going well, I can’t find a job, I’m really not good enough at anything I do, I wasted 3 years on a stupid degree, I graduated with a first class honours but clearly I’m just not worth the time and money. I am emotionally checked out, I have 0 interest in other people because no one will ever give me the special connection my ex did(even though the last thing I want is to get back with him), so to me new people are not worth it. I am working retail while (coincidentally) my privileged white male friends all managed to land a job during this pandemic (I’m sorry this sounds awful but it’s just tiring when businesses preach about equality). I don’t have family near me apart from my parents, and I haven’t seen my grandparents for more than 3 years (before that I hadn’t seen them for 5 years). I feel like I missed out on so many “normal” things while growing up at the expense of moving to a foreign country to make a better life for my parents and myself but I still have to watch my parents slave away everyday at their jobs while I have a degree and I’m here being useless earning like 40% of what I could be making if I was good enough to get a job. I feel mentally exhausted, no matter how many CVs and Portfolios I make I never hear back (I’ve had 1 interview after hundreds of applications) I honestly don’t know what to do. People keep telling me try this and try that (like put more effort in) but I honestly don’t have the energy anymore. I feel like if I’m gonna be this useless I might as well not exist."
835,My mum needs help?,"my mum is autistic, however she also has bipolar. (And has struggled with psychosis) much like myself. 
Her meds haven’t been working for a while, pretty sure it’s the tolerance. 
She’s had ongoing health issues, a mass growing in her side, all over body swelling, etc. 
However she’s stopped engaging with the services, didn’t go to her ultra sound or blood tests. Justified not engaging with doctors because if she doesn’t know, she doesn’t have to worry 😐
Her mum is on the last stages of terminal cancer (probably a trigger for her mental health to be fair) - my mum doesn’t have a support network or anyone more capable than her for logic and reason other than myself(my sister has the same type of autism as my mother) (she’s vulnerable, has lots of child like thought processes, rationality etc)
I am severely mentally ill and struggle to help myself but I want to help my mum? 
I don’t want her to have her pride and dignity ripped away by me calling social services or whatever because she is in many ways child like because of her autism? And i don’t know how she’d react. 
But her health is continuously getting worse, I don’t have a father or other family members so I dunno, pretty scared - just venting. But also who can I call? How do I help? I’m in the uk so not sure of the adequate services to try and atleast enquire on how I could support her as she’s stubborn as all hell"
836,Drugs/Depression,"I've been getting into drugs pretty heavy this year. Nothing hard, just a lot of alcohol, nicotine and THC, but I've just been doing too much too often, and I'm only realizing that now. I want to stop but I don't know if that's a good idea. This year I got confirmation that I was molested as a kid, which was something I had suspected for a long time, but my family never really talked about it. The whole reason why I started with drugs was to stop thinking so much, because the more I thought about it the more distressed I got. Now I don't feel much drive to do anything anymore besides getting too high to know what's going on. I spent years bouncing between therapists and programs trying to tackle my mental health in my adolescence and teens, and I know that drugs are a terrible coping mechanism, but nothing else made me feel any more stable, so I feel like if I just stop altogether I'll be in a worse place than I started. So I don't really know what to do, fighting depression has always felt like swimming against a rip current, now even more so. If anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it."
837,Can someone help (Dm me if possible),"So since June, which is around 3 months into when quarantine really began, my mental health has really deteriorated. It got better after like a month but really started getting worse around 2 weeks ago. Basically, whenever I think about myself having a mental illness or whenever I even think about a mental illness, I start panicking about whether or not I have that mental illness. Obviously you shouldn't self-diagnose, which is why I came to reddit to see whether or not this is because of the quarantine and the stress (everybody's talking about mental and physical health and all) or if this is something I should really look into. if you want some more detail, often when I am doing something, say eating, and then I go and get a glass of water, my brain tells me ""you should go wash your hands so you don't get the cups dirty"" but then almost immediately after my brain says, ""Wait. What if you have OCD?"" and then the list continues. for the past week it's been mostly things about derealization/depersonalization. the weird thing is, i feel like i wouldn't have felt any of this anxiety if i had never known about the disorder in the first place. its almost as if knowing about the illness is the reason why its happening. a more recent example is today and yesterday, when i randomly started thinking about my breathing, and now i can't get myself to stop thinking about it. i went to the internet to find some possible causes, and the most common search result was a form of OCD, so obviosuly i start panicking about having OCD. it'd be appreciated if anybody could give me some advice or insight into what i may be going through."
838,Random questions in my mind stopping me from learning something new," 

I am sorry for this post being long.  
And sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.  
There are a lot of things that interest me and I wanna get good at them, but I'm scared to start them.  
Whenever I think of how great it would be if I'd learn this and that a lot of questions start popping into my head that discourage me from doing it.

What if I lose interest in it fast? I'd just be wasting my time.  
What if I get really good at it and then what I release makes some people uncomfortable?  
What if it ends up like crap?  
Wouldn't my success (if I even succeed) be bringing other people who aren't as successful?  
What if I one day look at someone who's really good and get bumbed out and leave it altogeather?  
What if learning that leads me down a path where I'd end up dead (like one day I'm going to buy some pencils or some shit and a car hits me. The car wouldn't hit me if I had never started drawing to begin with)  
What if I develop some disese because of what I wanna do (for example, I play an instrument and then I get a fucking desiese or some shit because I didn't clean it and the next thing you know I fucking have lung cancer or some shit)  
What if I end up broke because I was doing these things instead of doing something what will bring me money?  
What if doing things that bring me money will just make me more depressed and then, at the end of my days, I realize that I've wasted my life not doing anything meaningful?  
What if I become a youtuber or a twitch streamer or some shit? What if I release cringy shit and start constantly geting mail to kill myself or similar shit?  
What if I go mountain climbing and fucking fall off a mountain and die? Great Idea, now you're dead in a fucking mountain when you could have just made some origami.  
What if I learn to use weapons and whoops I shoot someone cause my aim is shit?  
Or go scubadiving and a shark eats me?  
What if I start living a little and found out orgies are great, and get aids because i'm not careful? Or get someone pregnant? Or both?  
What if I one day start making music, release a song and a big company sues me for everything I have and wins because my song and theirs have a similar ring to them?  
What if I start learning to write and write the next My Immortal Copypasta?  
What if I start making games and make complete shit that no one will play and the people that play will hate me for taking 5 minutes out of their life?  
What if someone commits suicide because of something I've made? (a picture or a song or something)  
What if I start learning how to drive and hit and kill someone?  
What if someone hits and kills me?  
What if I start learning to make alcohol and make something for a party and poison everyone?  
What if I start learning to carve wood and drill a hole in my fucking hand?  
What if I start drawing nature and shit and, while presenting my things at the side of a street, huligans beat me up becuase that shit is gay?  
What if I make some memes and they become a symbol of a political movement, and then some huligans come and demolish my house or hurt my family?  
What if I eventually choose something and then realise I've made the wrong choice later in life and it's too late to start over now?  
What if I go skydiving and my parachute doesn't work?  
What if I buy a pet snake and it bites me in my sleep?  
What if I become a teacher, start a class and, one day, while live-streaming, i accidentally share my porn folder with everyone?  
What if I start going into politics or at least try learning about who's in charge, and vote for the wrong guy? I'd be partially responsible for everything bad that happend under his rule because I'm the one that brought him into power.  
What if start working with electricity or making isolation and don't do it right? Someone will die because of what I did.  
What if I become in charge of maintnence for a bank app and make a mistake that will cost a lot of people their livelyhoods?  
What if I start learning how to sing and end up really bad at it to the point where it becomes a meme?  
What if none of this happens and I just end up not being that good at anything? I'd have spent my whole life struggling to get good at something only to find out that i'm bad at anything I do?  
And so then I'd choose to lead a lif ewhere I wouldn't bother learning anything new and just go with the flow.  
But what if I start commenting on shit? And my comments make them commit suicide or just ruin their day?  
What if I comment something that will get me or people around me in trouble?  
What if I just lurk everywhere and people wrongly accuse me of having something to hide, which would spiral down to me having a mental breakdown?  
What if, when I have a mental breakdown, I start doing some messed up shit and end up in prison? It'd ruin the lives of everyone I love, including my own.  
Why do anything then?  
And then I don't do anything. But wait... then I'll just die.  
I don't wanna ""just die"". I wanna try out different things. There are a lot of things that interest me and I wanna try them. But what if ...  
... you get the picture.  
How? What? Where? When? Why? Why not? Where? What?"
839,Please Help. I’m Having A Hard Time,I have a younger sister who is currently in the hospital she is suicidal and suffers from depression and anxiety. I myself also suffer from depression and trying to help her even though I can’t even help myself has been really stressful. My chest hurts I physically feel pain I am stressed and I don’t know what to do. How do you save someone when you can’t even save yourself how do you convince someone to live when you don’t even want to live yourself. We have been through a lot as children and we are all messed up because of it and we are having a hard time coping but especially her she has had several breakdowns in the last couple of weeks and I don’t know what to do and we don’t have the financial support we need to seek the best care and the hospital bills are starting to add up and our family is dysfunctional so we don’t even have each other or have a support system of friends and family to help we are just broken and alone and struggling. People outside of our family have their own families to care about no one really has the time to care for us the way we need to be cared for and it feels like a burden trying to reach out to anyone else. I don’t have any friends and neither does anyone in my family really we are just very messed up people. Anyways I have no one else to talk to literally so I’m here asking strangers on the Internet for help.
840,Psychosis? Going mad? Losing my mind? Boyfriend plotting against me? My mind is frazzled please help.,"So a bit of a confused ramble here on a throwaway account, not sure where the best place to post this is and could be a long one so bare with me.. any advice is hugely appreciated. 

It started about a week or so ago, the voices and the shadow people. I’ve been hearing voices I guess and things that are messing with my head. I should point out that I’ve not been working the past couple of months due to covid redundancy and struggling to get a new job - trust me, I’m very much trying, hate not working! I’m somewhat of a casual drug user, but since this the uptake of drugs definitely went to daily rather than weekly - primarily meth. Now I figured this whole situation was due to that but I’m not too sure. I’ve stopped using now btw, haven’t touched anything for a few days. 

The main thing is when I’m in the flat really,
I’ll hear voices which I believe are coming from the loft upstairs - which to my knowledge after moving in a few weeks ago is empty. It kind of sounds like there’s a big group of people up there and I’m hearing them through the muffled roof but still clearly. It’s all ran by my boyfriends ex-girlfriend (changing the name for this purpose) - I’ll call her Jess. It’s her taunting me constantly saying how he loved her so much more and I’m nothing in comparison to her and how he’s never been in love with me and how ugly I am and what a bitch I am. She’s with a big group of people and they’re all constantly bad mouthing me and ripping me to shreds. Even when me and the bf are getting steamy in the bedroom, she’s still trying to get in my head. I hear her and the rest of the group constantly trying to split us up and convince me that they’ve been fucking for months and even sleep in the bed next to us at night. 
It gets really intense when they all go on about how much they hate me and I should die. They sometimes manage to convince me that they’re going to set the house on fire, so much so that I end up getting my shoes on and running outside terrified. Of course every time there’s never anything remotely of the sort going on. She tells me she’s got a gun and is going to shoot me in the head. It’s driving me crazy. 

When my bf goes to the bathroom for example, I’ll hear them talking about me and just slating me to the max. I’ll then hear sex noises from the two of them and them declaring their love for each other and it just sounds so so real and it kills me having to hear that even though it’s not there. I’ll end up believing it so much that I’ll barge into the bathroom expecting the worst and obviously it’s nothing.
I’ll walk down the street and I feel like I’m in the Truman show. I feel like everyone is watching and commenting on me and I can hear a bitchy running commentary and audience comments on everything I do. It’s making me so self conscious and insecure and feel weirdly isolated. 

I get convinced sometimes that my boyfriend is in on it and he’s set this all up, like some big conspiracy to fuck with my head. I’ll hear jess’s voice sometimes and she’ll be asking my bf questions and he will actually respond, whether it’s a yes or no or a nod or shake of the head or something along those lines. I know it’s in my head but sometimes I think it’s more than just a coincidence that those things happen, especially as it isn’t a rare occasion. She’s somehow managed to convince me that he’s leaving me and getting married to her in the next month. It’s affecting mine and my bf’s relationship because I just end up paranoid and accusing him of things. He understands it’s not really me and I’m never usually like that at all, but it’s driving me (and him) nuts. 
I feel pathetic, I’m constantly crying and feeling so low and I just want them to go away. I’m staying in a hotel for a couple of nights to give my bf space because it’s nearly getting too much for him my constant paranoia. I sometimes believe he is in on it because I’m so so so convinced I’ve seen next door neighbours like leaning across to our window and writing messages through reflections and things like that. I hear all the voices and he will respond occasionally to what they said to me and when I ask him about that, he just says I’m going crazy and doesn’t hear anything. 

I also see shadows of the two of them having sex in the other room through reflections and things like that, it drives me mad and I end up trying to take pictures of them against the wall and sneakily trying to catch them out when I know really it’s nothing, I trust my boyfriend and this isn’t really happening I know it, but In the moment it’s unbearable.
I don’t really understand what’s going on.. is my boyfriend doing this or is this drug induced psychosis? I have much more probably to say but I’m going to stop it there. I don’t want to fuck my relationship up at all, I love the guy so much and I don’t want to keep feeling this way all the time. 

Thanks for letting me ramble x"
841,A discussion about my brain,"What condition is this? People like to imply meanings, but not directly address them. I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but it makes social interaction bloody hard. Im not talking about common phrases like 'its raining cats and dogs', no, those are so obvious to me. I was asked 'what is the significance of...' and my mind just froze. Double negatives add to the confusion. I get confused over even simple concepts."
842,Emotional numbness,"I’ve been feeling numb for a while now, I did some research and I know what the cause could be however I haven’t found anything about what I can do against it. 
Friends told me that it could be depression but before I dive into that topic I’d rather try and see if I can 'cure’ my numbness. Any suggestions?"

844,Mental health and apartment hunting,"My bf and i have several mental health struggles, not the same ones and different triggers. Our current apt has several triggers for me so we'll be moving once the lease is up.
I was wondering if anyone has disclosed to a landlord their mental health while/before looking at an apartment and/or made any contracts with them stating if any triggers arise within X number of days they can break the lease?"
845,I reached out to find help,"Obligatory from-phone-formatting apology.

I've been on and off treatment for the past 15 years or so (since 5th grade), but the last time I spoke to a therapist was about 4 years ago. My life have changed drastically in the past 1.5 years, mostly for the better. Nevertheless, in the past few weeks I've been thinking on going back to therapy, because I feel like my thought processes aren't healthy and that I can do better. I've had some reallybad thoughts lately and it's been troubling me.

Only this morning I mustered up the courage to text my old therapist and ask him if he has the availability to talk to me on a regular basis. He wanted to chat over the phone but we didn't find a good time to do so, so we'll talk tomorrow or Thursday. 

This is the first time I've contacted help by myself, with no particular thing that's happened. I really want to improve my ways, to regain my self confidence and to better process my thoughts. 

I just needed someone to hear this. I'm very proud of myself for seeking help, and I hope it works out.

(I'm posting this right before going to bed, so I'll answer any comments tomorrow :) )"

847,I thought I finally had one win. One thing to be proud of- now it’s gone. He took it away.,"Background info: I’m a gal who has had a rough go of things for a long time. My family used to refer to me as the smart one when I was growing up. Life events seem to contradict that idea. My past four jobs have ended as such : fired, then demoted, then asked to resign, then laid off. I went back to school thinking I just needed a career change. I nearly failed - my instructor asked that I not go into professional work within my major in the final 8 weeks of my degree. I was crushed. I got married. Had a daughter. Found out that she was intellectually disabled during my second pregnancy. My second child died in the womb and was delivered stillborn. I felt like my body was defective and I couldn’t even succeed at carrying a healthy child. My husband became alcoholic shortly after this and started to belittle me ( he is in recovery now). Five years go, it got to all be too much.  I broke mentally and have been unemployed and in therapy and being treated with experimental medicine to try to pull me out of my breakdown. I’ve felt for a long, long time that I am good at mostly nothing. I continue to try to find anything I might have a talent at - even just a little- to rebuild my self esteem. 

Which brings me to yesterday. We recently started remodeling our older house in hopes of maybe selling soon. I’ve actually found it kind of fun to learn the tips and tricks of home remodeling. I also really like how productive it makes me feel during this period of isolation. 
This week we finished tiling our kitchen. I was anxious to help, and was asked to grout the floor. I was told it was an easy job for a beginner, and a good way to contribute. I spent about 12 hours working, I was really into it. I finished the job late last night. I started out needing a little tutoring, but I paid close attention and really put my all into the job. Today I got to show it off... but didn’t get the reaction I was hoping for. Instead, the husband said that it looked awful. He added that he would have to rip my grouting out and re- do all of it, which sets us back a bunch more days. He indicated that he was disappointed because he had worked so hard at laying down and cutting tile, and I had absolutely ruined it in one day. I couldn’t help it- I started to cry. My soul was crushed. I felt proud that I had rose to the challenge, learned, and toughed it out and saw it through. To hear that it was just going to be destroyed and redone was hard for me. I really thought I had a win before that comment- and I really needed it. His comments stole all that away. I spent some time on my knees afterward begging God to just help me find something I’m good at- anything really, so I don’t have to keep feeling so defeated by my failures. My husband said he didn’t mean to sound so harsh, but what’s done is done. I’m just not interested in continuing with our remodel project. Mostly, I’m worried I will keep screwing more things up. The same fear keeps me from employment. It keeps me from doing a lot of things in life. I just need to have one win so I can feel motivated to try again. But I’m afraid that win will never come. I’m middle - aged and just so exhausted from so many years of trying. What good am I for anyone if I can’t complete even the simplest tasks? Just what purpose do I serve? I just want one win pretty soon, just a small one to keep getting up every day and tell myself that there are reasons to keep fighting... I sure hope it happens soon."
848,Discrimination?,"This isn’t meant to be an “activist” type of post.  I just wanted to say this as someone going through it. 

TLDR: I am surprised by how badly people treat those with depression because I feel like everyone experiences it at some point in their lives or at least know someone who has.  I’m sick of being told to trust mental health professionals, hospitals, employers, and school administrators to help me because all they have done is give me reasons to *not* trust them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 The more and more experience I have as someone trying to get better, the less faith I have in “the system.”  I never would have thought there would be so much discrimination against mental illness (because most people don’t even consider it a disability) but now I think there totally is.  

It’s so frustrating because in high school, when I had an Individualized Education Plan for depression and ocd, I was told over and over that my requests for accommodations were unreasonable.  And now that it’s covid times and e*veryone* needs the accommodations I had requested, teachers do it easily.  In high school and now in college, I always get told how I just need to try harder than my peers but there is nothing they can do to help with it.  It hurts really badly and I’m not sure if they realize how much depression especially affects my schoolwork.  Sometimes I have clear days and it’s still not like I enjoy the work, but it’s so much less daunting.  And still, I am only allowed to get accommodations that probably any student could have.  Things like I can ask to sit at the front of the class, I can request for suggested mini deadlines to keep myself on track during a big project, I can take screenshots of the presentations...they try to act like it’s some sort of luxury and I should be soooo grateful but in reality, anyone in the school could ask individually and it wouldn’t be weird.  I think the only accommodation I’ve ever been offered that wouldn’t be offered to someone without disability services is getting 1.5x the time for tests. 

Mental health professionals.  I mean like social workers, therapists, group leaders, psychologists, nurse practitioners, prescribers, DMH workers, all that.  Some are downright laughable (one just recommended essential oils; one kept making me read Chicken Soup for the Soul; one talked exclusively about 90 Day Fiance when I casually mentioned I liked it and so then for the other 2 sessions all we did was discuss the shows).  Some are actually harmful (one kept telling me to picture a stop sign to block out intrusive thoughts which is the exact opposite of what you’re meant to do).  Some have treated me like a lab rat and I feel like they only went into psychology because mentally ill people are fascinating to them, not because they want to help.  A few are actually very good-intentioned, but never help in the long term.  They all just say a whole lot of nothing.  

Employers.  Over the summer, I was interviewed for a job that involves traveling around the country, so they wanted to make sure I would be able to control myself when we’re in the middle of the woods.  I told them about my mental health past only because their website had this big fear mongering thing about how if I lied to them, they had a right to fire me.  And I got denied because I was in therapy…  This made me so mad because it’s like, I’m sorry for trying to work on myself?

Hospitals.  Once I was in a crisis and needed to be hospitalized but none near me were open so I needed to wait at the hospital where I was screened for a week.  The inpatient hospitalization was actually quite helpful, but staying in the er for a week kind of balanced it out.  Laying in bed for a week alone with no sunlight and nothing to do except sleep and watch tv is probably the worst thing for someone with depression.

Overall, I just have a lot of distrust in people’s intentions to “help.”  If I could choose to be neurotypical without working on myself I would be in a heartbeat, but because I can’t, I just wish people would be nice about it.  Sorry, I didn’t expect this to be so long."
849,I think I have BPD?,"I used to study psychology last year. 
I did a whole thing on personality disorders, I was bored the other day and re read my old notes.
I don’t want to self diagnose, not at all, but if I want to bring the possibility of having bpd up with my therapist, I’d rather have some advice from others telling me more.

I feel like I do feel emotions really strongly, I get bored very easily, I have engaged in some self harming behaviours, I am way too attached to my boyfriend and my whole mood depends on him, whether he texts me or not. Before him, my whole mood would depend on my ex girlfriend, and before that when I lived with my mum, my whole mood depended on how she treated me. I am so scared of abandonment.
I want to go into more detail but it’s almost midnight and I’m tired.

Thx for reading"
850,"I have a severe issues with my hypochondria and have no idea what to do, can someone help me out?","So basically, i would say, that all of my problems started back when i was only 7-8. I had a ruptured appendix which one doctor mistaken for a common stomach virus and i had a septic inflammation (is that the word? Well basically blood poisoning). I had huge ammoun of white blood cells when i did my blood test a bit later on and other doctors knew what it was, ruptured appendix. I lost around 30% of my blood back then and it was highly traumatic for me.

Later, when i was 10 i had issues with multiple dentists who destroyed three of my teeth and made me go through various stages of treating those issues caused by them. 

Just recently i was diagnosed with a kidney stone (quite a small one but painful as hell). I think it is out by now but...

I have this anxious feeling that something is wrong with me any time i get a cramp, mild fever or something similar. I always thing “Oh my God, that’s it, i’m about to die” and immediately relate my symptoms (which basically are 100% of the times so far nothing serious) to some serious conditions like a heart attack or stroke.

Just recently i found out that when i skip my breakfast and drink plenty of coffee i get rather dizzy and i feel like i’m going to pass out and my blood pressure rises to something like 130-140 with 80-90, and i know it’s not that much but still, during that phase i feel like hell. 

I am extremely affraid, i had experiences with 4-5 different psychologists and none of them was able to help me. I was going through CBT, had some medications but to no avail. I feel like there is absolutely no help for me and i am extremely frightened, anxious and have rather depressing thoughts.

To add up, i am healthy (at least that’s what my blood, urine and other analysis show) 25 year old male, little bit skinnier and shorter. Not drinking alcohol nor fizzy drinks, only water and have rather healthy diet but i often skip breakfast or lunch and have inadequate sleep. 

What should i do?"
851,A Real Depression test,"This is the official ICD-10 and DSMV depression criteria. In other words what real doctors and psychiatrists use to diagnose depression. DSMV is specifically for mental illness and ICD-10 is for all illnesses. I think both are used in the US and ICD-10 is what WHO uses. The pros and cons are very debatable but DSMV generally gives a better explanation for what the criteria are. There are some differences in how the illness is diagnosed. 

These medical manuals show the real criteria’s for depression and what different kinds there is. If you want to know more about it or maybe reflect upon yourself this is the way to go. Not some rando quiz on the internet. It’s quite a lot of reading though. 

**Disclaimer** Neither you nor me are professionals and if you think you might have depression from these  manuals go and talk to someone who knows what they are doing. Only after that you can be sure. Really understanding how the criteria works and the best way to go about treating take years of training. It is not something everyone can do. 

If you don’t seem to have depression but still feel really bad something else may be wrong. People can still feel very bad even without depression. Go talk with an expert. Nobody should be needing to feel this way.

852,I need help asking my dad to see a therapist,"Thinking it over, I really need to see a therapist or my grades might suffer. I have a thought that I possibly have ADHD and quarantine just brought it to light. However, we're pretty fucking poor. And my mom has health issues (or supposedly she goes to all these special doctors trying to find out what's wrong with her). I can't do it anymore. I can't continue to sacrifice myself for my parents. Even if I don't have ADHD I have PMDD which is generally getting better but it still fucking sucks. 

Besides money, there's another huge road block. My dad doesn't believe I'm mentally ill. Even tho I've been struggling with it since 8th grade. And I have no idea how to convince him because this man doesn't even think I'm physically disabled when I use a fucking WHEELCHAIR. 

I just need like Idk, maybe a few general statements so I feel prepared? That would be helpful. Thanks"
853,Has your therapist checked up on you since the pandemic started?,"I usually see my therapist once a month (used to be every week, but things have been a lot better since I started with her), and we had an appointment set in March but once all the lockdowns started I obviously canceled it. 

She asked me once right at the beginning if I would want to do phone appointments, but I have a bit of phone anxiety so I said I would prefer not to. She replied no problem and that she understood. 

That was mid-March, and it’s been about 8 months and she hasn’t checked on me at all. Not to see if Ive changed my mind about phone appointments, not a quick text to see how I am (and she primarily has texted in the past to confirm appointments etc so I feel like it’s very easy for her to shoot a quick 10 second text). 

For some reason, this has kind of left a bitter taste in my mouth, like she really doesn’t care at all how I am unless she’s being paid. It feels extremely cold and transactional. Of course, I know that’s her job so I can’t tell if I’m just being overly sensitive (which I know is one of my problems). Or maybe she hasn’t reached out because I was already doing relatively well mentally before I stopped seeing her? 

So I was wondering for those of you who haven’t been able to see your therapist since all this started, have they reached out to you at all? Do you think this is just her being professional, or is it a bit cold?"
854,"My Uncle needs help, and I have no clue how to;","Hi, my uncle is quite young and rather close in age cause my mom had me so young. (I'm 18, my uncle is 24.) My uncle was only ever homeschooled without a driver's license and never really had any friends in his life, besides really me, he has a few online friends he plays video games but I'm not sure if he's close to them. I'm pretty sure he has never gotten a highschool diploma or a GED, and he's never been to a job before. He's always lived alone in my grandparents house, he's never been rude to them but they baby him and give in when it comes to certain things I'll talk about.

I'm no psychologist, but I'm pretty sure he has severe anxiety, depression, and OCD. He always HAS to have the blinds closed and doors closed, if they're open than he had to have the lights off to keep anyone from potentially looking in. If I come over and play games with him and I touch so much as a cracker; Everytime even with my own controller I have to wash my hands, a napkin won't do. He hates when I or anyone sits and eats in the living room so eats not seen at the top of the stairs on the end of the railing in front of the bathroom to not get crumbs on the carpet. I don't give in and my grandmother tells me I'm fine as to not encourage that behavior, however sometimes she DOES have me eat in an another room entirely and gives in. He gets depressed when I don't talk to him and see him ( and I do love to see him but I'm always busy with college work), but I try to encourage him to see me more often by having him download some sort of social media so I can talk to him (he only has an iPod, not a phone so I can't text him that way.) But he makes up excuses and when I ask why he never does (I even try to show him how to do it), he says he genuinely doesn't know why he doesn't get an account  and drops the topic whenever I try to encourage him to get something to talk with me. He used to be able to bare being with my cousins, though they are prone to not really being big on hygiene when it comes to eating, (They may not wash they're hands or use a napkin but they're teens now and are getting better at it.) But he genuinely will make excuses not to see them anymore ever when they're there as to not get anything, ""dirty"". He now hides in his room whenever they come over or says he's sick when they invite him over. I try to get him to come to some of my concerts and plays or just go out where he doesn't necessarily have to talk to people, like go on a walk and he refuses. 

My grandma tries to encourage him to go to a psychologist but he refuses that too, (I mean legally she can't force him now.) I have no clue what to do, how can my family help him get better? I feel horrible watching him throw his life away being stuck inside playing games. (He had an inspiration of becoming a cop and going outside, I think he's too afraid to.) He WANTS to do more than play games as he's told me before countless times, (not that there's anything wrong with having a job of playing games or having it as a hobby, he just genuinely does it every single day all day without having it as a job or a hobby), It just breaks my heart seeing him go through this while he refuses help."
855,I think I've developed panic disorder?,"Last night I had or I thought I had an asthma attack, but it turns out it was a panic attack. Very first severe one. God, I won't forget the horrible feeling that I was going to die on the way to the hospital. I was conscious but I didn't feel like I was there (idk if that makes sense). My cries for help, gasping for air, and my shaking in my sisters lap probably scared her. Not even one hour ago I had another attack but less severe. Can anyone with panic disorder give me some advice?!?!?? I don't understand why I'm like this all of the sudden, and it's confusing me so much."
856,Idk what to title this,"TW 
Sorry I feel like I don’t have anyone else to talk to or who would take me seriously. I can’t live with my family anymore. I’ve never got on well with my mum because she is a narcissist, but being stuck inside with her 24/7 due to lockdown and then losing my job has made it so much worse. She constantly degrades me and makes me feel so awful about myself knowing I have a history of suicidal thoughts and self harm and she pretends like she’s there for me but she’s the one person who’s made me feel the worst in my life. Recently my dad has started siding with her and being horrible and I need out but I’m jobless I’m only 21 and I’m scared and idk what to do. I feel like if I didn’t get pet rats recently to keep me sane I would have killed myself because I’m so trapped. My anxiety’s awful that I hate leaving the house but I can’t stand to be here. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get out of this situation. I’m thinking I will most likely have to rehome the rats because I need to leave and I’m gonna be homeless so can’t take them with me which makes me sad because they gave me purpose and I reallt love them. Has anyone else gone through anything similar. There’s no one I can stay with I’m on my own here. I’m in England btw"
857,Feeling anxious,"My previous semester didn't go too well. And this semester just started and I am already feeling overwhelmed. I just do not believe in myself. I just don't think I can do it but I don't wanna drop out of college either. 

During the semester break I managed to get my feelings under control through regular workout but now classes are taking up my time and I can feel my mental health going down again. Maybe it's time I looked for a therapist?"
858,How possible it is for me to develop schizophrenia later in life? (more in description),"Basically I have pretty bad genetics. My uncle and grandmother had schizophrenia and my psychiatrist told me I showed ""potentially very early stages"". I was pretty paranoid for a long time in my earlier childhood and I was diagnosed with depression. Now im 18 and I worry about my future. My life hasnt really got any better and I feel like it will go downhill a lot when I'll finish uni and leave my parents house. I basically have 0 friends and I dont think that will change (its not just my issue, 70% of people I knew either didnt understand me or were toxic). 

And yes, I know schizophrenia isnt 100% genetical."
859,are mentally ill people aware that they’re mentally ill?,"why do people in my real life think i’m mentally ill? i have a degree, i used to have jobs, i take care of myself and i have many friends/acquaintances, so why do people around me are convinced that i need help?"
860,Head Space!!,"Can anyone relate??
I feel an emptiness, loneliness, I'm just not me. Somedays I wonder do I really know who I am, what is expected of me, mostly what is taught of me?
I get up and go to work, i do my job well. I give more than what is ask, for a lot of reasons.
I want to be seen as being the best i can, i want to be like. Why this matters to me i can't explain but in my head it makes sense. I go from caring too much about something it consume my every taught, my whole day, my nights sleep or lack off it. Then other days i don't care, I don't care for life. I think of how i can end it all. This taught also consumes my head, i want every detail covered, from leaving my room easy to back up when I am gone, to having saved enough for the burial. Then there is the how my first taught is to hang but where? The option of an overdose has cross my mind but it doesn't work then there is a chance I'll still be here. Now it seems i get these taught my often like if I'm driving the car and i see a wall or lake i think if i just drive straight in. Ive always like to set goals in my head to achieve, one of them was to have a family, i think now if i havent meet someone to do this with in a certain time then i am definitely meant to. That I'm not for this world. I do believe in reincarnation, maybe this isn't my time, maybe I am made for a different generation. 
You see I've been told i have the ability to make others smile, laugh and I am a constant joker, always up for the craic but on the inside it is different. Some days I think I could win an Oscar, no one can really tell how my mind is working or how my soul is empty.
[ ] It makes me think well maybe this is where i belong, then i think well I've done my bit now. I've made more than enough peoples day with my ""pleasant smile"" I'm tired now, i need a rest from it all."
861,I don’t feel good enough,"I’ve been in a relationship for almost 17 months now. He has cheated on me about 3 or 4 times but it’s been well over a year now. Back in May we took a week break and we pinky promised each other not to flirt with anybody or anything, he broke that promise and ever since all that happened, i’ve had huge trust issues. Along with being manipulated by my prior boyfriend for about 3 years on and off. I don’t feel good enough, i ask for reassurance and he says he’s not good at it. He made me learn communication, but once i got good at it, he stopped communicating. Whether I communicate or not, he gets upset at me. Recently, he went to a Halloween party without me (college party), mind you i would’ve been completely fine with it if he didn’t tell me he didn’t want me there. I had our costumes ordered and everything, i wanted us to be that one super cute couple that are matching, ya know? Well that night everything added together and during every fight, he makes everything my fault, etc. I attempted to kill myself Saturday night. I’m super depressed and have no idea what to do. I’ve been in therapy but the only therapist that has been able to help me has no openings :( SO, if you were able to follow along and understand what i’m tryna say, can you please help me?"
862,Struggling with contradicting beliefs,"I’ve had this problem for two months now and I don’t know what to do. During Mid-August I went to a Pentecostal Church for the first time and saw people being touched on the head or had holy water poured on their head, after that they’d fall to the floor and speak in tongues. During that time I stayed and watched because I was interested in what the preacher was saying. Although I didn’t like a lot of what was said, I was still interested certain things being said. Later that evening, I started crying because I saw the way my friend was being held by her mother and I thought about how beautiful it was that you could love someone like that. The preacher saw me crying and took it as an opportunity to help me, so he asked me to stand up. So I stood up not aspecting anything to happen, he did this blowing motion on me and I felt this sudden calmness and fell back in my seat. During that time, I disassociated and felt like everything was blissful but ominous at the same time. I didn’t enjoy it one bit. I tried asking what happened to me and kept being told that it was the Holy Spirit, which was an answer that I didn’t really find satisfying to hear. Being told that also made my anxiety go up by a lot, I felt like there was a more logical answer for what was going on there. I’d also like to add that I come from a native traditionalist background and this happening caused a lot of conflicting beliefs. Because of that, I keep having thoughts that maybe Christianity is the truth and my beliefs are wrong. I don’t want that to be true and I’ve cried multiple times because of it. I’m afraid that maybe Jesus or God will punish me for not practicing Christianity, specifically the Pentecostal branch. I’m so scared and I’m scared of Pentecostal Christians because of it. I’ve met with people that practice a different sect of Christianity and I’m fine with them but specifically the people that I know are Pentecostal make me uneasy. Apart of me knows this might be irrational but I can’t shake these feelings and thoughts off. I’m afraid I might become a full-on Christian because of this but at the same time I have no interest in becoming a Christian. Please help."
863,Tips for combatting increased appetite?,"Here’s the dealio: I am about a year and a half on medication, and it has been fantastic for my mental health. Mood-wise, I feel like an entirely different person, but one main thing I’ve noticed is weight gain. I’m guilty of gaining the quarantine-15, but my weight gain had started before that, and I attribute it to my medication. I’m trying to be stricter about my diet and exercise, but I’m hungry—all—the—damn—time. Does anyone have similar experiences? Or have any tips?"
864,Advice for bf’s mental health?,"Is there any way I can help him? It feels like anything I say just makes it worse or he’s not receptive. Right now it just seems like he’s on a path of just anger and sadness. I’ve done some things wrong that have made this feel worse for him. I know it’s the small things that break the camels back right? 
The issues he’s having is he feels like he puts in way more effort and loyalty into his family and into his people and they are either abusing that or don’t give the same thing back to him. 

I currently live really far away so I can’t physically be there but any advice? Any way I should portray myself? What do I say? I just need help, and if this was just a blur of words I’ll try to explain to anyone who asks"
865,Needing a new bad habit?,"I have bad anxiety, to the point it causes me to just switch off and blank or I need to be doing something anything but nothing at the same time.. I recently kicked my habit of biting my nails for the first time where it actually seems I've done it successfully.. the only issue is now I find myself dissociating more frequently or having the urge to do something anything, like smoke even though I'm not a smoker... and during these phases I sweat and my heart rate spikes and my temperature rises... is this something anyone else has experienced or am I just strange? also any ideas of any habits I can pick up that won't damage my health like smoking would!"
866,All the time I am betrayed,By the people most close to me and whose opinion mean the most. I feel like a silly girl. It hurts so much and I really need to move on with my life and let go of all this shit and people and just disappear
867,people are out to get me (intrusive thoughts),"I have reoccurring intrusive thoughts that people are out to ruin my life. it could be an old friend, a teacher who doesn’t like me, a coworker from over a year ago, etc. it makes maintaining relationships so difficult. 

i’ve been wanting to unfriend some toxic people on social media for a while and i used this election as an excuse. i basically pretended their politics (more right than i) offended me and i unadded them over that. 

i’m so paranoid they’re going to try to kill me or blackmail me or something. i know this isn’t schizophrenia or something bc i know it’s crazy but idk what it is. please help me. i can’t eat. cant sleep. cant even get off my phone waiting to see if they message me to threaten me. help me. idk what to do."
868,Had my first therapy appointment today after scheduling it 3 months ago. Now my next appointment isn’t until late December.,"Honestly i’m not sure what to do, and I don’t think there is much I can do. While my problems aren’t very severe and I’m not an immediate threat to myself or others, I feel like I just can’t keep waiting for progress like this. I feel like I possibly have high functioning depression because i’ve been feeling like this for 2 1/2 years now, but I definitely feel like I can’t do it for another 2.5. I am also concerned about the amount of time it will take to make progress in therapy. 

I know that people say that making true change takes time but I feel like I don’t have that time anymore. I’ve been trying so hard to just keep my life together and stop it from getting any worse but I feel like I can’t keep doing that forever, ya know? Honestly, even though I don’t think my depressive symptoms are that bad and it is high functioning, I kinda want to cheat and possibly see a psychiatrist so I can just speed up the process. Is this that bad of an idea. What if i’m not depressed enough for meds but I end up getting put on them anyways, could it mess me up? 

People say that therapy takes time, but I feel like I don’t have time. I feel like if I don’t get better soon then it will start to have some major impacts in my life. I don’t want to come off to my therapist, who I just met today, or possibly a psychiatrist if I end up seeing one that i’m just drug seeking but that’s low key kinda what i’m trying to do."
869,Do I have a mental illness?,"Hi, I’m 18 turning 19 and I have a big problem. I find it hard to concentrate, i just can’t do chores and can’t pick myself up and study for a test. It bores me to death and I just don’t understand how it’s so easy for my friends to concentrate. Besides that I forget words, I know two languages (Romanian being my native language and English being my second language). When I am talking I am usually end up combining the two of them. I would forget words like “house” or “lobster” and end up saying them in English instead. I easily get angry and even the slightest sound can make me jump and scream (not that I am scared, I’m just easily surprised), I am terrified of butterflies and moths, insects in general scare me but butterflies and moths are on another level. I need to mention that I have hashimoto’s disease and that all my aunts and my mother have a anger issue. 
Thank you for your help 🤗"
870,Why does is feel like my life is already over?,"Im only 21 but it feels like I'm not going anywhere in life. People tell me I'm young and I have lots of potential to succeed but I just feel like I won't and feel like life isn't worth living. Its just the same old routine with nothing really going for me. Because I've seen for some people it really doesn't get better. And I feel like that's just how I'm going to end up and it just makes me so unmotivated to keep going. I wanna live but at the same time I just don't want to exist anymore. Life feels like a big chore. When I was 16 I thought I wouldn't even see age 21, at 21 I feel like I won't be alive by the time I'm 25. I don't know, I just don't want to be here anymore"

872,My mental health jouney - 19 yr old male from uk suffering from panic disorder and bipolar disorder,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-w\_aT\_4xkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-w_aT_4xkw)
873,i don’t even know if this has anything to do with mental health but this is the only place i can think of to ask,"okay so i’m 16 and this has been happening for as long as i can remember. if i’d give an estimate, since i was 7.

whenever it’s night and i’m on my bed trying to fall asleep, i sometimes get this anxious feeling and almost day dreaming about like a huge difference in size, i don’t know exactly how to explain it but like some scenario where i’m extremely small compared to something else, it always involves a huge boulder, for example a huge ball of stone just crashing into a flat grass field when i’m standing on it, bouncing around.

it doesn’t even have to be big as in size, it can be big as in time frame, for example i remember one time after the boulder landing on the ground without bouncing just watching people slowly dig away at this massive rock.

this always makes me feel depressed and sad and hopeless and anxious.

this whole thing probably sounds really dumb but the only time i’ve ever mentioned it was to my mom several years ago but she didn’t think of it much and neither do i.

this is not a regular occurance, when i was 7-12 it happened maybe 1-5 times a year.

it’s 1 am and it just happened to me for the first time in 4 years

as i’ve been typing this i’ve had major goosebumps and this weird uneasy feeling, i don’t get the goosebumps in the dream things

this is all over the place but during the things im just really distressed, as if it’s a nightmare, im very uneasy, anxious and sad. this usually happens from when im resting (not asleep) until i wake up.

it doesn’t bother me much but i’m just curious on wtf it is, as far as i know there’s no one else i know that has this.


also there was one time where i wasn’t even the small thing, i didn’t even exist, it was just a still picture of the massive boulder again just hanging to an overhang of a cliff with just one piece of tape and for some reason i can’t get that picture out of my head, i can’t get any of the dreams out of my head, it’s not like they’re stuck on my mind all the time i just have never forgotten the dreams."
874,Who else experiences waves of crippling anxiety?,"Hey guys, so I could really use some help, advice or kind words. I have a long history of depression and anxiety, medication, therapy. I’ve actually been managing my depression and anxiety for the past few years, had a child, experienced a lot of hardships and handled it very well. I now am experiencing really bad and sometimes crippling anxiety, it’s sporadic and random. It comes in waves.

It’s come to a point where I am almost running home to hide from the world because I feel so vulnerable as empathic towards anyone I come in contact with. I’m afraid of negative conversations because my mind set is very sensitive towards anything negative. Just someone talking about death or sadness makes my mind spiral down a dark hole. It’s affecting my relationships and job, anyone experience this and know of a way to keep my anxiety levels at bay?

Thank you."
875,Awake ar 2am,"Yeah.. It's two am in here and I'm wide awake trying to figure out ways to get contact with anybody that could give me medical advice and renew my med prescriptions. I've been trying to do that for about month now but apparently all cell lines are blocked with people getting advice on covid. Sleeping problems came back last week. So did my weird ass dreams, either it's violent or extremely sexual ones. Can't remember which it was this time but I only got like four hours of sleep. Not excited to go to work in my loud and social workplace. It feels like heaven to get home everyday to silence. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still doing relatively fine. I haven't gotten extreme depressive episodes or anger, but unfortunaly I feel like it's close even if I feel relatively ""steady"". I don't really feel like I'm in a bad place enough place yet to need active help but if you guys would have few encouraging words for me that would be nice. Hopefully everyone else is doing better"
876,I’m thinking of making a mental health related app and would like some suggestions.,"Heyo! I’ve been wanting to make an app for a while, and I’ve also struggled with mental health for a while, and it hit me. My goal is to try and make a mental health app that has different mental health disorders that each have their own way of helping. I can’t exactly put it into words, but an example would be for someone with depression, they would go into the app, click on the depression section, and then be able to pick from a selection of things that could help them. I have a few issues with this plan, though I think I could work it out, which is why I’m here. I don’t know which mental health disorders to include in the app and what I could put in the sections. Obviously everyone is different, but some general things that could help would be good. 

I’m essentially asking for some suggestions on which mental health disorders I should include in the app and what should I add into the sections for those mental health disorders?

877,"Mother struggling with mental illness, refuses to seek help","I'm 14 years old and for the past few years I've been struggling with my Mother's constant deteriorating mental state. I remember when i was a child, she was happy and enjoyed life. Nowadays she tends to be distant and cold, only focusing on her own issues. She constantly accuses my father, whom i have lived with since November of last year, of many things. This could be cheating, poisoning her, trying to poison me and my brother, or our animals.   


I remember this conversation i had with her a year ago about how she had someone or something telling her something, about how she was special, and how i wouldn't understand it. This confused me back then, but now i can understand what was happening. I feel as if she struggles with psychosis and paranoia, among other things. This manifests itself in auditory hallucinations, as i just mentioned, the feeling that strong events can have a huge meaning, such as little things that my dad might've said to her, as one of our animals had gotten hold of a rat somehow, and she misinterpreted that as him calling her a dead rat.   


Here i am, in the middle of this. I spent a week straight last night listening to this, all of it, from my room. I wholly understand that it is not my mothers fault that she struggles with these conditions, she has a long history of stress and abuse, which i personally believe is the cause of this. About yesterday, when things came to a head, one thing lead to another, and my mom was removed from our house for 3 days.  


Yesterday, in an angry rage, i assume having some sort of episode while we were out in the town over  trying to get help for her, she throws some of my dad's stuff out the window, puts his clothes in a basket where she dumps vinegar into it, and puts some sort of powder into the engine of his work vehicle, that isn't even his. I feel that she thinks she's completely justified in this, as she feels that she was in danger just staying with him.   
 My biggest fear is that she wont get the help that she direly needs, and instead comes back worse than before. The fact that i feel little emotion while writing this means I'm very desensitized to this sort of thing, having to deal with it for years. I hope to seek advice and sympathy for my situation. Any questions will be answered.  


TLDR: My parents argue, i feel as if my mother struggles with some sort of disorder that distorts her perception of reality. Recently, she had an angry rage, destroyed stuff, and she is now in some sort of facility."
878,i cant laugh genuienly,"i cant laugh anymore. from what i found on quora it says it has something eith aging to do, but im only 14. why cant i laugh? how can i start laughing again? ive always been such a happy person and laughing was a huge part of my life. whats wrong with me?"
879,My Meds story,"I never wanted to be reliant on any substance nor on medication. The idea of being on meds for the rest of my life really upsets me, but more so because they still haven’t been stabilized and I HATE the effect these changes have had on my body and mind. 


I was first placed on lexapro and klonapin after depakote knocked me on my ass. I stayed on this up until the midpoint of this year, where I was placed on lithium, seroquel and half a tablet of the lexapro. I actually felt pretty decent with this medication combo. Unfortunately my lithium levels read low, and my thyroid level high. They moved me to trileptal and increased my seroquel. I thought the depakote was rough. I couldn’t feel awake until 6-7pm each day. I was beyond depressed but now, I feel like I’m right back to my mixed episodes. They just lowered my trileptal and seroquel while increasing my lexapro - well I feel more suicidal so that means they’ll probably  change it again. 


I know it could be way worse but I really expected to have my meds normalized since it’s been a year now. I’m doing my behavioral therapy part religiously, I just wish my medication situation can be fixed."
880,I just had a full on anxiety attack at 1 am..... over hot chocolate??,"So, I have this really silly mental health trigger. 

I get extraordinarily anxious/stressed when I can’t find something that I just *KNOW is here SOMEWHERE*

Everyone gets a bit stressed when they can’t find their keys and they need to go somewhere, but this is on another level. 

I’ll try to explain it. 

Say you’re looking for scissors to open a package. And you can’t find your scissors. This would be a mild inconvenience for most people, and they would just find a knife. 

For me, I will heavily fixate on the scissors. Even if a knife will do. I could even use a knife to open the package and then immediately go back to my frantic search for the scissors. And I will get more and more stressed, to a completely unreasonable degree, until I find the scissors. I will start to cold sweat and hyperventilate and pace and compulsively run my hands through my hair or wring my hands or scratch my head or other compulsive behaviour. I will do illogical things like check and re-check the same cupboard or drawer over and over and over, even though I logically KNOW I’ve checked and the item is not in that place. 

In this specific instance, I spent 20 minutes looking for this stupid pot of hot chocolate because “THINGS DONT JUST DISAPPEAR” 

And my constant pacing, opening and closing of cupboards and hyperventilating eventually woke my friend (who is currently crashing on my sofa for a few weeks). She told me that she had used the last of it and that’s why it was gone. She apologised profusely for this and I said it was fine and had to explain my insanity. Very embarrassing and she must think I’m crazy now and feels an unwarranted amount of guilt over a pot of bloody hot chocolate! 

This is all a very long winded way of asking, is there a name for this? Does anyone else experience this? Are there any strategies that help? 

Thanks,

J"

883,Life is pointless. Nothing excites me anymore.,I just see ugliness. I hate life so much that I don’t have any reason I want to fight. Today I kept having suicidal ideation after I told myself it’s going to be a good day. I did some of my favorite things where I live and the whole time I kept thinking about ways to die at the moment. I went on a fun ferry and secretly the whole time I wanted to jump. And I kept thinking about jumping off this one spot on an island today where there was no people. I am scared I’ll fail and it will be crazy painful.

886,"Feeling like life isn’t worth it, how do I make it better?","Hi there, sorry for the long post. 

I’ve been struggling with depression, ocd, and anxiety for years, as well as a lot of food/eating related issues. I know throwing up and starving myself is terrible, but it sometimes feels like the only thing I can control in my life. Lately during the corona lockdown and the limited socializing going on, I have also been feeling really lonely and spend hours of the day crying. I started living alone about two weeks before the lockdown after a breakup, and it hasn’t been an easy adjustment. 

I do a good job of putting on a smile and very happy attitude, but all day long I think about how worthless my life feels. I love my family too much to act on my suicidal thoughts, but I also don’t know how to make myself feel like life is worth it. I have a therapist, but I don’t know how to bring these things up. Some part of me feels like I almost don’t want to get better because I don’t make any effort to help myself. I think a lot of my depression comes from existential thoughts that I can’t shake. How do I make myself feel like life is worth living? Is it a fake it til I make it kind of thing?"
887,What is wrong with me?,"I've been struggling with some kind of sadness for almost a year now. There have been happy times, memories and thoughts but when I'm left alone, I feel empty, sad and useless. AND of course I've been thinking about killing myself constantly.

I study in one of my countries best colleges (top 3) and I've taken this semester off cause I couldn't bare moving on without trying to learn and then ruining my GPA. 
I tend to ignore my messages and I answer them too late. 
All I do during the day is managing a fanpage on Instagram. Actually I put all of my time, resourses, focus and energy on this page to the point where I spend 48 hours straight making a mouth-dropping post for my followers.
I really want to do everything that I have postponed. I want to study, learn more about my major, find a job, lose some weight, read books, watch movies and learn art but instead I spend the whole day on my page. you see, I am trying to emphasize that I have interests I just don't have courage or energy to do them. I constantly ignore them untill it's bed time and then I start to think about my mental health prblms, searching it up a bit and redditing about it (it's 5:43am here). Every night I feel sleepy but I don't want to sleep cause I know that tomorrow will be the same. I will spent the whole day fangirling, checking Instagram and surfing the net. It's the only thing that make me feel good and bad at the same time.
There are times I want to leave the fanpage too and just have absolutely nothing to do at all.

I've always been a fangirl but I've never been this obsessed iny life. I have never been able to keep my life balanced but it has reached it's peak and I am not changing it.
I used to have many responsibilities in the college but I've cut all of them off and I spend most of my time avoiding my friends. When I try and meet them, I can have fun and they make me genuinely happy. 


I feel like I'm being lazy and I'm running away from my responsibilities. My family keeps telling me that. That this whole saddness thing is cause by the quarantine. But subconsciously I'm trying to find a reason to find what is wrong with me. If it's depression or not. I want it to be depression so I can blame everything on that and then be sure that there IS a way out, there is a way to heal and be normal and functioning again. I also feel like I'm just seeking attention by playing the victim here and I am deliberately trying to act like a depressed person to seek out love and attention. In order not to be blamed...

Well at the end, I have to tell you that I am seeing a therapist and I'm working on myself a bit.
But I Just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me.
Please someone admit that it's depression...

I'm a mess 🤦🏻‍♀️"
888,I might have an ed,"Uhh how do I start


Well, I was talking to a friend other day and he said that what I told him is very close to an ed. Now I don't wanna hurt anyone with an actual eating disorder here, I'm just confused, please understand that.


So, basically I told him that there's some phrases that are stuck in the back of my head all the time. They are: ""we eat to live, they live to eat"" from RJ, the animal from over the edge. Ik, it sounds ridiculous that a phrase from a children's cartoon caused me to think I might have an ed, but this sentence is everywhere I go, everytime I want to eat, that I'm hungry, that I need food. It's annoying. It's scary, scary how much it bothers me. The second one idk where I saw it but it's: ""you're not hungry, kids in africa are hungry, you're just greedy for food"". That one, that one broke me. It truly did. It was what made me not eat for twenty two hours, what made me starve for real. I needed food, but did I? Did I really needed it? Is it fair that I get it eat every four hours and be such a horrible person, and there's people who can't eat all day long? No it's not. Then I probably should just starve. That's what I think sometimes. Ik it's bullshit, ik it's not true, but just because you know you're colorblind doesnt mean you can see the colors. (Quote from empty, jaidens animation) 


And maybe I'm completely wrong, and I'm just a needy stupid girl, who can't control herself. That's probably it. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with a real ed, I just wanted those fucked up thoughts to get outta my head."
889,"""Positive"" behaviours/thoughts (with time) turning into anxiety-inducing ""rules""/compulsions? [ADHD, ADD, anxiety]","YMMV. My context: I have ADHD-PI (diagnosed as an adult), and a very analytical mind that was recently diagnosed as ASD, though I'm still unsure.

I was obsessive-compulsive as a child but noticed my behaviour and quit it—tbh I think I may just have driven it underground, internalised it? Much as I did with the ""hyperactive"" part of ADHD.

*****

I've long tried to deal with anxiety by reasoning around it + taking up ""relaxing"" behaviours.

Here's the issue: I find that while this strategy can work sometimes, it also VERY OFTEN ends up becoming part of the problem.

E.g.: meditation? It's great while it's novel, but after awhile I find that the practice has turned into a set of internal compulsions? I find myself sitting in a certain chair + looking at a certain point + doing a certain breathing exercise + trying to cast my mind to a certain place, but now it's so full of anxious expectation that I often end up feeling more frustrated than when I started.

(*Of course I notice this, too, and try to NOT have expectations, to change things up a bit, to ""*be in the moment*"" as they say...but no, once I'm in this headspace it's very hard to break out!*)

This applies also to music, exercise, and hobbies (incl. video games like Minecraft).

The anxiety/compulsion always ""finds a way"" to get me. Paradoxically, it almost seems to work better —to some extent— if I don't really ""try"", if I let myself be impulsive, then I am really truly ""in the moment""...

It's a balancing act! A very tricky one.

*****

The same thing happens with ""positive thinking"", like...the first time I catch myself in a spot of pessimism and take action to correct it? Great. But it gradually ""shifts"" over time into a thing where that ""positive"" thinking actually *feels* ""negative"", i.e. compulsive. Almost like a drug where tolerance builds up and leads into a vicious cycle.

To illustrate in a different way, it's kinda like [semantic satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation), where you say a word repeatedly (*banana banana banana banana banana banana ...*) till you're no longer aware of the word's significance/meaning, really, but only the act of saying it?

Does anyone else have this experience?"
890,(TW) I don't know how to tell my closest friends that my mental health had gotten worse.,"For the past few years I've been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. And I can tell that my mental health has drastically improved since the diagnosis, but then drastically declined in the last year. I assume this decline has happened to many people though.

Basically, I've been wanting to tell my closest friends that I have gotten worse. I can't even tell my therapist about me thinking about hurting myself without her being required to tell my parents, so I need to tell someone. 

My friends all have similar disorders to me, so I assume they would understand, but most of the time they aren't the types to openly talk about that kind of stuff. 

I know for a fact at least one or two of them have it worse than I do. I don't want to come off as whiny or anything. 

I'm just nervous that they'll think lesser of me, but I think they'll support me. They did for my diagnosis, so it probably will go well and I'm just overthinking it."
891,Vivid Nightmares,"So I have vivid nightmares pretty much every night and I almost always remember them. I had a particularly bad one last night (it was quite gory so I won’t go into it) and I told my boyfriend. This is the first time I’ve mentioned this to someone and apparently it isn’t normal. Bf wants me to get some help for it and I agree, it’s at the point where I’m waking up and having panic attacks.

Does anyone know why this is happening? They started towards the end of a three year emotionally abusive relationship, but I honestly thought I’d resolved the PTSD that came from that. I’m also on antidepressants and have restless leg syndrome, so maybe it’s that?

Idk I’d appreciate any information and advice possible really because a lot of these dreams are really traumatising. Thank you. ♥️"
892,I feel like I'm burnt out,"I'm a 15 year old who just started sophomore I have been trying to write for MONTHS now, I used to be able to write daily and write pages, now I can't even get past the first line on a doc before deleting it and then not doing anything with it. I was on a good drawing streak but now everything looks like shit and I haven't finished anything in weeks. I do group DND weekly and can participate in that fine but I feel lackluster compared to everyone else, I keep having weird episodes where I blank out for hours just watching videos and then I don't even remember what I was doing I was just sitting there. Everything I use to cope (writing, drawing mainly) feels like it's worthless and whatever I put down sucks and I can't get ideas out I form them but then whenever I start it looks horrible and I hate it and delete it and keep deleting things and I keep trying to force something to be done but it all looks so terrible I feel like a let down and I want to draw or write to get my mind off of it but then I can't and I used to be half decent but now I'm so shitty and I don't know what the hell is going on."
893,I don’t want to go back to the mental health system,"I get irritated so easily at work, I can’t seem to get any of the tasks in personal life I need to finish done, I wake up at 5am and still leave for work almost late, I have to write anything I need to buy down and then also make sure I keep in mind that I had a list. I don’t feel like my work breaks are actually breaks because they’re timed. I used to be able to multitask well at school and now I need to remind myself I’m doing a second task in between interruptions. I pick at my skin until it gets worse so I have acne and when it starts to clear up a bit I end up picking again. I drink a lot of caffeine just to get through the day and sometimes I binge eat. It took a lot of time but I’m finally starting to kick alcohol even though it’s been almost a year since I first said I wanted to stop. I’m struggling to lose the 25 lbs I gained from meds and alcohol. I’ve never been able to work full time without taking a lot of sick days because I just “can’t handle” work and I have a hard time explaining why.

I have no idea what to do for a career because I hate retail and even the things I love are really not getting done like music and art, I barely those now.
I’m 23F have no kids, no close friends and no partner. I’m lonely, but at the very least I have no excuses as a result for why I can’t lose weight, can’t get my apartment clean, can’t work on my music and art more.
Just a full time retail job that I call in sick to a lot. I’m sure people at work are starting to think I’m just such a bitch. I’m scared I’ll get fired.

I was diagnosed bipolar but I’m not entirely sure I have that. I got suicidal last night thinking I have misdiagnosed ADD and that mental health won’t help me unless I take more bipolar meds and end up gaining even more weigh. Just hopeless and thinking no one and nothing will help me and it’s only a matter of time before I’m unable to work.
I cycled through different eating disorders since I was 12 and right now I am the heaviest I’ve been in years and I can’t starve myself as easily anymore but I’m irritable whether I’m eating enough or not. Like I said I drink a lot of caffeine as well to function. I can’t save any money just because of my poor eating habits. I buy overpriced snack foods and sometimes throw a lot of it away. I’m only managing to stay sober out of guilt. I talked to my mom and she believes I don’t have ADD but whether I have that or not I need to go back to mental health.

The psychiatrists won’t quit trying to give me seroquel and lithium, the therapist I was seeing wasn’t very helpful and I honestly felt like I couldn’t talk to her. If I had a problem she wanted to refer me to someone else, if I accomplished something she would just ask me what I wanted to do next and I would just be completely lost. I don’t know what I want to do next after I managed to be 2 weeks sober other than try to be happy about it. So to the therapist I am a disappoint and to the psychiatrists I’m just a bad patient I don’t know what the point in going back there is if there’s nothing they can do except give me meds I don’t want and pointers that don’t help. I’ve been in and out of mental health offices since I was 7 and over the years I don’t think I see how it’s going to help and if it’s my fault then why can’t I just fix it on my own?"
894,Do I really have depression or I’m just desperate for attention?,"Hello I don’t really know how to start this off but, how do I know I’m actually experiencing symptoms and not making them up inside my head?

I’ve been kind of melancholic lately and I can’t pinpoint the exact reason why. Whenever I try to talk to my family or friends about how I feel they usually shrug it off as me having another emotional moment. Even if I try to bring it up in a serious manner, they’ll somehow change the topic into something else so I can’t get any confirmation to what I’m feeling.

I don’t know how to ask for help and if I even need it so I’m resorting to asking Reddit."
895,"At 19, I think I’m starting to realise that what I’m feeling may be more than teenage angst and hormones and I might actually need help","I’ve known somethings up for years now but I’ve always put it down to just hormones and all that shit when your a teenager. Now that being said I understand I’m still only 19 so it could still very much be that, but at this point as an adult I need to realise that hey, maybe the way I’m thinking isn’t normal and there might be something wrong. 

I was kinda s*icidal at around 13-15 but I partially blame media (particularly tumblr lol), and yet I still get these thoughts of killing myself. Now I’m glad I’m in a place where I know I wouldn’t do it, but a couple times a week I still find myself obsessing over the idea of dying and how much easier it would be to just give up.  BUT IM NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING DON’T WORRY! 

I’m also realising so many bad habits and defence mechanisms I have that I can see have ruined so many friendships. Like bruh that’s some toxic behaviour I gotta cut that out. I’m overly emotional, I obsess over anxious thoughts and I just think I’ve had enough :/ 

I’m writing this in a good headspace right now so I’m going to hold myself to it because idk how I’ll feel in a couple days. I’m going to try see how I can get some help because some of the toxic things I do need to just stop and idk how to. I’m going to try get help, find someone professional to talk about these things, because it’s just not an excuse anymore to do nothing."

898,Why do I get so angry over stupid things,"backround: I have anxiety and depression, am currently with a therapist and am a porn addict. Just moments ago, 3 small things happened. I was trying to listen to music but my headphones were sounding really bad for no reason, I was trying to log into Reddit and it wasn't letting me type for a second and I accidentally clicked on an ad. Normally these would not mean much to people, but I started punching things, yelling and I cut myself intentionally as well. I feel like the one that makes most sense was the headphones because music is one of the 3 things that make me feel not miserable, and even then that was completely unnecessary.

900,My mental health (vent),"(this will be pretty scattered ://)

my mental health has been pretty bad since i hit the fifth grade, so it's been about four years now. i cry and get anxious a lot, but the crying is mostly done alone, and the safety of my room. the only times i've ever cried in school were in the bathroom and the time i had a mental breakdown before a presentation in class. my sixth grade year fucked me up badly, as it was ""cool"" to cut yourself and talk about suicide. a guy i really liked told me to go kill myself after trying to ""help"" me with my ""depression"" and claimed that he just snapped and didnt mean it (i have no idea if i was/am just an attention seeker, which is part of why i cant/dont want to rly open up to people about it) 

i'm not sure if i have depression but i'm fairly sure i have anxiety (undiagnosed.) when my thoughts start to spiral my ears start ringing and such, and i begin to cry. lately its just been about grades, school, and people. i've always been a people pleaser and it is so so hard for me to say no or correct someone if it affects them negatively, even when not saying/doing anything will hurt me in the long run. 

i havent been doing something i really enjoy for a long time. i have been drawing here and there but im just not excited to anymore. same thing with reading, although i honestly dont have the time for either anymore. i barely have time to practice the piano or even work out, which makes me even more miserable. im tired and exhausted and just want a day where i can do whatever i want.

i cant open up to anyone, and i honestly dont want to. i dont want to be that fake-depression/anxety person because i dont know if i am. plus what the hell's the point with bothering other people with my problems? i dont want to talk about it, and im not sure i could really put it into words anyways

901,Am I worth it?,"I started taking therapy sessions(two so far), and the day I take them or the moment I take them, I be fine, I feel like I can accomplish something. But over the hours it just fades away. I feel I am spending too my of my parent's money on this and not becoming a better person. I feel worthless. My friends do not care anymore and tell me to go talk to my psychologist if I have any problems, it hurts me and they do not understand. I feel if I take medications, I am going to overdose myself, my friends think they are freaking chocolates and I won't get addicted to it, but I fear I am going to take more of them if my emotions go out of control. I am scared of being here in this world."

903,Trouble Dealing with Loneliness," 

A couple months ago, I started to feel really lonely. I only had one friend irl, and the online friends I had would never talk to me or spend time with me. Since then, I was able to make a decent amount of new friends irl and online that I've become close to. However, this hasn't stopped me from feeling lonely when my friends are busy or it's too late to talk to them.

On top of that, I also feel lonely because I want someone to love me for who I am, and to feel special to somebody. It's been over a year now since my first serious relationship had ended, and I find myself missing the emotions that came with a relationship. It's hard for me seeing the people around me happy with that person who's special to them and not being able to experience those same feelings, good or bad.

This feeling of loneliness is the biggest factor causing me to feel depressed, and I have no idea why it's affecting me so much lately. It has nothing to do with the virus, because I didn't have this many people around me until now. I've been having a lot of issues with feeling unloved and unwanted, and this state of mind is causing me to have dark thoughts and bad dreams as well.

One of the biggest thoughts plaguing my mind is the idea of being all alone. I'm at the age where my friends are all planning on moving away and following their dreams or going to be with the people they love, and I'm constantly worrying about not being able to physically see them. I keep imagining a future where I'm by myself in a dark, empty house, and not being able to spend time with the people I love because they're busy doing what makes them happy or taking care of their own families. And it's not like I wouldn't be happy for them, I just can't stand the thought of having nobody around to spend time with. I want to be there for my friends, and I want them to be here for me too. And I fear that when my friendships become long distance, our connections will weaken and I'll lose them.

I'm not really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. Everyone I've tried talking to about this just tell me not to worry, or they just don't understand why this is such a big deal to me. But I would appreciate if anyone had genuine advice to offer, and even if not, I thank you for taking the time to read my post."
904,I cant remember what I look like,"I’m laying in bed with my eyes closed and suddenly I’m trying to picture myself in this position. But I can’t remember my own face.

I had to actually stop and open my eyes and really think about what I looked like. 
Is this what people call depersonalization? I’ve experienced it before but never knew what it was."
905,How useful are therapist?,"I realize that my mental Heath is pretty much non exexistent, and I was planning on getting a therapist but those cost a lot of money so I need to know if they are worth it."
906,"I dont normally have mental health issues, but this past week leading up to the election has been completely stressing me out",If you are very anxious about the future of this country just know youre not alone and it is only natural but painful to be anxious and worried who gets power in the US.
907,School is hard.,"Throw away account also I just needed to rant somewhere so this might be all over the place. 

I feel like some people don't know how genuinely hard school is for people who struggle with mental health. I'm still in high school and I haven't gotten the chance to be officially diagnosed however I've already talked to my doctor and school psychologist and they've both said I suffer with bad anxiety and possibly depression as well. The end of the first marking period is coming up for me and I'm failing like three of my classes and I have been trying to get caught up on my schoolwork for months now. I also haven't been attending my online classes due to being so anxious over simply being called on even though I know it isn't that big of a deal. I was trying to do at least some of my overdue assignments but I started having an anxiety attack and whenever I tried to keep doing my work I would just start sobbing and not being able to breath. It honestly just sucks being so anxious I feel like I can't even live. I know that I'm supposed to be preparing for my adult life but I don't even know how I'm going to make it out of high school at this point. My classes this year are really hard because I'm in a higher level program that my school system uses. I just wish I didn't have a mental breakdown every single fucking time I try to do anything and I know that I'm going to fail this marking period but I can't even bring myself to care anymore because I'm suffering every second of the day and my parents are too worried about my sleep schedule than the fact that I can't do anything because I'm too scared to do anything even though I know I would feel at least a little bit better if I was caught up in school and attended my classes. It doesn't help that whenever I do complete anything or get caught up in a class I have no sense of accomplishment whatsoever and that paired with my lack of motivation and my anxiety just sucks. Everything sucks. I just want to not have every little thing take so much effort."
908,Need Help Here - Is It PTSD?,"Good day everyone, I am new here. 

I experienced a very shocking event last week. Since then, I would cry for hours everyday when I am reminded of the event. I would start to panic at similar triggers related to the event.  Also, I started experiencing anxiety that never left. I stopped my everyday life to lie on the bed for the whole day since last week.

Is this PTSD, depression, or both? 

Sorry about my bad eng guys. :)"
909,"Had a job interview today. Left halfway through as an anxious, crying, angry mess.","This is the second job opportunity in the last month I've completely fucked up due to anxiety. I don't know what the fucks wrong with me. The questions came flooding in and I just didn't know how to answer, I was completely lost for words, I couldn't stop thinking, couldn't stop fidgeting, looking away, sweating. I was about to burst into tears because it was just too stressful. I ended up saying ""don't worry"" and just walked out the door in tears and into the elevator, which is when I started punching the elevator wall. After I got out, I cried and cried, had a cigarette, burned myself with said cigarette because I'm such a fuck up. Then had to hold myself back from smashing and breaking things... I then went to the museum for some reason and spent the rest of the day walking. I just arrived home like nothing happened.. I was looking forward to talking with my new councilor over the phone and explaining what happened, but he never called. So I figured I'd vent to Reddit, once again."
910,Is there any need to go to a psychiatrist?,"For the past 3 years, I've been showing the signs of both depression and anxiety. I get a small feeling that I should see a psychiatrist to get tested, but I have a stronger feeling that I just don't need to. I probably don't have depression, nor anxiety. I'm probably just going through a long emo phase, or something."
911,I have nobody to talk to and am scared of spiralling into another breakdown,"My loved ones are all going through their own issues, especially my boyfriend who is the person I go to before anyone else if I need support. Nobody is able to give me support because they are struggling so badly with their own problems, they can’t give me 100% into our relationships, which is fine, but it’s gotten to the point where I’m barely speaking to anyone because they all need to be alone. Meanwhile, I’ve struggled heavily with mental illness my entire life, and right now my depression and my anxiety are flaring dramatically and I need someone more than anything. I feel like I’m going to go insane. I’ve broken my nearly 200 day clean streak and relapsed on self harm twice in the last week, I’ve spent hours crying and having some sort of anxiety/panic attack. I’ve felt more lonely than ever before. I am in so much pain and I don’t know how much longer I can take it. I’m forcing myself to sleep all day so I won’t have to face my reality, and during the night I’m trying my best to distract myself but failing because nothing works anymore. Nothing gives me any kind of relief. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I just want it all to stop. There’s no point to this post, I just need to vent and get it all off my chest."
912,I'm gonna lose my fucking mind over the elections [USA],"I'm so stressed, I can't sleep, I can't stop shaking, I can't really calm myself down, and all I can do is watch on in horror as Trump keeps sneaking closer to Biden in the polls. How are y'all handling this shit?"
913,How do I apologise to my girlfriend for the way I’ve been in my current depressive episode?,"So obviously lockdowns been happening for a while now and being stuck at uni accommodation in a room I can’t leave doing lessons fully online with no human contact has made me a bit depressed , I didn’t want to admit it to myself but I’ve realised I’m in the middle of another depressive episode. I’ve became apathetic, I barely get out of bed anymore, my rooms a mess and I have no mental energy to fix it , I’ve been distant to family and friends and my sleeps a mess - I spoke to my girlfriend last night and officially told her about how I’ve been feeling lately , she told me she feels like I’m cutting her out and that she’s worried for me and feels like I’m gonna leave her , since I never message much anymore and I’m either not awake or I’m not responsive online anymore - I tried to assure her I wasn’t going anywhere and we ended the conversation and said goodnight but I know she’s hurting about it all and i don’t know how to apologise - what can I say to her to show her I’m sorry for not telling her how I’ve been feeling and that my feelings for her haven’t changed and that it’s jsut part of my depression. I feel like admitting how I’m feeling and stuff is me making it up as an excuse but I don’t know how to feel anymore and I jsut want her to know that it’s not her fault for the way I’ve been. 

tl: dr- currently in a depressive episode and want to figure out how to apologise for making girlfriend feel cut out and like I’m losing interest"
914,Looking for a diagnosis,"Hello, if possible I was wondering if there are any psychologists that specialise in PTSD, anxiety, and depression? I’m certain I have all of them but I would like some kind of ‘official proof’ to show people as evidence of my disability since my family are not understanding and also for future things such as getting a job and a place to stay. Also I am 17"
915,Is there any reason to go on living if I can't feel emotions? (please read),"I will try and keep this as short and concise as possible, but bare with me as I need to go into some detail about my past. Starting at about the onset of puberty, I began to experience intense social anxiety. The main reason i see for this, was that my parents never asserted much control over my life nor disciplined me in any way, and so I ended up spending the latter half of my childhood years locked to a screen. I wasn't having the sorts of experiences that build character, make you an interesting person, the sorts of experiences that people use to relate to each other. I would hang out with friends occasionally, but most of the time I would dissociate from whatever was going on in my life by watching YouTube videos. I wasn't really learning, or developing my emotional and social skills. I wasnt learning how to problem solve, or how to commit myself to something. How to have intimate relationships with others. I had stronger emotions then, and I was a very happy extroverted kid so my parents never really felt that they needed to push me. But even then I remember never feeling anger, or sadness, never crying, never being able to empathize with someone enough to feel their pain as my own. This was a key developmental period and I didn't utilize it in any way. From then on, I started isolating myself more and more, spending my days in my room instead of being with my family. Not trying to meet new people and build new relationships. Because my parents never disciplined me, I never had any self discipline, so I didn't ever set goals for myself and achieve things. In 7th grade, my stepdad attempted suicide, and I lost it. All innocence and happiness dissipated immediately. I recall not being capable of smiling for that entire year. I didn't feel much, except anxiety and awkwardness. I started smoking weed heavily at 13, which I regret significantly, as it made me feel less. After my two younger siblings were born, my parents didn't really have the time or energy to parent me, so they just kind of let me do my own thing. There was no parenting or mentorship available, so the self-neglectful behaviors only snowballed from there. They didn't know that I was doing nothing with my life, that the hours I spent in my room were being wasted. It's not their fault, I know they were doing the best they could with what they had, but I never learned the necessary life skills that others did. At a certain point, I stopped feeling love mostly. Fast forward to December of freshman year. My social skills were horrible, and I had no friends really. I texted in full punctuated, multi-sentence messages, which turned almost everyone off, and my presence made most people uncomfortable as I radiated anxiety and desperation. Then... I met my soul mate, a friend who I related to on every level of my being. But the relationship was born from and sustained by weed smoking. Heavy, heavy, weed smoking. Sometimes an eighth a day between two people. It made my social anxiety disappear, and I could talk like normal people. I learned how to say stupid silly things, how to be normal I guess. But slowly I stopped caring about school entirely and thinking about the repercussions this would have on my brain. My friend was self-destructive and rarely thought about his future, so I in turn became self-destructive and stopped thinking about my future. Then I came across the teachings of Alan watts and Ram Dass, great spiritual teachers. I was entranced and basically let everything else go, I thought if I transcended my ego, and become desire-less, everything would be okay. I neglected my relationships, stopped doing any school work really and made it my mission to experience reality without the filter of my mind. I wanted to stop thinking. Instead of doing what Ram Dass and Alan Watts REALLY teach, which is fulfilling your roles beautifully just without identitifying with them, by not destroying your ego, (individual identity) but to instead not identify with it, I abandoned my roles and tried to destroy my ego. I became obsessed with the guru stories, particularly the miracles, and developed a very delusional and distorted view of reality. Looking in retrospect, I thinking this was the oncet of drug induced psychosis. I decided to move in with my dad because I didn't want to face my failure in school and in life generally, so I chose to run, believing I would somehow have discipline there. Before moving there, my father had been alone completely alone, crippled by his severe untreated mental illness for over five years. I would go out into woods behind our house every day for sometimes 6-7 hours, and listen to the same spiritual lectures over and over again. I would also smoke extremely large amounts of weed, sometimes up to 12 bowls a day. I was not learning anything else for the twelve months that I was up there. What I thought was meditation, was nothing more than extreme dissociation. I forgot how to think, how to feel. I became incapable of carrying a conversation, and my thoughts became very jumbled. I eventually stopped talking at all. I'd be in the car with my dad, and he'd be talking to me, but I'd just sit there quietly... dissociating. I wanted to exist as pure consciousness, what's referred to in hinduism as the Atman. I was very confused, and mistook my pathological state of mind for a state of transcendence. I had a very delusional notion that I clung to for dear life, that every single thing that happens is predetermined or destined, and thus when I heard about other people's problems or terrible things going on in the world I didn't react emotionally. Eventually, during one of my trips to Seattle that friend I mentioned earlier told me that he smoked fentanyl, and I didn't feel anything. At that moment I knew something was very very wrong with me. I thought that what I wanted, for months, was to exist in a state of thoughtless awareness. But I am 16, there are many many things I need to be thinking about. I started to panic, and over the next few days I came to the conclusion that I had gone completely crazy. Over the course of the next month, I had uncontrollable thoughts brutally dissecting all my memories and using them as evidence that I've always been fucked up, that I've always been crazy. The thoughts told me that I would never get better, that the only option is to commit suicide, that there's no way I'll make it in the world. I felt that my life was completely over. I started to dissociate more and more, my thoughts became more and more incoherent, until I stopped being able to think. I then moved back home, and have been seeking medical care ever since. My thoughts are disconnected fragments that fade out before they ever finish. I'm not able to feel empathy at all, and not only empathy, all other emotions as well. I feel nothing... nothing at all. No happiness or sadness, no fear of love, no pleasure of emotional pain. I also have no access to my memories anymore, what used to be detailed videos in my head are now foggy and minimal. I am hardly able to have a conversation, because a conversation is an exchange of thoughts; if your thoughts are completely incoherent there's no way of connecting with people. If feels like I'm completely on autopilot, like I'm just watching my life go by without any control over it at all, without any control over what I say or do. I can hardly read anymore, as my brain is unable to piece the words together automatically. It feels as though my brain is malfunctioning, and that my mind has nearly disappeared. I know this may be hard to believe, since I'm able to articulate myself so well, but there aren't coherent linear trains of thought which are translating into this writing. Nobody I've explained my situation to really believe the extent of my mental dysfunction because of this. My ability to write elegantly creates the illusion of mental integrity. My question to you is, is this really a life that is worth living? Without emotions, is there any reason at all to go on living? I don't plan on commiting suicide, as it doesn't really solve my problems, so you don't need to comment about that. I just don't see a possible road to recovery. I'm getting a psychiatric evaluation in a month and a half, but all that they can really do is give a name to catagorize my symptoms, prescribe medications which may or may not improve things, and give me a therapist. But talking to someone will not make me feel again, it will not teach me to how to think again. It feels completely hopeless. I would give anything to feel sadness, to just be crippled by sorrow or anger. I regret not appreciating my anxiety more, at least anxiety is a feeling. Please, if you have any advice for me or have experienced something similar yourself, let me know. It would mean more than I can say. Thank you for reading this, god bless."
916,mental/emotional issue with girl,"So, I am pretty much a loner and have been most of my life. I never had a girlfriend, don't really have any friends, never go out anywhere, am a virgin and my life has been constantly between home and work. About two years ago I started chatting with this girl I met on a dating app. We found each other appealing, talked about everything and I told her all my secrets and she pretty much told me everything about her. We didn't meet right away due to some of my phobia such as driving long distance or at night, but due to my loneliness I fell for her right away and due to the fact that I never really communicating this deep with any girl before. A few months ago we finally had our first meeting, and then after that we had two more dates. The first two dates were ok but the 3rd one was pretty bad were we spent an almost enire day together, the date was filled with a lot of awkward silence, forced conversations, and nothing happening due to my lack of social skills, inexperience, and shy, introvert personality. I even slept over at her place but nothing happened. After this 3rd date she said she didn't want to see me again, I understand why, don't really blame her and accept her decision. I tried to reason her with her to continue seeing her even though I knew it was over but she said no. 

The problem I have is I have all these emotions for her, regret what and what didn't happen. I want to let go of her, I understand that she doesn't find us compatible and accept that. I noticed on her social media she even started seeing someone else and invited him to her apartment and that image in my head of her with someone else is giving me anxiety to the point where I can't sleep.

I have a serious problem were I am in regret of what and what didn't happen, seeing her with someone else, and have all these feelings for her. 

I want to forget her but her images keep still in my mind, and thoughts of what happened. I lost her, I accept that and want to move on for the sake of my health but my mind keeps bringing her back being with someone else. This has made me stressful to the point where I can't eat, sleep, or even get aroused.

If anyone can help me with this situation, give me some advice, I would really appreciate it, I need help."
917,I can’t find any reason to live anymore,"For years I’ve dealt with severe depression and borderline personality disorder. It’s been really hard on me lately, making the transition from complete isolation and returning to in person school. I don’t feel like I have any reason to live anymore. Everyone is going to shit, all my friends are either lying to me or moving on, and even my relationships with my family are falling apart. I don’t know what to do anymore. Though I’ve never really hurt myself I’ve been considering suicide a lot lately. I just don’t know why I’m still here"
918,Advice on self improvement?,"Hey there, I’m new to this sub and not sure if this is allowed, but I’m 17F with a history of mental issues, stemming mainly from genetics, traumatic loss of my father at 11, childhood trauma, and similar things. Bipolar disorder and anger issues run in my family, and I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have been working over the past year to improve myself as I get angry very easily and am working on borderline abusive tendencies. I can be manipulative and overall just very shitty sometimes, but I have significantly improved over the past few months. Mostly, I am unkind to my significant other and tend to snap at him when he shows too much emotion. I am autistic and heavy emotions like sadness really overwhelm me, so I get angry because he is constantly showing emotions that overwhelm me. It’s definitely not his fault and I can be a major asshole about it. 

Long story short, do you guys have any tips for not getting angry so easily and not getting overwhelmed so easily? I’m trying so hard but sometimes I just can’t control myself. I have tried various visiting therapists, a couple of medications for BPD, depression, and anxiety, and the typical breathing exercises/counting to 10/etc. sorry again if this doesn’t belong here, just not sure where else to turn for help."
919,I haven’t been this anxiety ridden or depressed since I started antidepressants,"This year has been a disaster for everyone, I know, but the last time I felt this bad, I was bored earlier suicidal and I am trying so hard to keep myself out of that head space. Like many, I was isolated because of the pandemic, and I was already struggling with loneliness. Then, about y weeks ago, I got hit by a car going 30 mph as a pedestrian and despite not getting any major injuries, I am suffering from severe PTSD. I live in the USA right now and I am so petrified about what will happen if trump wins again. I’m someone who suffers from severe body dysmorphia largely associated with my uterus because, as I’ve been talking to my therapist about, going through a pregnancy/birth would be incredibly traumatic for me due to specific family history. I do not like children in the slightest and if I were to ever get pregnant while under the trump administration, I fear I’d lose my ability to abort. I will not debate abortion with anyone, btw. I firmly support it. It isn’t a “birth control method”. It’s a life saving procedure. I know if I didn’t have safe access to an abortion in that circumstance, I’d likely try to perform a home abortion, and if I didn’t, I know I would suffer the entire pregnancy with severe depression. I’d likely suffer from pre and postpartum depression that would likely lead to suicidal ideations. I know these fears are incredibly specific but they are the fears that haunt me. When I was hit by the car 6 weeks ago, it was entirely an accident. I unfortunately didn’t see the poor driver and he didn’t see me. He stopped and did everything he could to help, and I do not blame him whatsoever. But when my doctor said I was fine, my heart broke because a huge part of me hoped this awful accident would render me unable to have kids. I’m so glad to be alive and okay, but I feel so deeply betrayed by my body for being an object that society expects to carry babies  when children are quite literally the bane of my existence. I hate the current government for trying to take away a safe procedure that could save my life. I hate that people ask me to just take birth control, not knowing the ignorance behind their question. I have been on so many birth controls. My iud gave me an ectopic pregnancy, followed by a miscarriage (thank goodness). The depo shot made me so depressed and withdrawn. The pill made me throw up for months. I am careful. But when the worst happens, who can I rely on to keep me safe? Not doctors. They won’t give me a hysterectomy. Not the government. They want to govern my body. I can’t even trust myself to go on a fucking walk without getting hit by a car. I’m spiraling so hard because all I can think about is the worst case scenario."
920,How can I comfort my friends?,"Myself and a lot of my friends are so scared of the outcome of this election, especially if trump wins. We all belong to marginalized groups. What can I say to my friends who are scared? How can I bring some comfort to them in this bleak moment in time?"
921,I have no idea what is wrong with me and it's destroying my relationship,"I am non-stop obsessing over my spouses past and just cannot get a moment of relief. Its endless. It starts when I wake up and continues till I go to bed. Shes way more experienced than I am sexually and some part of me hates it to a degree that I just can't seem to get over.

And I am never ever happy. Sometimes the thoughts are less severe if we just had sex. And I've talked to her about this. About how my selfish ass needed things that were ""first times"" with her to try and fight this obsessive demon. And she was open to them initially, open to the idea of having anal sex for the first time or other kinks I have.

But it became clear to her as well to me that these things were the only thing that might make me happy. And I think the pressure it put her under turned her off the idea. So now the few things I was hoping might actually help me fight these obsessive thoughts are not going to happen.

And I am so unhappy. I love her so much and only want to be with her. I can't imagine a world without her. But I am suffering over her and things I can't have. Things that I don't even understand why they are important.

I just want it to be over. I don't enjoy eating video games going outside movies nothing. I haven't felt any pleasure in forever now. 

I am not sure if this obsessive sexual bullshit is because I was abused or what but it is ruining my life. And I can't get help. And I can't check in somewhere because I am financially responsible for people. I tried to keep this short but I have so many more paragraphs inside right now. 

Important side notes, not to make anyone feel bad for me just because they might offer insight into my mental health issues:

Sober, but was a chronic (dying) alcoholic for 4 years
Dad is trans and ocd and my mom is an addict
Brother had cf and schizophrenia and passed away
Raped by two different men from 3-4 and then from 7-9
Bullied all my life
Two past incidences of being extremely obsessed with girls, the one in highschool I continued to have obsessive thoughts for even after not talking for years

I just don't think I've had a happy day alive outside of when my spouse first said yes to a date. It was a fleeting moment of happiness where I forgot about the other things in my past for a second. Then my cruel mind began attacking me with nonstop images."
922,The thought of doing anything productive makes me just want to cry,"I’m 18 years old so this is a tough time and I just have a lot of responsibilities right now. I need to do stuff to finish Eagle Scout (which I’ve been wanting to quit for years but my parents wouldn’t let me. Now I’m just soooo close to done.), look a colleges, go on tours, spend time with my family, do my current school wok, vote, have time for friends, work at my job where I’m not paid enough. 

I just want to sit at home and do nothing and hang out with my girlfriend, but of course playing video games isn’t always fulfilling. Every time I just think about something I have to do, it makes my chest and throat hurt and I’m the least productive person I know. (I did start a brand new YouTube channel and since I enjoy it I can actually be productive on that)

I’ve never really dealt with mental issues, but what does this mean? How can I fix it?"
923,Everything is Awful and it's Only Getting Worse (USA),"tl;dr - Covid has caused my life to go from bad to horrendous and there's nothing I can do about it.  I've lost any sort of escape I had from the hellscape that is my household, and the only person I could trust and confide in has moved away.  My mental illness, a lot of which I had conquered years ago, is now back with a vengeance.

So, today my local school board has decided to stop with all in-person schooling for the remainder of November.  We only even really got to go in person for a couple weeks in the first place, and for those couple weeks I had an escape from home where I could see my friends for a few hours and not have to be around my mother.  There are quite a few reasons I hate my mother, but for argument's sake let's just say that she has, through negligence as well as malicious intent, put me through more trauma in the past 17 years of my life than most people would see by the time they're 30.  From the time she moved us into the middle of nowhere North Carolina with her abusive boyfriend for two years to the incessant manipulation and neglect, she's left me with my fair share of psychological damage.  At this point I'm pretty sure I have some degree of PTSD from how often she screams at me and how drastic her actions following said screaming bouts tend to be.  And now I'm stuck at home, 24 hours, 7 days a week.  The only solace I get comes from her going to work, but her work schedule is so sporadic and unpredictable that this only leads to me constantly stressing over whether or not I'll get to leave my room tomorrow.

And as if all of this weren't bad enough, I'm utterly without any sort of external support since the only true friend I've ever had moved away two months ago, leaving me completely and utterly alone on an emotional level.  Sure, there are other people who I could talk to, but after all I've been through it takes a whole lot of trust for me to even begin talking about how I feel with anyone.  She was the only person I trusted to take me seriously and be supportive, and now she's gone and I have no one.  I'm utterly alone with my crazed mother and my mental illness.

On the subject of mental illness, I've got a few of those.  Depression, social anxiety, OCD, a few weird sensory things, the occasional bout of psychosis which is usually accompanied with suicidal thoughts and generally destructive behaviors.  I've been struggling with these things for as long as I can remember, but over the past two years I had started to get better with a lot of it.  I fought most of my OCD rituals to nonexistence, I found ways to cope with all of the sensory things that stress me out to no end, and I was doing pretty okay in terms of depression and anxiety.  But that's all been undone now, old compulsions and rituals are slowly coming back, and I've gone back to having panic attacks every time someone yells angrily near me.  I would say that I'm currently the second most depressed I have ever been, and from some perspectives it's worse than ever -- I have no interest in anything at all, it's impossible for me to get motivated to do just about anything, and seldom does a day pass without me crying at least once over some minor inconvenience.

I just don't know what to do or where to go anymore.  I just want everything to go back to normal so I can see my friends again and get 7 hours of guaranteed reprieve from my mother and her antics 5 days out of the week. I feel like everything I love is slowly slipping away from me and there's nothing I can do to stop it."
924,ok so my mom is being rude and i am sad now," when ever i talk/shout my mom says stuff like 'DONT SHOUT YOUR VOICE GIVES ME A HEADACHE"" what do i do?"
925,I'm happy but I'm still sad.,"I've been in a decent mood all day, but for some reason I'll catch myself feeling really good and then my chest gets heavy and I start to feel really sad to the point I want to cry. What does everyone else do when they start to feel the big sad coming."
926,im feeling disturbed on a deeper level.,i am feeling more disassociated from myself and surroundings. i have been attacked by psychic forces of someones bad intentions for me and he said i only have 6 months to live. i need help.

928,Free therapy help?,"Does anyone know of actually FREE therapy in the NYS tri state area? My insurance is running out soon, and I don’t want to be left in the dirt without anyone. 

Also, I’m avoiding hotlines so (I know most of them, but find more help in them)"

931,Can someone just kidnap me and bring me back when the world is not so chaotic please,"I’m probably just in a mood but marijuana doesn’t feel like enough of an escape anymore. Covid, the elections, protests, riots, police brutality, everything is chaotic and scary and I wish I could hide."
932,Nightmares and anxiety,"Last 5 months I’ve made massive progress after I realised I kept going for people who weren’t good for me.

I won’t say treated me badly because I’ve accepted my self worth was low back then. I’ve now lost a lot of weight, work a better job, develop myself intellectually everyday, meditate... 

In life I’m quite strong, talk about my feelings and my anxiety and depressed state has diminished significantly. 

The last two weeks vivid dreams about seeing her have started, adding to the ones I always get about the world ending which are distressing to say the least. I now get a couple of hours everyday where I have to do breathing exercises to stop massive panic attacks.

I read you can become addicted to bad relationships/ friendships, maybe this is my subconscious fighting to try and take me back down that road. Can anyone shed any light on this?"
933,What are some ways to escape and enjoy life when it kinda sucks?,"I just genuinely need some thoughts, life feels the same for me everyday so it would be nice to have other inputs on what I should do."
934,I think I have a mental disorder/illness and I don't know how to deal with it,"The last four months of my life I have been feeling really unmotivated, anxious and useless. I'm a teenage girl who has mediocre grades, a few friends and some simple hobbies. Resantly I have noticed my parents behavior in comparison to other parents actually is kinda 'not good', and can be compared to emotional abuse. Of course, I don't want put abuse alligatons on my own parents, but I can't get it out of my head. This thought has made me feel really depressed, but I don't think I should self diagnose, but at the same time I haven't felt anything that I could compare to just simple sadness. Me being a big target for bullying and having awful not eating habits isn't helping me out. I have tried bringing these things up with my parents but they just kinda dismiss it, and if I even dare say something about how they're actions might be bad, they turn it on me and start taking about how much I'm overreacting and it's all my fault. I have tried bringing it up with one of my friends, her reaction at first were supporting, but then she said the classic 'you know you're parents still love you' line and now I'm scared to bring it up to her or even anyone because I think they don't take me seriously, that has not helped my anxious thoughts. I have self harming thoughs and sometimes even some thoughts about disposing myself and I'm scared that one day the words 'nobody would care' will get the better of me. I have had anxiety attacks over the smallest things, there was even a time I got one because there was too much people around. They started last year before all the covid stuff. I don't know what to do, so I've just kinda been trying to distract myself with watching YouTube and drawing but sometimes I just can't control myself and just start crying out of nowhere. I try to avoid eating for some reason and it's not because I think I have a ugly body (that award goes to my face), for me it's like a lust for control over something in my life, knowing that I made myself feel weak out of my control, it just kinda makes me feel 'better' temporarily. I also sometimes bite myself when I'm stressed. It's obvious that I have some mental issues, but I don't want to tell that to people, knowing that I'll eather be annoying or boring. I try to keep my mind out of dark places and right now I just hope that feeling like this isn't too commen. What do you think I should do or how should I deal with this without being annoying."
935,I'm not sure whats wrong with me,"Hi everyone, i have been feeling weird these few weeks almost a month. It started basically a year ago when i didn't get this letter which allows me to leave my home country (Indonesia) for working holiday, but things got better after 3 ish months thanks to my nice, friendly coworkers. However, after the pandemic hits all of us were forced to take our unpaid leave and after 4 months of unpaid leave i got kicked out of my job thanks to the person who recommended me for the position. This person is one of the BOD in the company and owned a restaurant of his own, long story short bc like 80% of the staffs were forced to take unpaid leave and he knows i'm one of them he asked me to help him manage his restaurant as the store manager and that i could quit whenever i want to or if i dont feel comfortable or when the company decides to take me in to work again. But during my work there i didn't get along with his sister who also manages the restaurant and called quit after 1+ months of working and right after i called quit, my manager from the company contacted me and asked if i want to rejoin the team or not, but in a different position in which i rejected because i know that position will woek right under the operational manager whos infamous for calling/asking the staff to work whenever he feels like it and the day after the operational manager called me then asked me if i have filed the exit form which people fill when theyre about to quit the job or not, and i was really shocked so i said i haven't and he told me that my manager will do that for me and all i have to do is to return the laptop the company lend me.
Since then i was really stressed as i dont have any income anymore and that i have to live off my savings. I told my friends about it and one of them suggested me to continue my study and finish off my Bachelors degree (i have an associate degree from a college in the US, went back due to financial problems). After looking at schools and randomly applying a uni contacted me and said that i got accepted and i dont even have to pay for the application fee, so the impulsive me said yes and sent all the datas over to the admission plus paid the tuition fee before looking at the curriculum since it offers international joint degree for the majors and even offers their students to go to germany for a year for thesis research and internship. Whats bad is that their curriculum was really bad and they make their students learn whats unnecessary for their major and make it mandatory. I am majoring in food technology and i have to take computer networking, gaming algorithm and even some electrical engineering classes which is sooooooo out of the major.
Im so stressed and often cry while doing the assigments of the courses as i really dont have any idea about it or have any interest of learning it.
Told my mom about it and shes like ""so what you want to do?"" And i told her i wanna quit after this semester and try to find a uni in canada that offers full scholarship then i can work to pay for my living expenses there + money left from my savings but my dad didn't like the idea since my tuition fee was sponsored by someone and he said that i would be a jerk of i stop after a semester and dont get a degree. This house is getting more and more toxic as the day goes and im getting more stressed to. Theres so many times where i wanna cry but i couldnt since if i cried they gonna blame me and told me that its all in my brain and it will stop once i stop thinking about it, thing is, me, too, dont wanna think about any of it and just wanna force myself to shove this hard pill down but my brain wont listen.
Yesterday one of my coworker who secured a job after the pandemic contacted me and told me that his company is in need of staff and he said that he could recommend me, and i told him it would be great. Since getting a job means theres income for me so i can stop living off my savings and my parents money but when i told my parents about it theyre not happy and told me i shouldve rejected it since its gonna mess with my study but i dont wanna continue anymore.
I ended up do whatever i feel like best and did an over-phone interview with the HRD earlier today and the thoughts of i might be accepted to the company + the study + everything just stress me out so much and my head hurts so bad.

Have anyone ever experience this kind of situation? Im sorry if its so long and i kinda vent too but i really dont know whats wrong with me.
I used to not be this kind of person, i am a high key introvert and high key hates people but i never ever felt so much stress like these few months combined my whole life (im 22). Ever since i came back from the States it has been downhill for me and i feel lile i dont see no lights in the future ngl"
936,Music made me release all the emotions I didn't know I was holding in for the first time in months,"a little background story: i've been dealing with anxieties since i was a kid but they've only gotten worse last year. it created some kind of domino effect that led me to almost take my life last month that left me in a somehow unstable state.

last night, it spiked up again so i decided to my comfort songs. first song got me teary eyed, but the next one... idk but 5 seconds in and I already found myself sobbing uncontrollably. usually the sobs i let out were inaudible or muffled but this time, it was painfully louder. 

this made me realized that i was bottling up my emotions all this time until it became overwhelming for me to handle. last time i allowed myself to show vulnerability was 8 months ago but even then, it was only an eight of the bottle. 

so yeah, i just felt the need to share this :)"
937,I have an issue of making issues seem like bigger issues when I’m overly emotional. Anybody else do this? And what can I do to work on this?,"Since I was a kid I have exaggerated things, I’m not proud of it, and it doesn’t help me... ever. And I have just recently realized it, I actually don’t like talking about my problems because of it, and usually only share the bare minimum of my issues with others. I’ve started closing myself off because complaining and venting always makes things worse for me. I work through things better by myself, alone, in my head. I don’t know why I do this, I generally don’t like attention, and hope to be forgotten by others, so I just don’t know, any thoughts?"
938,I don't care for myself enough to be better,"I've been in conflict with myself. Deep down I know I should quit smoking and start taking care of myself better, but I can't find any motivation to do so. I know I should because of my health, my family, my overall mental well-being, as logical as I am, even when I list them out I don't feel the push that I need. 

I have this deep-rooted, messed up belief that there is no point doing anything, or that nothing really has meaning. I really want to stop feeling this way, it's so ingrained in my head I don't know how I can find meaning in life again."
939,I feel myself wanting to seculde again.,"I'm tired of putting my issues on other people. I feel like a burden. And I feel like others can't handle it or don't wanna deal with it being all the time. I slowly find myself crawling back to just pretending to be ok. It shouldn't be their issues anyways. Slowly, people have wanted to deal with it less and less. And I don't blame them. And I don't wanna put it on them anymore."
940,Fed up with romanticizing of mental illness,"I want to make clear that I'm keeping this vague because I never want to assume anything on an individual basis, you never really know what is going on in people's life. And that everyone deals with their struggle differently, I want to encourage that if anyone thinks they are dealing with a mental health issue to seek professional help.

That being said....

I have been suffering from depression for a while and I really hate seeing people thinking that having a mental illness is qUiRkY or FuN. Not just with depression but also with anxiety, DID, OCD, PTSD ect... I actually had someone come up to me and tell me that they fake anxiety to get away with doing things. So one more time for the people in the back mental illness is NOT  fun or quirky or a fucking personality trait. It's an issue that yes is getting more attention now thanks to people actually caring and improved medical science, but that doesn't give you the right to pretend that you have anxiety so your followers can mark you relatable. I've seen what happens to people suffering from anxiety, on a bad day my friend can't function in public I have had to drive to their house and calm them down. My grandpa served in the Korean war, I have never heard him talk about his experiences over there but before he died he forced me and my brother to swear we would never join the military. The worst part about it is when someone who has a large following goes and gets to discuss their ""mental illness"" when it's obvious they only did a 5 min. Google search and looked at the images. They can spread false information. Sorry about the rant I needed to get that off my chest."
941,I'm not sure why I'm here,"I've struggled with my mental health since early highschool and have been through some really good highs where I feel the happiest ever and some terrible lows where I've considered suicide. In the past year my mentality has been in a steady decline after multiple failed relationship attempts (in the past years), dropping out of uni, work, and the stress of life fills me with dread to the point where I have panic attacks nightly when trying to sleep. It sounds weird but I don't feel like I can trust my friends or family with this information because I don't even think they care about me much at all. I'm supposed to be moving in with those friends later this month but all I ever feel is that they don't want me to and that my parents want me gone even though all say that's it's quite the opposite. I can't make friends anymore because I have no drive or energy to meet people. I'm extremely anxious at not being able to find a person to love before it's too late. It kind of feels like my life just fell into a pit of cement and I'm now stuck there with this shitty feeling of coldness in my chest all the time and anxiety in my stomach. So often now I think about ending things because most of the time I can't even find a reason as to why I should stick around and the possibility of no longer existing is the only thing that really gives me any relief anymore. This sounds stupid and no where near as bad as other people's issues but it's all I've got and I've got no where else to say anything anyway."
942,"I stopped taking my antidepressants after overdosing, couldn’t get any help, now my depression is creeping back and every door I try to open is locked.","I (M53) was diagnosed as suffering from C-PTSD last year and recently another psychologist diagnosed quiet BPD. I’m what you’d call high functioning since I’ve no problem holding down several jobs, as well doing online  copywriting and guest post writing, commuting 2-3h daily, bringing up my two children because their mum is more concerned with her bf and his younger kids, basically trying to work on myself and dealing with ending my last relationship because my gfs cheated on me with a sugar daddy. 

Here in France we’ve just started a second confinement and there’s also a curfew operating in most big cities.  Since the end of last year i’ve been going regularly to my local gym lifting weights/ boxing/cardio, i've lost a load of excess weight,  I started going to yoga classes in July, cut out all alcohol, sugars, processed foods and consequently put on a lot of muscle/toned up my body and was feeling much better internally as well as externally. Unfortunately since September i've been having problems. First of all i ended my relationship with my two gfs because they cheated on me with their old boss and now sugar daddy, i lost my two part time university jobs due to economic reasons, my son 'left the nest' and moved out to start his career ( so that left a huge physical and emotional emptiness since i'd more or less brought up  my two children on my own over the last 7 years when their mum left them to start a new life with her much younger bf and his young children), my freelance writing business got hit by the economic fallout from Covid-19, all the friends i'd made at my gym just disappeared off the radar, two of my work colleagues suddenly handed in their resignations leaving the rest of the department to pick up the pieces ( extra hours without extra pay), my GP suddenly left the local health clinic and no one has since replaced her, and   all the gyms/ sports classes are shut because of the newly reintroduced confinement. 

I'd made several appointments to see my psychologist and psychiatrist  ( normally i should be seeing them once a fortnight) but  each time they cancelled last minute, and i couldn't do any online Skype therapy sessions with them because each time slot clashed with my teaching timetable. Consequently, i haven't seen either since the start of September. I just get my prescription renewed and thats all. I called different support hotlines and got put on hold or told to see my GP ( i don't have one since she hasn't been replaced and no other doctor will accept to see me).

Last weekend I took too many pills and ended up  calling an Uber to take me to the nearest ER. I was refused treatment because there was no one available to  treat me so the nurse told me to either wait 6-8h or go home and call a paramedical service in the town where I live ( I passed out in the waiting room )  so I ended up forcing  myself to be sick in the waiting room toilet. I passed out again in the nearby car park, someone found me but even then no medical staff were available so  the woman called an Uber and I went home. I took about 150mg of vortioxetine. I must’ve been out cold for most of Sunday because all I remember was having a terrible flashback and waking up drenched in sweat on my bathroom floor... no idea how I got there.  I went to work on Monday. I teach full time and I’ve got several classes of 30+ very highly stressed out 15-18 year olds to keep occupied whilst everyone can’t decide whether to shut  down schools again or go for a hybrid teaching style. I suffer from a light fever, terrible headaches, brain flashes, insomnia, vommitting, flashbacks and panic attacks. I'm still working because since i don't have a GP to see i can't get ant time off work. 
My local pharmacist just told me to go and see my GP.

Since Monday I’ve barely eaten, have suicidal thoughts, insomnia, severe flashbacks and other symptoms of going cold turkey. My anti depressants made me sick but my psychiatrist told me I had to take them or he’d recommend putting me in a mental hospital..i felt i was being punished.  I stopped taking them two weeks ago but last Saturday had had enough of everything and I stupidly took 12-15 pills. I felt I had no choice. My GP didn’t bother either when I told her I was attacked back in July and had been suffering severe flashbacks since then. She made it sound like it was my fault and being told to go to hospital was like a form of punishment ' if you don't tale the pills you'll have to go....'
The police didn’t want to know either when I told them my version of events and even accused me of wasting police time.. I was held in an apartment and assaulted during several days. My two gfs at the time knew and tried to help me. We were going through a rough period but then got back together. They helped me a lot cope with it and encouraged me to report it to the police and see a therapist.   I’ve seen numerous therapists but each time they ended  up cancelling or postponing to another date when I’m working, or they didn’t understand why a heterosexual guy like myself would end up getting raped and assaulted  and because I told them I was into bdsm assumed I wanted it. They also didn’t  understand why I’ve kept all my severe childhood trauma locked up inside me for the past 40 years. ( too much to list so it’s in my other posts). At least three police  officers made the comment  'only homosexual men get raped.'  One senior officer told me 'If you're into hitting women and having rough sex with them then we might have to investigate you....' I was given a warning for wasting police time!!!

No idea how to handle everything now. I’ve tried doing some home yoga and meditation but get terrible headaches and fever like symptoms. My concentration levels are almost non existence, my creative inspiration to continue writing has disappeared, i repeatedly wake up during the night after seeing images of what happened to me when i was young, i can't eat and just drink litres of herbal teas and water."
943,DAE feel miserable before/during their birthday?,"It’s my birthday tomorrow. I feel miserable and anxious. 

1. A few of my birthdays before were really traumatic. I remember people fighting around me and forgetting that it’s (is it?) a special day for me. A friend of mine broke his leg on my birthday. My best friend’s grandfather suffered a stroke on my birthday. I have this irrational worry that something bad would happen and I would be deeply hurt again.

2. Also this feeling that another year has passed, I haven’t achieved anything remarkable in my life. I’m still fairly young (23), but I can’t stop feeling that I’m just a disappointment to myself and other around me. 

3. Most of my friendships have been very shallow, with people forgetting that it’s my birthday altogether. I just feel like if I couldn’t be an important person in even one person’s life, then why should I exist."
944,"Burnt out, trying to go on a little bit more","Hi everyone, Seeing some people's problems mine can feel a bit like 'bitching' but at the moment I feel I need to vent some things out. I am going to get some professional help in the upcoming weeks and a huge portion of my problems will be over in two months (or at least I hope so), but I need to struggle through these two months somehow.

So basically I am a middle manager in a media company. I am dealing with my team and the clients' issues as well. For a while it was good as I was learning a lot. But after a while it became more and more stressful and frustrating. I also had changes in my team (and I did not really have a word in these changes) and the new member is causing me a lot of trouble as well. I don't want to go through all the pain points, because there are too many. The conclusion is that now I feel burnt out, stressed and tired all the time.

Last week I gave in my notice period (which is 2 months according to my contract), because I just can't handle this anymore. I thought just doing this would help at least a little, but they have started to involve me in an onboarding project which involves a lot of work and additional stress. And at this point I just don't know how I will get through the next two months. I am still dealing with problematic clients, daily issues, conflicts etc. Basically I just want to let these things go, because if the company does not realize (after I have been telling them for months, that we should do something, because I have issues) that it's not a good idea to put more work on someone who already told them he can't do this anymore and is about to leave, I really shouldn't care. But there are some good people in the company that I don't want to let down. And this is making it even more difficult.

And I guess this whole world pandemic is not helping either."
945,Why can't I get myself to do something.,"Like I just don't get it, I tell myself, ""THAT IS IT. I WILL BECOME FAMOUS"" then I start procrastinating and end up doing nothing at all, wasting hours on pointless games, I need some sense knocked into me. Every time I want to do something essential for a change I eventually end up gaming or chatting on places like this. I'm honestly sick of it, it's like I'm a magnet and I oppose everything I want to do while it's the opposite for others, Helpppppppppp"
946,Trying to understand,"why is it that whenever I put my head on the pillow and try to sleep, the first picture I see is me hanging myself or a speeding car has turned me into a pile of meat...what in the actual fuck is this??

I'm not suicidal or anything so shoot your best answer"
947,Fuck me,"I thought I felt better yesterday, I slept good and liked myself. When my mum woke me up she told me to do my bed. I said yes but before doing so I browse Reddit for like 5min then got up. She went up again too look if I did as she said and I was dressing myself. She went in to my room and saw that the bed was not made and just looked at me with disappointment saying “you don’t want to get better” and left.

I downed like 600mg of caffeine and now I’m here. I can’t even study. I just want to stay I bed. I feel so shit. I’m literally worthless. I can’t even do the smallest thing right."
948,I don’t know what I feel.,"Is it normal for me to cry myself to sleep almost every night, even though I have a healthy relationship with both of my parents, friends that care and also good/average grades? But I still feel like nothing, I feel empty, I can‘t get out of bed to even brush my teeth, take a shower or even eat breakfast. I‘ve been struggling with this since January, but I can‘t open up to someone by the fear of being juged, that‘s why I keep everything to myself and let it out once I’m alone."

950,I'm beginning to have uncomfortable thoughts about sexuality that stem from anger,"I think this is mental health related. I have treatment resistant depression (tried drugs and therapy with awful and disappointing results) but have put my life together in a way that satisfies everyone else at least. 

The thing is, the elements of human life and our society are just abhorrent to me. Working every day, constantly pushing forward, and most importantly relationships mess with my head. 

I've begun to distrust and dislike women over the past few years. It's like society is giving them a free pass to act like the worst of men. Like somehow they went from rightfully criticizing the toxic douches to wanting to be just like them (not saying they were perfect to begin with, no one is). But now I just don't feel comfortable around females and I feel like everyone I meet plays games with me whether it's trying to get me to like them or just trying to use me for some goal. 

Because my mental state is so screwed up I tend to rapidly loop thoughts that are particularly stressful or powerful and they just become worse and worse. As soon as a stressors brings me to the point of a panic attack (I have a lot of them), in the future that stressor will trigger more anxiety and possibly more panic attacks. I try to meditate but thats like intentionally inducing anxiety so I usually distract myself with ""productive"" work, exercise, or hobbies when I feel a trigger. 

Still, lately I've been having both violent thoughts about women, and sexual thoughts about men that concern me. I know I'm not entirely gay, because I'm not physically attracted to men. Masculine features are a turn off completely. And I cant imagine dating a man. But sometimes I lapse into a state of mind where i imagine sex with a man but dont picture him as any particular person and it feels so freeing. Like I'm being freed from female expectations and their pettiness that is so typical these days. 

Even more recently I've been feeling a huge block in sexuality. I'm already a 21 year old virgin, never dated or even kissed anyone. But I've usually been able to become aroused by women. Now I have no libido, instead sexual urges become complete anxiety and frustration and I rarely climax from masturbating. Usually I'm just left feeling very on edge so I've been avoiding it. Hearing coworkers talk about sex makes me angry and the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack and threw up in the bathroom after hearing a girl I work with complain about not having enough sex. It's just very unsettling to me. 

I'd like to say maybe one day I want a relationship or even sex, but when I write my feelings down or think about them very hard I really just want to die. I feel like an alien for this reason and many others; I don't want to do anything anymore, I cant even picture an ideal version of myself because nothing exists that would satisfy me. Maybe something in a fictional book, like a sorcerer or a sage or something like that. But within the realms of reality I'm completely disappointed at every corner. 

I often ask why I should keep going, I've even written down my reasons and the only convincing two are to listen to good music, and because everyone else would be sad if I took my own life. Which I have tried twice before as a teenager and it really shook everyone up and got them worried and made me feel like shit. Still it's never made me appreciate life more. 

I just don't know what to do anymore."
951,Anxiety Attack - How do I help?,"My boyfriend has what he and the psychologist suspect as an anxiety attack. Some times he can't breathe well and some times he gets depressive thoughts. I am not in a good space myself but I try to support him as much as I can.

Recently he went to a friend's gathering and all of his friends have things going for them but my bf is currently jobless (graduate since one year ago) and is not looking for a job, he came back feeling rather depressed. He spends most of his time at a part-time job (that I got for him and pushed him to go for) and his hobby. He gets triggered when I talk to him about finding a job and used to just mass send him related job postings (he did send a few resumes), but recently, I decided to not help anymore as I feel that he is not even putting in the least bit of effort.   


I need to know if he has anxiety about finding a job, do I just leave things as it is? Because I got a feeling that 3 years down the road, he will still be doing the same and I want to know if its okay for me to slightly push or better to leave him to it."
952,Looking for opinions on my mothers mental health condition,"Hello, my mother refuses to admit she might have an mental health issue even though it is becoming more and more obvious to those around her. Due to her refusal we don’t have a formal diagnosis, I won’t go into all her symptoms as that would make things complicated but interested to hear your thoughts on one thing in particular which is minor in the big scheme of things.

She seems to purposely choose a viewpoint on issues that is usually the minority viewpoint. I’m not sure if the intention is to cause conflict, be different, feel more intelligent than others, something else or a combination. I don’t even know if she actually believes them herself, often they seem not to make any sense. 

Some examples:
She decided plants have feelings and we shouldn’t eat plants
She’s a huge Trump supporter (we live in NZ, this is a very minority viewpoint here)
Sunscreen causes cancer
She shouldn’t have to pay tax because she raised children who pay tax
Nigerian scammers are good people and should be supported 


What kind of conditions might cause this type of behaviour?"

955,i am afraid this is just how i am [venting],i (14f) have been having just a really bad few weeks with my depression getting worse due to familial and friendship issues as well as stress from school and what not. i recently got diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder. i have been feeling like this probably since i was seven or eight which is around half of my life. being so young and with my brain still developing and then having these mental health issues i am afraid that this is just how i am. like there is no fixing the problem because it had been engrained in me at such a young age. i honestly can’t remember not feeling like shit all the time and exhausted as hell because my mind races and i am constantly on edge. my jaw hurts from clenching it from stress and anxiety. i have so much work i have to do that is overdue as well as the stuff i need to do on time but it so hard. i can’t focus during the day. at night my thoughts start racing and i want to cease to exist. my parents know i have these problems but the chalk it up to me not getting enough sleep even though the problems cause my sleep loss. it’s an endless cycle of problems to sleep to problems to sleep and i can’t take it anymore. i need to distract myself somehow and i usually just mindlessly look at my phone but my parents use the downtime setting on it leaving me to drown in my intrusive thoughts at night. lately i have felt like nothing is real. i have felt like this before in passing and it maybe lasts about an hour before i get control of it but over the last few weeks it has gotten out of control. i can’t snap out of it and it all feels like a dream and my body isn’t mine. i feel like i shouldn’t be existing and reality shouldn’t be either. i don’t even know how to really explain it and my therapist and psychiatrist aren’t consistent when it comes to scheduling because of COVID so i don’t even know who to talk to or anything. i just want to cry

961,Badly depressed and heartbroken.,"Depressed and badly heartbroken

I have recently came out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend. She used to abuse me emotionally psychologically and then finally physically. 

I found out she was escorting and dominating for money and took her back. I also found out she was sleeping with other men and I took her back from it all. I loved this girl so much. But when I look back on it I don’t think she ever loved me. I think she was dominating me and getting off on it. She displayed real narcissist behaviour such as gaslighting me. Building me up and tearing me down. Used to even call me her little lost puppy. Never used to show empathy. She used to regularly laugh at her ex boyfriends she claimed she “broke their hearts”. 

I couldn’t even tell my friends What was happening out of sheer embarrassment. 


I live in a gang area in the us. And come from a low income housing project. Once I was on the way home and saw a man killed while on the phone to her. There was nobody else on the road just me and this guy. We was both wearing “urban” style clothes. He turnt out to be an innocent man. This could have been me if I hadn’t gone a different way, I only went that way because my ex had called me and I wanted to talk to her. So I took a longer route. I used to smoke weed but it just had me thinking of me watching this guy die. It used to give me anxiety attacks. Uncontrollable shaking. She noticed that and used to play on it. Saying she gave me a place out the hood to come to. 

She used to always hit me and strike me and I used to restrain her. Until the last time. 
It ended with a big fight and I finally hit her back. 
Her last words she ever said to me before I hit her was “can’t you see I don’t respect you. You’re f***img me after you know I have had sex with other men”


She went to the police and filed false reports on me which broke my heart so badly. I was in jail dreaming that the charges would get dropped and she would tell the truth but she never did. I felt so betrayed because I stuck by her through everything. She used to cry in my arms while I rocked and kissed her to sleep. She was my first love. 

I am now facing legal battles against her vicious lies trying to defame my character. She always promised I couldn’t be happy if it wasn’t with her. And now she’s going through with her plans. 

I find it hard to eat regularly. 

I go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. Then sleep all day. 

The “hood” I live in regularly innocent people are killed by accident and it’s not advised to be out by yourself for no reason. But it’s weird I’m not scared of anything anymore just numb. 

I have thought about ending it all but I been through so much even before her. 
I can’t have been through all that to go out like that. 
That means she will win. 

I’m a really good hearted person and sometimes
I feel to become a heartless villain and never show anybody love again. But she would still win because she would have changed me forever. 

All this while she’s enjoying her life. Has a new boyfriend. And regularly cryptically taunts me through her social media accounts. 

Tldr; I’ve been broken by somebody who was my bestfriend. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so low in my life."

I just got off the phone with my psychologist who told me that they're considering diagnosing me with borderline personality disorder. I don't know what's wrong with me anymore, my brain feels like nothing but a tangle of mental illnesses. I'm confused, I don't trust myself and I don't know what to do."

966,"If you struggling with something today, I gently recommend this","Hello stranger,

If your mind is running in circles today, please take a moment to pause. 

You’re probably not breathing deeply either, so let’s fix that first.

Close your eyes and slowly inhale until your lungs are full. Then slowly release it.Repeat this a few times until you feel calmer.

Feeling a *little* better?

Now, take a moment to do this:

1. Focus on sensations, not on thoughts\*.  
Take note of every sensation arising and coming into awareness ***in the body***.  
Not in the mind or in thoughts, *just focus on sensations like curled toes, clenched teeth, dry mouth, pain in the back…*  
Continue to breathe gently and deeply.
2. Allow the sensations to prevail ***without labelling or calling them anything***(*‘it’s my ulcer’*)

This is important.

1. Ignore mental pictures, inner dialogue and all thoughts that arise. *This may take a few attempts.*
2. Welcome the sensation(s) without resisting. Do this by breathing into the sensations - just let go trying to stop them, or make them go away.
3. If you’re do this right (see #3 and #4), you will realize that the sensations are slipping away. Almost becoming more *diffused*. The ball of energy behind each one is dissipating.  
If not - gently go back to #1. The key is resistance - the thoughts, imagery, labelling that is trying to *push away* the feeling of discomfort.

Take a moment to ask for help.

Don’t believe in ‘God’? That’s okay. How about *a higher power of our understanding?*

Could you conceive of a Power greater than ourselves? Just the way *you*understand it.

If yes - direct this prayer to your Higher Power.

The Serenity Prayer

    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.   

What’s the purpose of repeating this Serenity prayer, you ask? No reason I can offer other than that it works. It just does :)

I do hope it helped you.

\*This is a technique described in *Letting Go,* one of my favourite books by Dr. David R. Hawkins. Some of you might know it as the Sedona releasing method. It’s easy, free, devoid of any religious or sectarian woowoo.

After Doc, I like to repeat:  
*Gloria in Exelcis Dio.*  
That means, all glory (and credit) be to God.

967,Anxiety killing me after break up,"Me (23m) and my girlfriend (21f) of 1 year broke up today after 2 stressful months.. Things changed in a blink when my girlfriend decided to become religious and everything there on started to go down hill. I supported her in her new found path and thought it wouldn't affect as much... But it did affect very hard, complete dynamics of our relationship changed and everything lead to increasing distance between us. 



Today I initiated the break up but soon lost my cool and acted needy, desperate and unsure of what I was doing (which obviously affects my dignity) while she remained calm and collected. 


Though we broke up on good terms and mutual understanding... The anxiety since is killing me. I can't stop thinking about it and it's affecting my work. I can't stabilize my thoughts and the fact that she won't be part of my life anymore is absolutely killing me. I love her a lot but there ain't no future for us.

I have no ambition to do anything but think and constantly live inside of my own head. I want to better myself and get past this but I don’t know how, could this be caused by the untreated depression or something else? Anything helps"

972,Why was I sad one week and ok the next,I've had thoughts of death and this week it like disappeared every thing I'm not sad now I'm only sad when some says something mean.
973,I am not a well balanced human being. I have issues. I may be depressed. I probably am. This is a throwaway for reasons you'll find inside...,"So, yeah... I have always had self-worth issues due to being bullied in elementary and my first technical school. I got called names, which lead into me getting into fights and having temper issues that, TBH, i'm not sure i've fully gotten over even to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bisexual man, and almost thirty. To this day i've never had sex or even gotten to go on  a date.  Not sure i'd even know how to react if someone agreed to go even on a single date with me.  I'm a gods damned virgin despite turning 30 come early next year. I'm, as much as i hate to admit it, fat. I haven't stepped on a scale in years, so i don't know how much i weight, but probably over a hundred kilos. Because of the bullying, i became somewhat anti-social and didn't really get out of my shell until around 2010, when i was in my second vocational school after dropping out of the first one. There i met a girl in my class on whom i developed a crush on... Sadly she wanted to remain just friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i would get judged by most people for my interests, because i'm a nerd or a geek (my language only has a word that's seemingly derived from nerd, so i'm not sure what the difference between the two is, if any...) who loves games and anime. I'm even studying at a university to become a game programmer, though it's not going so well. There are subjects that just either go over my head, or have a teacher who teaches in a way that makes it hard for me to learn. I would say that they suck, but apart from maybe one, they're actually competent enough that most others seem to have less trouble than me.

I don't consider myself stupid at all, i'd even say i can be pretty smart and clever at times, but i have had trouble with the math classes here, partly because the teacher seems to teach as if we all went to college... I had no idea what the fuck a matrix is (apart from the movies), and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have trouble learning C++ because it's an ancient language that does some seemingly stupid stuff and IMO has basically no place in modern computer science apart from a history lesson. Except that people still insist on using it, despite C# doing almost everything better. I don't understand what reason there is for UnReal Engine to use C++...

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for rambling, this is written as it flows through my brain and onto the keyboard...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i have trouble connecting fully with even other nerds, because i keep a few things about myself close to my chest and won't talk about. I have a diaper fetish. Nobody but my partner really needs to know about that. But, I am also attracted to prepubescent kids... I would never do anything to them, but as you can imagine, that is not something one can go saying all willynilly, even here in the north. There are people who would lynch me for just saying that some kid is cute, especially if i said it with the wrong tone. Like i said, i would never do anything to them, i use hentai to keep myself satisfied when it comes to such matters.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also have issues when it comes to penis size. I feel that my dick is quite small and i'm worried if i can ever satisfy anyone with it.

Again, this is a ramble, because my thoughts are quite scattered and unfocused, and i apologize for it.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these issues compound together and make me at times feel worthless and just today my lack of progress in our project at the uni made me have a mental breakdown where i felt worthless and unwanted. Also, i at times want to discuss things about porn with others, such as tastes in guys and gals, what kind of porn do the enjoy watching etc. Is that weird to want? 

&amp;#x200B;

I did attempt suicide by jumping off of a bridge back when i was on 8th or 9th grade... Something just clicked about not being wanted and being a burden. I at times still have slightly suicidal thoughts, like today i wished that the earth would just swallow me to stop me from being a stupid, shity burden on others.

I'm also kinda terrible at finances, partly because i have slight memory issues, where i won't remember certain details, or have to concentrate to remember them. This causes me to lose track of how much money i have spent for example... I can, for the most part, pay my bills on time, but then at times i have little money left for foods etc. And i don't have much to spend on frivolous things like buying coffee at uni etc. But i still do it because i'm a caffeine addict that needs his coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

I have run out of things to say for now, apart from asking how can i deal with these issues..."

976,Can anxiety cause persistent hunger pain?,I'm suffering from server anxiety and depression and is coping with medication. On my self diagnosis I feel like my anxiety levels are high these days. I have experienced constant feeling of emptiness in stomach or hunger pains long ago. Recently I'm experiencing it again. Is it normal and because of anxiety? Or is it symptoms of stomach ulcer or something?
977,I'm sick and tired of myself,"almost everytime i'm with my family i always feel like a low level POS, my father accomplished so much in his lifetime and so did my mother and they all had great starts in their early education and attained high grades. My sister pokes fun and insults me for having lower grades than her and i can't fight back because she's correct. I've been always considering suicide because i want to change but i really don't have the willpower because what's written in the past stays as the past. I don't even know if i could get into a good college and i really don't want to have to resort to offing myself. I've been dealing with both anxiety and depression but all i get is the oh so common ""just do it"" and i don't know how. I really just want to give up and rest, i don't know even why i was put into this world. It's been ruining my life ever since and i pledge that if i could travel back in time i would beat my self until i was barely breathing. And i feel that i'm not even worthy of anyone or anyone's help, Then my parents are mad because i don't think the way they want me to and all the conversations we have are super inconclusive. I keep hearing comparisons as if we're doing a tech review and i'm sick and tired of myself. I used to hate the world but now i hate myself as i really am the center of all my problems. It's as if even i'm not supposed to or am even allowed to have problems because i'm in a normal sized house and can eat 4 square meals a day because my sister tells me that she doesn't have these issues that i do. Is it just the competitive nature of our culture here? My mental health has been spiralling down rapidly and i don't want it to end up with me being in the news as part of the obituaries.

I've really been a problem child especially when i was younger, i had ADHD and never took anything seriously anf had no grasp of reality. I could never look at myself again without seeing myself as a bound to be failure to my family and i really want to spare myself the extreme stress and shame, but i don't think i could have a miracle happen and make me study harder then create something to redeem myself because we live in a world where god likes to watch people suffer. It's like i'm in hell and i feel like i really am."
978,Why do I not feel like a human?,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but please, if anyone can read through and tell me if any of this sounds like anything, please. 

Here's the thing - this isn't depersonalisation-derealisation. I don't think so, anyway. I don't feel like an outside observer, I don't have depression, I don't even feel particularly sad or empty. I have hobbies and interests and things I enjoy, and my life feels very much real. 

I just don't think I'm a human. 

Human beings are complicated - they experience good and bad things. They have hobbies and interests, but they have other things, too. They have stories to tell, they have achievements and they have trauma, they have talents and weaknesses, they have overcome hardship and faced failure. That's a human. And a human's purpose is to just live through those experiences and make the best of their lives. 

I'm simple - I've never experienced anything particularly bad nor particularly good. I have hobbies and interests, but that's pretty much all. Any interesting story I have to tell usually revolves around others, and I'm just a side character. I've never achieved anything and I've never gone through anything traumatic. I don't have any talents but I don't have any debilitating weaknesses. I have never endured anything. 

I'm not a human. And my purpose is to help humans, listen to them, support them, and then let them leave when they please. 

I started feeling this way when, on two separate occasions, a friend group I was in fell apart because of issues people had with my fiance. For reasons I won't get into, people started hating him, but they constantly texted him, discussed things with him, and finally messaged him to say goodbye. 

Meanwhile through all of this, every single one of them just... Stopped talking to me. No explanation, no goodbye, not a word. If I didn't have my fiance telling me things I wouldn't even have known anything was going on. 

...On two separate occasions. 10 different people. 

There's no way 10 people can just abandon another human without a second thought right? I mean they couldn't even do that with my fiance who they were angry at, let alone someone who didn't really do anything to them. 

So I have to just not be a human. 

Humans are interesting, complicated, and have good and bad aspects. 

I am boring, simple, and completely and utterly neutral. 

And I don't know what this is, but please, if anyone knows what could be making me feel this way, please tell me."

984,"How tf do I talk to my professors about how my mental state has been so horrific, my attendence is close to 0?","Our academy went under lockdown two weeks ago, and we're back to online classes.

The problem arises with my evening pills - they keep me asleep well over my classes and I miss them every single time. Then when I wake up, there's major anxiety and shame and all kinds of self loathing stories/thoughts going through my mind. And then it just comes down to ""let's just k*ll ourselves, that way you will have an excuse for not coming"", and there's also the struggle of me being raised to do things no matter how I'm feeling, and cause of my poor decisions and pills, I can't do that, cause I am not conscious enough to get up EVEN if I hear the alarm at the right time. Some professors have not seen my face yet since the start of the year. I feel ashamed, like a complete failure and a disgrace. I don't know how to tell them my mental state has been so horrific I can't think normally and I can't do the tasks and homeworks, while at the same time thinking I will fail my senior year and fall behind and let down everybody, most importantly myself. And there's also these thoughts ""that's not your mental health problem, you're just lazy and using your problems as an excuse"" that come up every time I miss a class and at this point I'm terrified and disappointed in myself. How can I talk to the professors and explain myself? I really need help.

But the question that always linger in the back of my mind is why? Why am I so invested in an election that will have absolutely zero material effect on me, and why can't I stop engaging? It's like if I'm not paying 100% attention something awful is going to happen or America is going to descend into full-on bold-faced fascism when I look away, and that somehow in me fucking doomscrolling I'm helping in some inane way. 
Sorry for rambling on about this but I really, really need help."
988,How do you cope with this feeling?,"I feel trapped in a dark place or a really bad dream and I keep living the same dream over and over and over again everyday literally I don't know how to make it stop it's driving me insane. 
Things have always been hard with the family I can't take it anymore everything is just getting harder and I seriously don't know what to do.
I just want to feel nothing, nothing at all because this hurts so bad and am tired, I really am tired.. especially tired or pretending that am happy, laughing, and living the dream. 
In addition, I don't have anyone to say this to at this point because my trust issues are ten times bigger now, which makes things harder for me.
How do you cope with all these feelings?"

990,Help Pls,"I have suffered with depression and anxiety since I was in high school and I just kept it bottled in until one day I eventually broke. 
My family forced me to go to the hospital to see the doctor and I was prescribed medication but I only have got worse and now I’m on a high dose that I have been on for a while now whilst still always feeling down and having very occasional suicidal thoughts I don’t want to become reliant on the medication but i don’t know what to do.
The only reason I haven’t done anything is due to not wanting to hurt my family.

Please any advice on what to do, thanks."
991,How do you function?,"Hi! 

I’m glad to have a found a subreddit for those of us suffering from mental health issues. 

I’d like to share some of my experiences and would appreciate if those who can relate can share some insights/useful information. 

From the past 10 years, I’ve failed to maintain a routine - be it a sleep schedule, eating habits, or the like. First, it was an “act of rebellion” from an angsty team who was having family issues, and believed that he should be able to control how he spends his time, but now it has become a habit and I don’t really have the energy to change it. 

I have been on antidepressants from the past three years. I started off with Sensival and became a bit too addicted to it. The doctor had prescribed a 75 mg dose, and I couldn’t sleep without it; this meant that I used to keep myself awake for a couple days and then knock myself out to sleep for 15 hours. 

I changed my psychiatrist, and the new one changed the medications to Seradep and Alprazolam. It went good for a while, but I feel like I’m still “trapped” in a really terrible place. 

To help you understand my issues, I’ll try to write a summary which may prove to be helpful. 

I’m currently 23, and have social anxiety from as long as I can remember (maybe because I stutter). I can’t stand large gatherings as I feel I’m being watched and judged for each of my move. I don’t post regularly on social media or the like because then again, you’re being judged on your posts. I can’t connect with many people, and let them dictate the terms of our bond - at least people can call me a good listener - which means that I feel unsatisfied with most of those around me. 

I changed colleges a couple years back, so I’m still enrolled in an undergraduate program, but I never really joined classes or kept the required attendance. Still, at least I was going to my college a couple days a week. After lockdown, the classes turned online and I have literally stopped taking them; they happen in the morning, and just before they start I’m sound asleep. 

I feel like there’s a lot of stuff I want to do: I want to read novels again, I want to write, I want to learn new programming languages, I want to dive into philosophy, I want to understand human cultures and values, I want to create art, and most importantly I want to be the person I wanted to be! 

However, all I end up doing these days is kill time, and wait for my brain to go to sleep again. I keep myself glued to my phone - scrolling through the different social apps, browsing YouTube, watching stories - waiting for myself to gain a iota of energy or motivation to start doing stuff. 

I have a strong support system, but I cannot open up to my friends or family about my issues. They think I’ll be able to handle it myself but I am just so frustrated! I keep seeing the posts of my school batch mates, and people I know, “enjoying” life and I can’t help but feel flustered. Why am I not living the life I want to? 

Although I’m 23, I still cannot see myself as an adult. It’s almost as if time never moved for me, and I’m still there in my teenage years. The responsibilities, and expectations from those around me are increasing. And I cannot fault them for that. People are grown-ass in this age, but then I look at myself and I just don’t know how to proceed with my life! 

I would like to know if there are others in this community who can relate to the mindset I’m currently in, and can offer some solid advice over how I can grow out of this phase. Please don’t recommend another psychiatrist because there ain’t many qualified psychiatrists in my country."
992,Panic Attacks and feeling trapped in my head.,"Hey guys, 2 months back I had my first panic attack, which transformed into a full day of panic attacks and anxiety which landed me in the hospital as I thought I was dying. The following weeks I had some dissociation symptoms from this traumatic event. I´m finally feeling like myself more and more again. All I got left is my memory of what happened to me and it´s kind of crippling me to move forward. 

However what´s bothering me is that everytime I watch a movie for example I can´t fully concentrate on it as I´m constantly analyzing my attention span and think about how I can´t let go of what happened and in reality, this is the thing, that is holding me back to pay attention. Same when I´m with friends. I feel good whenever I´m around them and can share some really nice moments and emotions with them but most of the time my head goes: ""Why can´t you let go?"", ""Get out of you head"", ""I just want to forget what has happened to feel like I´m in the moment again"". But these thoughts are the only thing keeping me away from being in the moment, you know? Sounds very paradox, but I thought maybe you could understand what I´m saying. 

I feel kind of trapped in my head and in a constant loop of thoughts but the loop´s only content is that I am feeling trapped in a loop of thought and can´t be in the moment and like I said these thoughts are the only thing that keep me from being in the moment. Like I can´t let my thoughts just be there as before but kind of want to take control of them, even tho whenever I do it, my thoughts turn against me and push me further away from the moment. 

I guess my biggest problem is just that I want to make myself forget about all of these things, which is not possible, as I can‘t forget about it as long as I‘m still thinking about it haha. 

I also have that weird feeling that I can‘t ever get fully over it as everything in my life will constantly remind you of all of these things. Like I wanna move on but can‘t because once I was in this overthinking state for a few months, everything around me or just songs, movies and everything I once loved got connected to all of these feelings and thoughts and they will constantly remind me of my past. All of this is such a weird experience really.

I hope you got any idea of what I´m saying. I know probably all of this sounds not so bad, but it‘s really fucking me up. I feel like I‘m so dumb because of this as I can‘t get out of my head and think about anything external really and I‘m afraid that this will keep me from going to university or getting a good job later on as I just can‘t pay attention. It‘s really crippling me and making me depressed from time to time. Not to sound arrogant, but I always was a smart boy before this and now I‘m so afraid that I won‘t be able to use my abilities for good as I‘m trapped in my head forever.

I just wanna go back to the person I was 2 months ago, I wasn‘t even like a super happy person or anything like that but at least I didn‘t feel so lost in my head and not everyday felt the same, with the same thoughts going through my head day in and day out. I feel so dumb for knowing what my problem is but just not being able to let go. 

Do you have any tips for me on how to overcome this? Or did anyone of you had a similar situation going on? 

Anyway, have a good day, people. I wish you the best :)"
993,Repossession,"I’m asking for prayers please.. I’m not really a religious person but I’m begging for all the vibes. I’m bipolar with a hot side of OCD. I feel myself slipping.

Ford Credit deferred 3 payments last winter when I told them what was happening, then the pandemic and they haven’t been on my ass because of it. But now my car is about $3,000 past due and they can come get my car at anytime. My attorneys have costed over $8,500.

Everyone is suffering, even more so this time. We have to band together and help one another. Please pray. Please."
994,Could Use Some Advice.,"Hello everyone, hope you are in good spirits!

I could use some help and advice.  I've long been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, in addition to ADD/ADHD, and have been taking medications to help with them, and I've been able to manage them.  But over the past couple of months, I've noticed that I've hit a slump or low point.  Nothing overly bad has happened that I can recall causing this, but it's very obvious that I've changed.  

I constantly call-in to work and spend days-to-weeks in bed.  I recognize that I have to go and I have suffered financially because of not going.  I recognize that my situation will not improve until I resume working, but I still cannot muster up the motivation.  I've talked with my psychiatrist, family, and friends who have helped in many ways (financially too), but I just can't.  

It's not a job I'm necessarily excited to go to, it's just a job.  I've worked at worse places, and I'm able to listen to music/podcasts/etc while I'm there.  

If anyone has felt the same way or has helped someone in a similar situation, I would really appreciate some advice."
995,I'm convinced antidepressants are mostly placebos,"I made a post recently on all the antidepressants I've ever used: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/jngmrs/heres_a_list_of_my_meds_anyone_have_luck_with_any/

I'm so sick of trying new drugs and having it not work and then being more depressed that it's just another placebo. I don't know why these drugs are even on the market. I don't even know why they need a prescription. You can't abuse a pill that does almost nothing any more than OTC pain killers. These ""Antidepressants"" seem like all they do is make you sleepy, lose or gain weight, and make your libido disappear. If that's the intended purpose, don't call them antidepressants.

Zoloft is a libido killer. Mirtazapine and trazodone are sleep aids. Seroquel is a sleep aid and weight gainer. Lithium, buspar, latuda and wellbutrin don't do anything. None of them are antidepressants.

Sorry for the rant."
996,Getting annoyed with being told to just be different.,"I’m just sick of people telling me how to fix myself. That everything would be different and my non-professional diagnosis is “just change your attitude” when I have OCD, depression, some serious ADD, and don’t function well in times of great stress and uncontrollable factors. My life is a shit show. I’m more emotional than I am rational and it prevents me from actually seemingly enjoying anything or living a full life. I have scattered thoughts constantly and feel like I’m just incredibly stupid half the time. I see most things I do as wastes of time and not being productive, yet anything I do that’s “productive” is kind of meaningless in the big picture and not impressive to anyone. For some reason I need to feel like I fit in and that I’m not some like low life who isn’t productive enough. I feel like I have to be this impressive, interesting, successful, very intelligent/put together person 24/7 to have any sense of self-worth and none of my hobbies feel real anymore. I don’t enjoy my video games cuz everything seems way more important than they are. The person who just tried giving me life advice is in a good place... has plenty of money he works hard for, doesn’t have any addictions, doesn’t have mental health issues, says I speak in hyperboles way too much, and said if I want to feel adequate then I have to work at it and be positive instead of thinking everything is going to be negative all the time. Like me getting a job finally when most likely it’s just going to disappear in the next month because I live in the US and it’s a restaurant job. He’s like “well it’s an improvement it’s better than nothing” but this improvement isn’t controlled. It’s not consistent. It’s extremely possible I will work this job for very little time before it’s gone. 

How the fuck am I just supposed to wake up happy and be excited about my life and day when I feel like nothing is actually in my control and I just feel like a useless sack of shit."

998,Should I ever say that I have depression if I have never been diagnosed by a psychiatrist?,"When I do talk about it with close friends I do say that I get depressed implying it's a temporary state but I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. It feels like my default state and I fit all the symptoms for it. I relate to other people talking about it. However, since I have never been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist, when I do say I have depression I feel like I am being dishonest."
999,Pregnancy scare,"i know this doenst really make sense here but people here are super nice

So, last friday on the 30th I went over to my boyfriend's house. I got there at 2 pm, I think at 3 pm his mom brought us pizza. After we ate I gave him a hand job, he cleaned up with some paper towels and I went to wash my hands. I don't remember but I think between the cuddling I touched him some more but he didn't cum. In the evening, I adjusted my panties and the back of my hand touched the inside fabric of the panty? I didn't touch my crotch directly but the fabric I touched touched it. I know it sounds a bit dumb to be freaking out about something so small, especially since on friday I had a low chance of pregnancy according to Flo. This morning I got my period,and I was surprised since it was supposed to start on this Sunday. I started having cramps like usual before a period for me and obviously I started bleeding. I put on a pad and had really bad cramps for a few hours. I changed my pad and the blood was brown. It's not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think?its not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think? It's just the first day of my period and so far nothing too irregular. I've also had pms the days after that friday. I also noticed that whenever I thought about how I could be pregnant I started feeling sick and when I moved on and calmed down I was okay. There are also no early pregnancy signs. I think its too early to tell, since I heard about the spotting that happens but I just want to know if there is a chance I'm pregnant? I've read sperm survives on the skin max 30 minutes and only if it's still wet I think? And I'm pretty sure when I adjusted my panties my hand was dry and 30 minutes had passed since I touched him. My friends told me it was okay but I just want to be extra sure? Thank you for reading"
1000,"Keep your head up , keep your heart strong .","I know it hurts ... maybe you don’t even know why you hurt .

It feels like no one cares and no one is around to support you. You’re alone in this chaotic world and feel hopeless.

I just wanted to stop you from scrolling by to say that you are cared for and valued , you have worth and are never alone.

Things won’t stay this way ... that pain will heal. You will be stronger.

One moment I think I'm improving, the next moment I fall back again in this shitty, wretched, horrible wreck of a mind. 

I'm just so done. I'm so lost. 

I can't think. I can't learn anything new anymore. I'm losing friends and my reputation as a good student. 

I feel detached from reality and from myself. I just don't feel connected with what I'm seeing and my brain. At all. 

Does this post make sense? Idk."
1002,Is it normal to have thoughts of suicide after drinking coffee?,"hello, this is my first post to this sub, but this has been a topic of concern for awhile, but even more so now due to some personal matters. I am not sure if it belongs here or should be posted elsewhere, so please let me know if that is the case. 

I really like the taste of coffee, whether it’s just a cup of cold brew or more involved drinks. I have definitely cut my consumption down by A LOT, mostly because when I was younger I tended to opt for more sugar-y add-in’s and I also had frequent issues with headaches/ insomnia and my pediatrician said the acid and caffeine weren’t helping the situation. 

I’ve recently gotten back into drinking it, but I still limit how much I consume. It’s not an everyday thing, like maybe once or twice a week max and definitely no more than 16oz in a day and for the most part this is fine. However I find that when I drink coffee after I haven’t slept well, on an empty stomach, or anytime past the morning (so like any time after 12pm), I have really bad intrusive thoughts I guess? I feel really stressed out, and thoughts about how I want to kms and die won’t stop surfacing for me. I have no idea why this happening and I just wanted to ask if this is normal and if other people experience the same thing. I have tried drinking decaf when I want coffee later in the day, but it seems to have the same negative affect which I don’t entirely understand as I thought the caffeine might be triggering this for me. 


tl;dr I like coffee, but drinking it (caffeinated or decaf) on an empty stomach, after little sleep, or too late in the day makes me experience suicidal thoughts. Is this normal/ do other people experience this?"
1003,Weird pulling away feeling in head,"I live in the US and I am under a lot of stress. 2-3 years ago I started really hating my current job and went to school for medical coding, attempted to take the test in September and failed it by one point which stressed me further and overall made me feel pretty depressed. After a few weeks I started to feel better and then I lost my grandmother on October 22. Due to complications from Covid. Which was exceptionally hard because she was very much a part of my life and helped raise me. So I’m back to feeling stressed out and sad and still at the job I hate and recently I have started feeling as though an invisible force is pulling my brain. It’s definitely not a fainting sensation. It literally feels like pulling and I have no idea what it could be. As I said before I live in the US and we do not have free healthcare and I cannot afford any form of therapy. So I have never been diagnosed nor have I spoken to a therapist about any of this. Has anyone else ever experienced this pulling sensation or have any idea what it could be? Thanks in advance"
1004,"Why am I like this. - one week only crying, another week numb and the next week maybe even remotely happy and then over again in random order","Last week I asked for a session with my sons psychiatrist. 

My son is 18. He has PTSD and anxiety because of me and his fathers lack of good parenting skills. 

Last week I cried every time I was alone. I just kept crying and was sad. I had flashbacks of how I failed to protect my son from his father and how I am a bad mother and person. I finaly asked for a session at the therapist and got this appointment tomorrow. 

But I am not crying anymore. I dont have fights with my husband. For the first time in many many years I havent fantasized about suicide for almost a week. 

It seems like everything is how its supposed to be now. Our son is in progress, and my husband is improving and trying to be a better father and husband. 

But I feel something is wrong and I cant put it in words without feeling incredibly spoiled and selfish."

1006,Parents Not Understanding *TW: suicide/medication/mentalhealth*,"24 year old female, in law school, currently living with my parents because covid. I have ADHD. In September my therapist and psych thought I was showing symptoms of bi-polar. They said they didn't want to diagnose me immediately and put me on zoloft and wellbutrin --&gt; worst week of my life, went into a manic episode. Called a new psych and she told me that she did not understand why I was taking zoloft and wellbutrin and that ""no wonder I was feeling awful on it."" 

New psych diagnoses me with (ADHD obviously), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I call two different doctors to get second opinions and they agree with this new psych. 

New psych prescribes me prozac 20 mg. On day 17 we have a conference and she said she wants to put me on buspirone. so I start taking prozac and buspirone (twice daily). 

On Monday, I got into an argument with my family because I said ""once i get my JD, I don't think I would take my husband's name."" And then we had an argument about that and also about money. 

My dad said ""are you taking your medication? because if you are...it doesn't seem like its working. are you sure its working? you are so aggressive and angry. i dont think your meds are working."" 

And I said yes.

My dad says, ""well you're screwed up in the head."" 

Thank you dad. I didn't need to be reminded that I was screwed up in the head. 

After that comment, I went to my room and just cried. I kept saying I don't even know what my purpose is in life. I don't make anyone happy. If I died I would probably save my parents so much money. I've had so many people around me die from suicide but life seemed to just go on and it will go on if I'm not here either. 

I'm not quite sure what to do anymore. No one truly understands how I feel and even writing this right now, I'm not sure if others will relate too. I've never felt so lost and so confused. 

This morning, my father said "" i don't want you to take this the wrong way, but i have a friend who sits at the board of a hospital and i called him to see if he knows any psychiatrists and i want you to call this woman…”

So essentially he's asking me to go get a fifth opinion. I really feel crazy and any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."
1007,Possible emotional abuse?,"When I was 16 I dated this religious girl. It started off well we were able to kiss and hold hands etc. Soon enough we progressed to sexual stuff as well, but we never had full on intercourse. After about a year her religious side started coming up and she stopped wanting to do sexual stuff and stopped wanting to kiss and hold hands. I was okay with this for a few months but soon I grew tired of this and I told her that I’m going to break up because we are incompatible. This really stressed her out and she went a bit crazy and started cutting herself and threatened to kill herself if I leave. She was under the impression that I would stay with her like this forever until we got married and then we can start doing stuff again. I didn’t leave her because I genuinely felt like she would end her life so I stayed and I convinced myself that it’s all going to be okay, I lived like this for a year convincing myself that this is my new reality.

By the end of the year she had become even more religious and she explained to me how we can’t be dating as it is against her religion, but she still told me that she wants to get married to me one day so I shouldn’t go for other women when I go to uni. So I was technically single and wasn’t allowed to speak to or be with a girl. For obvious reasons I had become quite emotionally numb and didn’t have the same energy with her. I think she realised that I wasn’t the same person anymore and she started calling the relationship toxic etc and finally left me. I felt so free after this but I still felt off idk how to explain this feeling and idk if i can shake it off. I possibly developed an eating disorder along the way because I became really skinny I was eating like 1 fruit or 1 small meal per day and sleeping for around 14 hours.

It’s been 4 years now and I have been able to pick up some good habits. However, I feel like I can’t feel emotions freely anymore and I don’t even know how I feel most of the time. I’ve lied to myself so much that I feel like I’m lost in this world. I have had one relationship after this and this was thanks to my friends encouraging me to pursue one and get over my fear of women but I couldn’t handle this one because I felt really stressed. I feel like there is imminent doom, like I have no reason to be stressed but it feels like something bad is going to happen, especially when things are going good with a girl. 

I understand that not all women are the same, for instance I still love my mum and she’s an amazing person. But I find it difficult to trust girls and to be open with them. I wish I could become the person I was before I met her she’s negatively skewed my idea of a relationship. This is all so stupid I really shouldn’t let one relationship control me like this and it makes me feel so dumb that it’s still effecting me.

Any advice is greatly appreciated x"
1008,New guy with new guy questions,"First off, thank you for this forum for simply existing.

TLDR: How did you guys get the courage to get help? I'm afraid of meds due to my job(s) and the stigma that comes with mental health issues.

I'm Gutz, and I would like to give a simple background to myself before I start with a few generic questions.

I'm a US military veteran who has been absolutely terrified of seeking mental health care. i joined the army back during the ""dont ask, dont tell"" era and I've suffered from depression, self image issues and self harm for the last 16 years...

I saw a psychiatrist ONCE over a year ago and I was sobbing for an hour after. Just, I hated it and the fact that I've always viewed this struggle as ""My shit, my problem"" and it was super hard for me to come to terms with me actually being there. In hindsight, I think I wasn't ready emotionally. I've never been the kind of guy to talk about my emotions or my traumas.

All of that being said, I think I'm ready to try again. But I'm still scared of actually going and opening up to someone face to face to get the help I need. How did you guys deal with this raw emotion and mental hurdles to simply go get help?

Secondly, I'm scared of medication... not the pills themselves but the stigma attached to them. Is it as bad as my mind is making it out to be or has there been a drastic change shift where getting help isnt demonized anymore?

Thank you for reading this"
1009,Should I bring up my anxiety to my general doctor?,"I have a follow-up with my doctor very soon, about something non-mental health related, and was wondering if I should bring up my anxiety to him? I wasn't sure how I should bring this subject up to someone lol.

It isn't about any new anxiety triggers exactly, it's more about that I've had a lot of anxiety for like 20 years, and I'd like to lessen it if I could (and hopefully without medication). I just never felt like it was severe enough to bring up. I don't get panic attacks, and I don't think I have depression. I'm a bundle of nerves most of the time though, and I worry a lot, and I feel like it makes me irritable/unhappy, even when I should be happy and relaxed, like on the weekends or on vacation.

Do you think I should bring this up to my doctor? I wasn't sure where to get started for this sort of thing."
1010,"i’m in so much constant mental pain, it’s never been this bad. i feel like everything has been taken from me.","i’m 14 years old by the way. firstly, my boyfriend of over 1 year broke up with me two days ago. i was extremely close with him and dependent on him for my happiness. i told him literally everything, and he was the reason why i did things. he broke up with me because my mental health was so bad, and so was his. i’m too dependent on him, it was becoming extreme. he told me that after we both get better, and if i can start to love myself then maybe we can get back together one day. 

i have OCD very badly. i take medication for it and i have a therapist but it doesn’t really do anything. i had ROCD pretty often (relationship focused) while i was in the relationship, and it hasn’t gone away yet. i was constantly worried that i was cheating and had to confess all these stupid little things to my boyfriend constantly. i was in constant fear of him getting angry with me and breaking up with me. although he wasn’t angry whenever it happened it still feels like my biggest fear has come to life.

Everyone is telling me to work on finding myself and loving myself. they’re telling me that time will heal it. i understand that but right now it hurts so bad. i literally have lost all motivation for anything. i haven’t showered in days, i’ve only eaten light snacks and i’ve barley left my bed. i have to be talking to friends almost constantly. waking up is the worst feeling ever. i hate trying to sleep because i keep thinking about him and feeling the pain. it feels like my chest and stomach are constantly getting stabbed by a knife. my mom offered to take me to anywhere that i wanted to go that’s close by, normally i enjoy getting out of the house but i said no. the thought of doing anything feels empty and pointless. i have cried many times since it happened but most of the time it feels like i can’t cry. when he first broke up with me i had a meltdown and kept repeating over and over that i don’t want to live anymore, and that i’m nothing. i already regret that so much. he told me i was manipulating him.

He’s bad off too, and it hurts me. We have texted a couple times just to check up on each other. He’s worried i’m going to hurt myself. I have been trying really hard to be positive about it, and he said he’s proud of me. He told me I was being strong. He is doing just as bad as I am with this and it makes me feel so awful to think about. i don’t want him to cry or feel this bad. i don’t understand because i thought both of us were starting to get better and then he went and did this. 

I love him so much. yesterday my friends said I wasn’t taking his feelings into account but i don’t understand because it feels like i am. my dependency on him was and is a serious problem. I had a problem where i saw him as some type of perfect person who can never do wrong and I still do. what’s wrong with me? I just wanted to be in a normal and happy relationship with him. that’s all i want. it’s so hard to get through everyday now. it feels like everything good has been drained from me. i miss him so much. i miss when everything was normal."
1011,I don’t ever want to date or be in a relationship..,"It’s because of the biases and negative mindset towards mental illness.

People with mental illness are described as toxic, attention seekers, selfish, don’t contribute enough in the relationship, clingy, abusive etc. 


A lot of people don’t even understand how the illnesses even work and lack any empathy whatsoever or the empathy they have is skin deep and or fake...but they’ve formed their biases because of what they’ve watched/been told or read or because of their “terrible exes” behavior when in fact it was their bad character not their illness that caused the problems...mental illness is viewed as a character flaw that needs to be 100% corrected instead of an actual illness...I’m expected to “have it together” all the time...maybe I can have “a moment” but it better be short and I better be back to “normal” ASAP or I’ll become toxic. It’s like a movement that’s painting mentally ill people as ill suited even dangerous partners unless their illness is cured or “under control” enough that it’s not even noticeable. We are expected to be there for our parter on top of having our illness but things can’t be reciprocated less we become “toxic”. We are the problem, we have to fix ourselves *on our own* which is funny because at the same time we are told not to bottle things up and talk and that we “are not alone”. 

People lose interest or run for the hills if someone says “I have *insert mental illness*.” And the few that give you a chance leave or give you an ultimatum to “get better” they’ll leave.


I really believe it’ll be better for my health if I stay single, I already have to deal with my own personal onslaught of negative comments...hearing it from someone I love the most in life will kill me...or make me irreversibly bitter.


P.S. I have severe depression and anxiety which I’m getting treatment for and *slowly* healing yet I believe a relationship will reverse my progress and I refuse to let that happen."
1012,"I can get grumpy if I don't have anything to look forward to. I get excited, happy, and nicer to be around when I have something to look forward to. Is this something others have? Can I address it?","I've been seeing a therapist since I got sober almost 4 years ago.  It wasn't up until the past 6 months that I've been able to put together this theory.  When I have something to look forward to in the near future I get a rush of happiness thinking about it.  This can range from a project I'm enjoying working on at work, to an activity planned with my kids for the weekend, to the dinner I'm going to enjoy later in the night, a new episode of my favorite podcast, or even an Amazon package I'm expecting to arrive in the next couple days.

I find myself depending on finding these happy things to look forward to.  One thing that commonly happens is if I don't have planned activities or work around the house planned out the weekends I can get kinda snippy with my wife.  We have two kids under 4 so that's a big part of our weekend is keeping them busy and always making sure someone has eyes on the youngest 1.5yr).  

One thing I've been trying to improve since getting sober is my mental health.  Part of that revolves around mindfulness and meditation.  It's something I've started a few times but stopped after a few weeks. Anyways, I know a big part of mindfulness is being present.  And I'm worried about that because I get so happy and energetic when I have something looking forward to that it goes against the principles of mindfulness.  And it makes me think what I'm doing might be a bad thing?

Is this a thing?! I'm just wondering if anyone else has heard of this or experienced it.  I brought it up to my therapist but he didn't have much to speak on about it.  I'm not drinking a bottle of vodka a day or snorting Adderall anymore, but could this be a bad thing I'm doing?  I'm not sure if it's healthy. I'd love to hear if other have experienced this or how you feel about it.  I just want to keep the happy things coming into my life!"
1013,What happens if you answer “Yes” to the suicidal question at the doctors?,"As of right now I’m fine, I’m having stupid ideations but I want to get a grasp on it before I start to spiral. I don’t want to be taken into any inpatient facility or hospital, I just want someone to talk to. If I answer “yes” to their “are you having any suicidal thoughts” what will happen?"
1014,Ate without guilt for the first time!,"I have an eating disorder causing me to skip meals, obsesse around calories and lose weight (lost 10kg because of it) and generally be really worried with food. And today for the first time I ate an unexpected treat without feeling any guilt! I ate a donut and I am so happy that I am starting to enjoy it again without worrying and or feeling guilt,"
1015,Does depression affect the ability to feel love?,"I hope this is not insesitive I am genuinely curious how depression can affect the feeling of love and the ability to love someone else. I have not experienced depression but I can understand how love is not the main emotion or priority for someone suffering from depression. So Reddit, does depression affect the ability to feel love?"
1016,Dream sharing,"TW: MENTIONING OF SUICIDES AND DEPRESSION 
Tnr: me and my sister shared the same dream!

So I fell asleep as my sleep schedule is off track. My dream that I had was terrifying. I was fine and then something happened in my dream. I am normally a very detailed and vivid dreamer. What happened I dont remember. It was blurred out. But whatever happened it destroyed me. I began to refuse to eat and cry for hours on end repeating ""please....please just end me. let me die"". While saying this I am literally close or was having a mental break down. It didn't matter where I was I was sobbing and pleading for my life to be taken. I became numb in my dream and a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. I ended the dream by killing myself. Dreadful to say the least.
It was a haunting dream that ruined my mood for the day. My sister texted me in the middle of the night and said ""please get mental help. Are you okay?"" I asked her what she meant and she said that she fell asleep that night and in her dream I was begging HER to take my life. In my dream I was just begging everyone. She said I couldn't stop crying and looked very sick. She said at the end of the dream I killed myself and she woke up. She said that she told mom and because I had turned my dream phone off, they couldn't find me in my dream. 

THE FACT! that we shared a dream... scares the hell out of me. I realize dreams are symbolic, but I think I need to start taking my depression medication again 👀. Note me and my sister don't really talk at that level. We talk if its serious but never about our health or mental health. There would be no way shed know that I have depression."
1017,Why do I want to indulge myself into sadness?,"Last year I dealt with horrible depression. I've managed to get myself up a bit, even thought I had a few relapses.

But I've been smiling a lot for the past few days, but it feels fake(?) I mean I like the time when I'm smiling and joking around, but as soon as I'm alone it feels like I'm wearing a mask.

And it feels like I'm just barely holding everything's together, like at any moment it can all go downhill and I'd be at that same place.
I feel out of control.

And for some reason, I want to be sad(?) Not cry, but like a bit depressed. I know it isn't good but I want to be sad, or harm myself, or starve myself. I don't understand...why am I like this?"
1018,Is it okay to be numb in the moment?,"I’m in this friend group that is very overtly sexual towards me bc of my sexuality. I’m a lesbian and they’ll ask me to play sexual games w the straight girls or tell me to make out w the girls while their bf watches. Really weird and inappropriate stuff. 

I’ve noticed that when that happens to me, in the moment I don’t feel angry or hurt. I feel numb. I just turn off my reaction to it and pretend it doesn’t bother me. Yet when I go home and think about what they said and did to me I feel gross and objectified. 

Is it wrong for me to feel disgusted after the fact? Should I be feeling gross when it happens or is it okay that I only feel horrible when I’m home away from them?

TLDR: my friends make me feel objectified for sexuality and I only feel gross about it when I’m alone. Is that normal?"
1019,is hitting/biting yourself or pulling out hair self harm,idk
1020,I don't even know if I'm 'mostly good' or not,"TW: self harm, eating disorders and a whole lot more I guess?

This is going to be a long ramble because I'm really not feeling good right now. I'm living an overall happy (if not, not sad?) life. The thing is I occasionally feel very... down. The 'Uhh I don't think this is normal' feel down. 'Everything is terrible, I won't ever be a functioning member of society, I binge eat a whole lot of food and think of vomiting after, I can't get off the floor nor move and I still haven't taken my school uniform off it's 1 am and I have an urge to cut myself, I want to run away from home and disassociate from everything' down. Or is this normal? I don't know. Occasionally feeling down would be pretty normal I guess. But... is *this* normal? I don't even know if I should go see a doctor or not. Mood swings like this doesn't qualify as depression for all I know and that's the thing I was diagnosed with. I have a whole lot of other problems they don't know and I don't know how to bring it up. Maybe this IS normal. Maybe when people feel like shit this is what all of us go through and I'm just being a pussy. I don't know. There was a lot more to ramble about but I don't think I can fit all of that in here. So uhh... thanks for reading all of that."
1021,Don't know what to do,"I have a friend that live in HK. He was Very nice and fun to hang with. Recently however, he seem to have gotten very stressed and breaking down. His parents always press him to do better, which gives him the mindset that he will never be good enough. He always look at the more social kids and wonder if he's wasting his life. People even make fun of him, spreading rumors and such. He's always afraid of failure and is about to go to Europe for boarding school. He's afraid of no one liking him. Even making fun of him, and if they might teach harder things. He already broke down 3 times, and once in front of his parents but they didn't seem to care. All I can do is listen so far, but I really wanna know if there is something else I can do. He's been thinking about ending it...."
1022,Should I share about my mental breakdown during my exit interview?,"Should I share about my mental breakdown during my exit interview?

TLDR: Broke down mentally because of work. Sent in my resignation letter a few days later, not mentioning my mental breakdown. Have an exit interview next week, wanting to find out more as to why I’m quitting. Should I bring up my incident?

I work in a customer service role at a firm that does e-commerce and traditional retail business. I recently tendered my resignation because I was burnt out from my job. 

The situation is that I have been in a customer service role since June; I inherited a large problem (many unanswered customer emails) because my predecessor left without a proper handover. This was also because my then-manager decided it was not necessary for my predecessor to serve a notice period and basically she left in 2 days after she tendered. 

Fresh into the role, I was a little hopeful I could change things and battle the horde of customer emails. However one month into my new role, my manager announced her resignation too. This really fucked up the morale within my team because we were all barely coping with the swarming number of customer enquires and our boss decided to uproot herself. 

When she left, upper management failed to find a replacement until 6 weeks later. My colleagues and myself were left to fend customer enquires and battle for cooperation from other departments all by ourselves with no one to support us. The problem snowballed especially badly for me.

Our new boss only came in mid October but the damage has been done. One teammate sent in her resignation a week after that because she was so burnt out and feeling beaten up from internal and external stakeholders.
 
Two weeks later I broke down mentally. I was suicidal one night after a day of work and bawled myself to sleep. The next morning I woke up and I started crying uncontrollably again. I stay with my parents and they had to intervene because I couldn’t stop crying and I was still feeling suicidal. Some context: I’m seeing a counselor, but I’m not diagnosed with depression.

I eventually sent in my resignation letter a few days later. However I was a bit anxious about it as I didn’t want to bring up my mental break down. I cited reasons like I didn’t want to continue customer service as a profession and I didn’t think my personality was a good fit for the role. She didn’t really buy it but respected my decision. The thing is, next week I have an exit interview with my boss and my HR because they want to go deeper as to why I’m quitting. I really don’t want to share more about my mental breakdown and I just want a clean exit as much as possible. What should I expect from this exit interview? Should I share about my mental breakdown and suicidal thoughts?"
1023,A (Mental Health) Guide for the Second Lockdown: Ten Steps.,"[Ten Steps](https://everythingobserved.wordpress.com/2020/11/03/a-mental-health-guide-for-the-second-lockdown/)

Hi everyone, last night I posted on my blog ‘Ten Steps’ for the upcoming lockdown (England). I took a retrospective look back at the first lockdown and compiled these for anyone that may find them useful. The uncertainty around Coronavirus and lockdowns is a huge trigger for some people’s mental health. I hope these will be of use to some of you. 

Let me know what you think and stay safe!"
1024,"I hate everyone, I get angry when someone texts me but I also get angry when they don't text me","I have two friends. They're all I have other than my cats and we live far apart.

Every time they want to talk I get this feeling of spite towards them, I want to ignore them so they forget about me and I can die alone without anyone being hurt, but then if they do ignore me I also get pissed because I think I mean nothing to them and they only want to talk when they need me.

I have a little voice in my head that keeps maliciously whispering conspiracy theories against everyone I have ever known and everyone who is currently in my life, I know that everything it says is not true but I can't help but believe it strongly.

I'm exhausted. Every day is a constant back and forth between hating and adoring somebody, I feel horrific because I know everyone hates me and I'm disgusting, I have dark thoughts that I should be locked up for.

I feel like a toxic sludge of death that's shaped like a human, I don't feel like I belong anywhere, every day is a blur and it all blends together, nothing feels real anymore.

I tried forcing myself to morph my personality to be more aggressive, rude and overall unlikable, but it only made me feel worse because I'm not the type of person to be unreasonably rude towards someone even if I don't feel good about them inside.
My hope was that if I channeled all my dark thoughts and feelings into anger I would be able to let out all the pressure, like punching a hole in a pressure cooker, but this has only lead to more people not liking me and me becoming more lonely.

It's a neverending nightmare."
1025,I feel like I’m living a double life,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I was thinking it might be related to my depression maybe 

I realize that sometimes I do questionable things that I know I should regret or feel bad about but I  don’t have any feelings for what I did/do. It feels like it was someone else who did those things and I feel like I have no connection to it even though it was me. 

I’m usually pretty reserved and prudish(I guess?) but I go through these phases where I am like hypersexual. I willingly seek out strangers from the internet and say things send them pictures that I would normally never send to anyone. I masturbate like an insane amount of times a day. I do feel more confident in my body tho, I think I’m like the sexiest thing in the world, I usually hate my body and always wear big loose clothes. I usually feel my best when I’m going through this, whatever it is, but I feel like I crash pretty hard when it over.

It’s kinda weird because I feel like I usually act myself around people but when I’m alone it’s like a completely different person. I feel like I’m living a double life or something. 

Does something like this happen to anyone else?"
1026,It doesnt get better,"Like 2-3 months ago I made a post on this subreddit about how I just can't deal with anything anymore and a lot of people wrote like ""its gonna get better"". But guess what, it doesn't, at least not for me.

I was never diagnosed, but I just know I struggle with depression and anxiety as well as other mental disorders. I wasn't diagnosed, firstly because I don't like doctors and therapists(I guess because of anxiety) and secondly because my mother never believed in this and always tough it was just a phase. I also think I should mention my parents are split, I live with strict mother and we have a lot of financial issues. Just to clarify I'm 17 M, so no one even tried to understand my depression as it is a ""girl thingy"". Any act of attention seeking or reaching out and speaking about my problem is considered pu$$y like.

I lost a lot of friend due to my depression, make a lot of mistakes because I can't think straight and make the right decisions when depressed or anxious. I still regret leaving my girlfriend 7-8 months ago just because I was sad and didn't know what to do. She helped me a lot and one of the main problems is that I don't have her in my life anymore.

Now, when I wrote a post about how I can't do it anymore, it was when it all started. My mental health has gotten so much better after that mainly because I started hanging out a lot more and found people similar to me. We formed like a little gang. One of the things that connected us was the financial issues most of us had. To have a better time we started shoplifting tobacco, alcohol, food, energy drinks or just stuff to sell and make money to actually buy anything.

I know it's gross, bad and all that negative descriptions but try to understand my situation. At the time it made me happier in a way. So a few weeks ago I got caught and a big cash penalty or prison time is awaiting me. I stopped stealing and I'm not planning on stealing ever again, I learned my lesson. I'm fairly good student. I'm about to enter faculty, one of the best in my country so I'm working on bettering my self but this is where the real problem begins. 

I need help, real help. The only people that can help me are my mentally abusive mother and her boyfriend. I now have to act by her rules and that is mentally destroying me. She leaves town for a few days when she has to work and she is taking me with her now because ""she cant leave me alone"". I'm not allowed to leave the house. I can't talk to my previous friends. I get even fewer money than before.

I'm not mad at her, I deserve the punishment but I can't stand myself anymore. On top of my depression this punishment made me feel even more miserable. I've got the time to overthink every little thing I did in the past few months. I mean the things aren't even that bad but I just overthink it too much. 

I feel so alone, to the point where letting myself think is a punishment so I have to keep myself busy with video games or music. I don't have anybody to talk to. I have friends but I don't feel like they are interested. The exact quote to describe this feeling is from BoJack Horseman: ""Everybody loves you, but nobody likes you""

I want someone to help me mentally, but I can't reach out to anyone. U can even read in this post how confusing I am, irl its even more confusing I can't even describe my problem to anyone. Not to mention how nervous I get when talking about my problems. I sometimes find myself talking to myself in third person, I guess it's because I want someone to talk about me that way, I want someone to notice I'm hurting. If I want that why don't I get that? I can't, I always think my problems don't matter and everyone has bigger problems and I just overthink. Maybe that is the real problem after all.

Sry I overshared."
1027,How to find my own therapist?,"My life is extremely stressful rn and i think i could benefit from therapy, but i dont know much about it?

1032,Trying to balance therapy with an inconsistent schedule...am I an “annoying” patient?,"I (26 M) have been going to therapy on and off since I was in high school. I found a facility and therapist a couple of years ago that I have been regularly going to ever since. 

I have been working with my therapist pretty consistently (2-3 times a month) since May and I feel that I have made really good progress. However, I’m currently working a difficult graveyard schedule and have had a hard time scheduling consistent appointments with him, so now, I’m only scheduling appointments when I feel I really need to. I’m also paying out of pocket and it’s becoming difficult to afford consistent sessions. 

I recently scheduled an appointment with him and half of our conversation was regarding scheduling. He seemed a bit annoyed that I have been inconsistent with my sessions lately and stated he would really only prefer to work with his patients weekly in chunks of 8-12 weeks. 

Am I being a “bad” or “annoying” patient?

The vibe of the conversation was not very friendly and I felt like a major inconvenience. He had never hinted that scheduling was becoming an issue until now, and I have been very open with him about my personal life and erratic work schedule. I almost feel uncomfortable continuing treatment with him since I will not have a consistent schedule in the near future. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or have any similar experiences? How do therapists feel about stuff like this?"

1035,what do I do?,"I am a senior in high school so I have college apps, work, and a shit load of school work as well as some weird stuff going on with friends that I have been stressing about. It's been getting worse and worse over the past months, and recently I've been completely breaking down when the stress gets really bad. I get uncontrollable crying for half an hour or so and this has happened once or twice a months now. It happened for the first time over the summer. My grandpa is in heart failure, and my brother who is in college is struggling with depression and anxiety. Both have gotten worse recently, and I can see how stressful it is to my parents. I can't tell my parents about my own problems because I don't know if they can handle anymore. I don't know what to do tho because I dont know how much more I can handle, even tho my problems are nothing compared to what the rest of my family is going through. What do I do?

I should add I do not have any thoughts of hurting myself."

I've tried exercising, medication, and therapy but nothing seems to dampen the overwhelming feeling of apathy I have on a daily basis. 

I just want to feel emotion again. I want everyday to be a new day like they used to. I don't want my life to be so predictable. It's so exhausting feeling this way. I just want something to change and its never does."

Feel sick to my stomach,"I don’t think I would have jumped but I feel guilty that I was strongly considering something yesterday. I went on a ferry to have fun and it was late at night, super cold, and there was no one there at the moment. I was by the edge of the ferry with a railing and I kept telling myself now is your chance to jump. So I started to put a foot on and then I stopped myself. I was arguing with myself again and also thought about how painful it will be. A cop then came by and gave me a look and idk if he realizes what I was thinking. Doubt it, right? He could have thought I was just trying to get a better view? He kept walking by the whole time I was on the ferry and I realized it’s not the place to do anything and I can’t do it because I’m scared of how painful it will be and that I’ll survive. But I couldn’t give up the thought and kept going back and forth with myself. I argued with myself that it’s so cold you’re numb and won’t feel the pain as much. Pins and needles will feel numb in the water. The whole time I was going back and forth and I didn’t end up having fun. 

I feel guilty that I was even considering this again and I don’t know if I wanted to jump or not. Then I found this isolated place on this island and the first thing that came to my mind again was “jump and all this will end. Look at how up it is and no one is around for the first time. You won’t get this chance later. Just jump. C’mon just do it.” I couldn’t do it again. 

Idk this is just normal stuff, right? Maybe everyone thinks about jumping and gives slight consideration?"

Just for context: We have a class that replaced it’s final test with a cumulative project and the professor changed things every week so we started providing feedback and suggesting things in no way complaining. 

Y'all if you saw my comment in the zoom chat it was not the best way to convey my message and sorry if it came out as rude but I just wanna reminds you guys stressing out is okay wether you work or not. And this is directed to all of you but if someone is telling Prof that this isn't the best way they feel like it's working for them, saying that it's easy for you, can make someone feel like their doing something wrong when theyre not at all. But thanks for reading , all love❤️"
1039,My mentally ill brother is being charged with a felony,"My brother is 28 and has Asperger’s syndrome as well as a psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified). He’s the sweetest person ever and very timid and isolates himself in his room most of the time

On Monday he was triggered in a disagreement with my mom and within seconds he had grabbed a steak knife and stabbed her multiple times. Luckily my mom is okay and only had to get stitches. (This attack also happened in front of my 7 yr old brother who is autistic- luckily no one else was injured) 

My brother has no idea what he did, he knows my mom got hurt but he doesn’t know who hurt her. Our family is worried about him being arrested for a felony assault, we saw him today on a video screen in court (he couldn’t see us) and he is just shut down and quiet, just following directions from everyone. He is unaware of where and why he is there and we don’t know what to do

The state took the case and we want to get him out ASAP and get him help but his bail is too high. I’m still in shock about everything and would appreciate any advice"
1040,i loose my memory alot and idk why,"okay so i tried calling my doctor a few times im waiting for a call back. but whenever i feel a pit in my chest and anxiety, i feel my head get cloudy and i forget things really fast. idk why but its been happening alot. like i could be searching for something on google and half way ill forget what i was even searching up. i cry alot about this i feel like a dumbass and idk what to do. whenever i get like this i isolate myself and talk to my boyfriend bc hes the only one who knows about it and ik if i say what or stop speaking out of nowhere he wouldnt get mad at me for it. i kinda feel like this is disassociation but im not sure. i have my first therapy appointment on friday and ill definately tell her about this. but still am i the only one who deals with this?"
1041,I have never been in this low of a mental state in my entire life,"School has absolutely obliterated my mental state. I can't stand sitting in my room everyday listening to lectures or doing homework. I am fed up. I feel like I'm going insane. I was doing fine at the beginning of the semester but I feel like I'm spiraling downward into this hole that keeps growing deeper and deeper.

After studying my ass off and getting failing grades, I've lost my motivation to even try at this point. For one one of my classes, the average score for our midterm was a 50%, I fell below it. It feels like the university system is working against me at preparing me to take these exams. I feel like a failure.

After these instances, I don't even bother to try anymore. I know that education is important and I am so close to finally getting my bachelor's but I'm questioning is it really worth the tradeoff of feeling this terrible about myself? I don't enjoy most things anymore, let alone enjoy my major. I don't participate in lectures or pay attention to them. Everything about school annoys me. There's always something coming up and something to prepare for all while juggling full time classes.

I know that I am extremely lucky to only have to worry about classes but goddamn it I seriously hate them. I don't feel any sense of fulfillment from these classes. Every night, I dread the idea of waking up and having to deal with all the bullshit all over again.

I just want to get my degree and move on with my life but it feels impossible right now. I've tried searching for mental health help but therapists or counselors never really have helped in the past. I've tried meditating but I dread that too. It feels like my body is just rejecting everything at this point. It's like I translate everything that has happened with school into everything else in my life too, knowing that even if I try, I'll still fail regardless.

I don't want to drop out but I don't to keep feeling this way. How can I get out of this poor mental state? I feel so far gone from my normal self."
1042,Just Checking In,"**Introduction to our Mental Health &amp; Disabilities Series**

Chloe Mogg, one of the PRS and writers here at [**Quite Great**](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/) hosts our new segment for our YouTube channel ‘**Just Checking In**’. A series that talks about the importance of raising awareness for mental health and invisible disabilities. We decided it was best to get this out there now, as after all, the coronavirus pandemic isn’t the only pandemic that’s going on.

Our first video discusses chronic illnesses, mental health issues, the coronavirus pandemic, lockdown and discrimination in the industry. ’Just Checking In’ is a helping hand as such and something that will hopefully raise more awareness for these conditions. We want this new segment to be something that gives artists in the industry who suffer with mental health problems and disabilities that platform that they deserve. We are human at the end of the day, and you can do anything if you put your mind to it. We’ll be covering many different pointers including some advice videos, interviews from people in the industry and hearing their story, to a lot more too. 

Head to our website to watch Episode 1 of the series - [https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/just-checking-in/](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/just-checking-in/)"
1043,No social support. Back to being reclusive.,"I had a lonely childhood which became a solitary adulthood. My family isn't close in the slightest and I was bullied in my youth so I got *really* good at being by myself. I worked to come out of my shell a bit but started relying on others too much. I finally had support but overindulged and was asking my friends for help/advice about everything. During a rough patch, it came to the point where I could see they were tired of me. They mean well and are just enforcing their boundaries, but I felt so rejected and dismissed. I feel I should go back to keeping everything to myself. It’s unhealthy and a bit extreme but they can only put up with so much and I don’t have anyone else. No family. No significant others. And now I feel my friendships has devolved into fair-weather status. I feel lonely and preemptively lonely as this is going to continue for a long time."
1044,I'm destroying my life,"What the title says. I'm screwing up my life.

I just can't bring myself to actually DO something, even when I know that there will be consequences. This has gotten worse over the years. In the past, I spend my time playing/making games or watching TV. Nowadays I can barely bring myself to play something more complicated like sudoku or same game on my notebook and can't even focus to watch anything longer. I can't even watch a 10 youtube video without having a second browser window open or playing something. I read news articles for two minutes before thinking screw it and return to wasting time doing essentially nothing. I can't remember the last time I read a news article completly. Even writing this post took me hours because I always stop after writing a few words (if at all) and then turn to something else. And I can already see how bad everything is phrased.

For the last two weeks I wasted nearly all my time going up and down in my room, thinking and getting angry about something until my shirt is completly soaked in sweat. Followed by panic attacks and devastating feelings of help- and worthlessness that makes me need to sit down and holding my head.

I know I need help, but getting help isn't easy either thanks to social anxiety.

(I hope you understand what I'm saying. Obvious note that my native language isn't english.)"
1045,Is this a sign that i am depressed?," All day i try to get a hold of what's wrong and split it into problems i can find the root cause of, that makes it simpler and i feel like if i just have the right revelation i will be happy and functional. It's like holding on to straws every day. Seeing it fall apart and then finding new straws the next day. I don't know if it's because most of my energy goes in doing this , but i also feel like I can't think like I can't look at a problem actually think and solve it, the only way i react is the first thing my brain comes up it with the first round of unconscious processing, which isn't quite bad and has never led me to trouble but i still can't make decisions can't confromt problems head on, need a lot of space after even a minor incontinence, get overwhelmed a lot if i get even two tasks simultaneously, and in general my memory has depleted , and i get annoyed by every other thing. Now this doesn't seem like normal functioning but i have read accounts of depressed people, have a few friends who have chronic depression, and they are actually quite paralysed, and they speak from personal experience that i am not depressed."
1046,"I’m isolated, depressed, and have no friends, please talk to me.","For some reason I have a hard time making friends, I just need someone whose willing to talk to me regularly, I just want any sort of social interaction and that this point I’m desperate. 
If you’re bored send me a dm and I’ll ask you how your day is going, we can talk about the weather or football or conspiracy theories or whatever. Please, I’m just so god damned alone that I’ve come to reddit to find friends."
1047,Why Raising Successful Kids is the Cause of Anxiety in Teens,"Anxiety in teens is on the rise, and telling kids to be successful may be the cause of it. Professor Davis challenges the belief that social media for kids is the cause of anxiety and points to another cause of anxiety - expectations. In my latest YouTube interview he talks about the words ""success"" and ""potential"" and why those words are causing the anxiety in teens in school. Feedback and support are appreciated.

1048,Meditation has helped me beyond belief,"Hello everyone, I hope all that are reading this are doing well with everything that is going on right now. I wanted to take some time to talk about my experience with meditation in hopes that it may inform others about it. 
I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety at the age of 13, and that diagnosis still holds true today (f18). 
I started investing time into meditation about a year or so ago and have seen myself benefit from it greatly. Meditation doesn’t have to be sitting cross-legged with your hands on your knees humming. While many people do that, you don’t have to. For me, I usually lay on my back. I also occasionally sit on my yoga mat. I then close my eyes and focus on my breathing. I take deep breaths to relax my body and slow down. When I meditate I either completely focus on my breathing or dedicate the time to understanding what I’m going through at the moment. I process what is going on in my life and how it makes me feel. I let myself feel my emotions, but not let them take me over because that time is dedicated to processing, not reliving. There are also many options of guided meditation videos on YouTube that are good if you’re just starting out and don’t really know what to do. 
After I started making meditation a priority in my life, I began to feel less anxious about what was to come, whatever it may be. I began to let myself live in the moment. I also began enjoying the little things in life and finding something to be happy about even on dark days. My depression usually worsens in the fall/winter time, but this year is different. I still have my days that suck, but I have a different perspective now. 
All I’m trying to say is that if you haven’t tried it, might as well just try it out. If you don’t like it, that’s okay. If you love it, that’s okay too."
1049,*sighs heavily*,"Can I get a hello, or a how are you? I don't know. I just...sigh. Nevermind.   
Carry on."
1050,Help. Just... Help.,"Hello, to whoever is reading this. 

It's my first attempt at something like this, and please forgive me for the length of this post. I'm about 26, from India, and have been doing well in life. Job, family, girlfriend, lived in a great house with a close friend, and so on. And all of a sudden, within the span of about three to four months, I'm on the brink of losing everything. 

I was going to go to Scotland to study a masters degree so I quit my job, but COVID ruined that plan. Left the house I was staying in with a friend and returned home with the intention to come to a safe, peaceful environment, but it turns out that my parents are considering filing for divorce. My girlfriend left me because she said things weren't working out and that she herself is going through a lot, and she's involved with someone else about two-three months later. I'm in a different city (where my parents reside) and I don't know anyone here. I'm someone who drinks to distract myself from things and I'm someone who loves to share things with my significant other, and I'm currently in a position to do neither. 

I'm generally someone who is capable of dealing with \*whatever\* comes my way and doing so positively but for once I feel... weak. Very, very weak. And with everything around me seemingly crumbling all at once, I don't know what to do. Not once have I ever considered something like self-harm let alone suicide, but I feel like I'm slipping down a rather dangerous slope. 

Fuck, I feel so suffocated."

1052,What's a healthy way to deal with feeling like a failure?,The chaos of 2020 has made it hard to achieve personal goals.
1053,"Either stress at my (35f) family situation caused me to hallucinate, or my dad has a secret 800k","My dad is 74 years old and has parkinsons. I was at his house yesterday helping him with some admin, using the computer etc and doing his online banking.

He recently got an inheritance of £100k from an aunt, which he is gifting most of to my sister to help her buy a house. I had to help with getting proof of the inheritance to the solicitor.

When I was on his banking page I felt strange about looking in too much detail - I'm 34 and still feel like the young one in the family and I felt I'd be prying. I was certain however that I saw one of the current accounts had £800k in it.

This is waaaaay more money than my dad has ever told us that he has.

I didn't mention it then and there to him because as I said, I felt like I shouldn't really be looking at it.

After I drove home I messaged my mum (they live together), and said ""its quite likely that I must misread it, but was i correct?!""

She said absolutely not, maybe like £8000 but not £800k.

I feel like I actually went crazy - it was like a hallucination. Its not completely out of the realms of possibility, but it would change everything if he did have that amount. Firstly, he'd have kept it a secret (even from his wife) and secondly, he's forever of the mindset that we have no money and are poor.

Idk maybe I was just super stressed, and my brain was wishful thinking. I regret not raising it then and there, or taking a photo so I could be sure. I am kind of doubting my own mind.

TLDR: saw dad's bank acct. He either has a heap of money we had no idea about, or I've lost my mind."
1054,"My boyfriend just confessed about being suicidal, how do I help him with this?","I highly recommended therapy and he said he would try to ask his parents for help but I’m not sure how honest he’s being, how do I help him? Idk what to say and I’m scared to lose him, I already told him how much he meant to me but he doesn’t really believe me when I talk about how great he is, he says he has no hope in life so he’s been considering it (like how he would do it and if he would legitimately do it)"
1055,I don’t know if I’m just lazy and unmotivated or if there is something else at play.,"I am 17 and currently in my first year of tertiary education. I’ve been a procrastinator for as long as I can remember, but it’s only a few years ago when it has started to really negatively impact my life. It’s not like I forget about the deadlines often or anything like that, I just keep telling myself I’ll start later. I just sit there and do other meaningless stuff, like scrolling through social media, reading a book, playing video games or just lying on the floor with music on. I’m aware of the time passing but I just can’t bring myself to start and I don’t know why. 
Since I procrastinate so much, all the work I do is in the wee hours of the morning, often just a few hours before I have to leave the house for school. Which just means I barely get any sleep, if any at all. On good days where there isn’t work assigned I would pack my bag the night before for school, but when the alarm rings and I wake up, I just feel so unmotivated and lazy to go. Sometimes I continue laying in bed, scrolling through my phone, aware of the time passing. Sometimes I’m just so tired I go back to sleep. When days like these happen I just end up feeling so bad and wonder if I’ll be able to catch up on what was taught that day.
I’ve been skipping meals often nowadays since it’s almost a chore to eat. My mum cooks for the family most days and when she doesn’t, my dad buys food for us so really the only thing I have to do is show up at the dining table. 
I don’t think I have anything, but I’ve posted something similar to this in the r/therapy thread and some people have suggested ADHD. I have read up on it a little and though a few of the symptoms are relatable, I don’t think most are. 
The lack of motivation and laziness I think generally only applies to school affairs. I would indulge in my hobbies like gaming and reading, I would go out with friends and family if they asked.
I’m just really frustrated about myself right now and I want to change but I don’t know how. It’s like watching and feeling myself get into a situation I know is bad but I won’t do anything to stop. I’m just so fucking tired most days and my parents have noticed, I just don’t want them to worry about me. Sometimes I wonder how nice it would be to just not exist so I wouldn’t have to deal with anything at all."
1056,Post Graduation Blues,"I know that obtaining a degree is supposed to be a celebratory moment. However, I have just been depressed about it. Even before graduating, finishing school was a touchy subject. I just feel like I'm supposed to have a plan, a job, and just have my life together. But I'm broke, in debt b/c of student loans, unemployed, and just worried about how I'm going to make ends meet.  My mental health was already shitty before, but now it's just to the point where I'm not even getting out of bed."
1057,Don't know what to do with myself,"I feel so emotionally and physically drained. I feel like people don't understand completely when I say I'm not motivated. I can feel a break down coming on.

I lost a friend recently because she straight up said to my boyfriend ""if you weren't in a relationship I'd be interested"" and it's messed up our friendship circle. 

We're going into another lockdown which means it's even harder for me to find a job, and I don't have enough money to pay rent.

I hate my appearance - my weight, my hair, my undereye circles. I hate that I feel angry all the time, and too drained to do anything with my days just wasting away. Nothing feels real and I don't know what to do with myself anymore"
1058,Celebrating 3 Years of Better Mental Health,"Hi Everyone!

This is my third year with better mental health. 

My whole life, at least as far as I can remember, was a cycle of anxiety and depression. It got worse when I had my first child; it was so bad that even the way I sat on the couch was as if I didn't want to take up space; it was as if something was chasing me, I was afraid of it (probably my own thoughts) but  I could never really relax, meditation and yoga have literally saved my life... that plus a healthy diet. 

Life is not perfect; I still have a burning urge to please everybody, sometimes I find myself walking around as if I was apologizing for my own existence and am working on it, but I feel like I am alive for the first time.  I love the zen/Buddhism approach to mental health, especially the emphasis on accepting everything about yourself and working towards change from a place of acceptance. That one concept has saved me from a whole cycle of guilt and shame.

Although the year has been hard on everyone, I am surprised at how calm I have handled it, mostly! (some days are awful). I have noticed it's the little things that make life meaningful, a nice mindful dinner, conversation, a nice walk outside, etc. And I have noticed candles also add a bit of inspiration to my surroundings. As I celebrate my third year of better mental health, I am launching a candle line inspired by the Zen concept of being one with nature and everyone else Aether.  I don't want to sound promotional, but if anyone is interested, you can check it out here [https://prelaunch.dailyzens.com/](https://prelaunch.dailyzens.com/)"
1059,Are all our sorrows rooted from our childhood traumas and our parent's best/worst efforts?,"Over the years, every psychology video that I've seen, and article that I've read, has led me to believe that all my self loathing, hatred and insecurity stems from me being raised towards becoming a [good child](https://youtu.be/5DTIzzf6ncg), and no effort will ever be enough to help me get rid of these thoughts on my head which drag me down.

As the years pass by and I grow older, I find it harder to hold my ground in this constant battle against my brain's negativity. I'm writing a self-fulfilling prophecy of the lost opportunities that I've led myself to. Rather than living, I'm watching my life pass by without having any control over it.

I am not suicidal or wishing for death, but I have no reason to look forward to living either."
1060,I think I’ve figured out why I’m a perfectionist,"I’ve always never took well to not doing good enough, even if I come second, even if I get far, I can’t shake the feeling I’ve not done well. I honk I’ve figured out why. This probably seems like the dumbest shut ever- an overreaction, but I think I’ve found the answer. Today, for example, I did poor on a history exam. I got a 5 (a high C). That may seem fine to some, but there were people with 6s, 7s and 8s. I’ve lost motivation all over again. I don’t feel like I contribute anything, and that I’m just a failure. I feel like ripping my hair out half the time. It’s not helping my family believe I fake every fucking thing I tell them, but I hate having to look in the mirror, and know I’ve failed. That I’m not good enough for anyone. No one else goes home to cry over this shit. I feel like I’m just overreacting, but but it’s making me feel like shit. It’s just another mistake in my life that I have to hold over my head even when I don’t want to. I think I’m like this because I don’t feel worthy of anything when I don’t do well, it makes every fucking thought multiply. If I do well, maybe for a second, I feel like a have a reason to live- that I have a future ahead of me, but then I can’t stay perfect. I’m just a fuck up with good luck that doesn’t last. Once again this is a fucking overreaction. It just so fucking stupid"
1061,do doctors have to tell you what your symptoms mean,"i've gone to the doctors 3 or 4 times this year specifically asking about my symptoms that are most likely relating to depression but they keep shrugging it off as if it's just my anxiety causing my problems or they just don't tell me what my symptoms mean and go straight to trying to solve the problem. i'm too scared to ask the doctors myself if they can actually tell me what's wrong, let alone ask my mum. do doctors have to tell you what your symptoms mean or do i have to ask?"
1062,Quitting social media for mental health,"Back in April I decided to stop using instagram and Facebook, I also deleted my WhatsApp account. I am a small business owner so I have to post on Instagram sometimes regarding that, otherwise I keep my profile deactivated for weeks, and I never post anything personal. I was seriously addicted to showing off the highlights of my life and obsessively posting quotes or political crap and seeking constant validation.  I didn't even have the conscious awareness of how much it was feeding into my issues. (and didn't feel affected negatively by it at the time, even though I now look back and see how bad it was for me).

However.. once COVID started... Something in me snapped. I couldn't take the weight of the world anymore, social media became agonising and I realised I had to retreat inwards and seriously face myself once and for all. 

The change has been remarkable -  my anxiety is almost gone, I sleep much better, I read daily, I spend more time playing my piano, my concentration is better... It has even gone as far as strengthening my relationships and finally distancing from the ones that had become toxic for my wellbeing.

When I have a new business launch, I have to post on IG, I feel like I have to, but I always find it stressful and addictive and end up feeling overwhelmed.. When I don't use social media I am present, relaxed and self assured. I can't find a way to balance it out... it's all or nothing. And I am seriously starting to wonder if that is even a problem? Why should I make space for something that makes me feel shit, and why do I need to try and train myself to be more resilient to something that is not essential?

I have now reached the point where I am willing to take a positive risk of not promoting my business on Instagram because I have realised my happiness and health is so much more important.

&amp;#x200B;

has anybody else had similar experiences? Everybody is obsessed with their phones, it feels like i'm alone haha"
1063,I Have an Unhealthy Habit of Giving Things to People,"**If this is not the appropriate place to post this, my apologies and please tell me if there is a subreddit where I can talk about this habit/issue. Thank you!**

I really enjoy giving to people, usually small gifts or treats. It's a habit I've had since forever. When I was in school I was known as 'that girl that gives candy on every special day.' I just get a strong satisfying feeling when a person lights up after I give them something, and I loved when it became such a regular thing that everyone in class got excited whenever it was a holiday, because they know that I have something to hand out to them. It was wonderful. It went on through high school as well, giving things to students, teachers, and even security. I also hooked up my neighbors all the time.

Once I started becoming independent and using my own money, I realized that my love for giving was pretty damn strong. I don't know why I was still buying things for everyone around me, even when money was tight. I would sometimes give to homeless people on the streets as well, but one time a man grabbed me really tightly after I gave him a couple of bucks and he refused to let go of me until I began to shout so that others could hear me. I've given money to people who looked miserable on the street many times, and it was only then that I realized just how stupid that is to do. I don't give to the homeless anymore unless I'm at an actual shelter.

So it's 2020, the company I work for is struggling, and the *holidays are here.* I want so badly to go full Santa and buy so much for friends family and co-workers, but my future is uncertain and I know that I should keep my money close. But the temptation is so strong. Finally I said to myself, ""This is not healthy.""

I don't know why giving is so addictive for me. 'Seeking validation' is a reason I've heard before, but I don't know. My family was a bit lower class growing up, but it's not like I feel I've been deprived of anything when I was younger. Seeing people happy because of what I give them, especially if they were in a bad mood beforehand, is an amazing feeling, but I wouldn't call myself selfless.

I don't know what I'm asking for in this thread. It's mostly venting, but I'd also like to hear your thoughts if you have any. Thank you so much for reading!"
1064,"I think I have ADHD, but I feel like a faker","I'm going to see my doctor soon to ask him about being tested. I'm a sophomore in college and life has always been extra hard. I am and have always been the last one to finish a test or else I'd stay after class. I never finished the in class readings bc I just couldn't focus and I'd end up reading the same sentence over and over without getting it. I am really good at remembering events, but as far as trying to go to class I'll forget my whole laptop or my mask. I'll get up to eat and end up cleaning my toilet. I sit down to do a 30 minute assignment and I can't focus so it takes me an hour. In the middle of someone talking to me or me talking I will completely zone out or forget what I'm talking about. School becomes so stressful that i feel like I can't do it and I'll have panic attacks.

Here's why I feel like a faker though. When I was 15 my mom brought it up to my doctor who asked me if my grades were bad and i said no but that's bc I cheated through highschool bc I couldn't actually do my work. Then he told me to get some more sleep and that everybody has a little bit of ADHD. 

Teachers, friends, and girlfriends have asked me about it before and I always said no bc my doc said I didn't have it. But doing my own research recently I realized that I'm not lazy or alone, but for some reason I'm scared to go to the test and be told no and that I'm just lazy using this as an excuse."
1065,I'm scared...,"My name is Max (14m)I have depression, anxiety, and im suicidal. Alot has happened recently and my mental health is in shambles, I can feel myself going insane (for real) my mental health is rapidly getting worse, a couple of months ago I just wanted to die but now I am going insane and I'm contemplating suicide I have made suicide attempts and I can't control myself when it comes to me cutting myself. For example just now I saw a razor blade and my mind rly didn't want to grab it and hurt myself but I couldn't control my body...

I feel if I don't get help soon I'm not gonna last long.."
1066,Reflection,"Hello, I have felt so empty the past year, i am in school and i dont have any real friends. I face the day through prozac, its the only thing that gets me through the moment. I miss old times when I had so much, And I am just so close to loose it all and fall apart."
1067,I need advise,I lost my best friend. I feel so alone. It was easier for her to leave me than it was for her to leave the person that raped her. What does that say about me as a person?
1068,feeling my mental health start to slip again,does anyone else start feeling when their mental health is getting bad again? sometimes i'm on top of it and my 'usual self' and other times i can feel it creeping in like it's pulling the rug from underneath me. i've come in from work and basically sat by myself alone in my room for hours and can't get myself to do anything. i want to cry but can't i haven't felt this numb in a long time and feeling very overwhelmed
1069,I’m scared of being forgotten,"I desperately try to be nice to everyone to be remembered, but get abused for it. Look at all the famous people who have disappeared that they thought would always be known. Ask my father who Jim Reeves is and he’d talk for hours. Ask anyone under 20 and they’d have no clue. If someone who held such a status can just disappear, footballers, musicians, poets. Scholars who worked so hard to try to open minds. In 50 years time I’ll be a tree and no one will know that I even existed. In the most literal of senses."

1071,Stuck,"I feel stuck in so many ways right now. Stuck in this apartment with our predatory landlords that invade our privacy and threaten lawsuits over us just trying to live in peace. Stuck living here with my roomates/friend because they rely on me and owe me a considerable amount from the down deposit. Stuck because I cant afford to move out, and can't emotionally handle more shitty roomates like I've had in the past. I feel stuck in my grocery store job because I need money, because the college couldnt keep me, because every day at my service job is hard due to the possibility and fear of getting covid and the intense anxiety/social anxiety I experience working from my abusive childhood. Stuck because I graduated with my degree during the pandemic, stuck because I'm 25k in debt from school, from a shitty education that didnt teach me what I needed to enter the work force- so stuck in menial jobs to get by. Stuck inside because of the global pandemic. Stuck because I have little to no support group to support me emotionally, physically, romantically, etc, no one to turn to when I'm in need. Stuck because im that person to my friends, but none to me. I want to stay positive but it feels like theres so much I cant control right now, I'm trying to focus on what I CAN do, but it's not much. Go outside, ear a good meal (when the depression isnt dehabilitating), do art? Idk."
1072,Research for a mental health app landing page,"I'm creating a landing page that will direct users to an app. This app is geared towards mental health and is fairly new. We're trying to market it more so we thought to create a website in order to give more information on the app itself.

It'd be awesome if you guys are able to answer some of the questions below:

1. What sort of words or visuals make you download an app?
2. If you were to download an app for mental health what information would you want to know about it first?
3. Mental health can be a sensitive subject for some. What would make you trust a mental health app before downloading it?

If you have other inputs outside of answering these q's I'd love to know them also!"

1078,Trying to heal and move on,"When I was 17, I was generally innocent and didn’t know the evils of the world—and if I did—I never thought anything could happen to me. Just a little background. I was in a very vulnerable position. I had just had surgery on both of my feet and had casts up to my knees, of course in a wheelchair. I had unlimited percs. All of my “friends” had ditched me because I couldn’t drive. I had been having a rocky relationship with my parents at this time. 
     This is when I met Michael. A 21 year old musician from Indiana that had a song on s**ndcloud with over a million plays. As a 17 year old aspiring musician, I was in love instantly. He started to tell me how much he loved me and that my family didn’t love me. Since I was not receiving love from anyone else I held right to him and started to draw away from my family and friends. He told me he wanted to come visit me. I was so excited. He flew to Utah. Got a motel room in my city. The day I got my casts off I was mentally preparing to walk to that motel to see him. I honestly don’t even know what I was thinking. But I snuck out of my window and made my way down to the motel. When I got to the motel I walked straight in and went up the elevator to his room. I knocked and he cracked the door open. The lights were off. I asked him if we could turn them on and he said his eyes were really tired and sensitive from the trip. I asked him if he could take off his hat and glasses, he said he didn’t want me to see him. For some reason that didn’t ring any warning bells. At this point my feet started to ache and I asked him if he had any Over the counter pain killers or whatever. He gave me a Pill and I took it. He immediately pulled out a laptop and the screen was open to porn. I started to get really dizzy and he started to touch me and take my clothes off. I got really thirsty all of the sudden and there was no water left. He gave me a 10$ bill and sent me down to the vending machines. 
I look over to my right, towards the door as it opened and my dad walked in. With 4 cops with him. I started to cry and shut down. The cops start tearing apart the motel since I refused to tell them where he was at first. Micheal came down the elevator and then when he saw the cops and me and my dad— he panicked and walked right past us to leave. 
Cops outside immediately stopped him after my dad saw the look on my face as he walked past. They questioned him briefly and I cried for them to not hurt him. The cops came to my house after and told me that they couldn’t charge him with anything and they have released him. They told me that he was actually a 37 year old man from Indiana. Then a female cop turned to me and said,
“ you were lucky you know, he was gonna cut you up and stick you in that dumpster behind the motel” 
I screamed at that c*nt and ran to my room sobbing. I ran away that night and hid in a different city with my friends. They stopped Michael as he was leaving The state on a train and searched him, but again didn’t do anything to him. 
Since they didn’t do anything to him, it just made me think that he had done nothing wrong. I was so mentally fucked from all of this. I ended up having my parents drop me out of high school to go to a Wilderness group for 10 weeks and then a very hostile “therapeutic” boarding school—which actually had more in common with a prison than a boarding school. Lol
When I got out I felt as if my parents truly hated me and I left—BACK TO MICHAEL. I know I’m truly a dumbass 🤦🏼‍♀️
We started traveling, I was 18 now and he abused me mentally in public making me sob in public on many occasions. We ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles after starting in Chicago and making our way around Michigan, Indiana, Illinois. Then using the train to get to California. He refused to get a job. He wanted to support us by scamming people and using his mother. I felt so trapped. 
We made it finally to Tuscan az after being on the streets for about 4 months. Got into a small place and things were looking up. 
 He once again refused to get a job. Mentally and physically exhausted, I applied and went through the interview process of more that 30 jobs. I didn’t get one. 
We got a dog that ended up biting my leg after he beat her. 
I remember one night I made dinner and he didn’t like it and he hit me over the head so hard that I blacked out, when I woke up he was sitting over me and I pretended to still be unconsciousness. I sprang up and hit him as hard as I could. His body went slack and he fell. I was absolutely terrified. He woke up and threw me in the closet and kicked me until I stopped screaming. He left the apt (probably to make sure the cops didn’t show up) I crawled to phone and called my parents sobbing telling them I really needed to come home. I knew leaving is so dangerous. I carefully planned my escape and then had him walk me to the bus station so I could go to therapy. I went to the greyhound station instead. I’ll never forget the way people looked at me, covered in bruises, 100lbs on my 5’11” frame, sunken face. 
     That’s not the end of Michael. He came back to find me. He kept showing up to say he loved me but then he would just mentally destroy me. I wish I could move on. I wish he wasn’t out there capable of doing this to someone else. I hope I can move on. I hope that sharing this with you will help me with my process."
1079,I need help.,Whenever I get to the point where I trust someone enough to tell them about my mental health or personal matters I think I over share and over load them with information and then afterwards because I’m comfortable I start to say when I’m having a problem or and issue which is usually daily I feel like this ends up pushing them away as they weren’t aware for months prior so they don’t realise how I truly am and how much I experience etc and how much I struggle. I wondered if anyone else had this problem as I need advice and I don’t want to feel even more alone. Thank you.
1080,how to deal with others dillusions/ hallucinations,"Hi,

Any advice on how to deal with others hallucinations/dillusions?

i just got a call from work from someone with family history of schizophrenia, but i dont think they are getting treatment. 

they just told me my actions were horrible and i am a horrible person but they wouldnt give me any details and how everyone is in agreement with them but again no specifics. how they overheard this non-existant conversation where i went off the rails and it was inappropriate behavior. 

i am honestly shaken up. there was no reality to anything they said.they obviously dont know they are going off the rails and i the family seems to be pretty helpless in helping him. i see them for work regularly but at work they are fine. its like their delusions are person specific? and for whatever reason, i am the target? 

what would you recommend i do?"

1083,feel detached and guilty about election results,"hey. how are you all holding up with the election? 

i've been really anxious about a lot of things lately, have had plenty of stressful things happen in the past few months alongside just trying to get my first job in my field post-graduation, and i've been figuring out my gender identity the past few weeks as well. lots of dissociation, anxiety, poor sleep, etc just in general.

most people i know are really stressed about the election, and i think i am too but i feel so numb about it, and that's triggering a lot of guilt because i feel i should be more engaged in it but i just can't. i voted, did my part, and while i want more than anything for things to turn out okay i feel like i'm at capacity with stress and just can't handle taking on anymore. i just feel so bad, because i do care and i'm clearly affected by what's happening but i'm just not getting this high anxiety reaction to each and every little thing that happens with the results so far like everyone else seems. feels more like a dull ache. idk. the guilt feels awful, i feel broken.

does anyone else feel this way?"

1086,How to deal with the urge to cut yourself or rip your hair out/cut it short?,"My mom has been mentally abusing me for quite some time now without me realizing it. She makes me feel worthless, doesn’t take me serious, ignores me without any reason, shows no respect for me whatsoever. My father is tryin  to help me as much as he can, and I‘m seriously considering to move out (I‘m 19). It hurts to come to the realization that she mentally abuses me, but there nothing I can do about it. Anyways, the last couple of days where especially rough, and I didn’t know what to do with myself, I felt so worthless and I kinda hated myself so much that I got the urge to cut my hair (which I didn’t). Later that urge turned into cutting myself which I again didn’t do. I‘m still „sane“ enough to realize that this is wrong and that I shouldn’t do it and instead try to get outta here. Still, anyone else ever felt that way? How to you cope with that feeling?"
1087,Please help me,"I don't know where to start with this, but  it's my way of asking for help, I suppose.

I would like to wake up with no memories and a different personality, because the one I have has progressively turned into a self-destructive parasite. I hate myself.

I have no friends, no trustworthy family, no support, and no hope. I've been spiralling down for years, and it's all becoming too much for me. Although I can't put in words what I feel, I want to; I need support, and I need to let out what has all been bottled up, but some things in the bottle are so deeply  buried that I don't remember them, or don't know if they indeed did happen.

I want to self harm. I need the pain, and it's the only thing that makes me feel remotely alive - or good. I know many think this is unhealthy, but it's the only coping mechanism I ever had. But I had to stop, because the continuous condemnation from everyone around me including parents, friends, therapists and peers was crushing.

I cried for help several time but was met with laughter, condemnation or judgment. Even when asking people in a position of authority, this was no different.

I wasn't very old at the time, and I learned to hide things - after all, if all you get from expressing your pain and asking for support is a condemning reaction from all others, then why express anything? I hide and hide and put on a mask and a fake smile, and it pleases these people who are supposed to be there for me, be it my parents or my therapists. I bottle everything up, because when I show what hides underneath they hurt me even more. So, I felt even worse and wanted to cut, except if I did the backlash would be worse. So I put on the mask again. My therapist thinks I'm feeling better, but she is blind. The more 'normal' I become, the more pain I bear on the inside. The therapists judged me too, they told me how to think and behave, they told me what was wring with me, what I was bad for doing, what they - fallible people, as we all are - believed I should do. They were being paid to tell me what I should be, paid to judge me, paid to change me. Paid to change me, but at the time I still had esteem for who I was. I liked myself, and they were telling me the person I was was a bad one, that needed 'treatment'. So their idea took hold, of course. I started doubting myself, hating myself. Cutting myself more, too, because of the self loathing. When suicide started to take hold in my mind, no one helped me. I cried for help, no one gave me a helping hand when I needed it. No one stopped to ask me if I was alright. All they knew to do was judge, mock, and hate. I began distrusting people more and more.

I can't describe what really happened, nor how I became what I am, how I became this wretch I despise. But I can describe what I am become, which is Iwhy I am here. I am filled with hatred toward people, filled with anger toward people who said they would help me and instead started dictating what I should be, calling me insane. They called me a madman because I was paranoid, but I was paranoid because these very same people left me when I needed their help. In the past year the paranoia has become a true part of me. Everyone, including the people I once called friends or parents, or 'licensed medical professionals', wishes to hurt me; one could call this unreasonable but the past is all the proof I require. I can't confide in people; I hide my feelings and act more or less normal, but on the inside chaos is brewing. More and more, I find people disgusting. Their pretty little institutions that they take so much pride in praising but that only cause suffering to those that it says it will help; it will not help them! It will put them into a socially acceptable box or it will kill them. Their precious little society, made of people who say they will listen and help, but who use the information disclosed only to break those they deem socially unacceptable. It is the highest form of cowardice and utterly disgusting to build trust between themselves and me, to allow me to confide in them and to reveal my inner pain and darkness just to stab me in the back.

I'm not just filled with hatred and rage, though. On rare occasions, after a particularly intense episode of pain-induced rage, I will calm down and just feel... sad. No anger, no loathing, just a lot of sadness. I'm sad that no one cares about me, sad that I no longer have it in me to care about anyone, sad that it's come to asking people on reddit to help me, sad that I have no hope or ambition, sad that I see this society and this species I am both part of with so much contempt, sad that I can't cut myself to feel a little better, sad that I have no friends, sad that I care about nor love anyone, least of all myself, and ultimately sad to be alive .I was a cheerful child, who dreamed of helping others and making the world a wonderful place, I was enthusiastic, I was just.. alive. But no more; I dream of nothing but to go to sleep peacefully, and to find blissful silence, peace and to put an end to what feels like a very long scream. I've become cold and stone hearted; I have no empathy left. I would like to love, care and feel compassion again, but there's nothing left but ice. I see people suffer, and it brings me no tears. 

Furthermore, seeing people happy and laughing disgusts me. Seeing people filled with joy fills me with anger - why should they be happy after what they did to me? Why should they be able to feel love after treating me with such hatred? I don't want to come off as selfish, but I'm kind of jealous to see people enjoy what has been taken from me - love, caring, compassion, joy, passion, hope. I feel like I deserve it to, yet they took it from me.

The mood swings have started to affect my functioning too, as I can go from one extreme to another in a matter of seconds, completely breaking focus and concentration, and often taking a lot of time to calm down again.

Sometimes it feels like it's not real, none of it. Like I invented everything - like the things I mention above, like the suicidal ideation, the self harm, the way people treated me - in my head, or that it was planted there by people who wanted me to feel like shit.

I don't always feel in control of my actions, as though another person in my mind is taking over. My sense of self and identity has been touched by a lot of doubt. Sometimes I even feel like I'm not my own person, I'm 'taken' by another mind - or I am inhabited by another mind.

The hallucinations, too. I see flashes and sparks, arcs of searing light. It's troubling, at times.

I don't know what else to say, though I know there is still much to say. I just don't know what, but it needs out of the bottle, I need to vent so desperately.

The loneliness hurts a lot. I feel completely alone facing a thousand uncaring judges; and I must face and fend off the darkness alone, too. I'm starting to understand the true meaning of friendship; friends are those people who are willing to wallow in the same darkness as you to make it easier for you to cope. I have no such people. I don't know where to find them, and I certainly don't know how to trust, how to share pain and darkness with someone, how to essentially allow myself to be vulnerable in the presence of another sentient being. How could I, after having been given such proof that the reward is never there, and that vulnerability is always met with betrayal? But I need to be loved and cared about, as much as I need people to love and care about. I'm no perfect person and the way my mind has come to work certainly makes me a piece of shit in many eyes, and maybe I really am a worthless and horrible person, but I still desperately feel the need to be loved and cared about - and to feel the same way toward other people. I don't want to hate people, nor do I want to be hated. However it is the only way I have come to function - to hate, and in turn, to be hated. To be filled with rage and in turn to be treated likewise. And to have deep, deep distrust toward everyone - especially the people who appear kind and willing to help; they are the most insidious and dangerous ones.

The emptiness as well; I feel empty and have nothing to fill the cold, lifeless void.

I have become so angry and hateful, so paranoid and tormented, but ultimately I'm sad and hopeless.

Nothing brings me joy or pleasure anymore. I am physically exhausted and my body aches. Sleep no longer rests me, and I wake weary every day. I have no hopes, no dreams, no loved ones, no friends, no sense of self, identity or purpose, no belief than that I must die and no faith.

However I want to be wrong about people. I want to be wrong, because I want to put an end to all this. That will come either through death, or through being wrong. For if I am wrong, then people are not all disgusting. If I am wrong, not all people want to bring me suffering. If I am wrong, there still exists the possibility for me to love, to care, to have compassion and empathy, to feel alive, to feel joy, to hope, to dream, to be loved and to have passion. If I am wrong I could find peace and happiness in life rather than in oblivion.

So, if you read this far, thank you. I probably left out many things but this is the most I can do for now. Please share with me what you think of my situation, and if you believe it is not as hopeless as I believe it is, what I can do. I sincerely ask you, if you can do so, to bring me support, because I am becoming truly desperate for some, and truly desperate for the empathy I was never shown."
1088,Ready to be done. (Rant/Losing it),So if death is the end no matter how you live your life what is the point? Why put it off for another day? Why is today good for someone to die but not for me? How does anyone know when it was to soon... isn’t that how we feel no matter how old someone was. My mom lived two or more lives in her lifetime but yet we said gone to soon. How do you know. Because I feel like I know I’m ready to go. It makes no sense but I just know. I’m tired and ready but what keeps me here? Why cant I just kick the chair? Why can’t I just pull the trigger? Why can’t I just jump? What is it that stops me every time? Life didn’t come with a manual so how do we know anything?
1089,Is it normal to hear voices only at night?,"I’ve started to hear the voice of my mom yelling at someone everyday at night for the past year or so, I didn’t think anything of it at first as I thought she was actually yelling at someone in the middle of the night. 

Yesterday I heard her yelling at my sister and I heard my sister yell back, I was curious so I got up and I saw that my sister was asleep. Obviously I was very confused so I asked my siblings today whether my mom was actually yelling at someone and it turns out she sleeps very early so no one yells at night at all. They said that it’s very quiet at night and they don’t really hear anything and they’re light sleepers so I don’t think they slept over the sound or something.

I’ve also been hearing someone scratching at my door for the past couple of years and I’m starting to suspect that I was just imagining that too. Should I be worried about this? Or is this normal?"
1090,Sometimes I feel like there is something wrong with me...,"So... This is my first time posting in this sub, and after browsing it for a while I came to the conclusion that maybe somone could give me their opinion in this matter... I think I don´t have mental health issues, sometimes I have anxiety attacks (Can´t breathe, can´t stop crying, shaking etc) but I don´t think that qualifies as mental problems. The thing is that sometimes I do things that I have also seen in people with mental health problems, for example: Strong emotions, being loud in all situations, act inmature for my age, I don´t understand things as quick as the others, I get to easily distracted etc... Am I over reacting? Do I need to see a professional? Or all those things just normal?  

Maybe it´s also worth mentioning that I´m pretty sure I´ve been through some traumatic? experiences, or at least that´s what I think they are? Sometimes I get triggered by things related to my experiences or develop types of responses to certain things.... then again idk if I really need help or If i´m being ridiculous.... Any help is apprecciated"
1091,Increase of mental illnesses? What do we do?,"I feel like there are more and more people struggling with mental illnesses. I don't know if it's because I  am unconsciously more drawn to people who struggle with mental issues, but I barely know anyone who hasn't dealt with mental illness. Does anyone think the same about it?

I think it will be, or already is an issue people should talk more about. Like alright people are at least more open now and tell you that you should seek professional help if you don't know what to do anymore. However I feel like our health system is just not able to handle it. You have to wait for months and months for a place for therapy, or you have to pay loads of money.
So it's kinda bold to say just get professional help when it's not that easy.

I just wish it would be more accessible and common to get help from professionals, so that people would also get the chance to get help preemptively before illness start to manifest.

I am just concerned, that especially with the youngest generation growing up with toxic social media and stuff, that there will be more mentally ill people than healthy and that I will become a serious issue. Just some thoughts :)"

Basically they be doing racism indirectly through weight. 

Charging fat people MORE than privileged folk which have ""eating disorders,"" cause fat folk got to eat way more making black folk poorer cause they got more obesity.

I'm not diagnosed with anything and after two years I'm doing better now, but whenever I drive by the college I attended I think about how shitty I felt back then. I have memories and unpleasant feelings about all of it and I was in a really dark place, but now that I'm doing better, I'm thinking that perhaps I may have been overdramatic? 
 
Did I imagine it all? Was is really that bad? Were all the dark thoughts and emotional breakdowns just exxagerated reactions?"
1098,Happiness is temporary,"Since I was about 14 (I'm now 20), every time I acknowledged any sort of happiness or good mood, it would go away. Doesn't matter when or how or why, all that matters is that it would. It quietened down for a while because I stopped acknowledging good moods, like I would have to tell myself if I felt myself getting happy that it was temporary and not to make the most of it. I worked really hard on ignoring that voice in my head, but now it's back and louder than ever. Couple this with chronic anxiety and generally being high strung anyway, and I'm struggling, badly. I've got little to no support in place and I honestly don't know how much longer I can do this."
1099,will i always worry?,"
I’ll try to be brief:

From a really young age (around 4/5) I can remember worrying obsessively about things that could go wrong. My brain has always felt like it’s going at 100mph, and I’m a big overthinker.

There doesn’t seem to be a specific trigger but I could be anxious about absolutely anything if I thought about it.

I’ve managed to not let this take over my everyday life, mostly by completely shutting down any thoughts as soon as they pop up, and being as in control of things as I can, but I think this has led me to both apathetic and very closed off. It’s almost like I’m unable feel anything without feeling everything, and I hate having to mute all my emotions because of this. 

Is there a better/less damaging way of dealing with this?? 

ps. this is my first time ever posting on reddit, so i’m still getting the hang of things!"
1100,Still sad 5 years later. I miss her,"Please help me put this into context. Is this normal or is this poor mental health.

Long story short. I miss one of my ex girlfriends so badly. We broke up 5 years ago and I’ve had multiple relationships since. However my mind always wonders back to this one red head girl that I loved.

I feel like a part of me is broken and I’ve come so far with developing myself these past 5 years but it just feels like I’ve filled an empty hole in myself and glued the broken bits of my soul back together. I feel fragile, my selfesteem has never been lower and I miss her.

I’m working at home and this lockdown has me feeling like every day is like Groundhog Day. I’ve never had so much free time in my life and yet it feels like I don’t even have time to brush my teeth.

I also hold onto this idea....

When we were together we started a business together. When we broke up I toke the website down but I’ve always kept the domain name (the web address www.)....... one day I want to use that domain name for something so if she searches it she can either see that I’ve been successful in something (like a new business) or I’ve tributed something romantic to her like put a poem on the page or learn to play a song. I’m not sure if that’s romantic or sad and sappy. I know nothing will ever happen again between us and part of me doesn’t want it to because that part of my life is gone. But I hold this romantic notion that one day I want her to check that old website and think of me again in a positive light.

I’m ranting and I’d like someone from the outside to give a view on everything I’ve just said. All advice appreciated. Please be nice

Edit: read my post history if you want to see the extent that I’m broken"
1101,Would it be selfish to send this?,"I've been feeling a lot of guilt recently about how I walked away from a friendship. There had been problems in our friendship for a long time due to alcohol misuse, a volatile friend group, mental health issues, trust issues, and jealousy.  I have typed up a letter to try and get my feelings on to paper, and I was wondering if it would be totally selfish to send this to my old friend years later and if I would be better off keeping it to myself? My friend has borderline personality disorder and used to be quite paranoid so she may or may not respond badly to this message. 

 See below for letter

DISCLAIMER: Before you read you continue, I want to reassure you that dont want anything from you.  I don't expect you to understand or agree with what I am trying to say. I am not really sure that I can put what I am feeling into words anyway.  I don't expect any response from you, and please feel free to block me from social media if you wish. A massive 'fuck you' would also be an acceptable response. 

I am not sure if I am sending this message to you because I feel I owe it to you, or that I owe it to myself but I just wanted to say I am sorry.  I don't even know if these words will mean anything to you anymore.  If so, read no further, delete this message, and don't waste any time on it.  I am writing today as years later I still find myself feeling pretty horrible and guilty about how I left things with you after many years of friendship. Maybe I deserve to feel guilty but its been nearly 5 fucking years, which is starting to feel pretty ridiculous.  I think part of the reason I still feel this way is due to the lack of closure. There was so much I should have said to you, and I should have listened to what you had to say in return, even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear. I didn't think I could handle it. I felt so crappy about myself. I felt like any critism or conflict would trigger a full mental breakdown.  Even now, I still cant quite make sense of how things went wrong. I loved you lots, I had loads of fun with you, I felt understood and appreciated by you, and I felt like you were part or my family.  I know there were some trust issues in our friendship, which I think untimately led to things breaking down. Without a doubt there were things I did which didnt help the situation, and so many things I should have handled differently. I should have been more honest with you about a lot of things.  I fucked up there.  At that point in my life, my ego was so fragile that I didnt even feel like a real person a lot of the time.  I was dealing past trauma and shame. I felt very fearful and I put a lot of walls up to protect myself. I was really scared to let anyone see me, incase they used that to hurt me. I pretended to be confident to protect myself.  I tried to show you the real me and talk to you about my life experiences but the more I did that the more scared and paranoid I became and the more I saw you as a threat.  I felt so anxious when I saw you that I felt sick and my hands would shake. I would usually calm down after some alcohol or a smoke but then when I sobered up again I would have some major anxiety about whether I had said or done anything wrong. I was always drunk or out of it.  I always wanted to say the right things to make people happy and to make them feel better but I always seemed to get into situations I couldnt really understand and hurt them without meaning to to.  I never meant to hurt you but I fucked that up. I meant to always be there for you but I walked away. It felt like I needed to protect myself from you. But I didnt need protecting from you.  You never did me any harm. You tried to help me, you tried to support me, you tried to make me feel better. I was just really not well.  I was also jealous of you. Not a nice trait I know!  I always though you were so smart, funny, creative, and beautiful. You could light up a room. Everyone who met you wanted to be around you. I felt like nothing in comparison. I should have been more supportive and not been so caught up in my own negative feelings.  I totally believe in women supporting and building up other women. I practice this in all my female friendships......but back then I failed you. I wasn't the friend I wanted to be or the one you deserved and for that I apologise.
It took 3 years of intensive therapy for me to be able to think more clearly, to feel like a real person with my own needs, views,  likes &amp; dislikes, needs. To be able to set boundaries and stand up for myself,  to not lose myself entirely to other people, and to feel like I have some worth, and to be honest about my life without feeling shame. I dont feel trapped by my situation anymore or embaressed by my life. I dont have to exhaust myself trying to pretend everything is going ok.  I was a mess for a very long time and any friendships/relationships were a total headfuck for me. Even now they are not perfect.  
I've made a shit load of mistakes and I know that I can't make up for all of the things I've done but I am not a bad person. I care about people,  I want to see them do well, I feel bad when I hurt people, and I look after the people I love.   When I knew you my head was too full of my own issues to fully empathize with your situation, and I was probably pretty needy to.  I am a bit better at these days as therapy has freed up some space in my head, but I could probably still do better. 

Whenever I think about you I really hope your life is going well.  If I could ever do anything to help you out I would, although I doubt if I am the best person for the job.  I think there is something about our mix of personality traits that doesnt necessarily work together. Which is crap and I hate that, cos you were the best friend I ever had.  I appreciated the fuck out our chats. You got me. I think you get a lot of people. Its a unique talent. You made a lot of space in your life for people and not all were deserving. I would have liked to have been a person that was deserving of your efforts.  I wanted to be someone positive in your life and be a true friend, but it didnt work out that way.  I am still not sure if all of it was my fault, or if some of it was.  I suppose it doesnt really matter anymore. 

Before just want you to know that  I hope you are well, I hope Blair is well, and I hope your family are well.  I hope age 30 and beyond has brought you more inner peace, contentment and self- compassion. I hope you have good friendships with people who appreciate you and bring out the best in you, I hope you have managed to fill up your life in ways that make you feel happy and fulfilled,  and I hope thay you've managed to retain your brillant sense of humor in the face of life's challenges.  

I'll not bother you again. Upon reflection I think I am sending this message for me, I've needed to do it for a long time, but I hope you've been able to take something positive from it too and that I've not upset you by sending it. 

Take care Eve. 
Your one of the good ones"
1102,I feel so hopeless,"I was having a somewhat decent day, until everything kicked in again. I started having a ton of negative thoughts. I was at work, so they went from thoughts about how I’m probably useless, hated, and invaluable there, to thoughts about being worthless and hated in general. 

I’m in my first semester of college, but I struggle to get anything done sometimes. It’s hard to believe that doing the work matters when I feel like I don’t have a future. I can’t see myself being here in 10 years. I don’t want to exist most of the time, but I’m too scared to do anything to make that happen. 

I’m also too scared to fully tell someone how I’m feeling. I can never get myself to talk to my family about anything personal. Plus sometimes I can’t fight the feeling that even they don’t care. My mother let me down already once, and after that, even when I’ve tried to hint to her that something is wrong she brushed it off as being an adult. I feel like my brother doesn’t care about me. I don’t even feel comfortable enough around him to talk to him as myself, or make jokes. I feel like he won’t care. He’ll talk about his interests, and his opinions, but never asks about mine.   He only asks me questions about my own life when I’m quiet and not responding to his own comments. 

The only person who has really tried to help me has been my (now former) teacher, who I’ve known now for 5 years. She doesn’t even know the full story though, or the thoughts that go through my head. She made an effort to help though because she got concerned when she had noticed signs of possible anxiety and depression in me. I don’t want to be a bother and bring everything up again, because she has her own life, job, and family, and she shouldn’t have to deal with me. 

Anyway, it’s just so exhausting."
1103,How does someone fight instincts and kill themself by jumping off?,"I still don’t get it. I couldn’t do it. My instincts were too strong.

My instincts aren’t as strong with rope, drowning, pills, and bleeding to death. I wonder why that is."
1104,How does a healer cares for themselves while putting most efforts to heal others?,"I have a friend who always help and attend those who are having anxieties, panic attacks and similar mental health problem. But they never reach out others for any kind of help and never spoke about their problem, because they do struggle too. If you are similar to my friend, how do you manage to self care and handle youself alone at your lowest point while being a healer to others?"

1106,Distress tolerance skills: STOP,"When you are presented with something that challenges your coping skills here is a good one I found. STOP

Stop... Do not react.Stay in control.

Take a step back... Remove yourself physically and/or mentally from the situation.

Observe... Notice your thoughts and feelings as well as the actions of others what is happening?

Proceed with caution... Do only what is necessary.

Hope this helps."

He made the best pizza I ever ate. He had a pizzeria too, but it went out of business due to low income. He had a wife and kids (my aunt and cousins). I haven't met them since the funeral. Before his death, we really liked to meet at their house and hang out in their garden. It was really fun. But now, all of that is gone. He is too.

1113,Is there a recognised 'problem' for people who find it hard to accept changing from a child to an adult?,"Is this well studied or acknowledged in mental health fields? For example, someone who finds it very hard to come to terms with the fact that they change from a little innocent clean child to an adult with hair and sexual drives. This difficulty would then have an impact on their functioning as an adult, like forming relationships or having sex."
1114,TW suicide,"After I lost my dad to suicide I became very suicidal. I got better but after years of living with my mom, brother, my moms boyfriend and his son and two daughters it got bad again. He’s verbally abusive and sometimes to his kids a little to physically rough. I don’t want to kill myself but I want to die and be free. I have an aunt that lives in Arizona and I could ask if I could live with her (I live in Ohio now) I moved away from all my close family so I could live with my moms boyfriend a couple months after my dad died. My dad was my everything. I don’t know what to do. I love my mom but I cant be here anymore. I really need advice. Please."
1115,How to gain a reliable support network?,"I'm posting this because I wanted to see if anyone else has been feeling what I have been going through.

I've been struggling a lot with expressing my emotions and true feelings during the pandemic. I've been struggling a lot while working from home, and don't feel comfortable speaking about my issues to my friends and family. 

I used to have an active and social life where I could talk to people every day during and outside of work. It was easy for me to cut out time in my life to hang out with people I cared about or do activities that made me happy.

Ever since we moved to wfh, I've been living alone and I feel like I'm on my own island. I've been struggling with work since I can't I feel like I'm putting up a facade and it's reached a breaking point during this election. I feel bad about complaining about my wfh situation, as I consider myself blessed to have kept my job during the pandemic when a lot of my friends and family weren't as lucky. I feel guilty about this, and have a constant sense of anxiety because I go to social media and see all the fun things my network is up to.

Does anyone else resonate with this? How are you dealing with the isolation? I don't know how much longer I can keep up the facade without having a breakdown...."
1116,How do you make friends when you have nothing to say?,"I've been struggling with this problem for a while. It is something I didn't struggle with in the past. Before I was generally a sociable person. I had friends and people generally seemed to find me a likable person.

Lately I've been struggling to find words in conversation. I'm constantly zoned out which makes dialogue really difficult. Does anyone else struggle with this or am I alone? I'm confident it has something to do with my mental health, but I'm not sure which part. For context I've been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, social anxiety, and depersonalization disorder."
1117,#FIGHT RACISM,"Racist people are using a new technique to try to oppress black people with stuff like ""eating disorders.""

They are indirectly claiming people with ""eating disorders"" are being oppressed by acknowledging the so called illness itself, without the individual being fat, basically denying skinny priveledge, claiming ""fat priviledge.""

While at the same time taking money away from black people, and basically robbing them by charging them more for food due to them have higher obesity rates, as well as taxing the type of food they consume at a significantly higher rate than the type in which whites consumer at a higher rate. 

Basically CHARGING BLACK PEOPLE MORE FOR FOOD THAN WHITE PEOPLE! 

And people with ""eating disorders"" are serving as a  distraction to say they are oppressed and take attention away from the obvious racism through obesity. 

And don't you think there is a reason more white people are diagnosed with eating disorders than black people?

They are making fake diseases, disproportionately diagnosing white people, to fuck black people over to make sure white people get more money through healthcare. 


In summary, EATING DISORDERS ARE TO STEAL MONEY FROM BLACK PEOPLE, AND DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER WAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS ROBBING BLACK PEOPLE. 

Acknowledging eating disorders as an illness with the exception of obesity is RACIST."
1118,One of my closest friends is depressed. I want to help him but I’m having a hard time too because of his behavior. What can I do?,"In these days I’m not okay (mentally), and I got this close friend who is always talking about his problems with me. But I think I’m not in the right mental state to comfort him.

I always try to help him and I really want him to be happy.
The thing is, he messages me because he needs attention. He just wants to be loved and I know that, and that’s totally okay. But our convos are like:
Him: i’m so done with my life
Him: nevermind
Me: i’ll listen, tell me what you want to say
Him: no it’s all my fault i’m stupid i’m always wrong

And i always repeat that it’s not his fault, stuff like that, and that i’ll listen to whatever he wants to say. I always tell him that i love him.

Nothing works.

I just don’t know what to do.
I had depression back in highschool and I understand how it feels like. But i just don’t know how to talk to him or comfort him. I just don’t know.

And i’m already so stressed out in these days, and this thing stresses me out even more. Sometimes I even thought that he was being kinda selfish and too much of an attention whore. I’m sorry but it’s the truth, I even thought that. Because I was like that when I had depression.

But i don’t know how to handle him."
1119,Advice,"Male (22) I was sent away by my parents when I was  11 to live in another country with my uncle and his family and the explanation I was given was that I am better off in a third world country than to live in America and get arrested. I was there for 6 years, I was touched (in a sexual way) on by a male in a place where I go to worship God id recall how old I was how long it happened or how it happened. I didn’t realize what happened till about a couple months ago than it all hit me at once. My uncle use to hit me very violently and I never liked it to this day and never understood how someone that isn’t my parent can out their hands on me even if I wasnt their kid. I would hint to my parents what was going on but they would brush it off and go talk to my uncle and he would tell them everything was a fine than will yell or threaten me every time I  called my mom. I isolated myself and became a different person I’d never thought I would be. When I turned 16 was when I picked up drugs such as weed, lean, cigarettes and pills to relax myself and to forget what was going on around me. I returned home when I turned 18 and I wasn’t the person my parents knew me as. When I came back I got back with my childhood friends and just wanted to have fun and forget Africa all together. I already came with a drug habit didn’t think It could get worse that’s when I started taking percocets and smoking heavy potent weed and the lean drinking continued. What trigged that was when I talked to my parents and helped them realize what I been thru so the can help me deal with it, they stuck it to me and told me it was worth it your better off how you are now not knowing what I be thru just by thinking they knew it. My parents are good parents but they didn’t think that I was that hurt about the decision and didn’t make it a big deal. That’s just my history. Every since I came back I’ve been to about 4-5 different funerals in the past 3 years and that’s been tough. 4 of the funerals I personally knew the person and grew up with them so it’s been hard dealing with it. I don’t have a girlfriend in my life so technically I have only myself to talk to. What I wrote in this post not even my family know. I just want to let things go and be a normal person is that too much to ask for?  I just don’t know where to put all this I have in me or go to take it out. I’m just tired honestly. I won’t commit suicide but I’m tired of having to go thru the same things that made me like this. Any advice should I go talk to my mom and pour my heart out to her."
1120,I think I might have ADHD/ADD or something similar," As the title says I think I might have some sort of disorder like ADHD/ADD.

The reason I say this is because I often find myself getting easily distracted, forgetting stuff, having a hard time focusing on tasks, being fidgety and very very VERY talkative.

I can go on and on talking for so long and then realizing I've ended on a whole different topic already and the person I'm talking to didn't even say anything. I also tend to interrupt people often or predict their sentences before they can finish (although I've been trying to correct myself on some of these things).

I also forget stuff a lot, even if they're important, or important details or moments of my life, sometimes it just gets erased if I don't think enough about it and remind myself about it.

I've done a few online tests and although they can't diagnose they can help people have some idea of what it could be and whether or not they should try and get checked. So far they have all given me a high score.

I'm going to look into checking into this with a professional but I wanted to hear you guys experiences with ADHD or maybe something else that might match with this description although I know it varies a lot from people to people. I'm not looking for medical help, I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to what I said and happens to have ADHD or similar!"
1121,Can not having a routine impact your mental health?,"I (18M) Recently got a job at a cleaning company, and they have no schedule at all, I only recently got a placement at a treatment centre and is the only work routine I have. (That is only from Monday to Thursday, 8AM - 2PM) Other than that everything I else I do for the company is usually a day or two notice. I was told I’d have a steady schedule at this point, but I guess that’s only half true. I’ll usually do something for the company besides the treatment centre every other day, with like I said, a day or two notice. Maybe it’s something else but I feel it’s really stressing me out not knowing what’s going on, which is weird because I’ve never been bothered by stuff popping up. Just today my boss asked if I could work Friday, and with being on the spot I said yes (also consider that when I applied I said I could take all the hours I could get,  cuz I thought it’d help me get the job). I then later learned that that I would only be going to the job site with 1 other person and, in my opinion, that person is rather weird and overall gives me some weird vibes. Now don’t take that the wrong way, overall nice guy, but I don’t think I can sit in a car with him for an hour drive, then work 9 hours with him. (Sorry for the vent I needed that). Back on track, can having these surprise schedules cause lots of stress or just in any way affect your mental health? 

Also sorry if this is not formatted well or for my venting, thank you for reading :)"

1124,What can I do?,"Hello all, 

Just a warning this may be a bit of a ramble. My roommate moved in about five months ago, I posted an ad online so we were complete strangers beforehand. The day we met they disclosed  they had clinical depression and sometimes they would be “off”, but I wasn’t alarmed because I have a diagnosis of my very own! They explained how they were being proactive about their depression and regularly attended support groups and therapy. 

Within the last couple of weeks a lot of things have come to light though. I heard them throwing up in the bathroom, it started to become somewhat of a habit. When I asked if they were feeling okay, they told me they were bulimic. I offered my support to them of course. They also shared with me that earlier in the year they were hospitalized for attempting. 

Fast forward to this week I have started developing weird feelings towards food and I feel sick to my stomach after I eat. The anxiety of possibly coming home one day and finding them terrifies me. 

This hasn’t been the best year for me mentally either and I want to help my roommate, but I also want to leave. How can I help? What do I do?"

1126,Messy Vent About My Loneliness,"Hello! I’m a 14f, so currently a freshman in highschool. I believe that I’ve been struggling with loneliness for 5 years. I first came across that fact in the 4th grade when I was around 9 or 10. That year was the first time I think I had an anxiety attack. I had to share a bus seat with two girls who were apart of the “popular” clique. I panicked and thought they didn’t like me, so I began to cry in front of my class and did not tell anyone why and what happened until today. After that, I began to realize I didn’t “fit in.” I had a small class so I never got to meet anyone else. I stayed with the same small class until 8th grade (the school held grade school + middle school). And by staying with the same class, I had been known with two labels: the quiet girl/loner. So, nobody really bothered to interact with me much. I had people I occasionally talked to but I never had anyone I called a friend. I’ve never hung out with anyone outside of school. I didn’t have a social life. Throughout those years, I struggled with loneliness more. There were two certain social gatherings where I cried because I was afraid of all the people and that I didn’t belong there. The only real friends I ever had were internet friends, but I lost touch with all of them. I’ve gotten used to all of this, which probably isn’t good. And by starting highschool, I thought I would forget all of this. My school of choice had us decide on whether to attend class in person or online due to covid. I wanted to be in person but my parents did not. I remember there was a certain week where I had cried more than I ever had before. I was afraid that by the time I would be back in class, I would meet the same fate of not fitting in anywhere. I’m pretty sure that week was just a mood swing or teen angst. I’m now taking inperson classes and I’m better. However, the feeling of loneliness is still in the back of my head. I’ve never been this in-depth about my feelings to others until now. I have never been to counseling/therapy. I keep excusing these feelings as nothing serious. Am I experiencing something normal?"
1127,Your mental health is more important than you know,"You are literally a piece of the universe taking into account the Big Bang or any religion. You are part of the bigger picture, and so the bigger picture is within you.

You are a piece of the universe so you hold the universe within yourself. This world, this whole universe is a representation of your inner self. Your perspective dictates your reality, your perception dictates what you take in, need it be positive or negative, you’re the one perceiving it.

If we want change within this reality, it literally starts with changing yourself. If you truly want change you must change. This reality represents you on the inside. If you heal yourself inside you’re doing your part to heal the universe as a whole because you are a part of the universe and you literally hold the universe within yourself, even if it is just a part."

So my roommate and I are freshmen in college. He’s a good friend of mine that I’ve known for many years. But he’s having a really hard time here... barely passing his classes and always talking about how much he hates this place and wants to go home and drop out. He suffers from pretty bad depression, this experience seems to be making it worse by the day and I feel so bad for him.

I’ve been trying to help him out, being there as emotional support, trying to work through his assignments with him, trying to get him to laugh as much as I can... but it’s really hard, he never takes initiative, never wants to do anything productive, won’t up his dose of medication, and won’t even email anyone at the college for help. I don’t want to overstep and act like a parent or anything, and I’m afraid that if I try to force him to do these things that he needs to do he’ll get angry, and I really don’t want to fight with him. 

I just don’t know what to do, I hate seeing him like this.

Any help is greatly appreciated."

1132,Lost and overwhelmed,"Severe anxiety 24/7

Over the last year, my mental health has deteriorated. The combination of self image issues, weed dependency, and pandemic isolation, has caused my anxiety to become almost unbearable. I even get anxious around the people I’m most comfortable with including my family and best friend. When I’m talking to someone, I start to feel more aware of every little thing I say and do. If I’m talking, I start overthinking every single word and sometimes lose my train of thought. When someone is talking to me, I become hyper sensitive and insecure about everything. I start thinking about the way I’m sitting, where my eyes are looking, the shape of my mouth. It’s exhausting. Anytime I try to change something about my situation like quitting weed, I lose motivation and go back to the same situation. I just feel mentally drained and don’t know what to do."
1133,I talk to my mum badly and I can’t stop!,"I’m 14 and I suffer with multiple mental health issues. Suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, Anorexia and PTSD.

My mum is basically my rock. I’m in hospital at the moment for my Anorexia and she stays with me every night, talks to me, gives me a shoulder to cry on, hugs me after every meal and sits with me whilst I struggle to eat. She’s so beautiful and never yells at me, gives me any sort of anger and is very apologetic. I’m going to the psych ward in a few days and am very sad about that too.

My Dad was very verbally abusive to her when they were married and everytime she does anything that’s not her fault or anything at all she’s always apologising. She always holds it together for me.

Anyway to get to the point, I’m always so moody and give her so much attitude. I hate it. I can’t stop. She’s the one person who I let my feelings out to and I just love her so much but I don’t talk to her nicely at all sometimes but she never holds a grudge. I get very irritable very easily and always take it out on her and if I don’t I get a huge knot it my stomach of wanting to explode in upset and anger for no reason. 

Can anyone relate? Someone help me. I can’t stand the way I talk to her."
1134,What should I do if I believe I'm exhibiting early signs of depression?,"I feel quite lethargic very often, and it's quite hard to do basic chores and tasks.

And I find it a little unbelievable for myself, but I haven't felt genuinely enthusiastic in a very long time. 
Only temporary enthusiasm when I watch videos to inspire me to do my chores and tasks for the day.

I haven't fallen down the spiral yet, but I feel I'm close to this soon affecting how I think; it goes without saying that the thinking will be negative.

When I try to do these important activities in the day, I always feel strong mental resistance that's trying stop me from doing that activity, but when I accomplish that activity nevertheless, it doesn't give me the feeling of accomplishment, just.. an exhausted feeling.

It's kind of an oddity, but when the mental resistance is strong enough, and I'm still trying to push through it, I either cry, or get angry.. for some reason. But that was when I didn't quite realize it was possibly depression that was making me feel that way.

I was wondering if there are certain things I should do if I feel like I'm at the top of a depression spiral? And possibly am going to fall down into it.

I should mention that I'm 16, soon to be 17 in one month: and I have no intention of ever committing suicide, even if I'm in quite the pickle, and feel horrible; I don't want to be selfish, and hurt anyone I care about."
1135,welp i goofed it up...,"I'm 17 in a pandemic in America, I'm doing remote learning now, which means I haven't had a normal day since March 12.  I've gone 7 months without leaving my house or seeing people let alone touching them.  I guess I hit depression in this and a lot of stuff has happened for me to lose trust in people so yes I have trust issues, and yes I'm a little traumatized.    
I have strict parents from Hell.  I only have Discord to chat on people with-Don't ask about what was my phone-so this last thing is really bad.  Long story short, some irl friends left me - a lot at the same time- So i left most others, some deserved, some i don't know.  I have unfriended literally everyone but 2 people-1 does not talk to me at all i just can't delete him- but I also have left all of my servers, besides the one I own.  I have no friends left.  No one to talk to, since the one friend i have is always too busy to talk.    
It hurts, but people stress me out so i'm not sure.  I'm just addicted to and in love with loneliness I guess...I don't know what to do i'm torn tbh.  I want friends, but good friends and people like me...but those are hard to come across so I just don't trust anyone..."

Idk if this is useful, but here’s some info: 
1. Focuses on only some of the things I think I have but has very good reviews, specifically includes LGBT teens (like me), most expensive
2. Focused/has background in most things I want to discuss, not too expensive, no info on LGBT inclusion 
3. Cheapest, has specific focus on autism, which I’m trying to get diagnosed with, is Christian (which is questionable for me)"
1138,Pretending to Be Happy Isn’t Making You Feel Better," Many of us pretend to be happy at some point in time or another. Maybe we're just having a bad day and so we put on a smile and pretend in order to keep those around us happy. 

 After all, you're not only pretending to be happy but you're hiding your true feelings and your true experiences from them and those are also going to play a role in how you feel and how you interact with the people in your life.

1139,What do the colors inside these caps mean?,"I’m currently only on 2 medications and they have different colors on the inside of their caps. Does this mean something? I’m beginning to study to be a pharmacy technician and I’ve not learned about this yet so I figured I would ask here since they are medications for my mental illness.
Fluoxetine has a white cap, quetiapine has a red cap.
Is this because the one with the red cap makes me extremely tired? Is it due to OD or addiction potential? I’m in Texas, I know different states have different rules around medication packaging.
The caps are both white on the top/outside, but one has a red inside, to clarify. They look the same from the outside but I usually flip the caps upside down to bypass the child safety lock thing since I don’t live with children, that’s when I noticed the difference in color.
Any input would be appreciated, sate my curiosity and also teach me something I need to know for my class :)"

1142,Disturbingly obsessed with arguing about politics with strangers on the internet,"Example : There’s this redditor I got into a debate with some times ago, he ended up calling me a moron and mocked me. 

That really pissed me off and the fact that this redditor was apparently someone who was pretty smart (he had a lot of reasonable opinions and seemed to know a lot about politics and economics), I don’t dismiss his comment the same way I would dismiss a comment made by someone who is obviously a 14-year old or a neo-nazi.

But it turned me insane : I keep thinking about this redditor day and night cuz I want him to change his mind and to admit that he was wrong when he called me a moron. I ended up creating different accounts to taunt him, he ended up blocking whatever 1-day old account was talking to him.

He’s not the only redditor I got obsessed with. Sometimes I will do an all-nighter arguing with a stranger about something political on reddit, hoping I get the final word. 

When I stop the political argument and let the other have the last word, it will stay in my mind for days. Sometimes I can't enjoy watching a movie because I'm thinking about what the other online stranger will answer to what I've told him. It's insane.

Why am I so obsessed with things like this ? It’s disturbing. My guess is : maybe because the coronavirus lockdown has given me too much free time, to the point where I try to fill my mind with something. What do you think ?

EDIT : Also, what I don’t understand is that I‘m a very selfish person who does a lot of shameful (but not illegal, don’t worry) things, so why would I care about the state of the world ? And yet, I do. Or, at least, I pretend to. It doesn’t make sense. I think it might be an obsession to fill a void."

Hey there! I know lockdown has been hard for everyone. As a student, I was isolated alone in my university accommodation for our first lockdown. I also struggle with depression and anxiety, so I found the whole experience taught me a lot.

I would also appreciate feedback and to hear other ways in which people are managing and coping.

I had a boyfriend at the time and half way through I called him my boyfriends name. He then said no it’s (his name) so I immediately stopped and then I don’t know what happened after this but he left.  I then cried a lot and messaged friends telling them what happened and if I should tell my bf. I woke up to a lot of sick as I was hungover, and messaged my friends asking what I should do. I then told my boyfriend but he broke up with me telling me that I cheated and I’m vile and horrible stuff. He told everyone I cheated on him with my step brother so I got a lot of messages saying mean things. I went back to school and people were saying stuff like “step brooo” and “errr u cheater” I tried telling them I got taken advantage and I didn’t want it but they said I was lying and that I did want it.

1152,Doctors Reveal 10 Bad Habits That Cause Sleeplessness," **Here 10 Bad Habits That Cause Sleeplessness**

* **FALLING ASLEEP TO THE TELEVISION**

Having a tv in your room looks as if a very good idea, right? Nicely, this is one of the worst approaches which will doze off. A television has shiny lights and noise that can affect your brain.

Even as you may think it’s helping you to get to dreamland, the lighting is sending scrambled messages to your mind. Your mind is seeing the lighting fixtures and listening to the noise, and it prevents you from going into a deep REM kingdom of rest. Meaning, you received't experience refreshed because you may in no way enter the recovery part of your sleep.

* **HAVING CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS NEAR BED**

Every other trouble that is tremendous in our day and age is a mobile telephone near the mattress. These little gadgets have replaced the alarm clock and house phone, however, are they inflicting extra harm than proper? Cellular telephones emit a mild as a way to mess together with your circadian clock rhythm.

If the cell cellphone is more than 5 feet from your mattress, you then are secure. However, the general public keeps it within an arm’s length from them always. While your circadian clock rhythm receives out of whack, then your frame gained’t produce melatonin that facilitates you get and live asleep.

* **CONSUMING TOO MUCH CAFFEINE**

Caffeine is a stimulant that hastens your coronary heart. Even as consuming a cup of espresso or one soda a day isn’t going to kill you, it can preserve you up at night time. When you have a caffeinated drink too past due in the afternoon, it could motive  
Sleeplessness.

Part of your nightly habitual should include nothing caffeinated after 4 pm. When you have the self-discipline to cut these beverages, it might be useful in your frame. Caffeine is very addictive and follows the identical pathways as cocaine to your brain.

1153,I feel guilty for being a twin...,"I know the title can be confusing so let me explain.

I (F19) have a twin brother who is absolutely awesome. I love having him around no matter what kind of day it is and that is great. However as I’ve grown up with him and my mental health has deteriorated from years of trauma, it feels more like I want him around but he doesn’t want me around. 

I also recently was told that he felt unheard because of me. I feel like a burden or a failure. I just feel guilty for even being alive with him. I keep thinking he would thrive better without me but not the other way around. And I’m just making this post to ask if anyone else feels this or if it’s just me. Also to hopefully help someone else who feels the same. Hope you have a good day and stay safe. 🌸"
1154,My favourite lecturer saved both my bachelor and me,"Idk if this is the right place to post but I just need to talk a bit about how extremely grateful I am for this man. 

When I did my bachelor’s dissertation, I was lucky to get my fave lecturer as a personal tutor. He’s also the head of well-being for my faculty, so I’ve had a lot of time talking with him about stuff. When I was doing my dissertation I struggled a lot with depression and procrastination and executive dysfunction, leading me to not doing nearly as much as quick as I should. Lagging heavily behind everybody else and constantly changing topics and angles and interests for what I was writing. And this man stuck with me with the patience of an absolute saint. Not once did he show annoyance or frustration, just gently pushed me and helped me figure out how I should do things. Worked with me and supported me in a way no adult in my life ever has, out of compassion. Replied to my terribly distressed emails in the middle of the night (why weren’t YOU asleep though mr adult man) 

I ended up doing my entire 9k words over a weekend, and when I was too exhausted to edit it in the morning I emailed and he said he was proud of me and he knew I could manage it, just go for a quick walk and then come back and slam that motherfucker together. And I did. I made it, and I never would’ve been able to without him. 

And we’re still in touch. He still replies to my emails when i tell him how we’re doing, even though I’ve asked him over and over if it’s ok bc it’s no longer his job to do so, but he says that he sees potential and wants me to succeed. I’m not used to this sort of compassion from anybody, without any frustrations or anything that makes me feel stupid or dumb like so many other people have. I worried he’d somehow end up taking advantage of me, but he’s not even been a tiny bit weird. I got a therapist as well now so I’m not using him for that sort of heavy stuff either. It’s just so weird to me that someone can actually care about me like that, but it helps me so much.

TLDR: one adult showing compassion and support for you can really help huh"
1155,"I really want to change the way I think but I'm finding it tough, how do you do it?","A lot of mental health tips involve taking a negative thought and looking for the evidence for and against.

For example, I often think I'm rubbish at my job. You then look at the evidence, do I get bad performance reviews, have I ever got the sack, what positive feedback have I had etc etc

I really want to change and be different, but I have trouble believing the logic! Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean you stop feeling it. For example spiders are not dangerous in my country but many are still scared of them.

I don't want to stay anxious and unhappy but these thought patterns are so hard to shift. Anyone get what I'm saying?"
1156,Having covid really messed me up,"Hi, not really sure if this is the right place to post this but I feel like having covid really damaged my mental health, I've just got tested negative after more than 2 weeks spent in my room and being stuck there was awful. I mean absolute no disrespect to people who have it far worse than me with this virus, I'm lucky I'm physically well and I hope this post doesn't offend anyone and if it does I will take it down.
Before being tested positive I saw my friends and my family, of course with a mask on, but i was still really anxious the whole time i was quarantined cause I was afraid they could be positive too because of me. My grandparents who are very old and already sick were at risk also.
But the worst part was not being able to leave my room and simply have physical touch (if it helps ""physical touch"" is my one of my love languages). Of course I couldn't see my boyfriend and I really rely on him when I'm down so it was kinda hard. I was scared the whole time I could infect my family and I had to sanitize everything I touched in the bathroom. Of course I did all of these things anyway and it wasn't that much trouble, I don't want you to think this is a rant, it's simply for you to understand.

But today, since I was tested negative three days ago, I went to a park, but now whenever i am outside i just can't stop sanitize my hands or I get MASSIVELY worried and anxious, also when I was to a restaurant I kept noticing whenever someone was coughing and I just wanted to leave, I felt so uncomfortable being in such a ""crowded"" space, even if there weren't many people. I feel so anxious whenever my friends ask me to hang out and I don't know how to solve this or how to deal with this, can anyone help me?

1161,Messing up my life choices,"Long story short I live with a disabled and dysfunctional family. Dad and brother and sister blind. Mum has physical back problems and can’t stand up or walk for too far or long. They believe I am academically talented when I just put in some effort when I was feeling mentally well, but they soon started to force me to do clubs and activities which has triggered my anxiety and stress to the max and now I catastrophise the future etc. Anyways they guilt trip me to study medicine to help them get out of this flat since we can’t even live here properly and I’m struggling so much in college. Doing biology chemistry psychology. My teachers have all commented they know I am smart but they know I don’t have an interest in these subjects and will fail since it’s about hard effort and work ethic. Biology and chemistry is needed for medicine, and while I don’t mind chemistry biology makes me cry, but psychology wants to make me cry since it’s a memorisation test of scientific case studies with no logical stimulation (I hate maths too) and I just feel broken and defeated. Been looking at what else I can study and I could maybe do economics or English lit but even then I have no idea. I want to drop out of college so badly and cry but I don’t want to burden my family they’ve struggled through so much mentally as well. What on earth should I even do? Is this normal? Am I okay? Will I fail forever? What choices do I even have?"
1162,How do you deal with emotional detachment/ New attachment?,"Context: Married (not recently), no kids, most of our friends are married and/or have kids.

I have been becoming detached from my entire life and my marriage. I don't feel in love with my wife anymore and I am having a hard time accepting it because we have built an entire life from the ground up. To make matters worse, I met someone else that I have been getting super close with. I don't want to say I am ""in love"" but, my feelings are trending very strongly in that direction. I feel guilty about this, but at the same time I feel as if what is happening is out of my control. I have not cheated on my wife physically (and have no intentions on doing so) but emotionally I feel as if we're through. I'm at the point where I know that one wrong move could ruin my entire life. I'm pretty sure the other woman feels the same way about me. Now I am in a position where I know that my feelings and actions are putting everyone in an unfair and less than ideal situation. The worst part is that while I'm holding this all in and trying to keep it secret from everyone, it's becoming obvious. The entire situation is keeping me up at night and when I do get to sleep, I'm having vivid nightmares and I can never wake up.

What the hell am I supposed to do? The entire basis of ""Man up and deal with it"" has stopped working. I am at a major crossroad with my life and I can't afford to take the wrong path. I know that this is my fault, but how can I deal with this or make it better without hurting everyone around me?"
1163,caring?? haha what's that,"I'm quite literally going insane. 

everything is just piling up, really. I haven't gotten much school work done because I'm just so *tired*. I feel awful and guilty for not doing anything and I just wanna rip my body apart and force someone to give me a new one. 

my home life is the same; okay, but god if I have to deal with being called 'crazy' or something alike for saying I want a therapist again im gonna lose my absolute shit and ACTUALLY go crazy. 

my dad is an annoying narcissist who can't function like a normal human being without alcohol, and im so close to just leaving. 

I literally don't even care anymore. I'm failing?? cool. everyone in my family probably hates me?? fine. my mental health is declining and I can't stop it?? exciting. I'm so stupid and probably deserve everything happening to me?? exhilarating. so glad."
1164,"Why do I have the urge to write with a pen and paper constantly, even when I don’t know what to write?","For as long as I can remember I have this huge urge to write with pen and paper. So often I have no idea what to write and my mind is blank but this urge is so strong. So often I will literally write things I am hearing, words people are saying around me, nonsense. And then I scribble it out frantically. I feel like something is wrong with me but I can’t control this urge! And I want to write meaningful things but my mind always goes blank when I try. So it just ends up being pages of writing random things I hear and scribbling it out. What is wrong with me? Any ideas what this could be? Or am I just weird?"
1165,I cant figure out whats happening,"Hey everyone,

So I had what I think was an intrusive thought and I hated it. It made me sick, and ever sense then I keep thinking im insane or I need to be committed. This feeling has been persisting for a week or two but I do have some really good days where I'm happy and not thinking about it. I guess my question is what can I do? (I scheduled some time with a therapist) am I okay? Is this normal or is this as bad as I think it is? 

A lot of my stress from this comes from the fact I had the thought and now I keep thinking about the fact I thought it and how bad of a person that makes me. I dont know if talking about it will help or not"
1166,How do I slowly stop using Snapchat?,"Snapchat causes ALOT of my problems, it basically controls when I’m happy, depressed, anxiety filled etc. I know it’s doing all these fucking problems, and I still can’t stop using it less often. I know I’m probably addicted, but like who isn’t addicted to their phone? I am having trouble on how to go long periods without using the app, i want to begin caring much less and doing this will definitely help. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!"
1167,I have changed a lot post depression. I talk less. I think quite more than before. I have stopped being too much with friends. Many times I avoid people. Is this just me? Is this too wrong?,"I was a very talkative person. I had so many friends and I used to go out often. Since I landed into depression and even now, I became very silent. I think more than before. I avoid people if it's not important. I always search for silence.

Friends think I have some sort of ego and I am selfish. But the truth is I just have learnt a lot about people around me and I dont want to trust someone so early. I am just being protective. 

I just feel that when I was in depression, no one really understood me except one(I can even call him my life saviour). No one reacted positively. And that why do I need such people in my life. But the second thought is if I dont talk to people I will be left alone and will have less contacts and connections. 

Where am I exactly going wrong? What shall I do?"
1168,Problems..,"How do I tell my mom that the voices in my head want me dead. 
How do I tell my girlfriend that I cant do this anymore. I hate communication. I try to communicate what I feel then I get bashed for it. I get belittled and yelled at by family. I understand I fuck up. I do it a lot apparently.

1169,"People with BPD that were initially misdiagnosed as having MDD, how did you eventually find out?","I'm 28f and I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and am being treated with SSRI. Bipolar disorder runs in my family though, my father has it. I don't know if I'm being correctly diagnosed. I have found that I've experienced ""manic"" state only temporarily (couple of hours) under the influence of drugs or alcohol. I have never been manic when I'm sober though I experience depression on a regular basis. It sounds like I may have Bipolar II disorder but I'm not a doctor.


Any time I ask my doctor if I might have BPD, I get vague response saying probably not and it's hard to diagnose. I was wondering if anyone else had any experience with this."
1170,Family hit by covid. 92 year old Grandmother is slowly dying of ards,"My Grandmother is dying and I am stuck in quarantine and can’t be near her. 
She can’t breathe and is panicking. She lives across the town with my uncle and his family. I and my family all have covid, i’ve been looking after my father and mother for the past two weeks. They are in the risk group and have been hit hard but are recovering. 
There is no more room left in the hospitals. She needs lung ventilation but the ambulance can’t take her because there are no more ventilators. 

I am tired and don’t know what to do. I can’t be with her, I can’t help.
There is nothing I can do and as I’m typing this she is dying."

1173,How do I stop caring what others think without worrying that makes me narcissistic?,"I didn't care what people thought until age 30.  I don't hurt others.  Some of my choices are unconventional, but not illegal or deliberately harmful.  I survived a lot of harmful things and have no regrets by ignoring toxic and discriminatory talking points.

Yet now, I keep reading that being yourself is smug and narcissistic, and THAT of all things is causing me mental and now physical anguish.  I used to never fall for this stuff.  Now it's everywhere in a cycle.  What gives?"
1174,DON'T READ THIS,"I've started seeing people that aren't there and hearing sound that aren't real. I'm kinda paranoid, I guess. I have daydreams/thoughts which I sometimes can't distinguish from reality. 90% revolve about killing/hurting me/my surroundings. Most of the time when I go outside I have a pocket knife with me and I'm scared that I may harm someone. I've contacted 4 therapists because I think I have a clinical depression but the other stuff is relatively new. Nobody responded. And then last week I was really close to killing myself.  Don’t want to go into the specifics of that. The only reason that I'm still alive is because I'm too weak, physically and mentally. I don't know what to do. Honestly I'm just tired being tired."

1176,I don't want to get better,"I've been struggling with depression and PTSD for a long time now, most of my life. I've been going to therapy and take antidepressants. For a while I think o was actually improving. But, suddenly I just stopped and got worse again. I tried to fight it for a while, to use the new coping skills I had been learning but nothing worked. 

Now, I find myself not even wanting to get better. I've accepted where I am and I don't really want to change it. I know I should want to get better but I don't. It's not just that I'm afraid of how hard it will be, although that may be part of it. I'm actually starting to like feeling this way. I know that sounds weird but I like feeling bad. Idk maybe I've just become comfortable with it but I don't want to let it go."
1177,DH started taking Cymbalta,"My DH has just started taking Cymbalta. This is the first time his depression is being treated... It took 20 years to convince him that he should be on an antidepressant. His life changed drastically this year and his depression got much worse, and he finally recognized that he needed help. 

One of his major concerns about starting an antidepressant is the risk of serious side effects. He is already suffering from health conditions after contracting Covid-19 7 months ago. 

Can anyone share their experience with Cymbalta? Good, bad, neutral? I'm hoping to be able to keep an eye out for red flags on his behalf. 

TIA!"

1182,"Venting about loneliness/willing isolation tw/ suicide, desire to murder","I'm 15 and have been alone most of my life. My parents are divorced but I still see them but I can't stand being around my dad and I'd rather not do anything with my mom. I don't really have any friends or at least not friends I consider close. I was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder about 3ish years ago but I'm starting to feel like it was a false diagnosis. Before now I loved being alone and didn't really have a problem with it. I still don't want to go out or anything but it's starting to wear on me. My girlfriend of a year recently broke up with me and it's probably been the worst thing ever to happen to me. I've had several family members die, pets die, I've broken bones and been sick in the hospital but it never made me depressed or upset. I remember telling someone at school that I didn't cry at any of my grandparents funerals (all 4 are dead) and he reacted with shock, so since then I've felt like I shouldn't even bother trying to be social because people find me weird or hard to communicate with. The reason I'm starting to doubt my Schizoid personality disorder is because I miss my girlfriend. She was my best friend and it's been very hard for me because If i never had any friends how would I know what it's like to lose a friend? I've been trying to talk with her a little but I think I'm just annoying her so I'm trying not to talk to her but I really hope we can get back together. I've never felt this way before and Its really getting to me. I've cried every night for 2ish weeks now and idk what to do. It's really hard because my dad is really hard on me despite knowing I have this disorder. Basically when I would go to my girlfriends house over the weekend I would tell them I was hanging out with friends. Now that I haven't gone out for 3 weeks now my dad always gets upset and yells at me about how I'm wasting my life and whatever and I have thought about killing him but I don't want to get convicted, although im afraid if i go through some sort of mental breakdown I'll end up doing it anyway. I've put myself in a position where I want to have people to talk to but I can't. I cant talk well at all and most people think im weird/depressing. I just want my girlfriend back but idk what to do especially when she doesn't wanna talk. I have thought about killing myself and I have tried to self harm but i dont really have a reason to. I'm really trying to stay positive but I just feel like my mental states deteriorating.  I've been talking to my stuffed animals at night and stuff like that. I just really don't know how to make friends or how to organize plans. I was in a groupchat with friends from school who I would hang out with occasionally but either no one uses that specific one or I got kicked. I guess i could find another girlfriend but the problem is my girlfriend had asked me out, and I have no courage to talk to girls, especially if I won't be able to talk to them in real life because of online school. I still don't really want friends but I don't want to be lonely either. I could ask any girl  out but I'm too scared and no one besides guys at my school really knows me. Plus I still want my ex back because she was the sweetest person and she actually cared for me which was completely alien. Thanks if you read the whole thing :) i just wanted to talk about it to someone besides my ex who gets annoyed when I try to start conversations with her."

1184,I can't remember my abuse,"(very well)

I was in an abusive relationship that ended about two years ago, and I cannot remember the majority of the things that happened. I know that a lot of bad things happened but I can't remember them. I only remember like 3 instances, and not with much detail. I haven't been able to remember for a while now, and at first it was unsettling. There was a lot of gaslighting and emotional abuse, and sometimes the fact that I can't remember makes me doubt myself and wonder if I was really wrong? Or if I really was crazy? I deleted all of my old social media after it all ended cuz I didn't want him to find me, but cuz of that I don't have anything solid (messages, pictures, etc).  I am in a healthy relationship now and I try not to dwell on this, although it is a bit unsettling to realize just how much I don't remember."

1186,I gonna rant,"The past 4 years have been a living hell, ever since my father died in December 2016. Then a year after that in December 2017 my grandmother on my mother's side, Nanny, was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer she smoked cigarettes multiple times a day and lived in a house with asbestos for part of her life, she was in the hospital for Christmas, and it spread from her lungs to her brain and in December 2018 she died, she was a shell of the woman that rased me when she was in the hospital, I hated watching her deteriorate over the course of a whole year. 10 days after Nanny died my mother broke her leg and I had to help take care of her and myself until February, I had help but it was still hard. After that my grandfather's health started to deteriorate. Then I was going to a high school that most of my friends weren't going to, it hurt saying goodbye to them, but I did see some of my friends from elementary school again, so that's nice, I guess. My grandpa died in September of 2019. In February of 2020 my other grandmother, Grandma Susan, was diagnosed with lung cancer, she also smoked cigarettes, but also smoked weed, too. Then in March, Covid-19 hit and I was separated from all of my friends at school for months, I missed them so much. Then we went back to school and most of my friends are doing online school. Grandma Susan died in October of 2020, the lung cancer spread to her brain. I am trying to make new friends, but that dark part of my mind that hates myself is telling me that they are using me. I think my crush likes someone else . I just want a long term relationship with someone who likes me for the person who I am, not someone who is in a relationship with someone else and hits me up at 7:30PM, fuck that bitch, she got blocked. I want someone who will be there for me and I will be there for them. Fuck dating.

i am 15
i just want to be happy
i want this suffering to end (not suicide, I've been down that road and I do NOT want to go back)

Ugh, I understand her troubles, I try to be there for her, I talk to her, and try to understand her, but she makes my life so hard, someday's I just want to cry and stay in bed, but if I do that she'll call me Lazy, Crybaby, and a pig. And I live with her, right now my family has Covid, so I'm stuck with her for 14 days, the only break my sister and I get is the 2 days she's with her mother. Is this a behavior issue?

1190,"I don’t know if it’s a mental illness or not, but I am an ephebophile and I’m going to seek help.","Today I will start seeking therapy for my attraction to teenage boys.

I (40f) have a huge issue that I am coming to terms with. I know it’s disgusting but I wanted to share anyways. I am from the USA but I live in the U.K. Here the age of consent is 16 for everything except sleeping with a teacher or anyone in power over you. I am sexually attracted to boys in their mid to late teens (16-19) but I usually fantasize more for 17-18. I know it’s disgusting, socially unacceptable, and makes me basically a p-do. One of my coworkers is a younger male, he is 17. He is tall, muscular, and I can’t stop myself from staring at him. I had a sex dream about him and I felt so guilty so I stopped talking to him. I have not slept with anyone under the age of 20- but I have sex with men in their 20s who look young and pretend they are 16-18.. I also would watch porn where a young looking guy is the “teen” and he’s having sex with an older woman/ watch porn with 18-19 year old boys. I have since stopped and I’m currently trying to find a therapist. I am also trying to seek men my age as sexual partners. What I’m nervous about is admitting this shame to a therapist. I am always so afraid of judgment. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I’m so messed up but I am trying my hardest to create a sex life with men my age who match my life experience. I don’t want to be a predator anymore. I want to find and receive help. I want to be better than this. I wanted to get this off my chest. I know I can and will come out stronger than this."
1191,"Whenever I seriously consider the fact that childhood wasn’t any worse than average person’s, I experience intense, almost intolerable, shame and psychic pain. Why?","This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise I’m not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered a lot. I know this is a major victim mentality and that’s part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely want to get out of it.

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame.

It’s about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think it’s a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life. But in reality when I begin to believe that, I can’t stand to accept it, it’s so incredibly embarrassing because I have so many mental weakness and am so miserable, knowing it’s my own doing, I just... every bone in my body feels repulsed by that. 

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness. All the frustration and pain I’ve ever felt is instantly just turned inward. An acute awareness of your worst and most despised characteristics. All of the things you aren’t happy about — your fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault."

1194,I need help,"Hello

Two years ago, I had surgery two remove a tumour in the appendix. Besides that I was fine except being mentally exhausted thanks to very poor health care.

Eventually I had surgery and since then I haven't been the same. Sad, Impulsive, sometimes off, angry, memory and concentration issues time passes differently, It's weird to explain.

Anesthesia was Profolol and Ketamine, Tramadol, Pethidine, among others.

My parents kept forcing me to psychiatrists who don't have a clue. 5 mins interview and heavy meds and off you go, every single time. Every type of antidepressants and antipsychoticos made me all those symptoms worse, much worse and you can add murderous rage and violence to the list. Every single time and they still insist on those charlatans. 

I resent my parents, and honestly I wish I could kill them. They deserve it.

Right now I'm trapped. I was prescribed trazodone and now I can't get off them, since I won't sleep but they make me really angry?

What's wrong with me?"
1195,I finally told a counselor,I did it guys! I finally told my counselor about everything and my parents know! Going to be getting some help soon! :D
1196,I just need some help figuring out what's going on...,"This was originally posted on the website Novni by me. It is unedited and was written during an episode (which usually last up to an hour) and right after the episode (I'm still shaky after the fact for a bit so writing still isn't the best):

I experience these weird episodes and I have no idea what it is.

It normally starts with losing most of my feelings in my legs/ going weak in the legs, then I start shivering and having a stomach ache. Sometimes, especially if I'm around people or talking/thinking about my past, I get a twitch in my neck.

I start floating a bit, not all the way out of my body, but enough to feel detached. Every once and a while, my entire body will just jerk and I'll feel shocked and go back for a second until the floating starts again.

My thoughts get clouded, and I'm somewhat aware of myself, but not much. As it keeps going, my hands and knees/legs will loose feeling, and then suddenly come back only to loose feelings again. This hurts in my head and makes me more confused.

I loose interest easily and become unable to put sentences together right (I'm surprised I'm writing this right now, seeing as I'm having one of the episodes, but it's not as intense right now. I can see how messed up my writing is and it doesn't read like I wrote it).

I don't know if I have some sort of trauma. I am transgender, so I already feel disconnected from my body. I had to grow up fast when I was younger because I hit puberty early, and due to dysphoria, kind of lost my mind and sense of self. While I was going through that, no one could help me and so I developed fear associated with not being understood or being unable to control my circumstances (which is one of the reasons the episodes mess with me so much). I have a good family and friends, and my only issue with them is that they ignore my triggers sometimes because they think I'm fine and have nothing against me in life (I'm in the closet about being trans) and this triggers the not being understood thing.

The episodes are often triggered by:

Persistent loud noise

Loud noises and things being too close to my face (which makes me forget where I am or what I'm doing)

Think/talking about being younger specifically during puberty

Having/thinking about dysphoria

Talking about dissociation or any out of body experience

Being told to do too many things at once

Frustration with being unable to read suddenly. I have no idea why this happens either. (episode just ended while writing and took my train of thought with it! From here on out in this writing I'm back in my regular state of mind.)

I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but my mom has depression, my dad has anxiety, and my brother has anger management issues. I tend to be a perfect mix of my parents and the opposite of my brother (we both have strong emotions, he strikes out, I strike in).

I developed a coping mechanism a while back where I would pretend people would come save me from the episodes, and I've posted here before about them. I'm pretty sure they're made up, but I am still figuring out that part. It doesn't help me ""put myself back together"" as I call it when I have to get myself back into my body.

I hope I touched on everything! I would just like some help because for some reason I don't trust therapists as much any more seeing as mine told me multiple times she hadn't ever met a kid that thought the way I did, and that made the ""not understanding"" trigger go off way too many times.

Thanks so much!

P.S. not proof reading to avoid triggering myself again, so you get episode me AND post episode me XD"
1197,"My brother was condescending in front of company last night and I was high, and it was uncomfortable... advice?","
 He said he only let me live with him ‘temporarily’ fairly rudely. Of course I don’t need that negativity so I did my best to ignore it and not let it bother me. 

Fuck. Well... not the best situation but I just felt like he was rude and condescending. The bad part is well, I don’t have a room (long story) and I have like a partition with a bed. It’s a long story sorry... involving him moving out and moving back in. 

Well, the area had a poster that I took down. It kind of got crumpled. I was moving stuff around and set some stuff on it. To be honest I made a mistake. But he got confrontational and was condescending. Then he sarcastically something about ‘inspiring’. I know I need to save but saving can be hard but maybe I could cut back on the weed. I’m kinda anxious right now. Then he called me ‘Mr. Anxiety’ and I told him I wasn’t dealing with his crap and left. 

He was confrontational and mocked me and I left and I’m outside. I know he is a dick. For those who’ve been in similar situations, while I’m saving to move out, what coping tips and boundaries can I set up? What would you do?"
1198,Did i abuse my niece?,"Hey, so i'm a 26 year old guy who's somewhere on the ADHD/other spectrum and has some anxietys. I worry about the weirdest things and get a bit paranoid sometimes, probably because of the above and too much weed.

A few months ago I remembered something I did when i was about 19. I was at a party in a local restaurant to celebrate the birthday of a family member. Pretty much everyone from my (quite big) family was there. My (at the time) 8 year old niece asked me if she would ever see my girlfriend again. We broke up about 6 months earlier and they where quiet close. Now I don't really remember what my response was but i gave her on a kiss on her head. I think it was something I meant in some brotherly way.

Now kissing as a good-bye and out of affection are totally normal in this family but in this case i feel like I did something weird and maybe this has really affected her.

I don't know what to do but I can't get this thought out of my head I'm hoping some outside perspective might help."
1199,Denial.,"My family was mentally and physically abused by a man we somehow called our ""father"" and ""husband"". Is it normal for them to be in a state of denial? They react very aggressively when I mention his terrible behaviour and how it affected our lives. I can't understand why they don't want to admit the serious impact it had on us."
1200,I (f18) need help. My mental state is affecting my entire life.,"I need help. Plain and simple, I don’t know what to do or where to go to look for help because I find it extremely hard to speak to people about my problems due to past traumas but I really do think I’m getting worse. I don’t mean to be one of those people who self diagnose themselves however I’m showing signs that I have depression and some form of anxiety. My boyfriend sees this in me too. 

Over the past five or six years I’ve been extremely suicidal and have had tendencies to self harm in attempt to feel something but about two people in my life know about it and if it weren’t for my partner I’d still be harming myself. There’s points where I’m so far into a breakdown the only thing stopping me from lifting a blade or taking some tablets is the fact he’s laying here beside me peacefully sleeping and that it would pain me to waken him.  

All throughout school I was put down because of the way I felt and I was made out to always be the problem and it’s part of the reason why I can’t tell anyone what’s really going; but it’s getting to the point where it’s really eating me up inside and it’s affecting my relationship with my partner. I can’t bring myself to trust him again due to past experiences and it’s really driving a wedge between us and I really don’t know what to do. 

Please if anyone has any advice send it my way!"
1201,Dosing/microdosing LSD before therapy?,"I might be trying therapy again, but I will be paying a ton of money for it

I was thinking if taking a small amount of LSD might help me with the sessions?

I am a person who has mentally just given up completely. I'm going into therapy knowing it can't help me, and I can't convince myself to ""just not think like that and give it an honest try"". My brain just rejects it like when you reject your parents' advice as a teenager. 

I've tried it once and stopped going after 5 sessions because it was a waste of time and money.

I'm not looking for a a cure in therapy, I'm looking to understand myself and get diagnosed mostly"
1202,Will it be ok if i take like 3 more?,"I [15f] tried to od last night and failed. I just kept being sick and things. I made my parents really sad and now i feel really really guilty for it. I messed up. It’s my fault. My mum cried when i told her and now i feel really sad and want to do it again. I want to do it because i feel really really bad because i made my parents sad. I don’t want to spend weeks knowing i made my parents sad. I can’t. But if i kill myself my parents will be even more sad. I don’t know what to do. I have taken my meds already but i want to take more. I still feel kinda sick and my stomach hurts a bit from yesterday. 

My parents told my therapist and she wants me to go to the hospital for a few nights to stay and see if i’m ok or something idk. 
I’m super fkn scared of the hospital so i will not go because i’m scared af and really worried. 

My parents and therapist know my mental illnesses make me sad alot and understand that but i made my parents really sad. I have been crying all day. I can’t do this anymore."
1203,"(M19) Suffering from withdrawals, mixed with cabin fever from UK lockdown and seasonal depression","Really going through it tonight. Its only my 3rd day sober and the thoughts of relapsing are almost taking over. I don't know how I can go on like this- locked inside, feeling lonely. 

Is this all life has to offer me? Yearly pain and suffering? 

My mind is racing and I don't know what to do"
1204,do things always work out for the best?,"i’m by no means unique. i’m in my final year of university, and another case of an ambitious and perfectly competent student currently incapable of getting a job because of how fucking competitive each. and. every. single. job. worth having is. 

i’ve always worked incredibly, incredibly hard and sacrificed everything for my studies. consequently, i have perfect grades and a lot of extra curriculars. when applying for jobs, i either get rejected at the outset (probably because the applications are over subscribed) or i get through the stages but don’t make it through to the final round, because candidates are marginally better - i.e. got a couple more questions right on the psychometric testing. even though i’m confident that if i made it to the final round, i’d really be able to shine. 

mentally, i’ve been forced to be resilient. i don’t really have any other option. i don’t have any good role models. i’m a first generation child and all i’ve seen my life is poverty. my accomplishments stick out like a sore thumb compared to everyone i went to school with. my family don’t want me to get a good job, as this would entail me moving away from our city and to london. so they’ve not been supportive at all. 

thankfully, i have good self-esteem for the most part. i owe it to myself. i honestly just feel like i’m missing luck. i guess i just want some reassurance that things do turn out okay, and they turn out for the best? i don’t know where i stand philosophically on this. 

part of me wants to believe things happen for the best. the other part of me believes that there’s no underlying reason to anything, and life is nothing but a string of fortuitous or unfavourable events which you’ll never really have total control over. sure, you’ll perhaps be able to control 90% of things, but the other 10% is just down to chance. 

sorry about this. i guess i just needed a vent. becoming an adult sucks. young people are under so much pressure. how is one to balance university deadlines, job hunting (whereby 1000s of candidates apply to the same roles), mental health and having a life, all amidst a pandemic? 

i’m really sorry for venting"
1205,Staying indoors and feeling guilty about it.,"does anyone else out there feel the same way and is possibly willing to share information on how to deal with this? so here’s the basis of my problem. it’s a friday afternoon, i work monday-thursday fulltime, it’s a very labouring job. i’m antisocial due to severe social anxiety, and i have high functioning depression which partly makes me feel guilty and makes me feel like i have a reason. i’m staying inside, drinking and smoking, watching 30s cartoons and playing video games.

All alone and i plan on staying this way for the weekend (as i plan on doing everyday). it’s not that i don’t like being alone, i just feel like i should be more productive. i feel guilty because i COULD be out there making money or friends or improving my mental status or taking out the damned recycling. it feels amazing to be productive, but at the same time this mental block comes along and makes it impossible to see where to start or how to be what i want to be. how do i accept how i feel, or how do i be what i want to be? that’s what i need to accomplish."
1206,i dont know how to act,"im conflicted because i've always had slumps of depression but recently my mind made the sudden decision that i am not allowed to be happy or sad at all

i used to just sit and rot but i really dont know what to do because i keep telling myself that i don't deserve to even do that

my head hurts

sorry this post doesnt make much sense"
1207,Why can't I eat?,"I haven't eaten since Wednesday, technically tuesday if we are only counting full meals. It's not anything most people will think of, I'm not doing this to myself/ on purpose. I want it to stop. Every once in a while I will just 100% loose appetite and not eat for a day or two at most and when I do eat again I get super hungry and clean out the fridge. But this time it isn't stopping.

The last thing I ate was like 2 bites of pot roast Wednesday at lunch and thats been it, aside from a strawberry last night. I thought trying to make myself eat would fix it because my body would be like ""oh right we're really hungry"" but it didn't happen. The problem is that when this happens I dont feel hungry until that moment when it ends and I end up eating everything. I can't really make myself eat, I smelled pizza earlier and I almost gagged. I'm going to try again today but does anyone know what's going on? It's not a physical thing, so that only leaves mental left."
1208,Should I Get Professional Help For This?,"Throwaway Account for privacy

I don’t know if this is the right place to put this so if it’s not I would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.

So I have this “thing” about myself that my mother is very worried about and wants to me go to therapy for. While what I do isn’t “normal“ and from the outside looking in I could come off as “not well.” I‘m a responsible and productive adult who’s not hurting anyone nor myself so I don’t think there’s a problem, but my mom is very worried about me and thinks that I should get help.

Ever since I was a small child I’ve always had a very “active“ imagination. While my mom did have a talk with me about not “playing pretend” in public she left me alone for the most part and thought I would just grow out of it. However at around 11-12 not only was I still doing it, when I made sure I was alone, I got more active about it. To this day my mind will often wander into “Fantasy Land” and I will run around, jump, and talk to myself. Hell, I did it twice already before writing this. I admit, growing up I had to work extra hard to focus because my mind would just wander, whether I wanted it to or not, but I was able to finish grades K-12 on time, I went to college, and I can drive just fine.

I just get so caught up in my fantasies that I don’t feel like I can help it. Believe me I’ve tried to stop but I get so antsy and feel like I HAVE to do it and can’t go a single day without doing it multiple times. Having roommates would often make me anxious but if they ever walked in on me, because I was studying Theatre, I would just lie and say I was practicing a monologue for class. Now that I’m living back with my mom she’s commented on how she can hear me, but for the most part we never really talk about it and she is worried. I think it’s because I’ve never had any romantic relationships before and admittedly this is part of the reason, but I’m not sure where to go from here.

Is this something I need help for? Is there an official name fir what I’ve described? Should I get a therapist, psychiatrist, etc.?"
1209,What does 'well enough' mental health look like?,"I talked with my partner a bit today following an argument about how it's hard for people with diagnoses not to pathologise themselves and to understand when a difficulty isn't them or their condition, but just a part of life. As a type A underachiever who is great at burning herself out by trying to 'fix' herself to an impossible degree, it made me wonder about what on Earth 'good enough' mental health even looks like.

Even someone at peak mental health will still be flawed, have conflicts and disagreements, do bad or unhealthy things - but at what point do they have the healthiest version of these flaws? When they accept them? When they commit to changing them? Both? Neither?

Would a mentally 'well enough' person still need or benefit from therapy?

It's very confusing especially if you're nuerodivergent - because we have no real reference point to what an achievable good life looks like in comparison to nuerotypical people. Autistic, ADHD people etc just get represented as eccentric genuises or tragic children. The wide, wide middle isn't really explored. It feels like we can't even know if reasonably contented people like ourselves even exist."
1210,Personality and mental illness,"Basically, I feel as though I have trouble differentiating between what's my personality, and what's my depressive and/or anxious tendencies.

1211,How do I stop self-harming before it becomes constant?,"I stopped self-harming three years ago and it was never really consistent or that many cuts/burns. Today I relapsed, I was able to stop after four small cuts and I really don't want this. How can I stop before it gets worst???"
1212,Cheap or free meds?,"I have been to the behavioral center in my city (NC) and it was fine. Met with lpn, got a script. But cost about $250 if I remember correctly. My friend told me he’ll take me to the behavioral ER there because he’s been and they have to see you and possibly give you a script if it’s in the ER for free. Anyone heard of this or know of low cost meds options? Besides the intake appointment."
1213,how do I deal with covid and my girlfriend?,"i go to high school every day, I protect myself with the necessary ppe and sanitize everything when I come home. my girlfriend’s family is not as cautious as mine but I hang out with her every week. sometimes when they have people over i get anxious and have breakdowns before going to her house. they had some people over today (they weren’t their friends or anything, they were there for a house related thing) and I was supposed to see her today. i had the strength to tell her that I didn’t want to go since if i transmit the virus to any of my parents they’ll most likely die and me and my sister would be left alone. we don’t have any living family in the US and i would most likely have to drop out to help my sister. 

please help me discern a decision on how to manage this mess. i can’t keep going anymore :("
1214,Coping tips while living with mean brother??,.
1215,Poetry about narcissistic mom,"
I’m trapped underneath the debris of a home you broke .
Beat black and blue with the words you spoke .

After all the pain you put me through. 
People say I should hate you .

Remember that night I tried to take my own life and I needed you there ?
As I cried you lie in bed , to “tired” to care .

Remember those hospital appointments I went to alone .
Frightened to death with no one to phone?

Remember when you mocked my sexuality in-front of your friends.
“Stop being so sensitive “ was your way of making amends.

Your not sorry but I believe every lie.  
I forgive you for everything but I don’t know why ? 

You swear and scream at me , until I cry .
Saying I ruin your life , but I don’t know why ? 

Your sweet as pie in public and make me look a fool.
Put behind closed doors , you easily loose your cool .

What can I do to make you like me ?
Give me commands and that’s what I will try to be .



Edit: I am completely safe . I am getting intensive professional and medical help . I am in no danger whatsoever so please don’t worry 😊"
1216,I don’t know how to describe all my problems...,"Disclaimer: I hope this isn’t just a rambling mess.   I’m titrating off of my Effexor, so I’m in not in the best state of mind atm. 

First off, I’ve been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD-PI, Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I just got out of college, and am working in the first real job of my life. But, I’ve noticed that an issue that I have had all of my life, and especially throughout college has started to affect me; my timeliness. No matter what I do, I can’t do the things I know I need to do or even want to do within a reasonable time. I will say “ok, I have an event in 30 minutes”, and sometimes I will miss it entirely, or get somewhere an hour late. As you might think, these habits haven’t helped me very much in my job as of late. Getting to places on time is extremely important for my line of work, and I just can’t seem to cut it. No matter how much I plan, how much medicine I take, or how much therapy I go to, I just can’t force myself to do these things. I barely got through college, and I honestly have no clue how much longer I will be able to keep my employment. Am I just a lost cause? Do I have some other kind of disability? I don’t really know. I will say that I also feel tired all the time (I run out of energy after doing very little all day) , and I have this strange, needling sensation in the nape of my neck on and off all day. Idk if that had anything to do with my problems, but I feel like everything just started to really ramp up after I was in middle school.

TLDR: I’m chronically late, and nothing I’ve done in the past has helped. I can’t keep to a schedule, calendar, verbal agreements, etc. Am I beyond help? Why do I feel everything is connected to the pain in th nape of my neck?"
1217,How to feel better about yourself and get over feelings of jealousy and failure?,I'm overwhelmed with emotions of failure. I feel like a loser and am just mediocre in every way. I wish I could do something great at work but I can't think of any good ideas. I'm jealous of my friends who are doing great for themselves and I feel like I can't catch up. I don't even want to talk to certain friends because of jealousy and feel like they look down on me. How can I find little successes to be proud of at the end of the day? How do I get over feelings of jealousy and stop comparing myself to others?
1218,Things feel cartoony,"I don’t know where to ask for help because google dosent have answers for this specifically. 
Sometimes when I go out biking or hang out with my friends, everything starts feeling strange. Like when I’m biking and I see a hill and plants, everything will start feeling like a cartoon and warp but very subtly. It dosent happen often, only when I’m outside. I know it’s not DR/derealization because I never feel detached or anything like that. I’ve used light drugs like weed and LSD but I’ve never had a bad experience either. Am I just blowing this out of proportion or should I seek help or something?"
1219,Need to make a website for my mom but I’m so nervous about it/so tired I can’t get myself to start,"Graduated with a certificate in graphic design in May, but I haven’t created a single thing since then. I haven’t applied for any jobs or made anything for my portfolio, but now my mom wants me to make a website for her small business. I really don’t want to considering i can’t even do anything for myself, but she doesn’t speak English well, so I’m the best person she can communicate with and it saves her money if I do it. I should just do it, business has been suffering immensely because of COVID, and this would help my mom out a lot, and she wants it soon, esp because she’s stressing because she doesn’t know what to do now that we’re making like no money. But every time I tell myself I need to start i get so anxious and I don’t wanna do it. I just remember how long it took to set up my portfolio website, and now I have to set this one up for online shopping, and I’m just overwhelmed. My mom doesn’t understand and thinks it shouldn’t be hard because she watched like 2 youtube videos. She says understands if I feel stressed and she can just hire someone else to do it for her but I’d be a bad daughter if i let her do that. 
It’s not even like i’m so busy doing my own thing. I have the time to make it. But i really can’t get myself to start and I feel like shit."
1220,"(I've already posted this on ELI5, but I feel I might get an answer here too) What is the difference between Borderline personality disorder and c-PTSD?",Having a bit of a crisis recently. I really need to sort myself out. If anyone has literally anything to help me fully understand the difference it would help me so much.
1221,im really discontent with my life.,"i’m so unhappy with my life and how it’s going, but it’s not even that bad compared to others. i have a roof over my head, i’m physically healthy, grade-wise, school is fine, and my family is comfortable financially. i just feel so unhappy with the way I’m living. i dont feel comfortable in my friend group but i find it really difficult making new friends + going to a small school doesn’t make it any better. i feel like a lot of this unhappiness comes from the way I think. i spend so much time thinking about how things could’ve been and could be and I get all discouraged with the way I’m living. + this happens so often because i get so fixed on certain new interests and think how it could’ve been if i acted on that interest earlier. my strict parents don’t make expressing myself any easier too. aaaaaaaaaaaaa. i feel like i don’t even have the fight to complain + what if this is just part of being a teenager. idk thanks for letting me vent."
1222,Can i talk to someone or someone distract me please?,[15f]. Hi can i please talk to someone or someone distract me please i’m really close to OD’ing again. I messed up last night and now my parents are really sad and it’s 23:19pm and i have been crying since 9am. I’m really really scared of going to the hospital but i think i might be going tomorow because my therapist says i might need to stay a few nights. I’m getting freaked out and i’m just super fkn scared. I may or may not have had 2 pills already (i’m prescribed them) but my stomach hurts a bit now from it and i feel sick again. I’m sorry.
1223,Disturbing Intrusive Thoughts,"Every once in a while, a sudden thought comes to mind of my loved ones being sexually assaulted, screaming for help, and my powerlessness to do anything to stop their (imaginary) attacker. I want these thoughts to stop because I've become over protective of my loved ones and get anxiety whenever I have to leave them.

Personally, I feel like these thoughts arise from my constant feeling that I lack control over the circumstances of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?"
1224,How to stop yourself from having unhealthy crushes?,"Well first of all, even though the title probably sounds like it comes from a teenager, I am not, I am 24 (female).

I have a lot of social issues. Anxietys, I get mad really easy which is probably one of the reasons why I lost all my close and not so close friends. I am also self concious and struggle with simple things like small talk, meeting people etc. I am often extremely lonely until the point of desperation and wanting do die because I miss being social so much (even though I never had many friends anyway).

I think this and the fact that I struggling a lot with my self worth creates this defect in my head that I tend to crush really fast. Like, super fast and intense. When I was 18 I had a crush for the first time in my life and even though I never really got to know him and never had a chance it lasted for years. And it happened more times.

And it is happening again right know with a coworker I have known for a few weeks now. It is not as extreme yet but I can feel that I am again getting this feeling of affection and wanting to be liked by that person desperately even though I only had a few conversations with him that were not about work. And I think there were some hints that he might be somewhat interested in me as well (but I might be completely misinterpreting that). The messed up thing about this is: I am in a relationship (which is kinda complicated - different story). I am such a fucked up person.

It's really unhealthy and I know it. Those feeling are not real and I know it!! I tell myself everyday, stop it, stop it, keep distance to this person but my brain is working against me. I'll probably have a beer with him and another co worker next week even though I tell myself I shouldn't. It is so scary how much this thing in my head controls my actions. I don't know what to do.

Is there anything I can do to get control over those feeling or at least get enough control over myself to keep away from this person? I really need some advice. Thanks a lot for reading."
1225,I think i got called out,"By one of my friends when I was walking to school they asked how's depression (what I think i may have) and i said that I feel called out and i stayed lockdown has made all of us a bit depressed
But ahhhhhh I do not understand my own mind and I am just wondering is playing out my throughts a coping mackism"
1226,Afraid of Confidence,"Confidence is something people always want to have; to be able to have trust in something or someone. I fear it. I feel like if I have confidence, I have arrogance. I feel like its easier to expect the worse and go from there. If something good happens, then great. If something bad happens however, the blow won't hit as hard. That's just my opinion anyway. I have people who tell me that's no way to live but I argue its a safer way."
1227,I'm not really sure what to do with my life. How do I fix the nothing that my life has become?,"I'm 20, I moved into the ghetto after I was labeled 80% disabled by the VA. I was also forced out by my mother when I needed my family. They sat and watched me have seizures but my mom kind of acted like they weren't real. They've went away after leaving all the stressful situations I was in. 

In the Army I was happy, I actually went to South Korea. I had an unlimited network of friends and everyone just kind of acted like they knew eachother so it was easy. I was a paralegal, but eventually I suffered a horrible accident during PT. Three of my cervical discs are herniated and one herniated lumbar disc. A pinched nerve in each shoulder. And I basically have radiculopathy in my entire back and all the way down my legs. This made me pretty upset and it made me drink and I was addicted to cough medicine because it numbed everything. Before this I was at the prime of my life I worked out everyday I was in good shape, ate right. Right after this happened I eventually got discharged and sent home.

Shortly after getting discharged I met this girl who I decided to get an apartment with because I thought it would be easier, we got in a relationship and it tormented me but I couldn't just leave because I felt responsible for the apartment. Which we took from my mom when she moved out so her name was under the lease. And I suppose it didn't just torment me it tormented the girl I was talking to as well. Because I was just mean for no reason sometimes. But so was she. And we were just a bad couple I admit that. But the stress it put me under eventually I started having seizures with the pain of my back. Mainly after we got in a heated argument.

I eventually got away and moved in with my mom. She ended up moving all of her stuff out and into some new guys house, all while she was still having me under the impression we were together. I moved in with my mom and she promised me I'd always have a place there, and she'd help me until I got my VA stuff done and moved into my own place. So I stayed there and I tried to go out more look at nature. That was really nice. I never felt more alive and without stress in my life. And I met this woman I'm with now, she was sweet to me, and nice and before I had any money she stuck with me. My back pay for the military came in and my mom said that if I wanted to continue to stay there I should give her a large sum of the money, talking about in the range of 2k. 

My mom has never even taught me how to drive and I still don't know how to because she kept me for 17 years secluded and isolated from everyone and everything. And we argued literally every day of our lives. I spent days in this trailer just disassociating from everything. They would tell me that my mental illnesses are made up and that I should just say hey fuck it, it is what it is. And I did just that. 

Getting back on topic, I got kicked out that day and I had to find a new place, I eventually did. I moved in this place and it isn't nice. Its pretty rough. The girl I'm with now moved in for a little bit and shes from a rich neighborhood. Her mom kicked her out so I said she could stay with me. We lived here, tried to make the best of things but it just wasn't exciting here. She eventually moved 2 hours back to where she's from and she's STILL depressed from the experience while I'm trying to figure out what I should do with my life. Right now she probably sees me as some loser trying to teach her how things work. She tells me all the time how she wants to kill herself. I dont even know what to say to her I'm so out of it. If I don't find something to become exciting I'm not gonna have anything left to keep me going. And I don't mean suicide, I just mean I really am just gonna give up. Because all these audiobooks and meditation and everything everyone tells me to do doesn't work. I get closer to something and then its crushed. I just really need to know what I need to do to get back to the exciting me who made a lot of friends. I'm working on my license, but even now I wonder what exactly thats gonna do. I never talked positively before but I can't even be funny anymore, how can I pull this all together again?

TL'DR - I need to get out and make more friends and I need to be more positive. How do I do that?"
1228,"Literally can’t think sometimes, brain running low on RAM!","I have OCD, so I constantly replay sentences that people say to me or from a video or whatever. My brain counts syllables, the number of the syllable must be one syllable itself (seven=sev, eleven=lev, etc.)

For awhile now, I have found it LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to replay things in my mind. It’s ABSOLUTELY frustrating, losing control of my own mind? That’s supposed to be the one thing I CAN control in life!

It’s weird, my brain will literally be unable to playback, it causes severe physical distress, me trying to concentrate to replay what was said in my mind.

I barely read anymore because I constantly lose focus and reread to make sure I didn’t skip anything, because I could miss important information! When I was a child, I read ALL THE TIME. I don’t know if years of Zoloft and/or Trileptal damaged my cognitive skills, or if watching video over reading simply rotted my reading skills.

It is the strangest sensation, being LITERALLY unable to THINK. Like this sentence I’m typing right now, I can be trying to think it in my head, but my brain just can’t do it, it’s hard to explain. Often I’ll manage to form the thought/playback, but the quality will be degraded (doesn’t sound clear).

I’m 25 (almost) could I already be getting Alzheimer’s or dementia? Alzheimer’s DOES run in my family!"
1229,Experience with cognitive remediation therapy?,"Does anyone here have any experience with ""CRT"" - cognitive remediation therapy?

I take medications that help somewhat but not enough. I’m always going to my room and wanting to be alone because I’m scared of people."
1231,Does anyone feel this way?,Does anyone ever feel like life is moving through them instead of living through life and seeing life through your own eyes?

1233,do non-mentally ill people think about suicide?,"first of all, in all seriousness, I am not at risk of committing suicide or hurting myself in anyway, I can assure you of that.

I can't exactly ask anyone in my life because thats weird, but do non mentally ill people ever think about suicide? like, I know I could never go through with it but I have a plan in my head of how I *would* and I think about it when I'm really struggling with my MH. its kind of comforting in a way that its an option to stop the pain? difficult to explain. 

therapists always talk about if you ""have a plan"" or if you are ""seriously considering it"", and brush off 'casual' thoughts of suicide as no big deal because you aren't going to act on them, but are they actually no big deal? do normal people think about suicide even if they know they wouldn't do it?"
1234,Why does everyone think I’m ‘pure’ and ‘innocent?’,"I have a long history of suicidal ideation and self harm. I’m shy and rarely speak out in school. I’m in the process of being diagnosed for ADHD. I dress like, in the words of a girl in my class: “a homeless Vietnam War veteran.” I’m a talented artist (I think). I try to be educated on current events and not be a hypocrite. I have a girlfriend.

So why does everyone think I’m innocent? Do I just seem stupid? I try to tell the truth and try hard for other people, but they all just think it’s a joke or I’m putting on an act. I post whatever I want on my social media, draw whatever comes to my mind, and I try to say what I want to say. I rarely complain out loud or vent my anger outwards. I’m just trying to be myself, but everyone talks to me like I’m 12 years old. It’s infuriating."
1235,A hand just grabbed my water bottle,"I saw it, it’s dark in here but I saw it. Idk what’s been going on with me"
1236,I need help but I feel like it's impossible to get it,"I've needed help for at least the last 6 years but I never reached out until today and it went much worse than expected. It took me literally 6 years to work up the courage to find a psychiatrist and call them and when I did, the receptionist was incredibly rude and hung up on me when her phone cut out and I didn't hear what she said. I know it's stupid but I immediately had a breakdown and the entire day I've been crying and engaging in some of the exact self destructive habits that I needed to get help for. I don't know what to do anymore, how am I supposed to get help when it seems like the system was built to make it as difficult as possible? Besides that, I'm also on my parents insurance and they're the reason I need help in the first place so I would rather not have to get them involved, but apparently that's how the American healthcare system works. I really just can't do this anymore."

1238,is 4 years too long to still be grieving over a dog,"sometimes i just sit and cry when i think about my best friend dying 4 years ago. like out of nowhere, one minute i’ll be fine, the next, shaking in tears. 

the first year was pretty bad. i cried constantly, it got easier, but i still just get upset by it a lot and i’m starting to think i’m being ridiculous by still being upset 4 years later. i don’t even think my family cried when she died, let alone years later. i just miss her a lot and wish she was still around. i’m starting to forget what it was like to have her here and i see her in my dreams a lot and then ill wake up thinking she’s alive but she’s just not and idk what to do about feeling like this."

1240,Spiralling mental health due to panic attacks,"Hi there,

I’m an 18F and I’ve always had anxiety, since I was around 6-7 years old. It started off as nightmares, over the years it went from that to hypochondria, OCD and weird ticks I would have, and then social anxiety. I’ve seen many labels given to my conditions, such as panic disorder, generalised anxiety, etc. I’ve never been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist, but the problem is there. It’s undeniably anxiety. This year has been rough, with an increase in boredom leading to an increase in panic attacks, anger problems, and I also suffered with disordered eating for a while. It’s been horrible.

My panic attacks happen frequently, maybe 1-2 times a week. Over things that I can’t necessarily control, like things others have said, etc. I have an amazing loving boyfriend, however due to my issues with family (major daddy issues, abusive home life, never felt loveable) I have an increased sensitivity to things he might say or do, which can sometimes lead me to spiral. This week, we had two arguments which came strictly from my panic attacks. It started as a misunderstanding, on both occasions, and ended up with me screaming, hitting, crying, self harming and feeling like I wanted to die.

My panic attacks cause me to do things I would never do. In fact I blank out most of the time. This morning I had a huge row with my mother, and I can’t remember the majority of what she said, of what I said, and why I reacted by screaming and swearing. It’s quite scary. By nature I’m a timid and humble person who would never lay a hand on anybody, even in the worst of times. But my panic attacks send me into this disillusioned state where in the past, on two occasions, I have hit my boyfriend in the chest. It’s absolutely disgusting and I feel like a waste of space on this earth for doing such horrible things. Please do not rush to tell me how horrible I am for it; I already know, and I hate myself every day for it. He’s very understanding, and he sees how I change.

The thing is, I would’ve sought medication months ago. However my therapist told me that using medication is ‘giving up’ quote. She then told me that I have all these disorders, which (she is not qualified to diagnose me) seemed like a plot to make me uncomfortable, and to drive me away from medication. 

Has anybody else experienced this? Do you think that medication would help? Thank you for reading this, I really appreciate it."
1241,Why does this happen?,"I’m almost constantly worrying about everything and disliking myself, and even though I know I shouldn’t, I care way too much about how others see me. I usually think I’m worthless, stupid, and a bother/inconvenience. 

I say “almost” and “usually” because sometimes I’ll be listening to music, and I’ll feel super good. I mean it for that brief amount of time, I’ll have motivation. I’ll feel like I can accomplish so much in my life. I’ll think, ‘screw what other people think about me. Who even cares’. Then it goes away and I’m back to my usual self. I wish I could just stay in that somewhat happy state."
1242,How to deal with emotional exhaustion when you can't remove yourself from the situation?,"Due to everything going on in the world, I'm feeling just completely emotionally/mentally drained. The fact my insomnia is kicking in isn't helping. I'm able to distract myself some, watching YouTube videos, but because I have ADHD, focusing on one thing for a decent amount of time also drains me. 

I've had *no* ability to be creative lately due to the drain. I'm not great at meditation and my gyms have horrible hours. 

Any other ideas what I can do to deal with this exhaustion? At this point, I feel like I'm drowning."
1243,"I don’t want to lose the little glimmer of courage that made me talk about this, so I’ll post this here too because I think I’m just becoming too desperate to stop feeling sad","~~I think I need help with something~~

I’m a 23 female and I’ve been wanting to seek mental health help for a couple of years now, ~~does anyone know any good doctor who cares?~~

For the past few years I’ve been feeling very sad most of the time, I’ve lost interest in many things that made me happy in the past, like reading and writing and playing the piano, I can’t get through these things easily. I used to be a really good student, I would remember what I read very easily, for the past few years I’ve been struggling to even start studying, my grades are falling down and I’m barely passing, I love what I do, but as soon as I stop, it’s hard to get back to doing what I do.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past too, not too long ago, I’ve thought about cutting my wrists, hanging myself, overdosing on expired medicine, jumping from the window, stabbing myself with a pair of scissors, these are all thoughts, I’m too scared to even try.

I feel guilt about everything, I’ve been crying a lot lately regardless of my menstrual cycle, I’m always scared that I’ll receive news about a family member dying, I’ve had a few panic attacks, one was even during an exam in front of everyone which made me feel humiliated, I’ve hated myself on and off, I don’t like myself most days, I’ve had mental breakdowns, last time it was around 7 months ago and I couldn’t control myself and just screamed at my mom at the top of my voice and I didn’t feel like I’m the one who’s saying all these things, I try to stop and think about controlling myself, but during those times I always feel paranoid, and get severely insecure that I’m unwanted and never loved. 

I’m sick and tired of feelings this way, ~~and I do want to seek help, that’s why I’m making this post, please, if you know a good doctor,~~ I just need help

When I was in middle school, the doctor prescribed zinc stress tablets because I was dealing with anxiety that always made me dizzy during school &amp; I would end up calling my mom to pick me up and then proceed to feel guilty because the dizziness stops. I stopped taking the tablets a few months after prescription because I thought I felt better and never took anything for all these years. 

I feel like my world is falling apart, my grades are shit, I am passing, but seeing my percentage makes me feel like shit, when I’m studying, I remember and understand the things I’m reading, even when practicing, I know what I’m doing. When I solve past exams I know the right answers for most questions &amp; feel proud, but during the actual exam, I fuck things up and end up with a grade just barely passing.

I’m a senior in a college of medicine, I’m a few months away from my MD exam, I don’t have any motivation to start studying, I think about it and make plans for it, but never get to opening the book, and if I do, I can’t bring myself to read and study.

When I go to the hospital for the rotations, I love it so much, I love how we have to figure out what’s going on, and knowing what to do and which medication is the most appropriate, I love going to the clinic these days and take history from patients or see the clinical features and make a diagnosis, or when we discuss the patient with the doctor and see where I went wrong and what I did right, I love simulations so dearly and they always make me feel like a real doctor who’s capable of taking care of the people seeking help. Yet with all that, I can’t stop feeling guilty and scared that I’ll fuck things up.

I feel helpless most days, I wake up late, stay in bed for a while, sometimes even hours, get up, eat, watch Netflix or something, daydream a lot, feel guilty that I’m not studying, go to bed, sometimes cry before going to sleep, cycle repeats.

I’m so sick of this, I want to feel motivated, I want to feel capable and confident, I always thought that I might have bipolar disorder or depression since high school, I have a good support system which’s my family and my best friend who is the most wonderful person in the world, I feel guilty that I even feel this way when they always support me, I try to support them as much as I can but I don’t want to be inadequate.

I sometimes want the world to stop for a day, so I can catch up and sort my shit out, but I can’t and I feel helpless, and I can’t feel helpless anymore because I’m about to graduate &amp; be an intern during a global pandemic."
1244,I have a mental illness but don’t know what it is?,Who do I talk to about what kind of mental illness I have? I feel like I am mentally crazy but I don’t know what is wrong with me or who to speak to?
1245,"All things seem cloudy, I don’t have a clear vision on what I want","I’ve been having an ongoing bout of anxiety for al title while now and I’ve realized that I don’t know what I want at all, about almost anything. I also don’t feel like I have the energy or passion to do much of anything anymore. I also broke up with my girlfriend because I wasn’t feeling like the relationship was working anymore but I’ve realized that it could’ve just been because I’ve been feeling this immense anxiety about a lot of things, and I could’ve mixed up my emotions about being confused with basically everything into a feeling of not wanting a relationship anymore. I’ve been trying to work on it but I’ve only gotten more in my head about things and I’ve been constantly go back and forth, always over analyzing and worrying about things that don’t matter. I’ve always been care free and happy for the most part but my life just seems boring and dull. I just want some advice on how to get out of this slump and get back to normal if anyone has had this happen to them before. It sucks because I also still have feelings for my girlfriend but it seems as though I probably won’t be able to go back to her, which hurts me even more, but I feel as though maybe it’s a good thing for her to get away from me because I don’t want to hurt her. Any advice or words of wisdom would be helpful, thank you."
1246,Is this normal?,So a few days ago i stayed up until about 5am playing smash bros and animal crossing and i starting to just hear voices of people i know just saying random things. I only want to know if this is normal since it’s never happened before and just tonight something said “wake up” when i tried to sleep
1247,TWO COMPLETELY RANDOM SITUATIONS TRIGGER CHEST TIGHTNESS (I AM BAFFLED),"Hello, this will be my first post on this community and I think this is a great place for me to ask what's been bothering me for years.

It all started around 2014 when I began to experience tightness on my chest. I was at the church that time and I just thought it was some random chest pain so I  instantly didn't mind it. 

However, I continuously experienced it for the successive years. I had to stop attending church because I kept feeling anxious about what may happen to me. 

I think it was roughly six months before I started going to church again. Everything's going fine then, 2020 came, this annoying chest tightness started to bother me. But what boggles me the most is that it only occurs in two particular situations (which is completely random, like I'd suddenly feel heavy on my chest while cooking this particular dish!) 

What could this possibly mean? Could it be a life-threatening illness that I was not aware of? (I didn't tell my parents about this as I didn't want them to even bother. They've been thru a lot. ;((()"
1248,Is this normal?,"Hey just trying to figure out if what’s going on is normal, or if my brain is just tricking me. For a while now I’ve been dealing with this weird ordeal. I get to feeling like my head is overloaded, like it’s too loud or something, and it gets to the point where I feel like I can’t function anymore. And I feel like I’m just mentally repeating the same shit over and over, in and endless cycle and it just gets to the point where everything starts to hurts. And then there’s days like today and I feel fucking phenomenal! And looking back like none of it seems real, like it didn’t even happen? Like I didn’t feel like shit? Idk is my brain like tricking me?"
1249,Stopped taking AD and I’m sad,"I’m really sad and I’ve always been sad. I’ve been diagnosed and it has always been a big problem for me. When i was taking Anti depressants, my boyfriend was supportive but he said he feels like he wants me to go off it in the future and focus on exercising and going out more. He’s healthy so I can’t blame him for saying this but it Irritates me so much. It feels like I never tried to help myself before or I’m not ‘really depressed’ but just lazy. Currently, I’m not taking the pills (my own decisions) and I keep on thinking about what he said. It upsets me so much. He wants me to rely on him and he wants to be there for me but he barely understands what I’m going through. I don’t know what to do. I just want to run away from everything but I know it would help me at all."

1252,I am going through a rough stage in life and my parents don't care,"Hello everyone. Thank you for taking the time to read this post as I've put a lot of effort into making it and trying to convey how I am feeling across to you. Soo... I am 16 years of age currently and ever since I've hit puberty, i've just been feeling terrible and I've been making terrible mistakes because of what I am going through. I don't know what I am going through, but I feel as if there is a big black hole in my chest that is going to explode at any moment. Back on topic- I've been loosing some of my best friends lately because they don't see me the way that they used to, as a fun and awesome person. How all they see in me is a depressed wimp. Because of this, I've been doing terribly in school and I have been in many arguments with my teachers and my parents. My parents are grade orientated and don't care about how I am feeling so when the news broke to them about what I was going through, they got really mad at me and made me suffer because of it. I don't like how they have to punish me because I am going through something that I don't know how to stop. Like a bus with no breaks that is about to ride off a cliff. They got so fed up off me that they put me into counselling and even when the psychologist said that I had problems, they still got angry at me and didn't care at all. Since then, I've just become quiet, with anxiety and depression flowing up to my chest. I think it is just this teenager phase. Once it passes, I hope that I will get better. If anyone has any idea about how I can cope with this, please comment down below. Thank you for hearing me out."
1253,afraid to be happy,"right now i think i can say that i’m pretty happy. not gonna lie, saying that scares me. every single time something good in life happens, something terrible happens afterwards. i’m afraid to be happy because now i’m just waiting for the bad thing to happen. that feeling of being at your highest and crashing to your lowest is the worst feeling in existence."

1256,Am I an a#$ for keeping a grudge after 4 years,"Roughly 4 years ago I joined a new school and was sat next some girl. I'm fairly out going and so is she so we had a few conversations in English but nothing deep or personal. On my way home one day I walked past her and said ""alright"" and kept walking, we weren't really friends so I wasn't gonna walk with her or anything. I thought nothing of it, it was an innocent passing by after all. Within a day or two I start getting messages from her bf, I didn't know who he was because as I said I knew nothing about her. Her bf was basically saying I followed her home and stalked her. I called it out as bullshit and he started threatening to beat me up and stuff and I got very worried. Through out the following year more and more people started to get ahold of this rumour and people thought it was true, so I confronted her directly, I asked if she had said this to her boyfriend and she said yes and ""well you did"". Its because of this that I got bullied for 4 years straight, I have had few friends till recently and even got beaten up multiple times including one time where about 20 people all got hits in on me at once.

Its not like she beat me up or bullied me, we didn't speak to each other at all after the first year, but yet I still despise her. Is this wrong? Should I be holding a grudge for something that she probably didn't think would get this far out of hand?"
1257,"I been sad because, I think one of my cousins killed themselves"," I talked to some of my family about this, but i think if I tell my story. It could help someone that is struggling with depression. Or some sort of mental illness. My cousin which, im going to call him DJ. Dj and I were close cousins we grew up together. I remember me and Dj went to school together, to elementary for a year. I lived with him and his family, when i was about 7 years old. Now during that time they had a big brother and he died fairly young. Im sure that hit Dj the most in his life. We spent years as kids together, we would play 64 together, we got sick together, we were brothers. Then one day we move out and now am with my dad. This is the time am about 14. Years passed and Im about 22yrs young my cousin dj visits me lets go. Party so we did. The piont is he always came through for me, just remember he was always there for me for years he visited me. Until one day i decided to move out of my dads house. Then i dont hear about him for years. Until i decided to go to one my families parties because why not. I ask one my other family members where is Dj they tell me hes homeless. Right there my world just shattered, I thought to myself how does a young man that was well composed. Go homeless he was really battling some dangerous demons as in mental illness. At this moment I am battling some of the same things. But my piont is i never took the time to visit him like he did. I will never now what he went through in his head in his last moments. My brother told me he went to go see him a year before. My brother slept with him in his tent. To see what its all about, my cousin was just struggling mentally really hard. His younger sister told me, she saw Dj just a week before he passed. Not one day I regret not visiting my cousin to see how he was doing at least one time. This is going to kill me, inside until the day I die. So please ask for help, or ask if anybody needs help. RIP DJ"
1258,How do you tell a loved one you’re depressed,I really need help. I need support from someone. I don’t know how to go to people for help. I feel like I will scare them away or come off as dramatic or burden them. I can’t see a therapist because i don’t have money. Idk what to do anymore this is so hard. Every single day is so draining and painful.
1259,Letter to my old friend,"I want you to know that you are an incredibly kind, funny, smart, and talented person, and most importantly an absolutely amazing friend. You are so supportive, caring, accepting, and  understanding and you were literally the most perfect friend I could ask for then. Anyone who has had you or will have you in their life is extremely lucky because you are such a great person and friend to have. Please, please give yourself more credit. You have no idea how much you have impacted my life just by texting me every day for two months. I can’t imagine how the other people in your life feel and I can’t even begin to describe how amazing you are.  Again, I’m just so, so happy and grateful I met you when I did. You don’t even know. And thank you so much for being a perfect friend to me. I appreciate it a lot even if I didn’t always seem like it. I cared about you a lot and I still do, I never stopped and I probably never will. I’m always here for you if you need me. It’s the least I can do."
1260,I crave attention and think I’m developing mental issues/problems.,"Well, I just I don’t know. I wish my parents would take me to therapy or some sort of doctor to get help, but of course they won’t believe me or think I’m just being crazy/stupid. I know everyone loves attention sometimes, but I just crave it too much, I think. No, I don’t think I’m  the type of person to do the stupidest stuff to get attention like jumping off a bridge or something like that. Few examples: (1). Getting upvotes/likes on things I post are so nice. I feel so liked. Yes, I know it’s like “Oh IM FaMOuS nOW” but I really like it when people notice my things. (2). Today I saw an ant hill and went over to it, grabbed a stick, got ants on there and chased one of my friends with it and got ants on them, but that was probably me being stupid. (3). Another time I did something horrible and ran out my home to someone else’s. When they tried to help and talk to me I all of a sudden “felt better“ and wanted to laugh, but deep down inside I just wanted to cry. Like right now I wanna laugh for some reason even though this is serious, but I also wanna cry. Not sure why this happens, but maybe someone can explain it. 

 I also worry that my friends don’t think I’m funny or I’m not being funny enough for them to laugh every time I make a joke, and it seems I’m being a bit ruder to them then usual? I mean, we’re the type of people to make rude/stupid jokes and just laugh, so maybe I’m just overreacting? And everyday I just think, “I hate human interaction“ for no reason? And for some reason every time we go home like for a holiday or something I just sort of forget how to interact with people. I think people think I interact just fine, but I feel like I sort of forget how to make conversations.

Tomorrow I think I’m gonna go kick a fence so I can at lest hit something instead of someone.

I just want fucking help, god. Wish my parents would listen and understand. I just want understanding people in my life (sorry for writing this unnecessary part)."
1261,What do I do now? (big TW for suicide talk),"I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this, but I’m kind of fresh out of options. 

October and November have put me through the fucking wringer mentally and emotionally. I have debated for a long time whether or not I might have cptsd, but assuming I do for the sake of argument, I have been experiencing what I think are some really bad emotional flashbacks. I can’t remember anything clearly but I constantly feel sick, tired, scared of my parents, and mostly hopeless. It’s this burning feeling that I can feel in my throat and my stomach, it’s just pure dread. No matter what I’m doing I just want to stay in my room and stew over bad memories. It hasn’t been this bad since 6th grade (I’m in 10th right now.) I’ve been caught up in a lot of bad feelings and problems these past few weeks, and it’s ruining my life. For this whole week, I’ve been thinking of suicide, and it only hangs over my head more and more every single day.This cocktail got the better of me yesterday, and I tried to take my own life. Luckily, I didn’t go through with it, and I ended up calling a lifeline and speaking to someone for a while. Even after this, though, I still feel so fucked up. My brain isn’t working right. I’m still feeling these horrible feelings and if it weren’t for some things getting in the way I feel I might attempt again. I just want to live. I want to get out of this house and have something to live for. I used to have fantasies about being an adult that made me hopeful but now they make me feel even more depressed. I don’t know what to do anymore."
1262,Suicide?,"I don't expect anything anymore. Everything is predictable. So I deciding to do something I hadn't thought of. I know I should do something but I no longer see reason to. I don't care if I was just some little news to someone like ""he's gone"". How do I know I truly matter to someone other than resorting to their words for confirmation? I see no actions that prove anything. I only see distance."
1263,Two close friends died... I don’t feel anything.,"I had two close friends die in the last month. Unrelated incidents. I haven’t felt much if any emotion over it and I don’t know what is wrong with me. 
I feel like a psychopath. These deaths are something that others in my circle have felt strong emotions over. I am a little sad, but I usually am a little sad all the time anyway. Deaths just don’t seem to effect me. Thinking back, they never really have. 
Should I go to see someone? I don’t know what I would talk about. Lack of emotions? I have always been a listener, not a talker. I don’t think I would have much to say to a therapist. 
Something is wrong, but what is it? 

(This is my first time in this sub, I am on mobile and am not sure if I am breaking any rules. Apologies!)"
1264,comforting someone with school struggles,"can anyone tell me what i can say to someone who’s really struggling with school to the point of suicidal thoughts? or what you would want someone to tell you if you’ve been in that situation? i get so worried for my friend, who’s currently in online learning, and her teachers teach very fast and difficult subjects. im not in her grade but below hers so i can’t help academically and i feel like i don’t know how to be there for her. what can i say to her that i haven’t said already? sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, i didn’t know where exactly to post this"
1265,Have you ever lost your (bot literal but just as meaningful) family and the only place you've ever felt truly comfortable in the same day?,My mma gym has recently closed and I'm so lost. These people were family to me. And now they're gone. My parents are pressuring me to move on and just pick a new gym but I dont think I can do it. All the other gyms in my area feel like businesses while mine felt like home. I just.... was able to let my anxiety and depression and self hate and all my negativity disappear there. No one judged me. No one thought anything other then this kid is good I respect that... and I dont think I can reset that... I dont know... I just needed to vent... and ask for opinions. Sorry for wasting your time with my nonsense.
1266,Depression from injury?,"I broke my tibia (shin bone)in May. Well actually completely crushed it. It is taking a long to time heal and I have periods of such sadness because of it. I am doing everything physically that I should be doing, but I'm just so depressed internally about the state of it. I am a super active person and am still so limited on what I can do. Any suggestions to improve mental health?"
1267,Struggling with mental health in 1st year at uni,"Despite covid-19 making socialising at uni a lot more limited, there's still a fair amount of stuff going on, but I just don't have energy for anything. I have severe anorexia and have started treatment for it (therapy, meal plan, weekly health checks, starting medication, etc.) but I haven't made much progress yet. I just want to stay in my room and try to keep on top of my work so I don't have to drop out. I'm normally very extroverted, and have managed to make quite a few friends, but at this point the stress of treatment and work is making me want to be a hermit. How do I cope🤦🏻‍♀️"
1268,I want to go like this,[removed]
1269,My best friend told me that her boyfriend's music is so much better than mine.,It probably is. It was just a little jarring. I can't bring myself to make music anymore. It was the one thing that I felt good at. I put all my self worth in that and I'm just lost now. I don't know what to do.
1270,I don’t know what to call it but I don’t know how to help myself,I used to write all the time but I don’t anymore. I used to take medication but I don’t have health insurance anymore. They told me I had anxiety that triggered my depression. Sometimes life feels like a dream and no one understands what I’m talking about when I tell them this. I feel like I’m going through the motions and I know that I’m me but Sometimes it doesn’t feel quite real. Usually I either feel too much or nothing at all. I’m extremely insecure and I can’t stop the thoughts from rolling into my head about how disgusting &amp; worthless I am. When I’m sad I tell myself I deserve it and I should kill myself. I cry easily over small things for two seconds then I’m completely numb to them. I’m especially numb to big things that happen and it doesn’t hit me until months later when I’ve piled on the mistakes by then and there doesn’t feel like any going back. I don’t know how toxic I’m being and when others are being toxic to me. In my head it makes sense but then I have to double check and then I’m unsure how much I have fabricated to make myself feel right. When I’m around people I take on a whole new persona and I hear all the time how hard it is to get to know me. I sometimes feel like I morph myself into whoever I think someone might want me to be so appeal to them. I am scared of those closest to me being critical towards the things I enjoy or the things that make me me. After I do something I sit there for an hour wondering if I should have said what I said or did what I did or if I should’ve done it differently or if the other person hates me for the way I said hello. I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore but I feel like I’m noticing new things about myself every day that make me more and more concerned. I wanted to vent I guess. No one needs to reply. I just needed to let it out.
1271,My medications made things worse,"On my medications I couldn't feel positive emotions. Couldn't really feel negative feelings either I guess, but I just felt a deep numbness and was punctured with moments of darkness.

I stopped taking my antidepressant about 2 weeks ago and I can feel again. I told my therapist last night and described it as yeah, I fall to a lot darker of a place off the meds, but at least I can occasionally feel happiness. I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist on Monday and I'm hoping she's understanding and that maybe she has an idea of a way to get rid of the dark without erasing the light.

I know that antidepressants aren't supposed to necessarily make you happy, but what the fuck, they shouldn't make me less happy, right?"
1272,Am I overreacting?,Ok so I’ve been working at this job for about a year and a bit. And my supervisors and manager all dislike me and treat me like shit. I’m barely getting any hours as of rn and even working only one day of the week makes me feel completely horrible and ruins my entire week. And the only reason I stay at this job is because I don’t have my license and my mom works w me so she drives me to and from work. It’s convenient. My mom doesn’t seem to understand that I absolutely hate where I work and won’t let me call in sick days or go on stress leave because I can’t deal with it. Am I overreacting? Or what should I do?
1273,Been trying to make myself less self conscious,"I guess I just need to get this out of my head.

I've been really self conscious about my abdomen. I have a great figure I suppose, but most of the time, I feel shitty, bloated, or bigger than I normally am. And when my head gets all paranoid like this, it makes me feel even worse about everything. So I've been getting back into running a lot more, not eating too much, and I ordered something to wrap around my stomach area to help my form a bit more, I forgot what they're called. I'm proud of myself for running several miles for a few days in a row. I hope I can keep it up even with the weather getting colder.

I'm just tired of always being paranoid about how much I eat or how my stomach extends a little after eating anything, and just all the things that's wrong with my head in general. I used to just not care and eat whatever and whenever I felt like. I was never overweight or anything tho. My mental state has just changed so much...and whenever my stomach extends the slightest, my ridiculous paranoia and fear of pregnancy flares up. I don't have sex, I only have sexual contact AND I'm on the pill. So it's basically impossible but no matter how much I present my head with the facts, my body still has the capability to get pregnant and that's wat I hate and fear most about it. My paranoia seems to believe I'll somehow get pregnant anyways. And that by far, makes me even MORE anxious and stressed to the point where I'll feel a bit nauseous or feeling some signs of a panic attack.

I'm pretty sure I'll feel a lot better once I get news on the jobs I've applied for so I can work at a better place with better pay and once I'm able to move out of this hellhole im at now. I cant wait to have my own space, my own things organized the way I want, be able to go to the art school of my dreams, and me just chilling on an actual bed of my own with my bf eating some pizza while watching a movie in our underwear. Ahhhhhh, that's my happy place. Every day I think about it and one day, itll be mine."
1274,College Slump + Mental Health,"I'm a sophomore in undergrad in university . I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

My university in particular cut the semester by a month, making us work without breaks online. Many teachers have handled the change well, others have not.

I feel worthless because I can not handle such a weird semester.

I have this habit of putting my current self in the future. For example, putting my sophomore knowledge in a job interview out of grad school in the future.
This constant thought has me thinking that I will get no where in life because I'm awful at my major (the only thing I can relatively do and I do below average) when comparing it to grad students and the like.

This makes me just not want to do work, and not wanting to do work makes me feel worthless- the cycle continues. Panic attacks happen daily. Suicidal thoughts happen.


I was taking meds before but stopped a few months ago. I started them again yesterday.

Talking to friends or family doesn't help- they get tired of my constant panic and crying and don't understand it's something that is hard for me to control.


I guess I'm asking:
how do I survive? how do I stop this cycle of thinking? how can I feel better about where I am at in life?"
1275,What I just wrote out as a journal. Thought I might put it here for a bit of help or something idk,"Okay, so I don't feel alive. What does that evwn mean? What I feel is apathy as I watch someone else live a life. Through the routines and monotony and the fun activities. But while ""I"" can enjoy or be frustrated by thoae things on the surface, it doesn't feel meaningful. I was about to text my friend about it, but... the last few times I've texted her have just been to vent or get some help. I shouldn't ""use her"" like that. She's not just a resource I can tap in to She's a human with feelings and ambitions, and there I would be, wasting her time. This is somewhat similar to me texting another friend of mine. I feel like a silent observer riding within the shell if what was once a human. I am technically ""in control,"" but what does that even mean? Am I not being present enough, or am I somehow so present that I've ascended above or separated from myself? I can't tell what to do to ""help"" would becoming more in my own body be better or worse? Speaking of my body, it kinda looks and feels like crap. I try to treat it well, but sometimes I watch as an obsever as I destroy it more and more. And why is it important for my body to look nice? I guess for others sake? Or my own confidence? Who knows, but maybe I just tough ""it"" (whatever it is) out and hope I feel normal soon. Or do I communicate with friends? Likely making their life worse and mine the same or a bit better. That isn't worth it. Just heard a voice calling my name which is never good. I am low on sleep, but idk. I just feel so, so, wrong, so unsatisfactory, I'm doing and working on most things that I could be but it isn't enough. I'm not good enough, leaving all to be had an endless treadmill of attempting to gain, succeeding only to fail. Watching myself go through the same cycle over and over."
1276,"need help finding the root of my hypictritcal and kinda messed up and in my opinion dangerous opinion,i dont think im mentally stable in this area,but i just cant see a reason against it","So cards on the table,i hate the mentally dissabled,but weirdly only some versions of it if that makes sense,its been a thing sense i was younge that i never had a good outlit on those with mental dissabilities tho weirdly its specific kinds,i remember tons of times in school where i felt either angered or just dissturbed by mental dissabled poeple,like how some mentally dissabled poeple cant help with staying still or repeat things or do certain things out of there controll,i never liked them,they annoyed me to no end and i hated them,tho to be fair i never met alot of mentally dissabled poeple so its probly cuz im not used to them,but then there are the ones that i fucking hate,my dad has dated 2 mentally dissabled poeple at this point,the first one was mentally abusive and eventually we got rid of her when i called the cops on her,then there is my dads gf that he has now who isnt as mentally dissabled but its still obvoius,she does nothing but judge me,not too harshly just judges how i do certain things,she treats me like im her younger brother or somthing,she wont stop acting mothery if that makes sense,cleaning my room,cleaning my clothes or cleaning my stuff,she wont stop no matter what the hell you say to her,she also hates video games and movies and likes to make her opinions known wich i hate with a passion sense it seems to be a aim at my life style,but my hate doesnt just go with personal experiences,in my opinion i dont think the goverment should give money to familys with mentally dissabled poeple,mostly the ones who cant fucntion at all like speak or think sense it just wasts money,tho there are mentally dissabled poeple who im ok with like my cousin who is worse than i am and anyone with mental dissorders like depression or skizophrenia and stuff cuz those are genetics,i think if i had to guess is that my dissorders,and mental dissablitlies clash with others wich make it hard for me to fucntion around them,i was dingnosed with mild autism,depression,ocd,possible bi polar depression (wich i just learned about recently) and skizophrenia and enxiety,my mental dissorders wernt apparent till later in life but ive always hated other mental dissabled poeple all my life but poeple with mental dissorders like depression or enxiety seem to be ok with me,is there anyway i could find the root of this problem,i dont like thinking like this sense its hyicrital and i hate being hypocritcal but i just cant help myself,like im sure some mentaly dissabeld poeple cant love you back cuz there minds are so messed up and i dont think poeple should wast there time with them if they cant offer anything to society,im a horrible person but i cant help the way i think so i want to finger out why i think this why"
1277,I just need to talk about it,"This is just a vent post. I just need to get all my bs out there to help me cope with it. I'm not looking for any advice right now just looking for someone to listen at least. Some of the shit i talk about I guess are sensitive topics so just ignore if you don't wanna read that. Its also a lot of reading so i guess just skip this.

I'm just extremely tired. It feels like everything in my life to have ever gone wrong has. I didn't have a good upbringing or anyone to ever talk to about my issues. I was never listened to ever. Everyone I've cared about has broken my trust some way or another and its hard to talk to anyone I know so internet strangers it is.

When I was a baby my parents got a divorce because my father would physically and verbally abuse my mom but even though that all that happened my mom still thought it was a fantastic idea to keep my sibling and I still with him every other weekend. Honestly I loved my dad for a while and had great memories with him every now and then but he would get mad at me if I missed one phone call and would yell at me telling me how much of a horrible daughter I was and what kind of person could do that to their dad which made me avoid calling him more because talking to him had become scary at that point. He would call my mom all sorts of shit over the phone if I missed school because of an injury or being sick. He never cared about my well being. When I came to his house him and my step mom would make comments about how fat I was and that I was gross and made comments about my mom. My dad even sent police to our house constantly to drug search our house. My mom never did drugs he just wanted to inconvenience her and have them search the house. It got so frequent the police had to give him warnings to stop wasting their time. He even had his friends stalk us. We found out because he was able to somehow figure out exactly what we were doing constantly. Him and my aunts and uncles lied about awful things my grandma and grandpa did and even admitted later they were all lies. I forgave him for that until he lied about my step mother and later admitted he only said it because he got mad. As much as I have issues with my step mother she did not deserve the way he treated her. I stopped talking to him but since then he has called and harassed family members and even my friends and my ex. He is absolutely insane and has made threats and since he is a gun owner it makes me scared that he'd come visit. My family recently got a couple of guns in case he does. It is really really painful that I even have to get a gun for protection against my own dad who is supposed to be there for me and someone I am supposed to look up to and fucking walk me down the damn isle when I get married and the person to watch my kids and spoil them even though I told him not to just things a father is supposed to be like for their daughters. It really really hurts that he isn't there because we did have our good memories and the rare moments he was actually a good father. As much of an asshole he was I miss him.

My step dad was the only person to be there for me in my entire life he actually was there for me. He was more of a dad to me than my real dad was. He helped me get through such difficult times. When I tried to kill myself in 9th grade he was there for me. He got me through some shit. Then the only father figure did absolute bullshit to when we found out he was cheating on my mother and he had zero remorse for what he did at all. That hurt me because he was the only person I really really trusted and then he completely proven himself to be untrustworthy. I have no dad neither him nor my real dad and I fucking hate it.

When I was 4 I was molested by a group of older kids from my school. They made me think it was a game when they did the shit they did to me. I thought it was my fault for the longest time because I let it happen. I have never told anyone I know. I've never gotten justice for what happened. No way to prove it anyway its been too long and I don't want to bring that shit back up in my life. I don't want to have to deal with that. I just want to forget about it and hope that they are as haunted by it as I am.

I have health issues that when I was a kid my mom never took me to the doctor for because she thought I was faking or being dramatic about my issues. I've grown up with horrible pains. I missed a lot of school because I was in too much pain to go. Its difficult to even do things as simple as reaching up on a shelf because of the pain I have in my spine. My back goes cold and numb because of the pain. I've begged my mom to go and you know what she said? Oh you just need a backrub. No mom if my entire god damn back is going numb and I cant reach there is kind of a problem! She never acted like she cared either.

Those are just the major bs things going on in my life. I just needed to talk about it cuz I don't have anyone I know who I can talk about it. I just want someone to finally listen to me because all I have ever gotten was completely ignored or told I was being too dramatic and any time I ever tried to talk about my feelings all I ever got was them arguing back. I'm really really tired and life is seriously getting to me. I feel trapped tbh. I just don't know what to do cuz everything fails."
1278,I'm getting better,I found that after I posted about wanting to end it all that God is here and he put me in a spot yo work on myself it took awhile but im re realizing that life is good and anybofy dealing with depression while tougher for some than others there always hope please find it
1279,"Patients with psychiatric symptoms who received care in the emergency department (ED) were discharged home, rather than transferred to a psychiatric facility, more often when the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program was available, according to a study published online in",https://telemind.com/blog/uncategorized/telepsychiatry-lowers-rate-of-hospital-admissions
1280,What will it be like when I go completely crazy?,"I've always heard voices and had strong feelings compelling to do things even though I didn't want to, like there was someone else in my body who also had a degree of control. I've always had delusions, but lately, thee have been getting stronger, and I've been doing what the voices tell me to do more and more as I feel my sanity slip away.

Sometimes I'm lucid, like now, but more and more I'm becoming far less lucid. I'm wondering, what will happen to me when I go completely crazy? What can I expect?"
1281,Struggling with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria,"[I found about this new disorder yesterday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/friendship-20/201907/what-is-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria?fbclid=IwAR11gcGuuucX2WYldK0ZRCRN6uz2NILvaWgT3wLwBlY2UANd7WCKbfEVJnE). It was really satisfying to finally have a label for what I suffer from constantly. My fear of rejection is hardly irrational, however. the past few years almost all of my closest friends and family have blocked on everything and cut me out of their lives. I have a neurodivergent brain, which makes me bad at communication with nuerotypical people often.

I wouldn't wish the physical pain and rage hormones social rejection causes me, even years after the rejection occurs. I can feel the stress hormones pump throughout my body, and am helpless to stop the destruction the wreak. The pain I feel deep in my chest and the pit of my stomach wants me to puke. I am totally powerless. Most of the time, I have had no closure for any of these rejections, which makes it endlessly worse. And yes, it CONSTANTLY interrupts my productivity and day.

People hear this and think I must just be a combative person but that isn't the case at all. I am a very open-minded and positive person, I hate to offend people, but what gets me in trouble is defending the vulnerable, the misunderstood, the silenced, and the broken. I try to get people to empathize with those they disagree with, and they think I am defending the point of view, when I am actually defending the human being.

The other thing that gets me into trouble is that I am schizoaffective. I might have said something strange to someone while having a psychotic break, which leads them to cutting contact with me as well. This has happened with people on all sides of the political spectrum. 

There is this new idea that we should label a great deal of people ""toxic"" and banish them from society. I had no idea it would have gotten so out of control or I wouldn't have tried to stop it, and be cast out with the rest of them. I didn't realize it was going to be so hopeless so fast. If I would have known I would have tried to help those struggling with ""wrong think"" ideas in private, instead of trying to help them in public."
1282,I had a good day,"I’ve never posted here before but I felt compelled to tonight. I’ve been reading for awhile. I woke up today. I completed a full day of work. I supported my team. I took a nap during my lunch break because I needed it.  I prepared a relatively healthy dinner. It may sound small, but I’m happy with what I accomplished today."
1283,Thought I was having a heart attack.,"I've been having chronic but mild hypertension I've been trying to lower, so that's been in the back of my mind. 
This election has me not sleeping well. My partner has been stressed with family stuff, which stresses me out. I'm unemployed and trying to get my roots in a new state. 

I was laying down, felt a flutter and a punch in my chest on the left side. I get chest flutters, but not normally with pain. I check my BP and it was 128 over 99. 
Panic. 
We're not sure if I need to call an ambulance. My SO's grandfather assured that I'm likely stressed. I take my BP again and it was 140 over 106. I take an asprin and call a hotline. 
Covid isn't big here, but I don't want to go into the ER unless I'm dying. I have no insurance and JUST got out of medical debt. 
I kept getting chest pains off and on, ocassional  heart beat up my neck, but nothing that screams heart attack, like sweats and flu-like symptoms.  
After talking to the nurse, she recommends I see a doc in three days. Probably a panic attack. 
I grew up with low empathy parents and as a result, I don't let myself feel emotions. I can recognize I'm stressed by my trembling, but I don't feel it. Guess, I'm not as stable as I think I am. It's hard to face these emotions because my instinct is to push them back down. I guess that I'm a mess."
1284,IDEFK,"I feel so hopeless and stuck in the same cycle I've been in since I was a preteen. I can't do anything, I don't properly take care of myself

All I have been doing was staying in bed and playing games or just being on my phone. That's all I do. 
Yeah, sometimes I'll get up to cook cause I have to, for my brother's. 
When I know shit needs to be done, I pretend to ignore it until I actually forget then it just goes by. I feel bad about this cause I have no idea how much time I've wasted for counsellors and doctors when they could have seen other patients. I didn't even finish highschool and I had this one teacher who didn't give up on me until my 18th birthday, he couldn't help me anymore cause 18 was the cut off for that program but he gave me good recommendations for other programs I could go to but I never went. 

My mother is always on me about bettering myself and I hear her, her words always bounce around in my bed. She says them in the wrong way or tone but I know she just wants me to fUCKING DO SOMETHING.

 I always try to tell myself  ""go on, get up and do (this). It's easy, just 
1. get up.
 2, freshen up
3. Get dressed
4. Go out to (place)

But it's like I don't listen to myself. I hear myself but I just push those words out and I'm just laying here. I want to live my life before I get too old and have regrets. I want to change but it's like I convince myself that I don't have the will or fucking desire to change.

Like right now. I have this dresser in my room, in the corner, standing upward.

All I need to do is move these containers out of the way so I can set my dresser down then start putting my clothes away but I feel so overwhelmed by it cause there is a lot more shit stored away in here.

Am I just lazy. Am I just feeling sorry for myself. Is there something actually wrong with me.. who fucking knows, a doctor would but I wasted their time booking an appointment then not going.
A therapist would know but the ones I'm recommended, won't take my calls cause I booked too many times and didn't show. 

I know a lot of bad is happening right now, I know people have it more worse than I do

But I just want this to end. I want to be here but I don't want to be here.

I feel bad for even being here and doing nothing cause my uncle died like 4 years ago. He was like my brother and he was actually recovering from shit he's been through until he was murdered. 
My aunt's baby died last month and she wasn't even a year old. 
A dude a year younger than me was killed in a hit n run in my hometown, had a lot going for him. 

I feel bad for being here
I feel bad for even thinking of not wanting to be here..

Idk what to fucking do with myself. Even if I did, I'd probably subconsciously convince myself that it isn't it at the same time while I try to convince myself that it is it"

1286,First post,"Hello R/mentalhealth I just wanted to know: When did you suspect you have autism? I’d like to hear others post’s but I have been suspecting I am on the spectrum for the last 2-3 years but idk who to go to for answers. I remember my parents had me in a speech therapist when I was 5 or so but I really can’t remember details. Or any details of my childhood for that matter. I never assigned emotional significance to anything. My mom always tells a story of how when I was 4 she told my brother and I that we were going to Disney and that I responded sadly with “it’s gonna take long to get there”. I feel like my parents would have told me by now if I had been diagnosed but I have such a hard time forming bonds with anyone, even family members. I got a cat last year at 20 and I have never loved a single human being as much as her. Even my mother or grandmother. I feel horrible saying it but the older I get the more things add up. I hate making eye contact with anyone even family members. I form emotional bonds with animals much quicker than humans. Up until about a year ago I didn’t know much about autism or sociopathy, but the more research I do I see so many similarities with myself, and I’d like get to the bottom of if I was born with one or the other. Does anyone on this sub know of a cheap therapist I could visit?  I have a hard time creating emotional bonds with anyone even family, I’d like to get to the bottom of this. Sorry for the long post."
1287,How do you open up to someone?,"I have things I want to talk about but I struggle with actually saying them or getting my point across in a clear manner. The real reason being that I just have a hard time opening up and actually saying the problems that bother me, especially if they’re personal. Like, therapists are people who I barely know, even with a few meetings it’s not like I know much about them and I’m just supposed to say my life story? How do I bring out the truth?"
1288,Thank you for changing my perspective,"I booked a condo, top floor with a balcony.

I had a bottle of whisky.

I cried for hours, hours and hours. 

I was this close to sending personal notes to a few people while also posting a general note on social media indicating my years of suicidal thoughts which lead to me jumping off the balcony.

I thought about my Mom, my Dad, my younger siblings, my friends, colleagues, etc 

Though at the same time, having countless strangers messaging me had truly sparked my decision to stay alive. 

Yeah I know this sounds corny, but the fact that a group of strangers were able to respond to me on a topic that I could never share with anyone in real life.. really helped push me to stay alive. 

Made me realize the world isn’t as horrible as I’ve painted it out to be. 

Thank you to all of you.

From this point on, I’ve decided to make some serious life changes.

I’m gonna quit my full time job, focus on my studies, do a part time job in the mean time to cover my expenses (maybe food delivery) 

I’m also gonna take this time to focus on ways to improve my coping methods for stress, my diet, my sleep pattern, and even explore some potential self-employment opportunities. 

I’m going to finally stop worrying about others, and take this time, after 25 long years, to worry about my own happiness and well-being. 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. 

You gave me a reason to fight another day."
1289,How do you know if you have Sociopathy/Autisim,"I wasn’t sure where to post so I came here. I think I am suffering from one or the other and I’m scared. I have very few memories from when I was young. I’m 22 now and adopted a cat last year. I love her more than any of my family members as hard as that is to say. As I’ve aged I have increasing noticed how hard it is for me to look anyone, including family in the eye and how it is even more difficult to initiaite a conversation with anyone. What I want to know is: can anyone suggest a cheap therapist to visit? I’m 22 and just joining the workforce. I have 1 friend that I contact frequently and feel that this is abnormal. I’ve had suspicions for a few years and I’d like some answers."
1290,Feeling Depressed. Any tips to work on feeling better?,"Hi, I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past. I’ve been on antidepressants and I’ve been to therapy. I worked really hard to get to a point where I no longer needed either, and I am really proud of myself.
As of the beginning of this week, I’ve been feeling my depressed feelings return. I feel disconnected from my friends from high school (I graduated with class of 2020 and I’ve come to terms with the fact that it’s probably the end of our bonds as I knew it, because it feels pointless to try to maintain it. Believe me, I’ve tried. It doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere). This week I found myself missing what I had, and the things I didn’t get to have like a proper prom or grad night or graduation. 
I have my new friends and acquaintances, but it’s not as well established as the people I knew in high school. I’ve just been feeling a general lack of energy and drive to accomplish. It feels like how I first felt when I first noticed myself becoming depressed, and I really don’t wanna spiral off into how bad it got for me last time. It feels like I’m at a stand still, and I remind myself that I’m doing well with college work, and that’s enough, and it helps for a bit but not in the long run.
I’m making efforts to remain connected with my parents and the friends I do have, but still the depressed feelings haven’t completely vanished. And I do openly discuss them with my parents, but if anyone has any advice I’m all ears."
1291,My mother keeps telling me she expects me to care for her in the future,"I'm in my early twenties. I didn't finish college because I sunk into a deep depression and lost all my motivation for doing anything. I had suicidal thoughts night and day, I almost never went to class or did any of my coursework. I just stayed in bed and slept or cried all day and barely ate. I'm going to go back eventually, I want to finish my degree. But I need to go to therapy or something first before I do, because I know otherwise I'll just sink back into that depression. I'm still not out of it. It's just not as terrible as it was before.

Then here's my mother telling me how she expects me to care for her. No time frame, no ""when I'm old"", just a vague description of ""the future"". ""You have to take care of me in the future. I don't know how to cook, so you have to learn to cook for me. I don't make a lot of money, so you have to make a lot of money and provide for me financially. You have to buy a house big enough so I can live with you."" I can't deal with it. It's so much fucking pressure.

She's unhealthy. Obese with progressively worsening diabetes, and she doesn't do anything to care for her health. Whatever money she earns that remains after paying for necessities, she squanders on things she doesn't need. I don't mean the occasional splurge. Whatever her friends recommend to her, she buys. Whatever ad she sees on the internet, she buys. Whatever snake oil she sees, she falls for and buys, no matter how much I tell her she shouldn't. She's constantly eating out with friends when we cook food at home. And just today, she told me I have to start giving her a portion of whatever money I earn from work because she doesn't have enough.

I don't have a lot of money. I have barely held any jobs over the years, and now I'm not even technically hired at the place I work. They call me in whenever they need extra help, and it's usually just one or two days a week, every few weeks. I get maybe three days' worth of pay max in a single pay period, but it's usually just one day's work, which is about $120. The only reason I'm not out on the streets is because I live with my family. And my mother just told me she wants me to give her about $100 every time I'm paid. I told her that's almost all the money I typically make, and her response was, ""Fine, give me $50."" What about my savings account, I ask? I have just over $3k. ""Put in less,"" she answers.

It's so much pressure. I can't just say no. I can't just say I can't provide for her in the future. I can't tell her there's no guarantee. Every time she gives me that same speech about having to care for her ""in the future"", I break down, because I know I won't be able to do it, but she completely expects me to. My friends have parents who encourage them to become their own individuals, but I feel like my mother just wants me to become her mother. I'm not even back in college yet with a plan for my own future. There's just so much pressure, and it's just gotten progressively worse and worse over the years because of my mother's lack of care of her own health, because she fully expects me to take care of her in the future no matter what. I don't know what the fuck to do, and there's no one that can help me."
1292,What is your experience with antidepressants? (Asking for a friend: myself),"Hey all, I’m looking for advice. And your experiences. 

I’ve been depressed (probably) since I was six, and I’m now twenty. I am sad a lot of the time, about a lot of things. A lot has happened in my life recently (my dad died, I got married, I moved, I went to school, I quit a job, now I’m working two, I got a cat and a snake, all within a few months), and now I’m wondering if I should take antidepressants. 

I’ve always been against taking drugs, I didn’t want to change who I was or how I thought. I heard a lot of people who take drugs (antidepressants/antianxiety) just stop feeling, or it changes how they perceive life (for the worse), or they become worse, etc. I don’t want that to happen to me. 

Here’re some of my symptoms, I guess, I’m case any doctors out there see this, I’m always tired, even with exercise. I’m often sad, I keep waiting for life to be not so difficult, so I can be happy again, and I still feel sad. I feel dizzy whenever I stand up, like I can’t breath good, and I’m always afraid of passing out, like a pressure in my head. I’m not suicidal, currently, but I have been a lot recently, and right now I want to hurt myself (I’ll be safe, I promise). I have no energy to do anything, and I’m afraid if I do, I’ll fall over/pass out. I lose my train of thought all the time. I eat well, and enough, sometimes too much, but I get all my nutrients and calories in, and I drink enough water.  

So, fellow redditors, what has been your experience with antidepressants?"
1293,Caught up,"I paid ALL of my bills today. Gas, electric, water, car payment, rent, WiFi. EVERYTHING.

I haven’t been paid up to date like this in years. I FEEL GREAT."
1294,Insert cliche 2020 is the worst joke here,"Mostly a rant but if anyone's interested post how 2020 has been for you. 

I've lived a very fortunate life I've never lost anybody before 2020. 

I began the new year by grazing a car while parking. I had such driving anxiety that my car would always need a new battery because I never drove it. I grocery shopped using my bike's basket. 

I nailed a job interview and began trying to socialize after being tired of living alone for a year at my new college.

I lost my grandpa a month later. He wasn't that involved in my life but I loved him and we used to go fishing and he'd watch me try to catch lizards. He was so quiet, but he was there. We still haven't had a funeral. 

Why? Because my grandma also got dementia. She was so isolated and scared when they found her she was eating molded food. She also thought my dad was plotting to kill her. We got her help, but I don't think I can forgive myself for how long it took us to find all this out.

I decided to try the counseling at this new college but they immediately asked me what goals I wanted to work on after telling them my fucking grandpa died. I just wanted someone to talk to like the counselor at my old community college. After my grief was sidelined I was told I could schedule another appointment. I scheduled it but decided I didn't want them. It was more of a bureaucratic institution than anything resembling counseling. 

Then the pandemic happened. Why pay for rent I can barely afford just to be near a college I can't even properly attend? Bye new job, new club, new fresh start. I moved back with my mom. She's a great parent, but I'm 21 and haven't even been out on a date. Now I'm forced back into this situation numbing myself with pot, video games, podcasts, and booze. But hey I'm still functional going to work and passing my classes. 

I visited my grandma she was so much better now that she lived at my dad's. Spending time with my babysitter even walking the neighbors dog because she hates not working. Even though they are always at each other's throats. Now he bought a house and left his mom alone again. Oh and did I mention today I found out she has uterine cancer? 

So besides cancer surgery I still have to worry about her living alone. My moms side of the family says I'm obligated to help her, but since it's not their side of the family they feel like it's not their place to get directly involved. The other side wants me to shut up and stay out of it. Worried I'll interfere in the legality of whose house is whose. 

I'm genuinely worried my dad will just let her end up on the street or poisoning herself with rancid food just because he had a bad relationship with her. Fine I wasn't there for your childhoof, I get that I don't get it, but whatever it is he's doing it isn't closure! I have a bad relationship with him before all this shit happened. But I'd never leave him alone in such a state. She was there for me a hell of a lot more than he was. 

I just want the suffering to stop. I can't help anyone. I can't help myself. I never wanted to be born. No matter what I do people I care about will be hurt. No matter how hard I try I'm not even close to being who people need me to be. 

I'm sorry to the two people who had to read me screaming at the universe. Share how your 2020 is? It'd be nice to know I'm not the only one feeling overwhelmed by everything."

1297,How should I budget for my mental health,"My outlook on life is nothing too bad has happened to me that I can't come back from however I still feel my mental health is poor at times. Neatly the more time or thought I spend on my mental state the poorer it becomes

What does that mean? Should I be worried about that? What plans should I make for my mental health given that?

1299,"Were any of you diagnosed with ADHD as an adult? If so, what was your experience?","(Sorry for the mobile formatting)

A little background - I’ve (23F) been dealing with depression for ~10 years now. I’ve always considered my inability to focus as a symptom of depression, but recently, I learned that ADHD may lead to depression. I never considered that I may have ADHD because of the stereotypes associated with it (i.e. poor academic performance, hyperactivity, etc.). However, after doing some research online, I found that I display almost all of the symptoms for the inattentive type of the disorder. 

I was wondering if any of you have been diagnosed as an adult with ADHD. I’ve heard diagnosis for this disorder can be challenging, especially as an adult. I’d love to hear your experiences, if you feel comfortable sharing, and any advice on how to approach this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
1300,The three reasons I’m still alive and getting better,"I don’t know if this is the right place but I wanted to say this somewhere. 

Background: I’ve had depression for years, but it got really bad recently when I started cutting myself, which ended in a suicide attempt. With therapy and meds I have a better(ish) outlook on life and I realize now I’m not as lonely as I thought I was

First and foremost my amazing girlfriend - her family is constantly busy and really poor so she basically lives at my place and will cuddle with and hold me whenever I need to cry. She always knows how to make me feel better, and is the only person that could convince me to eat a burger so I don’t starve. She’s incredibly smart and understands all my references and I love her wholeheartedly. Trying not to make her cry is the biggest reason I’m making an effort in life again. I love you Ames

My friend - all wonderful, amazing people that like the same things I like and are hilarious. They’ll hang out with me and play DnD to let me escape into someone else without any of my problems. They make me food and come to all of my performances. I love you, you bunch of fuckheads.

Critical Roles - Easily my 8 favorite celebrities. I’ve been furiously trying to catch up and I’m almost there. I’ve contributed thousands of dollars to them and the charities thy support, and they’ve taught me how to be a better DM/player, a better storyteller, and a better person. Thank you Critical Role

No idea why writing this made me cry but I’m sobbing now

1301,"I cant stop shrugging my shoulder in an attempt to ""pop"" it","Hi. Just looking for some advice on what's going on here and perhaps how to stop it.

I jerk my shoulder upwards about every 1 - 5 seconds in an attempt to pop it. Its nonstop. I even accidentally ""punch"" my wife in the face when we hug/cuddle with my shoulder shrug. 

Sometimes my wife will remind me to take a break from ""the shoulder."" If I really try, I instantly shift to disjointing my jaw, in an attempt to crack that. I'm quick to shift back to the shoulder after a bit of jaw-pop-time though. 

What's going on here? The only time this isnt happening is when I'm SUPER sucked into something else, like sex or eating something I really like. I do crack my shoulder the second sex is done, though. 

Thanks for anything you have to share!"
1302,Can't believe I ended up like this!,"I am 24(M), I had been depressed all my teenage, Until I got on lexapro which changed my life, I grown strong, confident became best version of myself while I am on them. Until I tapper off them thinking i don't need them anymore, I will be fine, that later I learned is the worst decision I ever made. I am doomed now I relapsed so hard I am having panic attacks, worst anxiety and depression, I have ever experienced. I am having constant suicidal thoughts. I back on meds, It is not working for me anymore. I think this is the end my fckng story..cant deal with this mental illness anymore."
1303,How do I assess my mental health,The longer I dwell on my mental health the worse it seems to be. I wonder is it because my mental health is bad and I should be doing something? Doing things always makes feel better but is that improving my mental health or just distracting from constantly poor mental health? What are some objective ways to assess mental health? How do I tell how good my mental health really is?
1304,I'm a bad friend,"I want to be a good friend. But how can I be if I can't even communicate with them!

I've been feeling terrible . The guilt from not talking to them, plus the anxiety of thinking they hate me, Its gotten to the point where every time my phone goes of I panic. 

If I do respond it's normally 3 word answers at best. I haven't been able to hold a conversation with them in a while. 

I know they hate me, they have to by now. But if they do hate me why do they still keep me around? I'm useless to them, I'm Not even good for entertainment!!!

But they STILL keep me around. 

Out of a of 5+ other people my friend could have asked to help him. He asked me and two others. I don't understand, why. When he added me to that planning gc, I didn't even express interest in his project. I just responded to what time I was free. I'm so conceited and rude, I should have told him how cool his project sounded and that I was great ful he wanted to included me in it. Everyone else was able to, but why couldn't I? Why can't I just talk to them, express how I feel.

So now I'm going to see them on Sunday, but I don't even know if I can handle that. I know that I'm going to act distant and akward bc I have convinced myself they want nothing to do with me. I'll just bring down the whole mood and make them all uncomfortable. I'm a burden on them."
1305,Can anyone tell me what is wrong with me? Is this some kind of mental problem or am i crazy.,"I came on here looking to see if there are others like me and maybe some help, but i don't think i have it as bad or do I (im not really sure) i would get the violent urge to smash my head into a wall and if i don't think about how much it would hurt im pretty sure i would, i would be walking alone in my house and just feel the need to drop to the ground and start growling. Wanting to hit stuff and the sexual urges are far worse (thank god for hentai or i might have been arrested its that bad or at the edge of sanity, which i probably am). Like i feel like i am insane and actively thinking about it is making it worse. I've always had these urges since i was younger (I'm a teen)  but they haven't been this bad if i don't think about the consequences i might end up doing it. While writing this i have full force punched myself at my temples at least 5 times.

P.S I am looking for other subs that could possibly help me, would go to a therapist but i can't."
1306,"TW: suicide | i know i’m not going to, but i can’t stop thinking about wanting to end my life","I know i probably need therapy or to talk to someone but i don’t really have anyone to talk to and this is just the only outlet i have i guess. After graduating in may i haven’t done anything to better myself. I don’t work, I haven’t applied to any jobs because i don’t feel like i’m ready, and I feel like i chose the wrong career path because i’m not that good at it. i haven’t taken classes or made anything. I’ve stayed home and actually quarantined as hard as i could since March because I’m immunocompromised and paranoid about COVID and giving it to my parents. I don’t like going outside or exercising, i’d rather just stay inside, and I just do the bare minimum of cooking and barely cleaning, and I just want to do nothing. I don’t want people to expect things from me, I usually end up disappointing them. I’m scared of real life, and don’t feel prepared, and I don’t want to put in the effort to make myself a better person. I don’t have that many friends, I don’t want to tell this stuff to the people around me. I’m lazy, i procrastinate, and i’ve always been this way, and I know if I want to stop feeling so shitty I need to start finding help and going to therapy, but I don’t want to. And I know that’s my fault, and because I don’t help myself, I can’t do anything to achieve the kind of life I would want for myself. So I’d rather just disappear, end things now. But I know the consequences, and what that would do to my family and the few friends i have. So now i’m just stuck here crying to myself and feeling pathetic. I just want to disappear without having it affect the people around me. I want to just give up. I imagined myself to become better as i grew older, but i just get worse and more nervous and sensitive and scared of everything and i don’t wanna go on, but i can’t kill myself.
i have no excuse for hating myself and my life so much. my life has been relatively good, so i’m just too weak to handle life. i know my parents and family and friends care about me, which is why i can’t just die, but i don’t want to disappoint and burden them with how lazy and useless i’ve become. they say it gets better but i really don’t want to put in the effort that goes into things getting better, and i don’t see that feeling changing in the future."
1307,self destruction avoidance,"Hi, I have never been here before but I can find absolutely no resources for this outside of parenting blogs and they don't really help. I [23F] am diagnosed with PTSD and depression and I have been handling it as well as anyone does.

I have recently developed a really harsh self destructive streak when I enter an episode now. I continually bash my head into the wall, kind of very very hard, as well as like ripping/scratching myself, hair pulling, etc. It's also passive things that end up doing harm, like refusing to acknowledge my surroundings to the point that I have a gash in the back of my head that wouldn't stop bleeding for over an hour from simply not caring there was a cabinet in the way or minor burns from the shower. 

I have tried looking for advice on how to prevent it or make things less harmful, mostly for the head bashing as it leaves me feeling extremely lightheaded/in pain and it makes my fiancée extremely worried and panicked as it's incredibly hard for them to stop me, but finding relevant information is difficult. I've thought about buying corner bumpers like people with epilepsy tend to put on walls/furniture and I've been using pain relief patches on my forehead, palms, and hands.

I really appreciate anything anyone has to say so very much."
1308,Is there any reason why I'm always mentally preparing for everything?,"It can be a video game I want to play which can take hours before I start playing (or not). It can also be a book I would like to read but I can't because I'm waiting too long for. And it's not like that I have to read these books for college for example, I personally want to. But most of the time it doesn't work..."
1309,How do I be supportive and not suffocating?,"Hi all, 

This account is a bit of a throwaway since my friends know my main username.

I am concerned and worried about my best friend of 15 years. He has BPD and seasonal depression, and currently can’t afford to see a doctor or have ant prescriptions. 

Lately he’s been more than his usual “seasonal depression” self, which I’ve witnessed for many years. 

My best friend is becoming distant toward everyone, even me, which is very strange because we are 2 of a kind and always enjoy eachother’s company even if he’s having a rough patch (albeit we’ve been hanging out in our discord server voice channel due to covid, plus he works in a hospital and so he takes extra precautions) and he’s become quiet and very easy to upset. 

He’s been having relationship troubles as well, and usually we talk about it and sometimes I give him advice or I’m just an open ear for when he needs to vent (and vice versa of course), but he’s just completely quiet. Not a comfortable kind of quiet either. I can tell something is wrong and when asked what’s on his mind he just keeps saying, “Same old shit.” Or “Nothing really.” But by the way he’s saying it, I know that’s not true. 

Yesterday we were playing overwatch and he _never_ gets upset while playing a game, even if one of us / both of us are bad at it, he’s the first one to shrug it off or make a joke out of it, but this time he screamed at me? I understood this might be misplaced frustration so I just replied with, “Oh okay, I’ll work on that then.” It was just.. not like him at all. 

As of lately I’ve told him I’m here if he wants to just vent or chill, and he says he appreciates it and usually takes me up on that, but this time he isn’t. I often find myself texting or calling him first whereas it was mutual before.

Something tells me there’s more bothering him, and I really just want to help but I don’t know how. I know he’s miserable with his job, the fact that he can’t get professional help, and the seasonal depression isn’t helping much either, but as best friends since middle school I **know** there’s something else. 

I don’t want to play detective or force anything out of him, as that’s not my place to do if he’s not comfortable or sure on what’s really going on, and even if there isn’t I don’t wanna keep pestering him about it.

So, how do I tell him or show him that I’m here for him and he’s not alone? What can I do to help?"

1312,Trying to convince my mom and her boyfriend to go see a psychiatrist... need advice.,"So my mom... is not a good mom. Shes a good friend, but not mom. Let's start off by saying that. She's a giant pushover and has made my life miserable due to her actions. She's also ill, physically ,and mentally.  When I was a preteen she and her boyfriend took me in and he abused the shit out of me for about 4 years straught to the point where  CPS got called (nothing happened though) and I still his voice yelling at me sometimes. She watched all of it happen and refued to stand up for me because she was afraid of losing him. In high school, she got us an apartment so that I didn't have to live with my abusive dad only to lose her job about a month in due to her being very ill (which she was aware of beforehand). I had to help pay rent cuz and missed about a total of 150 school days between my sophomore and senior year. Good intentions... bad planning. 

I am 20 now. I live with my fiance in our own apartment and we're talking about our future and having kids some day in a couple years after college. I got myself a full scholarship to one of the country's top 60 uni's within their honors college with a 3.8 GPA.  Im close to applying to medical school next year to become a pediatrician. I also work prt time CNA for my resume and a dasher on the side since its a very flexible job and doesn't interfere with school. Although Im working my butt off, especially in this pandemic, but my mother is really making my mental state worse every year. Two years ago I had to cut her off for two or three months because she told me that she would rather be with her boyfriend than have me (HER ONLY KID) in her life when I gave her an ultimatium. This was because he and his friend tried to beat me on a camping trip for sticking up FOR HER as they were yelling at her for moving a chair into the wrong place. But then she told my immediate family that if I didn't start talking to her again she will commit suicide. I basically got bombarded by everyone for being such a terrible daughter that I led my mom to that point. 

Now that I've got an apartment, my mother will call me at ood hours at the night because this dude is having an anger spaz; making me drive almost two hours to go get her, only for him to be like ""oh haha everything is cool now! I can go back"" I've been living here for three months and its happened TWICE and no doubt will happen again. Two nights ago she called me with this request and you can hear that her phone was broken, turns out he threw it at the wall (not the first time). 

It has been 11 years now. She refuses to leave this man, shes obviously VERY depressed. She is 42 years old and she's physically ill due to a muscle disorder which prevents her muscles from contracting correctly, thus altering her ability to walk, drive, etc. She's on gov. welfare from disability and basically gives this money to her man and since she can't drive, she just lives there as his borderline slave. If she doesn't make him breakfast at the correct time, he'll flip. So I kind of mean it when I say slave.  Other than her physical disability, shes an extremely beautiful woman with a big heart thats been damaged severely. She has A LOT of childhood truama she endured from just about everyone including losing her virginity to a gang r\*\*e at 13 in the Soviet Union. I know she needs help and probably medication so that she can at least regain some semblance of who she once was before all these abusive relationships came along. She has never in her life been with a man that didn't mistreat her and she's convinced that's all there is. 

Today she literally told me that she's planning on dying in a couple years so it is pointless to even try with her mental health, which is EXACTLY why she needs to try. Her physical problems aren't severe enough to kill her early unless she gets the medical attention she needs, but she's refusing it on purpose. I can see that she is indeed slowly dying and it's breaking my heart. She also smokes like a chimney and that doesn't help her medical issues. I know that the root of it all is her mental health. If she actually wanted to live she would go to the doctor so they can help her but she's so depressed she refuses to. I'm finding this very hard to cope with and I decided that I should tell her if she doesn't get help I'm cutting her off for good and if she tries to pull what she did last time, I'll make sure she gets put into a mental institution. I also feel like this will actually throw her off the edge.. I don't know what to do. 

My second part of the plan is somehow convincing her boyfriend to also go get help. I mean my mom is depressed but this man has textbook bipolar rage. Because when he's not having a total anger outburst, the man is actually a really sweet dude and I'll even admit it. But he will completely randomly switch on and off like as if he has two completely different personalities, yet he is still totally aware that he is him, then he calms down in an hour or two and begs for apologies. This has ruined his life beyond his relationships, but he can't even get a job in what he loves now. He was a fencing coach his whole life, and a VERY talented one. I would know because I was one of his students and at 11 years old I was completing nationally and won broze amongst children older than me. All his students, if they stuck with him, were basically guarenteed a full ride to an Ivy leage... I mean the dude is TALENTED. But... he just can't get anymore students and thus he gets fired from everywhere... because kids don't like being cursed and yelled at by a stranger whos supposed to be explaining a sport to them. He blows up when the smallest thing goes wrong and most parents didn't take kindly to that. He still does have very dedicated students whom are in all most all in Ivy Leagues on full sports scholarships and schedule lessons with him when they visit home. He just goes to them now. So he's stuck working as a shuttle driver 10 hours a day 6 days a week picking people up from the train station to bring them to work, then back. Obviously, he's even more pissed at life.   


I just know if the two of them got help their lives coulf turn around. I really do believe it, and in turn also take this stress off of me. My mom is the only parent remaining who loves me and I can talk to. My dad treats me almost like a stranger, I don't even have health insurance at the moment because he won't put me on his even though he should be. Im so sorry if this is long but someone please help me. I don't know what to do or how to go about this situation. It hurts so much."
1313,"Is this autism? If so, how did I not know until now?","I have this thing in my head and it does weird stuff that I’m pretty sure isn’t normal but have no way of knowing. I don’t have a therapist right now because I can’t afford one and I can’t safely explain myself whilst living through the apocalypse with my parents who sent me to conversion therapy as a teenager (wow I just realized I’m not a teen anymore). 

I am 21 years old trans male (2 years on hormones)

I am incredibly good at school. I am a science/math major. I love it. I love research. I don’t like the details of it putting it to pen, but I love the work and how everyone is a total nerd. I vibe in those environments.
I make weird eye contact. There are some people I can’t make eye contact with. My dad is one of them, where it physically hurts. Other people, I give too much eye contact to, like my pharmacist. She has warm eyes. I accidentally sound sarcastic sometimes and it bums me out. I would never be sarcastic about another person. I don’t like to hurt people. 

If I’m around people long enough I adapt, but since I isolated during the quarantine, I hadn’t seen another person in months. Now that I’m  back at the lab, I feel like I have to practice my social skills all over again. 
I am also sort of naive? the idea of sex and a relationship sound rad (sometimes) but I’m a virgin and get confused with all the rap up of flirting. Ive gotten good at catching sex jokes because my friend has been in relationships and jokes about sex, so Ive gotten better, but I can still miss a few. I am awful at dating and I don’t know how to casually flirt. I’ll just ask the other person if they like me. 

Other times I’d rather just not bother because I am really happy being alone. I think I’d like someone to be alone with, but if not that’s cool. I have a lot of hobbies, and when I’m in the mood, I can appear to be quite the charmer. I can strike up conversations with most strangers (even racist homophobes like me most times). Usually I’m on the outside looking in though.

I can’t concentrate when there’s too many things going on around me, like the TV, a water faucet and a conversation happening all at the same time. I have to stop one or two things. I can only process one, maybe two things at a time.

I’m posting this here because I don’t really fit in anywhere and I don’t know why.  I just want to know if I’m normal? Because I can’t relate to anyone I know and it makes me lonely.  It’s like, other people are out there living a human life and I’m sort of doing that but I’m also kind of just on my own wavelength, yknow? If it were autism, I feel like I would have known somehow prior? I’ve taken those self filled questionnaires, and I get marks of “possible aspergers” but I might be biased? This information I have you might be biased? Everything is biased?  Sorry for the rant. I just wish I had a better clue as to why I am the way I am."
1314,I hate being alone,If I’m alone I’ll find a way to not have to listen to my thoughts. I’ll constantly be watching or listening to videos which I fucking hate being on my phone so much . So if I have a boyfriend or friend I’ll try to fill up as much time as possible with them. I don’t want to be alone with myself. I know I could fix this with enough self discipline and mediation. But the thought of even trying to makes me sick.
1315,i’m really anxious about my behavior after my first bad breakup. is what i’m experiencing normal? i’m not sure why i’m so worried but it’s really bothering me.,"i’m worried that somethings wrong with me because of how i’m acting. we broke up 4 days ago and we have plans to get back together in the future after we both improve our mental states/self esteem problems.  I was extremely close with him and depended on him for everything emotionally. almost everything i did revolved around him. the reason why i’m worried is because i’m afraid that i’m not feeling sad enough. i know that sounds ridiculous. it’s just that i’ve definitely cried and sobbed my eyes out many times since it happened. when i allow myself to think about the breakup i start to feel very empty and messed up. i often get nauseous and get bad headaches and feel as if i’m being stabbed in the stomach and chest when i see anything that reminds me of him at all. it’s just the reason why i’m worried is because i’ve also had way more energy than usual. i’ve done my makeup, done art, made playlists, reorganized my phone, caught up on more schoolwork than usual, started up a daily skincare routine and more. this just feels weird to me that i’m already doing this stuff. i honestly just feel really guilty about it but i’m not really sure why. i just really am having trouble processing that it’s real. i feel like maybe these things are just distractions. i think about him so often but my mind keeps telling me that we are definitely getting back together even though that’s not guaranteed. i feel like i’m going to get way more messed up later on during this. i’m also anxious that our relationship was toxic or that we were manipulating each other and other stuff like that. i do have relationship OCD that makes me worry about things like that though so I doubt it’s true. I also have been comparing this breakup to a very small breakup i had two whole years ago. it was with someone who i was not that close with and i mostly just liked the idea i had of him in my head. i have had really bad anxiety and felt so guilty about that idea that i was more upset about that breakup and than this one even though rationally i know that’s just so very untrue but it’s like a constant battle in my head. i know that my thought process might not make since to a lot of people and i honestly think it could be because of the fact that I have OCD."
1316,I want to help my friend quit smoking for stress,"I have a schoolmate who has been smoking again for like half a year as her new boyfriend smokes regularly. We started getting closer to each other as this school year started and she told me that she smokes only when she feels stressed out. The other day I made her not smoke when we were talking about something that has been making her nervious - but after school, she smoked twice that day. We talked about her problem, I gave her a hug, told her my perspectives and to think of the positive things she has in her life, but everything was useless. She also told me that she wants to be alone when she's stressed. Yesterday I told her to call me whenever she is in the mood to smoke to at least try to talk about her problem even if she doesn't want it that way, I want her to try this as neither of us knows if this would actually help. I assume it would because the best thing is to discuss our problems and have someone listen.

I would like to hear your suggestions on how I could help her. Thanks."
1317,I don't know how to help my girlfriend,"I (M 17) am in a pretty long relationship with my girlfriend (F 17) and we are in our senior year of high school together.

This may be a bit long, so I apologize in advance. 

For context, she's had a very rough life. Her parents were very abusive (pulled her hair out, bruised her,  locked her in dark rooms, made her eat her own throw up). The physical violence stopped when she reached around 7th grade. The emotional abuse never stopped. The issue was/is that her parents are extremely affluent and intelligent, so not a single person has ever suspected them of abuse, nor would believe that they're abusive. In addition to parents, she also had a two-year relationship with a guy who was also emotionally (and occasionally physically) abusive. He controlled everything she did. This is particularly important because in this relationship, they had agreed to spend the rest of their lives together, which seems like frivolous and innocuous, but because my girlfriend was so devoid of affection, she took the offer of permanence with glee. When they broke up, the hardest part for her was trying to let go of that.

As for the current situation... Throughout the entirety of our relationship, there are instances (typically at night, but sometimes during the day) where she becomes very sad, but also destructive. It can honestly be scary. The reasons are fluid, but typically, she becomes very sad at the prospect that her and I will not last through college. She usually begins to cry, and I try my best to comfort her. She's always had these bouts of sadness, and I've always tried to be there and help her through them. But over the last 3 months they've gotten particularly worse.

I honestly don't know if this is the correct position to take, but when it comes to us two attending college, my position has always been that I would love to try and preserve our relationship, and I think that we can. The only thing is that I cannot guarantee permanence with out relationship, And because of that, she becomes very upset at the prospect of us breaking up. She will have multiple instances a day where she cries for 30-180 minutes because of this. And as she gets deeper into an instance, she becomes more destructive. She begins to talk about how she ""has nothing in this world"" and how she would be better off by leaving (alluding to suicide). Often, the phrase she uses is that she ""has nothing, and can't stay here any longer"".

She has had issues like this for a slight while now. I've slowly tried to ease the idea of therapy to her, but she does not want to try therapy. Of course I would never force it on her, and, no matter how bad these instances get, I am there with her to comfort her. But, the instances become more frequent and intense. It is at the point where I'm beginning to fear that she cannot live without me.

Tonight, it was extra bad. We were talking on the phone and she became sad, as per usual. And she got progressively angry at me. I kept insisting that ""things can get better"". She replied telling me that I hadn't lived her life and didn't understand what she's been through - which is all true. Nonetheless, I insisted that, no matter what, things could get better. Then it got bad. She told me that ""things could get better if I stayed"" (didn't go to college/planned college around her). She told me that ""when \[she\] dies it will be \[my\] fault. And if \[I\] try to stop it, \[I\] will be the person causing \[her\] the most pain"". Essentially, she told me that if she killed herself, it would be my fault, but if she stayed alive (something she deems worse than suicide) it's also my fault. She told me that I had the opportunity to ""stop it,"" but that I didn't and wouldn't, referring to my desire to not base my college decision around our relationship.

I can't pretend like hear that didn't hurt me. I dedicate so much of my time to trying to help her. I am constantly up to 3 or 4 am, not getting schoolwork done, or even sleeping. I always try to be there for her, and I am, but it's becoming increasingly difficult. The more and more I stay with her through these times, I feel like she only regresses and it's having a very bad effect on my mental health now. I feel awful, because I know I'm supposed to be there for her, but it's becoming so unsustainable. I want to help her, but she refuses therapy and I know I can't force her to see a therapist (or any clinical treatment for that matter). I've considered telling a school counselor, but they're honestly pretty powerless, even if I have some marginal evidence of this happening. After tonight I feel like I'm in an especially bad place. I feel like she's in a very bad place mentally, and that I am completely unable to help, and I'm so mentally drained that I'm losing my own will to live. I'm sorry this is so long, but I honestly just don't know what to do. I could really use any sort of advice. If you've taken the time to read this all, thank you so much."
1318,"Please help me out, idk what’s wrong with me."," Idk if this is the right place for this but idk where else to post. Past couple of months i’ve been having these episodes of extreme anxiety where i’ll feel like i’m stuck in one moment forever or that i’ve died or something. This feeling is really abrupt like literally a jumpscare. I’m starting to realize I have certain triggers but they immediately send me into some kind of psychological abyss. Really hard to to explain. Once it happens I completely dissociate from my surroundings and can’t function. I feel like i’m falling, like when you miss a step going down the stairs, that’s how hard my heart is beating. As this happens, I feel there’s electricity rushing through my body. By the time I can convince myself that i’m okay, my life is real, and that i’m a living person, i’ll start to hyperventilate because i’m so terrified of what just happened to me. I would go ahead and say that they’re some sort of panic or anxiety attack, except the episodes really don’t last that long. No more than 15-30 seconds maybe. But it feels like a lifetime. I’m really just trying to find out what this is, I can’t really find anything that’s quite like it. Like a thought loop, minus the acid, plus a panic attack. I’m really uneducated about psychological conditions and such so if anyone knows anything about this kind of thing or has any questions please let me know. I’m afraid my brain is broken and I’m so tired of feeling like this."
1319,"What are the first steps to getting your ""drive"" back?","In the past couple of years, I've lost a motivation to be productive. I always was working on a project, and was always writing down other ideas. My creativity hasn't gone away, but the instinct to act on my ideas has.

1322,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love."
1323,Dealing with test anxiety by being negative and telling myself I'm going to fail,"Is there a word for this type of mindset? Whenever I'm nervous about a test, I immediately jump to thinking I'm going to fail it and resort to bitching and moaning about it. I usually bitch and moan to my friends and I guess it really annoys them and I feel bad. One of my friends told me to stop being negative but im afraid to think positive because what if I actually do fail the test?

Personally, it feels better if I expect myself to fail because if I actually do fail, I got the outcome I expected to get, and if I end up passing, I exceed my expectations.

But if I push myself to think positively and ""believe in myself,"" I usually end up feeling even more depressed because I wasn't able to meet the expected score. Ive never felt happy after telling myself I'm going to pass a test. I remember telling myself how amazing I am and how hard I've worked and that that amount effort will produce good results on my exams, but then I end up not getting the expected score.

This is why I dread when my peers ask me after class how I thought about the test. I never want to say it was easy because what if I got a bad score. I dont want to ""jinx"" it. If I say it was really hard but my peers thought it was easy, they'll think im dumb. That's why I always say it was alright or something neutral.

Is this sort of mentality damaging to me?"
1324,I stupidly looked at his Instagram *TW*,"**TW** RAPE 

So you know how when you follow someone on Instagram, it pops up other suggestions of people you might know?

Well, I followed someone I knew from university who has just started a brilliant photography account. After clicking follow, some other suggestions pop up.
One of them was the guy who raped me in my first year of university.

I don't know why I clicked, I am so mad at myself for doing it, but his Instagram is just *full * of posts about people's rights, equality and taking down higher-ups. I feel like this has triggered me even more than if it was just photos of him climbing a hill or something.

If he wanted equality, why the fuck did he hurt me? Why was I so bad that I didn't deserve equality in his eyes?"
1325,im fucked in the head.,"i told my crush how i felt like a month ago and she has slowly started saying she also likes me but for some fucking reason every night when she is sleeping i think that she hates me or that she tries to ignore me or she likes someone more than me and i felt like such a dick for asking her how much she likes me but when i asked she said ""ur different than the other guys."" She has also told me many secrets, like big and personal ones which i guess shows that she finds me reliable. She also keeps mentioning how kind and adorable i am and when i talk to her i feel like she does like me too, but when she goes to do something i get super insecure i think and just keep making excuses that she doesnt like me or whatever. idk how to explain it. Ive been thinking about it for weeks and i think it comes from my fear of abandonment. I fear so much that people will leave me that i push them away mentally. Ive told her about my mental health and shit and she is very accepting. The reason i got feelings for her is because she was the first person to not call me weird. We were friends for like 2-3 months before i told her how i felt and at the time when i said i like her she said she sees me as a good friend and thats it but now she says that she actually likes me and wouldnt mind dating me. The only reason we arent dating is because we are in different countries. She lives in UAE (dubai) and i used to live there but i moved to Sweden and somedays i feel bad that i left UAE. I am 15 so this is all probably some really dumb shit but i loved my life in UAE. Or not loved but i liked it and now i just feel like shit. Ive told my parents multiple times that i want to go back but they always say ""its for your education, u should be grateful."" wtf am i supposed to be grateful for, feeling like absolute shit everyday and feel like everyone tries to avoid me wherever i go. IS THAT SOMETHING I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR?? im just ranting at this point. the point is i feel like everyone fucking hates me even tho they say they like me and i hate feeling that way. all i want to know is how to stop feeling like this and if its normal."
1326,My(16) boyfriend(16) deals with severe emotional abuse at home and something needs to be done,"For the longest time my boyfriend has been suffering from emotional abuse from his mother and uncle. His father passed away when he was extremely young which I can only assume is why his mother is so emotionally unstable. My boyfriend has been told by his uncle that he should kill himself and that he isn't worth anything and has been told other horrible remarks by both his uncle and mum. He has to hear his uncle and mum yelling and screaming at each other every night. He has depression and PTSD from having seen dreadful things, once he had an episode from having a blood nose due to seeing his mother slit her wrists as a form of manipulation right infront of him. I try to be as loving and supportive as I can possibly be but I know there's only so much I can do, I don't want to stand around and watch him go through this anymore, nobody should have to deal with that. I feel like it isnt in my place to say anything to him about it but his mental health is deteriorating day by day. What can I do? What can he do?"
1327,What are these spontaneous and uncontrollable bursts of energy ?,"I usually feel sad, hopeless and depressed throughout the day and often get these suicidal thoughts. Sometimes randomly during my day I get these sudden bursts of energy where my thoughts are racing and I would scream because there would be so much energy and excitement inside I can’t contain it. I would smile so much that my face hurts afterwards. I don’t feel 100% in control, These bursts of energy include the feeling of intense happiness and it would feel like I’m on drugs sometimes. The bursts can vary on level of intensity so sometimes it could be less intense than described above but It all usually last for a couple minutes to several hours then I’d go back to self loathing and deep misery.

1328,Is there a way to remove a mental heath diagnosis from your records that is no longer accurate or never was?,When I was 5 I was diagnosed with ADHD after 1 30 min session and at 8 I was diagnosed with ODD after another season with the same doctor. I dont think these diagnosis are accurate then or now. I haven't been in any treatment or on meds in over 6 years. And have lived a normal life. How can I clear up these possibly erroneous and inaccurate diagnosis's? Is there a method to remove them from my records or at least say I no longer have them? so I can enlist into the military?
1329,My mom is losing her mind and I don't know what to do,"I am aware that the title sounds quite a cliche but I need genuine help.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm writing this, my mom is crying in the next room while also hiccuping. I have offered support lots of times but whenever I do, she pushes me away. Here's a little context:

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is a bit of a workaholic. Not like she enjoys her job or anything. She just can't live a life without giving herself tasks. In her mind, lots of housework needs to be done every day to live a stable life. That is perfectly normal. Perfectly normal until it turns into pressure. I try to help as much as I can. I vacuum the house, do the laundry, etc. while trying to make sure I get sufficient grades to pass with merit. That is a requirement for me to keep my high school scholarship. I just need to protect it for one more year and it'll all be fine. However, since I have to keep up with everything at the same time, my mom ends up trying to do everything I am unable to start immediately. Like, imagine me saying that I'll begin a chore after homework. I finish it in about ten minutes, proceed to start doing it only to realize that my mom ended up doing it. Then she ends up claiming that none of us help her out and begins screaming. She says that she works all day and ends up doing every house duty as well. She does have a point. Yet, despite my dad being a bit lazy, I try my best to help. She ends up neglecting those. This puts a toll on her own health as she genuinely believes that no one around her is responsible enough. It gets worse though.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have a toxic relationship. Getting a divorce has been discussed multiple times. In fact, the topic was brought up about ten minutes ago. My dad had been diagnosed with anger issues but he refused to get proper therapy for years. ""They don't help."" type of reasoning. Whenever my mom begins shouting for whatever reason, my dad just can't control himself and begins shouting as well. He ends up insulting her in a few cases. He does feel sorry after the events occur, yet does not try to improve himself. My mom feels even worse when her own husband insults her after she claims that no one is helping her out. I try to reason with her instead of shouting, but my dad's shouting just makes everything worse for my mom. I don't even know how many times my mom ended up claiming that she wished they never got married. Why's she not divorcing him? I honestly don't get it. He is a good guy when he is calm. He has good intentions. He just can't control himself when tensions arise. He even ended hitting me once when I insulted him as a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

A little more reasoning as to what led my mom to start becoming a bit paranoid. In the past few years, her dad suffered long term memory loss which has been healed significantly right now. Her mom caught cancer and although she has won the battle, this corona situation has put her at risk. We also lost two pets and her grandma broke her ribs very recently. So it has been one thing after another. A few weeks ago, she even came up to me and said that she sees little to no point in living anymore. I am trying my best to support her. But I can't do much when any minor issue results in her breakdown and she begins blaming me for her issues and stuff. And even I am struggling to connect with her now. Any reason why? She just got diagnosed with a herniated disc.

&amp;#x200B;

Why does this change a lot of things? Well, she can't do physical work now. Her life had been revolving around pushing herself to work, and the inability to do so has seriously damaged her psychology. She is beginning to get a bit paranoid. She just randomly got out of bed and began cleaning the bathroom earlier today while shouting about how my dad is useless. The problem is, my dad was cooking the meal she asked him to. When he told her what he was doing, my mom claimed that she never said that and my dad is just cooking because he likes to. Then a fight ensued and my mom began crying as I  mentioned at the beginning. She's just losing it. She was crying about how she can't do anything and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? As she openly mentioned her suicidal thoughts before, I am concerned. I fear that she'll do something harmful to herself one day. I also feel incapable of helping her now. Has she gone too far into that hole? How can I help her get out of it?"
1330,My mental health counselor told me it’s my fault for having ptsd,"My mental health counselor straight up told me that it’s my own fault for having ptsd. That “I’m letting myself relive these traumatic memories”
She’s saying that my ptsd is my own fault. That I’m hurting myself on purpose. 

She mentioned that when I realize that these traumatic memories are not my current life anymore, then I would stop. I try to believe that. I really try but it hasn’t changed anything. 

It was the worst feeling having her tell me that. 
Not once in my life have I ever had control over the traumatic memories that I relive."
1331,Are therapists actually good?,"Im not even sure if i have any mental health problems but i think i do. I overthink a shit ton and i feel empty i guess. Im not sure what it is exactly but i want to seek for help. Im still a teen so ill have to tell my parents i need a therapist which is probably the part im most scared of. My sister is bipolar so i already feel bad for feeling bad because i dont want my sister to feel bad for me or my parents to think that both lf their children are depressed. Im not saying im bipolar i dont think i am, but i do think im depressed."

1334,Invisible burden,My teacher said to me the other day that everyone is carrying an invisible burden that we know nothing about. Is this true? Because surely that kind of suggests that everyone is sad all the time which makes me terrified that happiness isn’t even real :(
1335,Sad deep inside,"Sometimes I feel kind of sad inside of me, like I can feel it inside my stomach. It happens most often when I’m alone at home. I literally feel tension in my stomach and bad thoughts start surfacing. There are bad things happening around me but nothing that really can affect me that way , yet I still feel bad. I can counter it by distracting myself , talking to friend or just doing something to forget, but the moment I stop I get sad again. Does anyone else feels the same way ?"
1336,Being dismissed by a mental health professional because I seem OK on the outside,"So I had a bit of a nervous breakdown on Wednesday night. The weight of the world had been getting to me, everything from this lockdown, to the election, my having lost a close family member recently, other family members being unwell, me being alone 95% of the time, me being unemployed, never having any money, having to choose between some reduced price sausages and a lighter at the supermarket that morning because I'd been double charged by my gym that same day, a whole list of circumstances that I really couldn't begin to list here. Those are perhaps just the main ones. 

I decided to turn back to drugs. The one thing in my life that has made me feel happy, for a while, at least . I took far too much, and ended up having to call the NHS 111 non emergency number. I basically lost the plot for a bit. I've been off of the drugs since late Wednesday evening, but I still feel much better than I have for the last nine months, when I returned home from having been living overseas. Shortly after I got home, I was diagnosed with having a traumatic brain injury. That hasn't helped matters at all.

Anyway, I called 111 and spoke with the guy there. He asked me if I thought I might harm myself. I said I didn't think so. In fact, I think I offered that information to him. From that point on, I could tell he felt bad for me, but also that there was nothing he could do. I think if it hadn't been a time of lockdown, if life was normal, I might well have had someone sent to check up on me. I told him I wouldn't hurt myself, but how could he really trust what I was saying? I wasn't in a good place, at all.

Anyway, I got off the phone, went to lie down in my bed only to start having uncontrollable full body tremors, a sort of ultra panic attack, for at least 2 or 3 hours, until I fell asleep. The next morning, I woke up, still pretty dazed and confused, and I called my GP for an appointment. He was worse than useless. I basically called him negligent and that he shouldn't be in his job. The only advice he could offer me was that he couldn't lend me any money. I told him I was insane, I wasn't stupid. 

Then I walked round the corner to my local mental health department. It just do happens it's very close to my flat. I hadn't known that until I had to visit there. I walked in and asked to speak with someone. I'd had an appointment booked with a psychiatrist from there for a couple of weeks previous to this, but I had to cancel it because it fell on the day after a close family member's funeral, so I knew for certain I would be too hungover to take any calls at 9:15am. I saw one of the nurses there. I sat and told her all types of shit about my past and my current situation. I was bawling with tears one minute, and trying not to laugh the next. I would tell her some dark tale of woe, then go off on some mad tangent the next. I was lucid, I was even eloquent and articulate, but I was talking absolute madness. She said she'd call me the next day at lunch time. I waited until about 2pm, which is well after lunch time in my book, and she still hadn't called me back, so I walked back round there again.

I asked to speak with the same woman I'd spoken with the next day. I'd been sitting there all morning, trying to diagnose myself, because I've been getting next to no help at all from the health service since I got home. Anyway, I told her I score highly on all of these online quizzes you can take - bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder. She dismissed this out of hand. Apparently she can tell I'm not a schizophrenic or I don't have bipolar just by looking at me. Therein lies the crux of what I've been trying to get at - how can someone possibly tell me I don't have a certain mental health problem just from looking at me, and from listening, for about an hour, to a tale of absolute insanity? I've been told this in the past, that I don't look like I have any mental health issues, apart from depressive disorder. That seems crazy to me, and pretty offensive to the people who do have these conditions, to say they have a mad look about them. I'm willing to accept it might well be a drug induced state, I told her as much, but I actually feel better now than I have in a long time. I'm deeply troubled that there might be something wrong with me, but I'm also not sad, for now, anyway.

I apologize for any formatting or spelling errors, I threw my phone against the wall the other day, in a fit of rage at something."
1337,Is random times of sadness normal?,"Hey reddit im a 20 y/o male whos been dealing with random feelings of sadness and i have no clue why. i was wondering if you people know if this is a normal thing or should i maybe go get checked out. to give a little more context, starting january of 2020 at random times maybe 1-6 times a month i get very sad and my anxiety raises for what i think is no reason and im really starting to get annoyed/ irritated with this feeling and am just wondering if others have this same type of feeling."
1338,"Warring Mind. (It's very difficult to express this in any other way, I apologise)","I feel like I'm different people, each wearing a different mask, all governed by one person.

Apathy and Empathy contend for fragmented amounts of time, one dominating the other, yet still judged by its opponent when standing atop the podium. 

Even as one Mind takes the reins, they will always see through frosted glass. Will scatters like light through its fractured patterns. 

Whispers protest every action, despite themselves building haphazard constructs from mismatched puzzle pieces. Each piece a part of a different puzzle. 

Contention begins again, The frosted glass resigned to draw it's patterns, lest they melt into the icy lake far below."
1339,Is there a condition or term for being exposed to adult things as a child?,"Just a question for you: If a child is exposed to things such as violence, knowledge of sex &amp; stuff relating to sex, &amp; just things considered not for children, what kind of (if any) conditions or mental issues can occur from that?"
1340,I’m struggling with depression and insomnia,"19 M I’ve been struggling with depression for the last 9 or so months, and the last few months I’ve started to feel suicidal. I went from a very outgoing student athlete with great grades and a lively social life to an incredibly unmotivated and lonely person after my first year of college ended. I struggle to fall asleep no matter how tired I am as my thoughts race at night, and I often wake up unnaturally early and can’t fall asleep again. I’m not sure how to go shoot therapy in a covid era, as I’m not sure I can afford it, nor would want to do it remotely from house (concerns with privacy, thin walls). I’m not sure what about my past to share but I’m open to answering any questions and receiving advice or whatever. Sorry, I’m new to Reddit and asking advice in this manner in general so I don’t really know what to say. Thanks to anyone who reads this."
1341,"lately, I can’t stop thinking about kms, it’s been a constant thought repeating itself in the back of my head. how do I deal with this?","tw: suicide. I don’t really know what’s considered ‘normal’ but this can’t be it. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with anything mental health wise, just as a disclosure I guess, but I also have never been tested for anything and typically those sheets you get at doctors appointments about identifying signs of mental illness I tend to choose the ‘right answers’ that wouldn’t get me flagged but I don’t think that helps my case

Just some background I guess but I started thinking about suicide casually when I started middle school, and more seriously towards the latter half of high school. The closest things got at that point was just very well hidden and controlled slits into my wrist, but nothing too deep or scary. I was never planning how to die or anything like that, but I was definitely pretty upset all the time and stressed out from parents and school etc. I just recently graduated college and I’m working full time as an intern and potentially going back to school in a semester or two for my masters degree. 

I don’t really know how it started or why but lately, every moment of time I’m not actively thinking or working on something, I have this like record on repeat, subconsciously playing through my head saying I could die/ I should die/ I want to die/ I need to die and it alternates phrases based on just how stressed I am about something or how upset I am. It started pretty recently, and I’m pretty sure it’s stress related, but this is really new for me and I don’t know how to make it stop. This can’t be normal, is it? Is it common/ if you’ve ever had to experience this, how were you able to manage it?"
1342,Anyone wanna help a teenager in crisis?,"I feel like i have no purpose in life besides completing school work and i just want to be working towards some sort of goal to actually enjoy life but thanks to the rona I’m stuck in my house all the time and I’ve recently lost almost all my friends and my girlfriend just tends to have her own problems so I’m burnt out on talking to her for help, I’m drifting aimlessly and i want something to fucking change"
1343,Filipino Psychiatrist,"Hi, 

Does anyone knows a psychiatrist who accepts HMO? I badly need medication for my anxiety :( It is affecting my work and my relationship with people. I don't have money to pay cash. My HMO (lacson&amp;lacson) covers psychiatrist but they don't have any affiliated psychiatrist though they are willing to provide letter of authorization if I found any psychiatrist who is willing to accept my LOA. 

PLEASE HELP HUHUHU"
1344,Does anyone else have absolutely no motivation?,I’ve found myself missing work a couple times this week due to depression and just feeling overwhelmed by everything. I know this isn’t good but in the moment I just don’t care. I need a break. But what happens when a break isn’t enough?
1345,I keep hearing people I know in my head,"Doctors are expensive so I’d like to ask for advice please. I don’t think I am schizophrenic since it has only been happening recently (2 ish years). 
   I keep hearing the voices of family or friends when they are not there. It’s unintelligible sorta stuff like they aren’t saying words just making noises. It used to bug me sometimes since I’ll think someone is trying to get my attention but then remember that they aren’t even home. Not a big deal.
  There is one thing that kinda makes me uneasy about the voices though. One night like a year ago I heard a woman crying and I searched for her but couldn’t find anyone. I told my family and they made jokes about the house being haunted. The ghost comments have made it more scary for me. I know ghosts aren’t real but would just like some sorta non-supernatural reason so I can sleep at night."
1346,I think I have depression,"I’ve recently felt so lonely and down. Everything I used to enjoy feels like a chore, I’ve been losing sleep, not eating even if I’m hungry, crying in bed uncontrollably for no reason. I’ve stopped basic human needs/hygiene as well: I’ve not been drinking enough, barely brush my teeth and more I can’t think of rn. I just feel like there is no point in doing anything and I struggle to get through weekends without seeing friends at school. There is just a constant cycle of wake up,school,homework,bed,repeat and I’ve recently been scratching myself without it hurting. I’ve been having crisises in bed: crying punching my pillow and wanting to see my friends, even though I’ll see them in like 10 hours.

Idk what to do bc if something doesn’t change I’m just gonna get worse.
Thanks"
1347,Existing without distraction hurts,"Whenever I am not distracted by some task or coping mechanism, I experience an almost physical feeling of pain like my mind is tearing itself apart. I don’t know when or how it began, I only know it’s been the case for a few years now. It is hardest to avoid when trying to get to sleep, so I often stay up all night till I pass out in morning or I literally cry myself to sleep. I’ve tried so many unhealthy and a few healthy coping mechanisms over the years: self-harm, throwing myself in relationships, sleeping as much as possible, self-isolation. All of these have worked for a bit, but I always eventually take a break from the constant distraction, and the pain returns. I just feel so defeated."
1348,What is wrong with me? Should I get help?,"Background information. I want to provide as much detail as I can in case it helps. I am 18M and have a 13yo brother. My relationship with my brother is so bad to the point where I have just been shutting him out of my life - he is very spoilt, constantly demanding things (and my parents keep giving in to his demands as they struggle to say no to him), really self-obsessed (constantly staring at himself in the mirror and going on about how much better he is than everyone else in the family) and always trying to interfere with things. He has attempted to break my things before, knows how finicky I am about keeping things organised and is always rearranging things in my room to annoy me and one time a few months ago tried to outright strangle me (although didn't get very far as I'm bigger than him lol). We are complete opposites - I am introverted and have a small friend group, he is extroverted and has a large friend group. He has had pet birds for a year now, they wake me up early every morning and are just generally really noisy all day long. He doesn't even look after them (my parents do) and rarely even acknowledges them - I told my parents I wanted the birds gone and they said they did too but they won't do it because my brother says he wants to keep them. There's also the fact that my mum is an extremely intrusive person - constantly asking me just too many questions and trying to spy on what I'm doing online. She doesn't respect my personal boundaries. I've gotten very good at hiding things from her as a result, and it's just made me a more private person. Ironically I am closer to my mum than my dad but that's a whole different story.

I have always been an anxious person ever since I was a child (nothing changed there) and more recently have began developing depression. It feels like I'm always either extremely anxious or extremely depressed - like a light switch, there isn't normally an inbetween (although I sometimes do have these rare moments where I'm not dealing with either of them and I love it so much when that does happen).

I can live with the anxiety, it's more the depression that's the problem. It often kicks in whenever I've had a good time. I often reflect on the good time, and start getting depressed that I can't go back in time and relive that good time when in reality I should probably be making new good memories. COVID doesn't help as it makes having a good time extremely difficult for me.

I think the earliest example I can think of this was when I was around 8. I had a friend round, we had loads of fun and then I proceeded to throw a huge temper tantrum when he had to go as I didn't want to stop having fun. Kind of similar to what I get now, with the tantrum replaced with depression, but it could just be because I was a kid.

The next example is Christmas. When I was a kid I used to feel somewhat sad whenever Christmas was over but I guess that's to be expected. When I was a young teen this feeling stayed except I would somehow start to feel depressed about the year changing (yes, a NUMBER changing was somehow enough to get me depressed in those days, I have no idea why or how). This feeling only happened for a couple of years before it was replaced with the classic ""post-Christmas depression"", where I basically feel sad and outright depressed about it not being Christmas any more for at least 3 or 4 weeks.

For nearly all of 2020, my depression was related to how much of a better year 2019 was thanks to the lack of COVID and how I wish I could go back.

Just recently, I went on a short trip halfway across England to see some of my dad's family. I stayed with them for 3 and a half days with my dad. I saw my auntie, uncle and 18F cousin. The last time I had seen my cousin and uncle was 6 years ago (me and my cousin were both 12 lol) although I had seen my auntie once or twice since then as she would travel to my hometown by herself on the odd occasion. Because I'm an introvert, I spent a fair bit of time there on my iPad doing nothing different to what I would at home - except I no longer had the birds giving me a constant headache, my mum trying to spy on me and I didn't have to even look at my brother once which was a nice change of pace. When I was talking to family, I actually had a really good time (much better than expected) and REALLY enjoyed seeing them all. It's almost been a week since that visit (how does time fly so fast?! - feels like yesterday) and I'm basically going through the usual depression, wishing I was still there and enjoying seeing them all whilst getting fed up with my brother, the birds and my mum as usual. I keep looking at the Reddit posts I made whilst I was away, the messages I sent to people on Discord and Messenger and even looking at the YouTube videos I watched whilst I was gone and for some reason these all feel ""extra-special"" and I get all sentimental all over it - I can't quite describe it. It seems to be at its most extreme point yet as I'm now writing an overly detailed journal about my time there so I can look back on it even though there wasn't anything massively out of the ordinary for a family visit.

One last thing to mention - I research my family tree and know my dad's family is riddled with mental health problems (could be partly-genetic?), my 2x great-grandmother died in a lunatic asylum in her 30s, her daughter (one of my great-grandmothers) was messed up and used to enjoy trying to starve the children and also died rather young etc. Obviously the symptoms are different lol, though my other auntie on my dad's side has kind of similar symptoms to me at times."
1349,i hate myself so fucking much,"people say they love me and people have crushes on me but its just because I give them this false  idea of who i am because i only hang out with them for a short conversation. so its just a little snippet and I'm using al my energy to be the most amazing person and make them feel good in that moment but I'm nothing like that. i fucking hate myself, I can't produce organisd thoughts and I can't think straight. all that shit. i don't know who I am. i hate myself so much, my looks can be okay sometimes I don't hate that part, I just fucking hate who I am and everything about me. i dont let anyone new get close to me anymore bcoz i know they'll relise I'm not who they thought I was. I want to be anybody else, just someone who can think properly, also I'm really worried my meds are the reason my personality has changed sm ,  I overthink more than I used to so I just dont speak my mind and I can't feel angry or much anymore  I'm numb when I'm supposed to feel strong emtions or its just feels like a body buzz, everything i do feels fake, i used to be so much more energetic and amazing and i literally feel dead inside all the time now, i can feel happiness yes sure, I'm just confused, I'm off my meds, I've been off them for ages, maybe that's why, shld i just go back on them but i dont remember feeling like this before i took my meds (sertaline), idrk what to do, i know I've changed so much but my best friend keeps saying i ahvent but i know i have."
1350,Im constantly comparing my life to people and its getting out of control?,"

So lately it's gotten so bad to the point where I cant even leave the house because I bump into someone from my old school/college and see/hear of their success and I come home feeling like shit. For example, I'll drive up to my street even and see an old friend driving a better car than me, then I feel bad about my life that I don't have a really prestigious job and can't afford a luxury car (my car is a basic A-B Car, though I'm grateful for it nevertheless). Additionally, il see some old friends from college in the nail shop, or in the store and the thing that destroys me the most is that they are married. Literally, all I see and hear everywhere on social media, in real life, is that they're married. my parents are divorced, so messily. My family is so toxic, my mum is abusive emotionally and tries to stop me from seeing my father, etc and she makes me feel like a burden if I ever did try to tell her anything. she doesn't know my suffering because all she cares about are her own problems..she says herself she can't be bothered to deal with anyone problems

I have never had a bf, and one of my biggest insecurities is never being a wife or a mother. I have a horrible past of being rejected by every guy I ever fell for, being fat-shamed and bullied at school, and coming from a terribly broken home where my mum was emotionally abusive and never made me feel like I am not loved. Seeing all these girls married, having a lovely partner to support them through life's ups and downs, and looking at how lonely my life is, iv dreamed of this since I was a teenager. I just want a man to love me. I don't want anyone on here to say ""focus on your career"" or ""there's more to life than men"" when honestly Iv been there with having a fancy career, having tons of girlfriends, investing time in other things, but nothing makes me happier and fills me with more joy than the thought of marriage, children and our own little happy family. My worst nightmare is nobody marrying me/me being lonely forever. I am such a jealous, frenzied person that I make up awful excuses to not go to my people's engagements/weddings, and I see pictures and just cry and burst into tears and get depression. Iv cut off so many friendships simply because I'm jealous of them. It's sad because I have so much love to give to a guy, I know Id make a great wife, but nobody has ever given me a chance. I have loved boys so much and got my heart broken so many times, only to be rejected cos of the way I look.

I made a terrible mistake and due to my over-sensitivity and lost all my beloved friends from high school. They were so good for my mental health and I was just too stuck up to realize this. 4 years late they are all friends and I cut off my nose to spite my face. Tbh I dont even want friends though, I have a few work friends now and they dont make me happy in the slightest. Now when I see my family members/cousins all going out with their friends, late-night drives, travelling to new cities, I get really really jealous. So now I am jealous of my own family. But honestly, I want to do all this, but with a GUY/MY HUSBAND. I see people and how they tell me and show me how good it is going out with a guy and I can imagine how amazing a feeling it is, dressing up, going out with the man you love. Even if I go out now and see a couple driving together in the car, I get jealous and a little piece of my heart breaks again. It's literally that bad I can't even leave the house. I see couples in IKEA and think how lovely it must be to come with your partner to shop for your own home,..and they'll probably go home to a home that isn't broken/toxic like mine. And yes I know you never know what goes on behind closed doors, but come on, it must be so peaceful to have someone who cares about you. My auntie, recently had a baby girl and is married to the love her life. iv always wanted a daughter. Im so jealous that iv even cut her off, my own auntie. I used to visit her and then literally come home in floods of tears, so i stopped going

I have 2 degrees, (psychology and MSc in Health Psychology), a car, a close family I guess like with 2 siblings, my aunties, and cousins we go on day trips. But its like a part of me is always missing. I don't have a prestigious job I do have a lot of money troubles. i have a lot of past trauma. But Its constant comparisons where i can't even leave the house. Just sitting in a car in a passenger seat with my mum and I imagine, what if this was a guy driving me and taking me on a date? And it fills me with so much joy that imaginary world. Sorry if this sounds ridiculous, I FEEL ridiculous. I'm so unhappy and SO lonely. I work from home, but even in the past before Covid I had a really good job in the psychology feel but that didn't mean anything, I was still feeling like this so I know ""focussing on my career"" is something that won't solve these issues. im so lonely,all I'm faced with in my social circle is seeing my acquaintances go traveling with their partners, go traveling and enjoying movie nights and stuff. I just sit around all day, on my phone, overthinking, fearful to leave the house, dont want to socialise or even talk to anyone. Im so lonely, im so saddened from my previous life events i have no proper parents together, no husband or partner, no friends, no money. I am a horible person honestly filled with nothing but jealousy and curse people who are happy."

1352,Struggling with depression in rocky relationship,"I have been struggling with depression lately and I don’t really know what to do. I moved away from what I guess I’d call my hometown to live with my boyfriend a few months ago. He’s pretty much the only person I know here, despite failed efforts to find friends. I just need to start working but my car is in the shop. Anyway, things got rocky(more so) due to complications &amp; things are weird between us. Some days he wants attention and is affectionate and some days he wakes up and is cold &amp; dismissive.  It’s taking a toll on my already depleting mental health because I don’t know what to expect from him. I’m trying to see the good in life &amp; defeat my on and off mental illness but it’s hard when I wake up ready to make the most of the day and he’s like that. Today he basically told me that I don’t do anything all day and when I told him he takes the things that I do for granted, he repeated it back to me and said that I take HIM for granted.  I appreciate him and he knows this. I do whatever he needs me to do whenever because I know I’m not working right now except I do DoorDash to make extra money when I can. I don’t always spot clean the entire house but I do clean up after him and do his laundry. He knows pretty much everything that’s going on with me and he knows that I’m not too awesome so I don’t know why he comes down on me. Anyway, how can I defeat this? How do i get past the way that he treats me sometimes? I just wanna put my big girl pants on and be okay whether he’s good to me or not. It’s just hard when he’s the only person I interact with in person daily."
1353,Positivity feels fake and unattainable? (self esteem and outlook),"I find it hard to be positive about situations, and I can’t help but cringe when people are like “everyone reading this is special, intelligent, unique,  interesting and beautiful!” because the fact is it’s just not true. A portion of the population have those negative characteristics, some people can be ugly, unintelligent and boring.  How can I be positive about myself and build up self esteem when I just don’t believe in the positive affirmations? 
The world largely isn’t a positive place, and my life largely hasn’t been positive either.

TL:DR, I’m transgender, gay, and I live in Trump’s reign of terror. I’m absolutely terrified and stressed about the elections, plus I’m behind on school, and a lot of people have stopped talking to me. I also might have top surgery coming up soon, I think, which I’m worried about, but happy.

I constantly feel awful and tired. Everything is long and drags by. Sleep seems like I close my eyes for a second. Like a blink. Everything feels bland and dark. I just want to feel better."

1356,A clear lack of mental health.,"The worst part about suicidal thoughts - you can't act on them. You either commit fully and just end it then and there or just lay there trying to think of something else and hope that it passes. But there isn't much you can do, to just not have them. And even if you do - they will return and you will have to find something to do to get rid of them.

If you're thirsty - you drink.
If you're hungry - you eat.
If you want to off yourself - you can't do that because there are loved ones that don't deseve to go trough all of that (some don't deserve to go trough all of that again).

So you just keep on going for days, weeks, months or years until it gets better or breaks you completely and you finally commit to the thing your mind has been telling you for a long time."
1357,I don’t know who I am or what I want,"I’ve been sleeping so much lately. I know I have assignments to do but I just sleep through everything.

I feel like I’ve joined the wrong uni courses and I’m only three months in. 

I ruminate over things that I need to tell my therapist through the whole week and I somehow magically forgot to explain it in enough detail when the time comes and just brush it off. 

I got off meds a few months ago and I still can’t understand what went wrong. My attention span is off and I’m just isolating myself. I feel like a waste of space, a waste of resources. I can’t bring myself to look forward to anything or find something to do and I’m just tired. 

I don’t know if I’d benefit from medications or not, I’ve had one bad experience with them. I don’t know if I should look into it or just continue with homeopathic medication instead like I have been, but I don’t see any difference. 

I’m deeply unhappy with myself. I’m trying to change but it feels like nothing is working."
1358,Anxiety &amp; Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment Style [Advice Needed],"Relationships, Anxiety and Dismissive Avoidant Attachment

[first time poster here, happy I finally made it to the Reddit side of the Internet] 

Long story short, I have a hard time getting close to people. Whether it’s a friendship or a romantic relationships, I’m either overly/anxiously attached (need constant validation, overthinking, etc) or completely avoidant/dismissive. It’s like I desperately wish I had the same sort of close connections that everyone else has, but I just have trouble being open, vulnerable, viewing people as being permanent in my life instead of just passing through. 

Here’s where I need advice, now that I’ve given you some context: I recently came to the conclusion that I wanted to move out of my current apartment (which I rent with my older brothers who’s cool) and into a different one with my friend who I’ll call Juniper. 

Juniper and I have known each other for roughly 3 years now, and we’re friends but not super close friends (even though we’ve travelled together, talk frequently, etc). So when I heard that she was also looking for someplace to live, it seemed like an opportunity—to leave my current living situation, try something new, have more or the traditional roommate/college experience (I’m in college, a junior but graduating a year early). 

Even though I’m super excited about the idea of living somewhere else (I tend to romanticize things), the fact that I’d be living with a friend scares me. I can’t help but think that I’ll be living in a constant state of hell from all the oscillating between anxiously attached/dismissive-avoidant. It kills me not knowing where we stand in our friendship, and I’d hate to move into a home with these romanticized ideals of our friendship only to be disappointed. Like I said before I have a lot of anxiety/insecurity about relationships (probably from my childhood where I had emotionally/physically unavailable parents) and so I just don’t know if I should proceed with this move or not. 

Why can’t I view my relationships as being permanent? Even in my close friendships my social anxiety feels crippling. Do I take this leap and move and just trust the friendship and not overthink it? Or do I stop romanticizing a new home life with Juniper, accept that we’re not as close as maybe I thought we were, and move on with my life being content with where I am."
1359,I have a guilt problem and it's driving me insane,"I'm (19F) not talking specifically about something I've done, though there are things like that too, but I think it's a different thing. This is something that leads me to procrastination and feel really sad, even though it isn't exactly my problem. I am a person that is prone to feeling very guilty about smallest things that are or ar not in my control. 

So, I have a problem with seeing or hearing about people or animals who need help, or just look sad for example. I draw people to earn a bit of a side money, and usually people request pictures together (it's stylized and funny and rarely people order for themselves alone, more as a present). So today I received an order with and older man. I am aware that someone probably ordered it as a present, but first second I thought he looked sad and alone. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there is anything wrong with being alone, but for some reason I felt terrible. And that's just one of the examples.

If I see a post for donations for ill people who need treatments (it's mostly on social media, but we have that big foundation that donates and sometimes there are flyers outside) I'll feel immediately sad. It costs $3 to send one message, and my parents and I usually send those, but there is way too many people who need help. And I live in a third world country that doesn't have that much money for themselves, let alone other people. Then I think what it would be like if someone I know or me got ill. Then it's just negative thought after negative thought.

Same with animals. I have a very soft spot for animals, especially dogs, since I have two of my own, and one of them is adopted. I can't look at adoption posts or anything animal help related without feeling bad. When I see adoption posts it makes me wanna cry because I don't have space for those animals, and I know no one else who could adopt them. I need money for myself and future studies, and I somehow give money here and there for donations, even though I don't have it much. Then it's the guilt for noy having enough to help.

Then the guilt that I love all those animals so much, but am not a vegeterian and not using all cruelty free products. I don't even eat a lot of meat, but I'm not that healthy to try and change diet right now. I mostly use cruelty free products, but sometimes I don't. It's driving me insane. I just don't have that much time tl worry about everything right now, especially since I have a lot to study. I also take care of my dogs and do most of the house chores (which is not a bad thing, just time consuming) since I'm not in college but decided to take another way to study. But I find it difficult because I get anxious about things like those mentioned. 

Also reading and listening to a lot of world events, news, politic related topics, it's been driving me insane. I am aware that I can't do anything about any of that. When I saw that Vienna attack, I was terrified. Not because I was afraid of that happening to me, but because I am aware how I can't do anything. Then the guilt because I'm not educated enough in the topics above, but I just don't have that time. In the end, I end up doing nothing, and then guilt about that, honestly, it's just a terrible cycle. 

The worst of it, it makes my physical health suffer. I often feel very sick when slightly anxious. It doesn't happen every day, but it disrupts my work a lot when it does.

If anyone knows why is it that way, how to solve it or anything, please share your opinion in the comments. Thank you very much!

TL;DR: Big problems with guilt about things I have no control over"
1360,"I can’t feel emotions, or enjoy things, or fall in love and I don’t know how to deal with it while being in a relationship. Help me","It hurts me to say that I just can’t enjoy things the way I used to. Let me briefly explain how the last two years have been for me. Last year I had my heart broken by the person I was in love with for a year. We ended it in december and just a couple weeks after that he jumped into the arms of a friend of mine. I spent two months having to wake up in the morning, going to school and see them together every single day. That was hard. Luckily or not at the end of february our government put us all in lockdown for about three months, so I had some time to recover from that. Still, in May I was thinking about him and those memories were heart wrenching. In June, an action of his made me understand I was better off without him and I finally made the decision to move on. Of course I was not over him 100%, I was in love so that cannot be that easy, but anyways I spent a couple months away on vacation. That sounds like a lot of fun, but I felt like I was dying inside. I felt so lost, broken and empty that I tried every activity, I even worked and studied in my free time to fulfil that feeling of emptiness. In september, nearly a year after we broke up, I started dating another person: we met in december of the previous year (what a coincidence), and we went out on a date in january, but I was so hurt I really wasn’t able to see anybody so we stopped talking shortly after. 
We’ve been dating for two months already, but the thing is I cannot feel any type of emotion. When I’m with him, or when I’m with my friends, or even family, I may like being with them but I don’t genuinely enjoy it anymore. I feel absolutely emotionally numb. It feels like I would like to have fun but really can’t. For a while I thought it was him, so we even discussed that even though I really couldn’t explain how I was feeling. Instead, I feel like I’m totally empty and no one can actually help me fulfil that emptiness. I can’t enjoy things anymore, not like I used to, I only feel distress, sadness, tiredness, emptiness, loneliness, anxiety, nervousness and anger. But I know that’s not me, that’s not the person I used to be. 
The fact that I mentioned my dating history is intentional, because the first months of the year when I was not dating my current boyfriend I was just dealing with it alone, if I was sad I just remained sad without noticing. While now, I see that even though we meet, spend time together and everything I just can’t fake it. I tried talking with my parents but they don’t seem to understand, the only reason they make sense of is stress, but I know there’s something more than that. I’m struggling a lot with this. It feels like I’d like to be alone to just deal with it alone, without having to explain anything to anyone, including my boyfriend. I feel totally detached from my own person and my emotions and I don’t know how to deal with it. I just know I’d love to fall in love and feel something, but I think I’m not able to, I wish I could. It pains me to make sense of this. And it makes me feel even worse when I’m with him and I just cannot enjoy anything because I don’t believe it’s him to blame, I don’t think it’s his fault. I’m so sorry with myself to be feeling this way. 
I have history with anxiety and depressive crisis, and I really don’t want to have been caught up in that circle again. Someone help me please. Thank you for taking the time to read."
1361,Convincing people you love that they are not happy,"Hello everyone,  
I am completely new to this subreddit and i am here because i wanted to ask a question. I am actually reposting this from the /productivity sub-reddit. I think that i could benefit from opinions from both here and there, since what i am asking is both a productivity-related issue and a mental-health issue. Thank you!

I am living a pretty good life. I am a very productive person and in the recent years of my live i landed an excellent job, worked on and developed a body that looks i would say fairly good and have had success in other fields in life. I came to this point by working through periods of my life in which i would say i was very depressed and was very lazy. I still have issues in my life and other things that disturb me and i need help with one of them:

I have close friends who i believe are very much depressed and who have not achieved anything in their recent life. They spend all their time playing games/watching youtube or twitch or other similar activities. Their sleep schedules are reversed most of the time, so they spend all their nights doing said activities and they wake up at around 6 during the day. Some of them have resorted to almost no social activity and rarely leave their homes ( even during non-corona times ), while others often go out with new bad groups of people with whom they take light drugs. Their fitness is a complete 0, they are either on the verge of obesity or an ugly form of skinny-fat. They have not exercised in years. They consume fast food on a very regular basis ( more regular than normal, home cooked food).

I have attempted to involve them in career related projects (since they are studying for the field in which i am working), however i can not get them to do focus on it and no progress is being made. They start off exited about the idea, but bad sleep schedules and youtube/reddit/twitch and video game addiction (including World of Warcraft) puts them off track. I am all for these things and i do them as well. However i like them was once addicted to this stuff, and i can 100% say that they overdue them.

I have attempted to talk to them regarding these things, however i am always unsuccessful. Since in recent years i have been working very hard (and since i have other issues in my life), i have appeared sad, tired and sometimes miserable in front of them and they might think that if they try to be productive this is what awaits them. The main issue i am having when talking to them is convincing them that this happiness they have now is very limited. **And with that is their main counter argument, that they are happy being lazy.** They often let out silent screams of pain in the form of being sad about not having a girlfriend/partner, complaining about their parents being disappointed in them, complaining about their body and similar things, however in the end they just play some videogames and start convincing me that they are happy (and in those moments im sure they are).

These were nice, shy, smart kids who were doing good during school and were sometimes bullied. I think that they think that they were meant for and they expected better things in life, but they are now slowly being forced into minimum wage jobs which they hate. I don't suspect life will get any better going forward and i am trying to help them now, while we are all in our early 20's.

**I need help on how to save my friends**. I don't want to make them unhappy, but i know that this path will lead them nowhere. However at the same time, when i hear them tell me that they are happy, i don't know how to argue with them and how to convince them. I will consider budging them on to go to therapy soon, but i doubt they will listen and i of course cannot force them. I will appreciate any thoughts, tips and advice on how to deal with this issue. I will also answer any questions if you have them. Thank you!"
1362,"For people that know they have/had control issues, how have you coped or overcome them?","I know I have control issues, it stems from childhood trauma and it does get the better of me a lot. I just want to know from other people how they've coped or overcome this."
1363,Focusing is really hard at the moment,"As you have read from the title I’m finding it really hard to focus, I’m currently the only kid at my school doing online learning and I just can’t focus even looking at work just enrages me which is probably my fault, but that’s if I’m even sent anything their is no communication whatsoever and I hate it because my teachers are always saying to us we expect you to turn up to class on time and learn well that’s hard when they don’t send work on time or even send me anything, and work that is in a double period and is worked on with the whole class isn’t adjusted at all it all up to me and my parents are too busy to help, I have exams in two days and I have only been sent revision for one of them and I’m afraid that I will fail and have to repeat. 

I get so angry at myself for even messing up a sentence and I just shut down, and I don’t even have a good reason I don’t get top marks I’m a below average student.

I’m sorry for complaining or taking help from others who need it I’m just scared and I feel like I’m annoying my friends when I talk about my problems due to me complaining a lot and I hate myself for doing so 

Again sorry"
1364,"If you've been stressed out by recent events, it may be contributing towards tension in your back, shoulders or an overall restlessness. Its worth taking time to scan and calm your body; its one of the key drivers of your mental health","You might have been feeling stressed recently with events happening across the world or closer to home; a lot of that tension manifests in our bodies without us being fully aware of it. That might be in your back, in your brow or simply in a general feeling of restlessness which could be interfering with your sleep. 

Moving your awareness through the body relieves our stress by grounding us in the present moment. We can be aware and fully appreciate the body's complexity, the details of the tissues, the muscles, the bone, the skin. We can also draw attention to our organs and the functions that they provide - our eyes to see, our brains to think, our legs to walk. Focusing your attention in this way reunites our mind and body, helping us to feel whole again. In addition, caring for your body through awareness, exercise, nutrition etc supports your mental health - inputting positively into the feedback loop between mind and body is one of the important ways we can build our wellbeing.

1365,I'm not sure what's happening to me..,"I'm not sure what to do or how to feel, it's been 5 years since my last relationship which was not a good one, it kinda broke me. I've been living with roommate for 2 years, known him for like 3, we don't see each other in any way other than friendship but he's started seeing new friends and a girl and I'm just sitting here bawling.

When I think about whether it's because I like him (which I did when I met him but got rejected by him) I don't feel like I do, but my emotions have gone haywire!! I feel fine for 5 minutes then start crying next 5 minutes I'm fine then having a panic attack, I honestly cannot handle these mood swings anymore, I went from wanting to kill myself to feeling fine within the span of a few minutes. I feel like I'm going insane. 

I have a feeling I've become emotionally attached to roommate (where he has not, to me) so him going out sleeping over at a girls house makes me feel horrible, I don't know how to fix this or how to talk to him about it. 
I'm sorry this is so long."
1366,My dad said I've failed myself,"I got together to talk with him, hadn't seen him in awhile. I'm 26 he's 63. It ended up turning into an argument when he tells me I've really accomplished nothing (though I've had plenty of jobs and logged plenty of hours in the last 7 years), that I'm fucked up and that I'm a failure to myself. I dropped out of college, didn't fit in / get a girlfriend / have sex in college or any of that but I'm ugly so it's to be expected but now I'm feeling my youth and energy and everything that I had dreamed or hoped for in life slip away when all I do is work. 

I started yelling at him then he started yelling at me and tries to push me out of his car, I call him a sick twisted piece of shit, get out and he drives off. The hard part is that I love him deep down but the things he said make me so angry. The truth is that he didn't have a father (didn't meet his real father until he was 30 ) so he didn't really know how to raise his son to be a man. I have basically been a lost boy wandering in the dark for the past near decade and to be told I've failed is almost more than I can take. I still have low social status and am a romantic and career failure and am considering suicide. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from. And I'm going to have so much guilt and PTSD when he dies because of our rocky relationship while I was growing up."
1367,What does it mean when a psychologist says you’re too difficult?," i feel like i should say i’m on mobile so sorry for formatting + i’m not sure if this is the right subreddit but idrk where else to post it

a few months ago my mum made me (15nb) go to a psychologist because of a few things but one of the things is that i have trouble socialising, talking and relating to others. the psychologist knew all this, but after a couple appointments she called my mum saying she doesn’t wanna see me again because it’s a waste of time because i won’t “open up”. i know i fucked up by not taking the opportunity to talk to someone but i feel like a licensed psychologist should’ve known how to help me feel more comfortable and open up? i can’t just make myself feel comfortable to talk to a stranger like that. i went on a bit of a tangent but i’m still really confused by what happened. did i just fuck up that bad? is she not very good at her job? were we just not a good match?"
1368,Autism is overrated,"I'm sick of being like this. I'm sick of how weird my mind is. I get no joy from anything. I want to be with people. I want to be able to communicate normally. I want to be normal. I'm sick of being eccentric and all the quirks. I'm sick of the passions. 

I get no joy from what other autistic people get joy from. I hate math. I hate coding. I hate numbers. I almost blew my brains out because I wasn't good at math, so fuck that. I don't enjoy learning. I spent MY WHOLE LIFE studying, just to end up alone.

I'm sick of being alone, but I know it's nobody's fault but mine. My mind is broken. It makes me into a shitperson to be with. Autistic people are unpleasant. I can't blame anyone except my wiring.

I can't even get support since ideas like these are silenced. People literally call you a Nazi if you don't enjoy being autistic. It's just another version of toxic masculinity - I'm supposed to enjoy being alone and doing math, and all other emotional needs don't exist. Fuck neurodiversity."
1369,I somehow don't feel as depressed today and wanted to leave a note.,"Hello there.

This is literally a random post with no consistent topic or issue but I somehow thought it is good to leave a note now. My English is not so well and I'm writing this on impulse so it should be not friendly to read but I'd be glad if you can overlook that.

I'm a guy in my late 20's and I recently lost almost everything: a job, and connection to people including my old friends. It was mostly because of myself rather than a bad luck, like I wasn't fired but I quit the job. I can't explain it why I did so very well but I think I just could not handle my emotions and stresses I had back then. I think I was just confused and needed some rest or/and help but I chose to escape everything without organizing my thoughts or thinking about the consequences.

And then I became depressed and have had so much regret, and recently I've spent most of my time on my bed and slept more than 12 hours on average for a few months. And when I am awake I've often been thinking about how to end my life. 

But today I am not as depressed as usual. I really don't know why. Maybe because I had to go outside for some errands yesterday. Or just a lot of sleep may have helped. Whatever the reason I feel a little better today and am less suicidal. And I don't really know why either but I wanted to leave a note. Maybe because I can get back to this post when I get down again, I wanted to share this to someone else, or I just wanted to let it out. I know this doesn't help anything practically but anyways. 

I know this is really a bad writing lol, but if there's anyone who has read through this, thank you :)"
1370,Feeling extremely trapped,"I have social anxiety but it lead me to not developing any friendships or crucial things like that at a young age and severe bullying and became depressed by the time i was 11 because it kept repeating on my mind. From then on things just got worse bullying, stalking, degraded, all friends leaving me, exes leaving me, rumors, losing a job bc couldnt speak, etc. 

I dont know whats even wrong with me anymore but i feel like my mind my anxiety is stuck in the past on repeat. I feel emotional pain just reliving it and reliving it and have such random triggers now."
1371,Is there a way to remove a mental heath diagnosis from your records that is no longer accurate or never was?,When I was 5 I was diagnosed with ADHD after 1 30 min session and at 8 I was diagnosed with ODD after another season with the same doctor. I dont think these diagnosis are accurate then or now. I haven't been in any treatment or on meds in over 6 years. And have lived a normal life. How can I clear up these possibly erroneous and inaccurate diagnosis's? Is there a method to remove them from my records or at least say I no longer have them? so I can enlist into the military? I live in US Indiana.
1372,Where do I begin?,
1373,I think about other peoples thoughts too much,"Basically I believe what other people tell me about myself, more than mine. I am aware what other people say is more about their mentality, but I still think about it too much. The comments that are affect me the most are about my personality. I still think about what people said so many years prior."
1374,How to help myself with my anxiety,"I need to better myself, I have anxiety, the wrist things being my overthinking over small things that can lead to panic attacks and dissociating and being generally overly emotional whicb eventually leading to feelings of helplessness and depression... its ruining my relationship, its getting really tiring for both me and my boyfriend, he says I should try to help myself more and better myself as he's never even see me try to help myself, that I am just complacent in my ""self-wallowing"" but I don't know how to do that on my own? I don't even know where to start... I've been on antidepressants before but me and my boyfriend both realised that they just made me a shell of a person and didn't really fix anything, so when I said I had rang the doctors again he didn't really see this as a form of helping myself so I need solo options, things for me to do to help me... My boyfriend is sick and tired of my anxiety and says that he has ran out of sympathy and patience for me as he has been with me for 3yrs and nothing has changed and I haven't tried to help myself, so please I need help I need solutions..."
1375,Parent not getting the correct mental health care,My dad has struggled with Bipolar disorder (I don’t know if it’s 1 or 2) for as long as I can remember.... he’s at the point now (60 years old) where he just lays in bed and shakes with anxiety and can’t catch his breath. I miss my dad. I’m terrified he’s not going to get better. He sees a therapist every week and he’s on like 4 different medications. Obviously not working because he can’t even function. He can’t even help himself anymore. He’s not going to survive much longer. His medication is obviously not correct and I’m ready to strangle his doctor. I feel like she’s just trying to throw spaghetti at a wall to see what will stick. My mom has tried her best but she’s just frankly sick of him. He has to take care of his 90 some years old mother so I can’t move him in with me but that’s what I wish I could do. How can a child intervene in their parents Medical care when no one seems to be doing their job right or fighting hard enough for him?
1376,Do I just wanna believe I was traumatized or am I just delusional?,"So I was diagnosed with DID not too long ago as a result of early repeated childhood trauma that I do not remember. I will not say the type of abuse here for my own sake, I learned about my DID and am working through that but now I can't help but feel i'm just faking. At first I thought maybe the culprit was someone I met at a church pre-school I had gone to, then because I had talked to my mom about it she had said perhaps a certain person I would visit often and stay over with when I was little was the culprit but my aunt said that when my mom went off to work she and or my grandma and grandpa would keep a good eye on me. So now i'm at a loss, the only place I have left is my own home, I know nothing happened at school so that's the only option left. But here's the thing even though there is a man in my household convicted for a crime similar to what I could have faced it just doesn't feel right. So I just feel fake, I feel like i'm lying to myself and i'm delusional, it's my only thought that makes sense. I've been psychotic before and to an extent I am now as a result of mania, hallucinations and some delusions but I don't think I was delusional while I found out I had DID. But it just doesn't make any sense otherwise, I feel like there is no other way I could think about this. I can't believe that someone that lived with me would do something like that to me, even though he was arrested for it with another person."
1377,Wanting to help - ideas?,"
My SIL recently opened up to me about her severe depression and anxiety. I want to be as helpful and supportive to her as I can. It is a long hard road that I have also been on my whole life.

I guess I'm asking you all if there are things that have helped you or that you find you can really use in a time of need.

I appreciate you all"
1378,Thinking about ending everything after work today,I can't do this anymore. I wish I could die.
1379,Food obsession,"I just realised that my relationship with food is controlling my life.

Let’s start with that I look good, I have a perfectly fine body (normal weight), and I’m (f)25 y/o. 

Still all I want sometimes is to lose weight. I want to eat less and only “healthy” food. This mindset is troubling because it makes me think about food all the time. What snacks I can eat next. If I ate something wrong. Good food day or bad food day. Losing control. Can’t stop eating. 

I eat so much I can barely move and then I stay away from food for hours/days or pretend like it never happend.

I have so many rules around food it’s hard to remember all of them. I love food and I eat like it will run away from me and never come back. It’s like the worst type of toxic relationship. 

I’ve had a short period of bulimia, of fasting, and calorie counting. I eat only plant-based. I don’t eat when I’m hungry, I eat because I can’t stop thinking about food. I eat because I don’t want to eat. I eat when I’m sad. I eat when I’m happy. All I think about is food and if I don’t - it’s because I force myself not to. I am obsessed. 

But how do I take it from here? What went wrong? What questions can I ask myself? Is there anyone else that has been in this situation? 

I need your help."
1380,What would be wrong with my bfs mother,"Hi all I’m new to Reddit I figured I would start on here by seeking some mental health advice for someone in my life

My boyfriend and his brother don’t have the greatest relationship with their mother, well she doesn’t seem to have a great relationship with anyone.

Some situations which they encounter with her are issues such as blame being put on them for certain things they didn’t do. For example if something changed or got ruined in the house they would be blamed. They are also accused of trying to ruin her life. His mother also accused his brothers girlfriend of scratching her door ( because she saw a scratch on it )

I’m also told she thinks people are out to get her and for example if my boyfriend asked her something or told her something she would tell him that her workplace is conspiring with him to ruin his moms life or something along those lines.

In the past they did go to a therapist but the therapist asked to meet her alone and with that she disagreed to and because defensive about it.

Mind you she doesn’t talk to her sisters or anyone from the family, she’s divorced for a good couple of years as well.

I feel bad for her honestly, and for my boyfriend too. Apparently according to him she was never like this when they were younger and only became like this over the past couple of years.

Would it be connected to something like let’s say Alzheimer’s?

There are so many other things that I can go on about but my post would be far too long !

1381,I'm overthinking a thing I imagined...,"When I was in primary school I was, among all things, ""the singing kid"". I really miss it so when I listen to music I always imagine myself being on the stage and singing.


Well, one time I was imagining myself singing "" I kissed a girl"" and imagined kissing my bff as a way to shock people on the stage. It's really embarrasing to talk about it tbh...


I chose this girl because it's my closest female friend and she's also playing instruments. 


The thing is, I have a bf and I'm paranoid about cheating to the point I'm afraid of talking to people even though I know it's ridiculous. It's not his fault, he's not abusive. I'm the problem. 


I know I don't have a crush on this girl and I don't want to kiss her since she offered that to me in the past and I refused.


 We're really close, she's like a sister to me. We're hugging every time we see eachother and even kissing eachother's foreheads sometimes. It's not anything romantic and my bf knows about this. 


That's why she asked me if we could kiss eachother in the lips as friends since we have never kissed a girl in the lips before and she wanted to try it out. I was curious too but I'm in a relationship, that's why I refused. It happened way before the pandemic and we forgot about it (now that I panic a little I remembered that).


Now I'm overthinking those situations. I know I love my bf, I don't want to leave him and I'm not in love with my friend. But what if I had a crush on her in the past while being with my bf? What if I had a crush on someone else? I had a dream about being with my ex crush recently so what if I still have feelings for him? It's ridiculous, I know, but it disgusts me..."

1383,I (19M) had an out of body experience acting psycho to a friend (19F) in a way I never have before ever and I’m really scared/ don’t know where the behavior came from and why it happened.,"I think I went crazy. I consider myself a pretty confident, slightly awkward, but mostly normal 19 year old male going through college. I played sports in high school, got bullied in middle school, been in four romantic relationships that were mostly healthy and ended amicably, one that lasted a year and a half, and really grew my friend and social circle in the last two years. I’ve had my good and bad life events, but generally feel I act like a normal guy that copes well and has a positive life outlook. I have a really loving supportive family and really strong friendships. I also am successfully living on my own in college at an apartment with friends and have good grades. Often times people think I’m in my late 20’s because they say I act way more mature than a 19 year old.

A month ago I ask a friend I’ve known a year out to dinner. I always thought there was a lot of chemistry and her friends said they thought she liked me that way. She says yes and looks forward to the dinner. I’m excited. I go to plan it a couple days later and she flakes on it. I’ve been rejected plenty times before, once even like this, and always played it cool. Something scary happened here though. I sent a long message and called her pouring out feelings like crazy. After I did it I felt real weird. She says she just wants to be friends and sorry if she freaked me out. I said sorry for my behavior cuz I didn’t understand it. Things got weirder though. I had urges to constantly text her and scroll through her social media, and asking friends what she was up to. Sometimes I’d double or triple text her waiting for responses. I’ve never done or acted like this before to any women. When I saw her in person I would feel super lustful and horny, not in a good way like with my past girlfriends. I could remember every word and thing she talked about and felt urges to kiss her all the time. I was never even sexually attracted to her when we first met. It made me uncomfortable when I noticed I was doing these things so I made attempts to put space between me and her even though she was a good Friend.

One day I find out she’s taken back her ex who for a third time and I suddenly became jealous, angry, and resentful. I send her two long messages wishing she would’ve told me and how I feel I was hurt. A day goes by, I wake up and look back horrified at what I did. I can’t fathom or even really remember how I got in the state of mind to send that. I try to call her apologizing that I don’t know where that came from , it was immature, I value her friendship a lot, And I asked if we could talk about it. She said she’d talk to me in the future about it, then blocked me everywhere and cut me off. And I don’t blame her. I’m not going to try to contact ever again unless she reaches out to me, because I know my behavior was awful and I respect and care about her too much to hurt her further. It was textbook weird guy behavior. I felt horrible shame and guilt because I’d lost a really good, close friend cuz if this, and probably seriously hurt her mental view of trusting and having male friends in general cuz of this. I may carry that shame for the rest of my life. Mostly I’m scared.

I started seeing a therapist and talking this out with family and friends because I never want this behavior to repeat again and don’t know how it started. There’s no history of infatuation with women in middle or High school, or previous traumas I have besides losing a best friend halfway through high school due to me being a little toxic for him, and no precursor bad event to this besides being home for a couple months during COVID quarantine. Sure I’ve been socially awkward to some girls in the past, but this was like I was a different person. Ive been real moody and depressive so far since and struggle to go back to who I was before this episode. I’m really grieving the friendship too cuz I liked her a lot as a friend even if the date didn’t work out, we always had tons in common and she is very sweet so this feels like a huge loss. My friends are worried too cuz I’m usually a very emotionally guarded and emotionally passive person. I’m also having trouble separating myself from this event, everytime I talk to a girl, even ones that are close friends, my brain says you’ll just become lustful and push them away. I’m trying to shut those negative thoughts out. I feel like a terrible, worthless person sometimes because of all this, even when all my female friends tell me I don’t act like that and shouldn’t be so hard on myself. I never get sad really or angry, at least not in the past probably 3 years. I’m really having trouble forgiving myself.

Has anyone else had an experience like this where they feel like they became a different person? How can I forgive myself? How would I explain this if she ever does want to reach back out? And what could’ve caused it?"

1386,First post; could use some advice,"Hey all,

First post ever on Reddit. Might be TLDR 

Just sitting in my car in a carpark here in cold rainy UK thinking about how things got this way and thought why not post it for internet strangers to see if anyone has encouragement. 

Anyway to start at the beginning

In July this year I tried to take my life several times. I woke up one day after being stressed and sad for just the whole of my 20’s and most of my teen years and decided there was no reason to continue being unhappy. 

So I quit my job high up in IT and bought a lot of psychedelics and stocked up on blood pressure medication I’ve been taken for anxiety. 

Had a fun night off it on 3 tabs of LSD doing the things I enjoyed most then took 90 tabs and 108 blood pressure pills and went to bed to die. 

Rather annoyingly I woke up several hours later covered in vomit and out of my mind, sure people were trying to break in and attack me. Rest of the night is a blur but when I finally pulled myself together I realised I had failed but I still wanted to leave. 

So round 2 bought some shrooms and a helium tank and prepared an exit bag for myself. 

Got high, put the bag over my head and breathed deep. Didn’t work tried like 5 times. 

All in all 6 attempts over a month and a half without anyone knowing. 

After all the failed attempts I was out of resources to try again and I just really couldn’t do it again. There’s this whole internal “saying goodbye” thing that comes with suicide that I didn’t expect. Going through all the stuff you enjoyed and people you loved and just taking note that those things wouldn’t happen again was rough. 

So I called my best friend and told him everything and ended up moving in with him.

So for the past few months I’ve been living with him, doing counselling, taking my meds properly, making sure my money and finances aren’t getting out of Hand etc.

I’ve been doing really well and in the last few weeks met a new guy who knew what had happened and was supportive and such. 

Smoked a few joints with him and went back to my friends to live. He also smoked weed until about 3 weeks ago. 

He was unhappy that I smoked weed I said I understood but it wasn’t like before where I was buying weed every day but he demanded access to all my bank accounts weekly and full access to all my historical transactions.

I said no because there private family matters going on in my finances that he doesn’t need to see. 

This has resulted in me being kicked out. 


So here I am 3 months of progress, doing everything im suppose to do and I’m suddenly living in my car 2 days before the big interview to get my life together. 

Everything has pretty much fallen apart again. 
I quit my meds
quit counselling 
Have no money after getting sleeping bag and stuff to live in my car 
No one in my life knows where I am. 
No one has been in touch. 

Guess I’m just feeling pretty alone and defeated right now.  It feels like I almost got to the start of a better life then it all got smashed up. 

Anyone have any advice or words of wisdom?"
1387,Getting the life sucked out of me,"Last month, my lifelong toxic parents decided to kick me out of the house because of selfish reasons.  
Ever since, they've started picking away every single bit of enjoyment that I had left and making my life a living hell for the last 2 months that I'm allowed to live here. Every snack I eat, every bit of food that gets made, everything gets put out of my reach little by little and I get left out. They've even gone as far as to seal off certain parts of the house to me, tucking away the key where I can't get it.

I'm not some little kid that needs disciplining, I'm well in my twenties and tall enough to reach all places. Stuff just gets tucked under their supervision.

We're in a second lockdown with plans to shut down everything until halfway through december, meaning I can't visit houses or apartments for at least one and a half months. I just want all of this to end so I can get a life as far away from them as possible, as soon as possible.

I'd be happy to never see them again, they've gone too far down the path of cultism for my words to reach them and they'll never reach out to me out of pride.

I feel like I'm going insane with all this bullshit happening at the same time, increasing in intensity as time moves on."
1388,struggling today,"normally my finances don’t affect my mental health, but I’ve been living off of $.88 for a week and a half and not being able to go out with my friends and leave the house is starting to get to me. I’m going to go window shop in the stores but dang."
1389,What’s wrong with me?,"Hey all. So for some context, I am on medication for depression and anxiety and also struggle with ptsd. I had been hanging out with a group for the past year and really looked forward to hanging out with them all the time. We could talk for hours and never run out of things to say. I was grateful to finally find some friend because I go to a university down south but never had found any friends. However a couple months ago, I had a disagreement with them in which I felt really ganged up on and belittled. They’re all a bit older (im 21) and it felt like my opinions were dismissed as being immature and that I couldn’t possibly know what my opinion was because I’m younger. This triggered me because I was similarly and constantly dismissed by my parents growing up and made to feel like I am insane. Now I can’t seem to get excited about hanging out with these friends again, and Im just going to work and school and becoming more isolated. I have no one else and I know they didn’t have horrible intentions with this discussion but I can’t help how I am feeling. The whole thing seems to have sent me down a rabbit hole of insecurity and poor mental health and I can’t climb back out of it. Any advice about this friendship and how I’m feeling? Thanks"

1393,4 Tools to Deal With Anxiety,"Last week, I shared a [recent struggle I had with anxiety](https://heem.substack.com/p/anxiety-and-me). Today I’m going to talk about the 4 tools that I used to deal with it. But first, I wanted describe how anxiety works in order to help explain why these tools were effective for me.

Anxiety for me is like stepping into a pool. On the shallow end, my head is above water. The anxiety is manageable and I can step out at any time. But the further I get into it, the harder it is to fight. And once I’m in the deep end of the pool, I’m spending a ton of energy just to tread water and run the risk of drowning in it.

What pushes me deeper into the pool is fixating on things that worry me. Sometimes I’m choosing to do it. Other times it’s an undercurrent that drags me into the deep end. That’s why the tools I use to help manage my anxiety are designed to break this cycle of negativity and lift my mind out of the pool of anxiety.

# Exercise

The first tool I use to manage my anxiety is exercise. I’ve discussed this before, but our bodies responds physically to anxiety. It has the tendency to activate the “fight or flight” system and pumps adrenaline into our bodies. This adrenaline has to get out of our systems and the faster it does, the faster our bodies get out of the elevated state.

Exercise burns the adrenaline while simultaneously producing natural endorphins that makes us feel pleasure which helps to combat the negativity. When I exercise, I also stop thinking about what I was worrying about and focus on my work out which serves as a temporary distraction.

When I’m in the shallow end of the pool, exercise helps a lot. Often times it completely breaks the cycle. However if I’m in the deep end, I’ve noticed that the relief is often temporary.

# Support Network

The next tool I used is my support network.

During my 5 months of unemployment, I reached out to my friends. I called them, asked them for prayer, and gave them regular updates on how my search was going. They checked up on me too and this helped me feel like I wasn’t alone and that they cared. They would also served as my barometer by challenging lies that I expressed such as thoughts of feeling worthless or useless.

Another source in my support network were my parents which I actually think is rare to get from Asian American parents in this context. Whenever I had dinner with them, they were really supportive. They didn’t pressure me, criticize me, or even berate me for being unemployed. All they did was ask me how the search was going, encouraged me to keep applying, and believed in me.

After I got my job, I took them out to dinner and thanked them for being so supportive. Had they pushed or nagged me during that time, they would’ve just added to the anxiety I was already feeling and would’ve made the situation a lot worse. The fact that I received empathy and could even temporarily distract myself while I was with them was a huge source of encouragement for me.

# Gratitude

The third tool I used to manage my anxiety was gratitude. Being unemployed was rough, but I kept continually reminding myself that there were many things to be thankful for: my health, a roof over my head, my family, my friends, food, video games, the internet, netflix, a new church community that I’m getting plugged into, the fact my pet cactus isn’t completely dead (although that’s debatable), etc.

What this did was lift my mind out of the pool of anxiety that I was constantly getting pulled into. My gratitude injected positivity and helped me be grounded whenever I felt like I was getting pulled by a powerful undercurrent towards the deep end.

# Prayer

The final tool I used to to help manage my anxiety was prayer. This started with reading a chapter in the book of John everyday. Then I would meditate on some of the overarching themes that I felt like applied to me in that moment. Finally, I would pray to God about anything and everything.

Reading the bible helped ground me. It gave me a long-term perspective by reminding me that my life isn’t just physical but spiritual. It also lifted me up with timeless truths that I gleaned from the parables that I read. Meditating on these truths broke the cycles of negativity that I would get caught up in. It also created separation from my anxiety which allowed me to observe, acknowledge, and recognize it without getting overwhelmed.

Prayer gave me the space to fully express myself to God rather than bottling it all up. It gave me the freedom to vent all my frustrations and share my deepest fears. It also served to remind me that there were things that were simply out of my control, which was humbling. It forced me to give up trying to control the situation and admit that it was out of my hands. It was in God’s hands. Reminding myself of this truth over and over was a constant battle. But everytime it gave me relief.

# Discussion Questions

1. What are your “go to” tools to deal with anxiety?
2. What about them works? How does it help “lift” you out of the pool of anxiety?"
1394,I'm so upset by my thoughts about lockdown not counting because they don't fit the narrative that its bad,"I'm sorry, I'm needing to vent. I know this isnt the same for everyone, and I'm not saying it is, but it's my feelings and I hate that I'm made to feel like they aren't valid. 

I'm stressed and suicidal because of the pandemic, not because of lockdown. I'm stressed at my friends preaching love and kindness and ""just be nice to each other"" on facebook while not wearing masks. I'm stressed at how many people I know who think they know more than the scientists and have decided to put their own spin on the guidelines, because ""the government can't keep us like this forever"". I'm stressed that there is a virus that's spreading and causing people to die alone, and in a horrific way.

I was a flight attendant. I have a few friends that still work in that industry, currently flying to America, coming back to London, commuting up to the north of England and then getting shitty that I don't want them to drive to Scotland to come and see me. They tell me that mental heath is more important that pyschical health, and then discount my experiences because they are using suicides as a reason not to follow *any* guidelines, and my thoughts don't fit with that. I'm called a ""lockdown hitler"" by my family when they talk about Christmas and I mention my concern about travelling down south to see my grandparents. My Grandparents who have been told to shield, and that they are particularly vulnerable. I don't give a shit if I get it, but I don't want to pass it to anyone and have them die, and especially not anyone I care about. 

I'm fed up of people moaning and asking when it will be over. I'm fed up of being told that I'm ""the only person left in the UK who's still worried about this."" They are using peoples mental health as an excuse to do what they want, and then ignoring how I feel. I know I'm in a minority but I *like* having the guidelines. It takes away a lot of my anxiety, to know what it is I need to do to help. I'm glad Scotlands circuit breaker came in when it did. I've not cut anyone out, I'm not telling people they can't do something, I'm not reporting people, I'm just not comfortable being around people that have decided that they are bored with this, so they aren't going to bother. 

Yes, I'm on my own and unemployed but it's the fact that I seem to have a totally different mentality to pretty much everyone in my life is what's making me feel isolated. I downloaded tinder to try and see if I could meet someone and as soon as I say no to meeting up in someones house I just get abuse. ""Oh god you're one of those... look, lockdowns are much worse for peoples mental health - what about that huh?"" But if I mention my own mental health I'm told I'm being over dramatic. I'm so over being told that I don't matter, because I have a different outlook, that doesn't fit their agenda. I'm so over my so called friends saying ""look, you're sad, come to this party I'm having, it's for your own good"" when it's the parties that are making me sad. I'm trying to do what's right, and everyone is making me feel like I'm in the wrong. I wish I didn't care. I wish I could say fuck it, and drive to Glasgow to see my pals. I wish I could have the mentality that I'm only going into a handful of peoples homes, so that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. But I don't, and I'm fed up of people rolling their eyes at me when I say no to something. I'm not telling you not to break the guidelines, so just fucking let me follow them, without telling me why I'm wrong too. And when I am sad, and suicidal, and struggling, don't tell me it's my fault for not ""being relaxed"" about things. 

I hate that if I kill myself it will be seen as another cautionary tale of lockdown. That is not true. With or without the lockdown, there's still a fucking pandemic, and it's *that* that I am finding hard."

The rest of the world is screwed too, since there won't be anyone to counter China anymore, they will take over Taiwan and the whole technology they have, semiconductors in particular.

Dark times ahead of us. I am very anxious."
1397,Kindness brings the tears,"I don't know why but I've noticed in recent years that nothing is as guaranteed to make me cry, especially if I'm on the edge, as someone being kind to me. 

Today is the one year anniversary of my little brother's suicide. I woke up ok. A few small sad spells but I was more productive than I'd been in weeks. I cleaned, I showered, I wrote, I cooked. I was actually getting a little anxious that I hadn't cried yet. I didn't know if it was going to happen at a friendsgiving I'm going to tonight or if I was just callous enough not to cry. 

One of my friends dropped off a care package. It had chocolate and a candle, scented sanitizer, perler art of one of my favorite characters, even a bath bomb themed after a fictional world I'd created, along with fresh mint and bubble tea. 

And that's what did it. I looked at that. I knew who it was from and why she'd given it to me, and I completely broke down. All the grief I wasn't feeling all day suddenly washed up. I'm grateful to have loving friends, and I don't know why it sometimes takes an external force to force me to deal with the emotions, but I'm so glad I was finally able to cry today because a friend was so thoughtful."
1398,Is there any alternatives to talking about your mental struggles with people,"I've tried talking to my friends about my mental struggles which does help a little bit but putting my thought process into words or text just makes me realise how fucked up I actually am, which just makes me wanna cry the rest of the day and leaves me in a foul mood just thinking about it (tried meditation, not for me)"

1401,am i just feeling down or is this more serious,"hey gang so I never thought id vent on the internet but here I am I guess. I've been going through the same thing for the past five years and I've never talked about it to anyone, but I've started to wonder if it's something everyone goes through or if it's a little more than that. So I've been anxious since I was 10, that hasn't changed, but five years ago I started having these ""phases"". Basically, the best way i could describe it is as if its like im looking at the world through a grey filter. Everything is so.. grey. And it feels like i'll never be happy. I just want to be so small that i disappear and the world forgets about me. I feel so hopeless, as if it'll last forever. I have no motivation and im just so sad. For no particular reason. Sometimes a certain event will trigger it - but not always. The longest time it lasted was around 6 months, 4 years ago. It has gotten better over the years, but, if anything, it makes it even harder to bear when ive forgotten what its like to feel that way. When it ends, i wonder how i ever could have felt this way. ALso, when it first started and i was less mature, i couldnt quite grasp what was happening, so instead of calling it a ""feeling"" i described it as a ""thing"" that followed me everywhere. If anyone could give me guidance on what this sounds like that would be amazing - i'm kind of tired of feeling like i'm making up problems for myself."
1402,Has anyone here been in a psych ward? And if so how has your experience been?,"I'm 19F and mental health is super taboo with everyone I know. For years I have been wanting to get help, I have been sexually abused and beaten, and I cant deal with it anymore. For close to 8 years I have been depressed and suicidal on and off. I dont know the first thing about getting help or what to expect. My only experience has been horror stories about hospitals and psych wards and my doctor putting me down and making me feel like shit about it and saying I'm being dramatic bc I shouldn't be depressed. So I'd like to know if anyone here has stories about being in hospital for mental health."
1403,I'm 23 and the fear of reaching 25 is costing me so much sleep,"I'm a 23 year old dude and a lotta this shit has been keeping me up for weeks on end and it's really eating at me and draining my will to do much of anything. I know I shouldn't be filling my head with pseudo-science articles I read online but when you're stuck in a PTSD riddled mind during quarantine you tend to rabbit hole a bit.

All these articles I've been sifting down lately, about everything from how the brain stops developing at 25, or 27, to your cellular structure essentially begins collapsing around then and your cells start degrading at 25, everything going downhill. A lot of these articles aim more around mid twenties but I'm even seeing numbers like ""your body starts dying at 18"" and then some sources say ""21"" and then ""25"" others saying ""30's""

Is any of this actually true? Do we all just peak around mid-20's then our body's start to decay at 25? Is it the same or different for everyone? Is this all I have to look forward to? I feel so hopeless I don't even wanna make it to 25 at this point"
1404,Where do I begin?,"Where do I begin?

I feel like I want and need this sort of ‘Spiritual Awakening’, perhaps it’s wrong for me to think of that but for a while I just want to change myself, I think this year I may have changed- I’ve become more comfortable and open with a close few friends and not beat myself too much etc. but I think the thing I guess I most desire is just getting rid of this feeling I’ve carried for a long time, I’m sick of this persistent sadness and weird feeling I feel mentally and physically that I literally can’t describe, questioning everything about life, existence, the meaning of everything and why you and I are here, and why am I feeling like this instead of having an amazing life or whatever. I’m just not enjoying a lot of things in life, especially for such a bleak year for all of us, the beginning of the year was so shitty and then all of this happened, I’ve definitely gotten past it but it’s not better it’s just what I felt before but I guess slightly different because I’m older and thinking differently but nonetheless the same. I just have a feeling I always had, just ending it all or newly feeling like drastically changing everything. I know I can change but it definitely puts me back into my shell when I hear it’s a whole life journey, makes me think I’m gonna be sad for my whole life till I’m at my death bed at peace. 
Basically, I just want to be free of this feeling, I’ve felt it in childhood, teenhood and now almost reaching adulthood I really don’t want to carry this suitcase with me."

1407,Why don’t I feel excited or passionate anymore?,[deleted]
1408,Am I overthinking or should I seek help?,"Hi, I'm new to the subreddit so I'm not too familiar with how this works.

I've never been diagnosed with anything before but lately I've been getting paranoid about a lot of things. I didn't think it was a big deal at first. My reoccurring thoughts are that someone is in my house or they're following me home (I live alone). I sometimes think that someone is watching me from the neighbouring window (this is less common). It doesn't matter if I'm out of my house for 2 minutes or 2 days, I always have these thoughts. I've noticed it occurs a lot when it's dark. I'm not afraid of the dark but I guess I feel like it's easier for someone or something to watch me if they lurk in the shadows. I'll often go in complete silence to see if I can hear footsteps around the house. So far, no footsteps. I'll try to avoid going out in the dark, even if it's just to take the bins out.

I've been getting a lot of suicidal thoughts as well. It isn't to the point where I think I'd commit it, but the thoughts are there. I think about how I would do it, what I'd write in a letter, how I'd want my body to be disposed of, who would be affected and just details. Some of the thoughts I've had about it are creative and it puts a smile on my face, but again, these are just thoughts. I don't think I need help about this, but I don't know. 

Something I am really unsure about adding is that a couple of times in the last few months I've heard sounds coming from my phone. It's usually rustling or slight mumbles. I always check to make sure I'm not on call or watching a video or anything like that and the sound goes quickly. It always sounds like a male voice and I get worried maybe someone or a group of people, like hackers maybe, are watching and listening to me through the phone. It's like they're muted and they accidentally unmute themselves or maybe they do it on purpose to stress me out and make me think I'm being paranoid. I'm sure I heard a guy mumble and say ""fuck"" once before all sound stopped. 

A few friends know about the first two topics but I have never told anyone about the last one becsuse it always happens when I'm alone and I'm scared of what people might think of me if I tell them. 

Am I overthinking or should I seek help? And if I am overthinking, could someone please give some advice on how to stop feeling paranoid because it stresses me out so much. Thank you to whoever reads this &lt;3

(also, I live in the UK)"
1409,Not feeling excited or passionate anymore,"Why don’t I feel excited or passionate anymore?

Hey! I’m a 21 yo male who has had problems feeling excited about anything within the past 2 and a half years or so. Some of my journey includes spirituality, and I know not everyone will understand that part, but please hear me out... Also, this is a long story, but I’ll keep it as short as possible.

I grew up in a super religious home—tons of rules— in the religion, girls couldn’t wear makeup, cut hair, wear jewelry etc, and guys couldn’t have long hair or wear jewelry and neither were allowed to have tattoos... it was very oppressive—especially to women. I still love those people and honor them, but it was tough.

In 2015 we left that religion and along with that, all but 2 of my friends left... and if those two friends, I only saw them 5-10 a year. I was a super happy people person who became extremely numb at the age of 16—I still look at 2015 as the fastest and most odd year of my life, even with this year happening...

I was 16, with hardly any friends, I was one of the leaders of my church’s kids department and I was a MESS... I never showed it, but I was completely lost inside... funny thing is, I was numb to it, and it didn’t all hit me until 2017. I realized how lonely I was, so I turned to family and then I realized how distant I was from them. I was around them a lot, but I was the youngest of 3 kids and I was always the one in the 3rd row of the suv with earbuds in my ears living in my own world.

Eventually, late 2017-early 2018 I started feeling like me. I was writing poetry, creating art, and literally just felt inspired by everything. Then came august in 2018. I felt so much like myself—creativily inspired, lost 100 pounds— that I decided to get my ears pierced... doesn’t sound like a big deal to most, but with my family’s background, my dad didn’t agree. He passed the message to me through someone else and said that I would get kicked out if I did it... I was NEVER the “rebel” child—matter of fact, I was the opposite; the pushover. I hated conflict... but even with being SO scared, I said “I always listened to everyone and did what they want, but I’m done with that...” I got them done.

I came home and he told me to pack my bags. I have seen him do things like this before with my brother, but it was different. Most people in my family didn’t really expect me to leave, I didn’t either, I knew he would eventually calm down, but I didn’t know what to feel in the moment. I was in tears, packing my bags. I text a friend and also my pastor. And they helped me through it... long story short, I apologized tried to take them out, but he said it was okay and even though he didn’t like me wearing them, he gave me the 👍🏼.

After that happened, I still felt SO guilty for months. I felt like I needed to take them out, but I disobeyed. Throughout the next year, I probably took them out about 5 times because I felt so guilty. Months later, I felt so guilty that I randomly apologized again for doing it.... I expected him to say it was okay, but instead he said something like, if you really did, you wouldn’t be wearing them right now.... My guilt felt deeper..

After that, I began to just feel weird. I began to write less, eat more, workout less etc...

In 2019 I went to a youth camp as a chaperone for my first time, and in one of the services I felt like I wasn’t supposed to create art... I just felt like I heard it. It defied what I knew, but what I heard felt so real. So I went home from that camp feeling completely devastated... literally I just felt like the life was sucked out of me.

Later on that year, I became the student (youth) leader at my church... while that was a dream of mine, I also felt so lifeless because of the lack of inspiration when it came to the arts.

Now, 2020 is another story and I’ll only mention the highlighted details:

1. My co-leader of our students left and I became the only student leader at the age of 20 in January
2. Covid
3. Started online college

And then we have,
4. Something surfaced from my family’s past and we had to separate from my dad (and still are) for awhile... we all are now going through counseling and therapy. Our family will never be the same going forward, but we’re all getting healthier, so that’s a positive. But our Thanksgiving and Christmas are going to be WAY different this year without everybody together.
5. Because of what happened with my family, I’m now without a job because I worked for my dad.

So now... I have a dream-come-true position as a student leader, I’m JUST now starting to somewhat write again, but I still just feel bleh. I don’t really have any really close friends— I only have 2 friends— and I want to feel excited and passionate again. I have to say, I have moments that I feel okay, and I feel like I’m in a better place than I have been in awhile, but I still feel disconnected to my dreams and passions.

If you made it to the end 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

If you have any advice, please comment! Thanks!!"
1410,I’m at the end of my rope,"I’m struggling to maintain a positive outlook on my life and keep the hopes up that things will get better for me. My mental decline started in July 2019 when my wife and I separated, then ending up divorcing (which was unexpected for me), then I lost a couple pets to illness, I lost my good paying job in December, then quarantine hit and I was unable to find work until this past June. Things were looking up because I had a steady job, but in September I was involved in a car accident and my only vehicle was totaled. Which led to me quitting my job because I was commuting an hour to work and was unable to find reliable transportation to and from work because I was still trying to financially recover from not working for six months. I’m currently financially screwed because I can’t afford a new vehicle and I would need one to commute to work. I’ve been applying to jobs in town, but it’s a small town and there aren’t many options, but it’s at least within walking distance. I have no money and have been trying to sell personal items, but I don’t have much items of value and I currently have no money for food or basic necessities. I’m so depressed that I can find a job and that I can’t pick myself back up again. I posted a GoFundMe to help me get a new vehicle, but it’s been unsuccessful (I have gotten $75 toward the car), and I have no friends in the area and my family and I aren’t close anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do."
1411,50mg seroquel with 30mg cymbalta,"50 mg seroquel with 30mg cymbalta

First off I’m going to apologize if this is long but bare with me....

I’ve always struggled with depression and severe anxiety since I was 14. I’m 25 now. Recently I have been having some other health issues along with never ending depression and  anxiety. I’ve been to multiple doctors and therapists about my mental health. And we can never find a combo of meds that helps. My doctor recently prescribed me 50mg of seroquel to take with the cymbalta I’m on that’s not working. I’m not going to lie, I’ve been extremely low these last few months. But the last couple days it’s like I’m on a high. They considered diagnosing me with bipolar but I didn’t fit all the symptoms so now they are also throwing around borderline personality disorder. Which I’m sure if that’s accurate or not. I think I’m just broken. I’ve seen and heard a lot of scary stories about seroquel though. And it honestly makes me terrified to take it. I’ve had it at the pharmacy for a few days now and just picked it up and still haven’t taken it. I’ve explained my concerns with my dr but he doesn’t seem to listen to anything I say about what I’m feeling and what I’m going through. My anxiety has been so bad lately I pass out and feel like I’m dying and having a heart attack. He won’t prescribe me a fast acting anxiety med because “I’m too young for something so addicting”. I guess the point of this post is asking what should I do? I can’t keep living like this."
1412,Nobody seems to get what it's like for someone with anger issues,"I've been an angry fuck since I hit puberty, never in a good mood, feels like I'm ready to snap at any instance, which is sort of true. Obviously, every book and therapist seems to think that anger can be cured by anything. Maybe true for others, not for me. Read a book? Too angry to. Write down what you're angry about? Too angry to. Of course, I'd be labeled as a psychopath, but here's the thing. I don't like it, I don't like that my first thought when I see someone I don't like is curbstomping them. It's not fun, it's terrifying. There might be a day where I'll finally go off the rails and do something I didn't mean to do. That's a scary thought. Fuck, my grandmother once told me ""You're gonna end up in jail or dead one day if you keep this up"". Over 15 years later, no jail and I'm still alive. My anger issues have prevented me from having long term relationships, whether it's romantic or just regular friendships and having a stable relationship with my family. I live far away from my whole family, I only talk to my parents once a week and never talk to my sisters. I just want everyone to know, when people talk mental health, it's usually depressions, anxiety, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, but one that seems to be forgotten is anger issues and I get why, but it's something that needs to be addressed more. If I could get rid of one of my mental problems, my anger would be the first, over the depression, over the anxiety, and over the suicidal thoughts, THAT'S how much I hate it"
1413,Question regarding general happiness and relationships,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing today because I'm finding myself in a peculiar situation. And unfortunately, this time it's not just me who is involved.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just gonna start with a bit of my background. I hope that helps in understanding the situation. In the past, I've simply been unhappy. However, I have a relatively long educational path behind me, i.e. I went to get a master's degree a few years back.

&amp;#x200B;

During that path, I always believed that... somehow the next step would make me happy. When I was in school, I thought ""well, I might be unhappy now, but once I get into college and can choose my courses, I will be happy."" I went to college and was exactly as unhappy, but able to choose my courses.

After that, I thought ""well, I might be unhappy now because I have no money and can essentially not do anything. But once I have a job, I'll have all possibilities in front of me and I will be happy"". Now I have a job and I find myself still unhappy... but with a job.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, during all that time I thought that even if what I thought was incorrect, I still had one solution that would solve it all: a woman in my life. Clearly I was unhappy because I was alone. I don't know how to describe it really. Now and then when I was at home, watching a movie all alone, I thought... if I did this with a woman by my side that I could hold in my arm, I'd just be happy. Is this just a delusion from watching too many Hollywood movies? I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I started dating pretty late in my life. But I now have, and I have a woman in my life. She seems to really like me. The problem is... she doesn't make me happy. I am the exact same unhappy person I was before, but now I have a woman in my arm when watching a movie. She just doesn't make me happy and that's why I have kind of refused to \_really\_ open up to her in the past. I hug and kiss her a lot. It just seems like more of a reflex than an expression of love. I don't feel happy, at all.

&amp;#x200B;

So... she now demands a statement from me regarding our relationship. Should I stay with her or not? And every time I think about it, I keep coming back to just... I am not happy when I'm with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Are my expectations regarding a relationship just wrong? Should I not feel happy inside when I am with her? Will it always just be like this? Do other people truly feel happy when they are with their partner?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this should be different. But I have no experience and really no idea what to do. I have tried getting professional help in the past but seemed kind of hard where I'm from (e.g. waiting for three months for a therapist appointment seems useless...).

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate feedback and advice on this. Not really sure what do to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

I will just submit this and hope for the best, without proof reading. Otherwise I'll just reword or delete half of it. This is probably all over the place."

1415,Do suicidal urges / ideations ever get better?,"I have been suicidal since I was 12, I’m 29(F) now. I struggle with this so much that I have basically lost the ability to problem solve because my default is to instead dive into planning my death and the details around it. I have survived an attempt and I have been interrupted from 2 other attempts. I think about it all the time. I struggle with feeling out of place, broken, wrong, and like a person who doesn’t deserve happiness. I am also a recovering alcoholic, and was raised in an abusive dysfunctional neglected environment. I just want to know if there’s a shot this will ever get better, if anyone has ever gotten relief. Anti-depressants and talk therapy, including inpatient psychiatric hospitalization haven’t helped. I’m currently planning on hoarding pain meds from a shoulder injury to possibly overdose. I just don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this."

I’ve been through some shit let’s just say that. I guess I’m numb you know I don’t really feel anything.

1419,5 Ways to Explain Racism to a Child,"**Here 5 Ways to Explain Racism to your Child**

*  **Educating Yourself About Racism**
*  Get yourself up to speed with that means of race. Words like race are used so frequently it could appear to be there that means it is simple, but the phrase is sincerely misused a lot. Whilst used effectively, race “refers to a category of those who percentage certain inherited bodily characteristics, inclusive of pores and skin shade, facial features, or stature.
* Learn the definition of racism. Racism refers to a “gadget of benefit based on race.” This system of gain regularly influences various elements of lifestyles, together with get admission to monetary opportunities (like jobs or loans) and political impact.
* Apprehend prejudice. Prejudice refers to a “preconceived judgment or opinion, frequently based totally on restricted statistics.” Prejudice is each resulting from racism, and it perpetuates racism.
* Get comfortable questioning and speak about racism. It is a good concept to speak about issues of racism with different adults and to perform a little self-mirrored image earlier than coaching kids about racism. It is able to be especially helpful to speak with adults who are of a different race than yourself.
* Plan to interact in an ongoing conversation together with your child about racism. As kids develop, they’ll have reviews that make them consider racism in more depth, and as they mature, they may be equipped to take on heavier topics approximately racism. You won’t cowl the entire subject matter of racism in one discussion. It will likely be a slow, ever-evolving conversation with your baby.
*  **Helping Kids Respond to Acts of Racism**
*  Understand signs that your toddler has encountered racism. Your child may not recognize or let you know in the event that they had been the victim of racism. Study a few caution signs and symptoms that could suggest that your infant has had a terrible revel in. If you may apprehend the difficulty, you will be better equipped to cope with it.
* Help your baby know what to do if they revel in racism directed at them. Educate your infant to apply words like “prevent” to place a stop to the conduct. Have them practice pronouncing, “forestall, don’t speak to me that way.” you could also have them exercise asking a person for assist.
* Fortify family and community ties to build resilience. One of the fine methods to improve your child’s confidence and foster a fantastic racial identification is to ensure they sense supported and related to others. Do activities together as their own family. Sign your child up for sports like sports, dance, or artwork training in the community. And spend time with superb position models to your network.

1420,Why does it feel like my heart isn't there?,"I'm not the best at explaining what I feel. But I my try to best. 

I think sometimes I care too much. So recently I think I've been using alcohol to try to combat that so I dont care as much. I get anxious now when I'm not drinking and feel like people are talking about me or making fun of me and some of them probably are. Because I act off when Im off the alcohol.  I've been using alcohol to try to numb the anxiety and drink when I'm at work (like right now) and feel a buzz so that I'm not anxious and feel a buzz, I guess, and dont care as much. I think it's getting to the point where I need the alcohol to feel normal. I've been drinking alot since july. And in October I've drank nearly every day. 

But if I drink heavy, the next day I get some withdrawals like anxiety, my hands shiver, I feel depressed, but it goes away within a day or 2. So I dont think I'm dependent on it yet. 

But lately I've been feeling, I guess numb. I dont know how to describe it. But the best I can say is that there was a moment where I was feeling like shit about my life. I dont like to make things out to mean more than what they do but I was talking to someone and I felt something for them. But they're toxic and i know it would never work out. I was feeling bad about it, coming down a hangover I think. I blacked out the night before and dont remember what happened. My heart was throbbing and hurting thinking about it but out of nowhere it just sinked down and then I felt nothing. It felt like my heart wasnt there anymore. Like it just disappeared. Physically and emotionally. Ever since then I've been feeling numb and apathy. I dont know what that means though. And I'm a bit scared. Even now I got a bit emotional writing it but now I dont feel anything in my heart. It's like I dont even have a heart. I put my hand to my chest where my heart should be and I cant feel it. I just want to know what that means."
1421,TW: PTSD/Sexual Assault + Gaslighting Please Talk To Me,"So my mom decided to clean the bird's cage. She put the top on the floor and the bird sat on top. We just got a dog. She has tried to attack the bird before but we caught her first. She kept staring at Sunny (bird) and getting closer. I would talk to her and call her away and try to distract her. But my mom kept telling me to knock it off. So I stopped. Then Tessa (dog) ran at Sunny and was inches away when I yelled her name. She's being trained to be my assistance dog so she knows to run to me when I call her. She told me ""Shut up. You're so overdramatic. You blow everything out of proportion just like your father."" (My father is abusive so this was extremely hurtful.) I stayed there a little bit before she started doing it again. I had a class at that time anyway so it was a good excuse and I left. 

The class was led by a therapist on how to recognize and deal with PTSD. All I did was disassociate the whole time. Now I feel so alone. (I was r\*ped at 10 yrs old). While I was in the class, my mom was talking to my mom about how I need to grow up and ""get over myself"".

And yesterday I made a horrible mistake. (Not related in any way to this and no one in my house knew about it.) 

AND one of my friends said it would be really convenient for him to call instead of messaging but I'm hard of hearing so I couldn't. I haven't opened his latest message because I am so guilty.

AND another friend messages me everyday but I haven't messaged back in a while but I read every single one. I can't message back now because It's been too long. I love them (platonically) but I messed up so much and probably ruined the friendship.

AND everyone in my house makes fun of the fact that I have to eat a liquid diet (dysphagia). I haven't been able to see a doctor but they call me ""lazy"" and ""a baby"" because I have to eat ""baby food"" (Ensure). 

I just feel like such a burden on everyone. Like I'm not really a person, I feel like I don't exist and I don't really matter. I feel like everyone hates me, even my therapist ignores me *and I pay her to talk to me.*

1422,First time panic attack,"I had a panic attack today. I also had one three days ago that I was so afraid of that I called a paramedic because I genuinely thought I was going to die. I only realised what was happening today. I never realised just how different they are from anxiety attacks. Anxiety I can fight through by talking myself through it and pinpointing what set it off. There was no reason this happened. It was like being drop kicked. The room span, I got so unbelievably dizzy, had this really metallic taste in my mouth, my hands started shaking, my face went red hot. I thought I was going to pass out. It was like a crazy adrenaline rush. I ended up having to phone someone while pacing in circles to calm me down because once again I thought I would die. Has anyone ever had anything similar and do you have any tips to get through it if it happens again. I have had anxiety and depression for many years so know how to hold against such things, but I have never had to deal with this."
1423,"Calming Down quickly? This is either a mixed episode or panic attack, either way I’m not doing okay.","
I do have bipolar 2, first and foremost, but I also have pretty severe anxiety. I’m not so sure what’s happening with me right now. I think I’m having a mixed manic/depressive episode, but it could be a panic attack? I’ve had both, and I know what triggered it. I’m competing in a zoom tournament for competitive public speaking and acting from home right now. I have a piece I perform that unfortunately makes me relive some trauma, but I perform really well with it. In this very huge tournament, I made it to the semifinal. I gave my all into that round, and I didn’t make it to the final. I got really upset about it because I poured my heart into the round and didn’t make it. But I found this out right before I had to perform for another semifinal round, and it made me get really nervous and mess up in the round. 

That was a lot, and obviously I take too much stock in what people think of me, but goddamnit I work so hard. So so hard. And my team has shown a history of only caring about me when I make final rounds. So it kind of sent me into a downward spiral (I was already on adderall today too), and now I can’t stop frantically breathing and crying. Maybe it’s just a panic attack? Very dangerous thoughts are coming in my head though. I know this is stupid, something so seemingly small triggered this, but I really don’t feel okay right now. 

I don’t know, but I have another semifinal to perform for, so I really need to calm down before my next round. Please let me know any tips or tricks you may have to help me out."

1425,coping mechanisms to calm down and deal with anxiety?,"what are some coping mechanisms or exercises that you use to deal with anxiety? i'm making an app with different prompts, exercises, breathing, etc."
1426,Being too sensitive? Feeling misunderstood by my (23F) BF (23M),"Thank you to anyone who reads this in advance! 

I've been thinking a lot about this and I'd really appreciate another view on this! Whenever I'm upset, especially about something related to my bf of 2,5 years or our relationship and I bring it up to him, his reaction is almost always a minimizing (its not that bad) or a sort of neutralizing (then do xx) one which doesn't make me feel heard/understood. I told him about this and he said that he is just trying to propose a solution or so. I once had a time where my mental health was very low and a lot of things caused me anxieties, I was very sensitive and it was hard for him (but would have been to anybody probably) to comprehend (although he always stood by me!). I think my issues now I rooted in that time. When something upsets me he can argument against it with rational arguments and it makes me feel like I'm being silly/petty but at the same time the feelings are still there..in  a way it frustrates me and makes me feel guilty about even being so sensitive in certain aspects. My problem is also, that these kind of situations are usually really stressful to me..it's like suddenly my brain is blank and I can't properly articulate myself, while he is super calm which -at least in my head- makes me always seem like I'm overreacting. I guess this also has something to do with us perceiving/assessing certain situations differently.

Anyway, I feel like I can't think objectively about this anymore. Like I get the feeling that maybe there is not really a problem but that my reaction/feelings is/are. 

Can anyone relate? How can I tackle this?

1428,Helpful advice?,What can I do to avoid hitting mental rock bottom? Or is it possible to take it like a champ and let it be? How to recognize symptoms of incoming depressive episode? I read a lot about exercise and changing your diet but I want to know what is the most effective way of dealing with mental illness which is depression.
1429,Some more things,"So to just add on to what i said previously here are some more things i want to know if it’s normal or not

I have a constant feeling that I’m not where i think i am and that I’m really somewhere else even though it looks like I’m in my room or whenever i am (and I probably am)

My personality just changes when I’m in a certain or around certain people or by myself 

I always feel the need to do everything evenly (eat an even amount of food, have an even amount of footsteps, say things evenly in my head etc)

I’m scared of failing things and have a high expectation of myself 

Sometimes i just want to stab myself for no reason

And i say sorry for almost everything and i feel bad for the person i said sorry to because i feel like they think they’ve done something wrong."
1430,How would I tell the difference if someone wants me to improve for my own personal growth vs. wanting to change me?,"For example, I understand if what I do might not be the best/healthiest way to do it and I appreciate them letting me know, but how could I tell the difference if they wanted me to change something not for myself but for themselves?"
1431,I hate my new job and I have no outlet,"So I just started at an amazon fulfilment centre, Jesus Christ I’ve never had a job where I felt so isolated and lonely, and that’s not even to mention the work, which is just the most monotonous work I’ve ever experienced, at times I’ve found it borderline unbearable. 

Now that gyms are closed I can no longer work out and that’s a huge deal for me as I normally use it as therapy/healthy outlet for my depression. 

I think my mental health is about to take a huge nose dive and I thank god that I have my girlfriend who is really supportive, otherwise I don’t think I’d be able to cope. 

Reading this back to myself it sounds dramatic but I’m not really a strong person, ah man, shits about to get bad."
1432,Your Mental Health Is A Priority,"Hello everyone. How are you today? 

With Winter here, the rates of people with suicide thoughts will start to rise up more and more. At moments like this, we need to stick together as one big family. Help one another, support one another, be there for one another. If there’s anything bothering you, have a read on this sub, people are more than happy to listen to you, including myself. 

Your Mental Health is a massive priority. It has been an incredibly tough year for us all, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. It’s not only your Mental Health that’s a priority, it’s also your:

- Happiness 
- Existence 
- Self-Care

They are *all* a massive priority. Your Mental Health is much more important than other people’s opinions, your career and money. Before you get a career or make money by doing so, you need to be healthy mentally, emotionally and physically. If you feel weak, disassociate or feeling like you should be hiding from the world, it’s completely fine, this is why *we* are here for you. 

Make Mental Health your **#1** priority. If you’re not happy with who you are, how do you expect anyone else to be happy with you? It all starts with *YOU*. Give yourself self-care, time and attention that you so desperately need. If you physically can’t get it from yourself, the lovely people of r/mentalhealth will offer their hand to you. 

You’re so worthy and we care deeply about you. Keep on going, keep on fighting and remember, make sure your Mental Health is a priority. 

Take care all! :)"
1433,How not use mental health as an excuse to be treated poorly and how nagivate around it w someone close,"So, the person I am casually seeing (fwb kind of situation) got divorced 5 months ago and he is grieving and going through different mental states.. but during the last two months he has been feeling usually low and his mental state affect mine greatly.. so I can go see him feeling ok but after staying with him or after we have sex and I just feel heavy.. also sometimes I feel he has became less intimate (frequenccy of non sexual touching) and even self-centred sometimes. I am not judging him at all, and he is actually a very caring and intimate person and I know how depression or anxiety can affect our selves and our rs, I just want to know how to navigate around this without being constantly let down or feeling sad or disappreaciated.."

1435,I don’t know if this is what these subreddit is for but I needed a place to let it out,"I feel so empty I let everything in my life go because of how I felt and now I feel like I have nothing . Nothing I do seems to make me happy or just feel anything . I got so sick of staring at the walls in my room I decided to spent days taking it apart and making something I thought I’d be happy in only to do it all and lie down feeling the same . I don’t see the point in anything I only am going through with my education to make my parents happy . My last relationship was a disaster and it has left me worried that I’m going to do too much or do too little or just do the wrong thing and mess up with the person I’ve met who I genuinely want to be with . I don’t know what to do and I’ve told no one how I feel because Ik there’s not much they can do and I don’t want to worry them or seem like I want attention . I just want to not exist any more every day feels the same and my life feels pointless and like I’ve wasted it already . Sorry if this seems like a pity post I just needed to get some things off my mind and I didn’t know where to go to ,to do so."
1436,Suicidal but too afraid to die.,"I've been feeling this way for as long as I can remember. 

I don't want to sound self-loathing, but I am so so lonely.  I have no close friends, no close family and I feel like I'm the perfect case for committing suicide right now.  


I don't feel like anybody would question it, I almost feel like people would be very accepting of it because of how my life is. I imagine them saying ""Oh she was very isolated"" and ""She didn't really have anyone"" ... I basically feel like nobody would blame me if I did decide to go ahead with it.

But I've suffered with suicidal thoughts for years now and never actually done anything, I'm too scared. I'm a wimp.  


I guess what I'd really like to ask, after reading my life story, if I was to do it, would you blame me?

Here goes...  


\-I was sexually abused from the ages of 4 to the ages of 10 by my stepdad and on one occasion at the age of 11 by another stepdad.  


\-My mother was very absent during my childhood, she never hugged me, called me beautiful or said she was proud of me. She knows nothing about me. I didn't really have any close role models growing up.

\-I struggled with relationships throughout my school life, dated older boys who treated me badly and started having sex at the age of 13.  I struggled throughout school with self esteem and depression.  


\-I moved out at 19 with an older boyfriend who would psychically and emotionally abuse me. This lasted for 2.5 years.

\-During our relationship, my boyfriend kept giving me opiate based medication. I don't blame him for my addiction, but this is where my 4 year daily addiction to strong opiate medication began. 

\-After that relationship, I became homeless. My mother didn't want me back. After a week of living in a colleagues spare room, I was given a place in a local hostel, I stayed there for 1.5 years. 

\-6 months ago, I decided to withdraw cold turkey from my addiction. It was the most painful and messed up time in my entire life.  


\-2 weeks ago, I was hit by a car. I wasn't severely injured but I did end up in hospital. 

So that's a brief description of my life. I know people have it a lot worse, and I am blessed that I have held down jobs during all of this and been self sufficient the entire time. But I just feel like my life is all leading to my inevitable suicide. 

  
Right now, I have a full time office job, filing paperwork and sitting a desk all day. I can't drive. I have my own flat but it's not decorated.  I spend every day living the same reality, and no matter how hard I try, nothing changes. I have nobody close to me. I will be spending Christmas alone again this year. 

If you had my life, would you do it?"
1437,Pregnant anorexic girlfriend,"I'm a man who met a woman on a dating website in March and things moved very quickly with us. By the Summer, we were living with one another (Sigh, I know, you don't need to tell me). She's 12 weeks pregnant which is the other complication. There's so much to write so I apologize for the length. We've been together for about 7 months.

She put out from the beginning that she had anorexia/orthorexia, but that she was utilizing multiple support systems, such as a support group, two therapists and was in the start of a nutritionist. Of all of those components seemed indicative of someone trying very hard.

Once we moved in, the extent of the eating disorder really kicked into high gear. For several months, we were eating out every day, which was triggering for me, as someone who has struggled with his own weight my entire life (I probably had some eating disorder tendencies for years too).

I tried doing things like offering to cook, or look at recipes together, or cook together. I asked If she wanted to meal plan together, went to her online support group, her therapy, etc. Eating has become harder and harder. I cannot begin to tell you, that trying to come up with where and what to eat has literally taken hours. HOURS! It's devolved into hours of upsettness, and then I become panicked and upset, and then I become upset, and at times it's become a long deep delve into why I'm upset and have made it about me. She's pregnant now and sometimes it's taken hours to figure out what to eat. She tells me ""We need to do this as a team"", as I look in the kitchen and wrack my brain. I stare at the fridge, freezer and pantry, and she rejects most of what we have. She often says there has to be something and that I must be missing something. It's infuriating. It became a huge fight when I told her I wanted to set up boundaries and no longer do that.
Her eating has gotten so bad that a few times she's started to nearly pass out and then I have had to feed her and lift her head up to drink. It's happened four or five times since May? It happened twice this month, and over the weekend I was so angry. I expressed to her I was angry but in my own misguided way tried to comfort her when she was upset about the gain weight from pregnancy. I became pretty angry with her, and then she became upset, and when she said to me, ""You need to manage yourself"", I for the first time got very angry and shouted, ""All I do is manage, I'm fucking tired of it"" and then walked away.

I also don't sleep much anymore, guys. I'm often going to bed around 2 or 3 am and wake up at 8:30 am. She has issues with sleeping. I tried making boundaries with that but she gets...pissy? She'll fall asleep on the couch, she'll continue to ask for more time, pass out, continue. Early yesterday I told her I wasn't feeling well and wanted to go to bed early. Around 12:30 I said I'd like to go to sleep and it'd be nice if she joined. She asked for 30 more minutes. Then spent another 10 minutes drinking at 1 am. Then when I said, ""Ok, let's go to bed""---she said for two more minutes for her stomach to settle. I said, ""Nope, I'm going to bed"" and kissed her forehead goodnight. I didn't feel great leaving a pregnant woman on the couch to sleep, but this was an issue before pregnancy. I didn't raise my voice or anything, I just said it matter of factly. She wasn't happy this morning about it.

She also doesn't bathe anymore since I've moved in. She's averaging about once a week now. Lately once every 1.5 weeks. I've helped bathe her twice, literally putting soap in her hair. She seems limited in her 3 months of pregnancy, but she was only showering once or twice a week before all this too. For a while, it became a big deal if I wanted to shower because she wanted to shower with me. For a period I was showering once or twice a week too, and hated it. That definitely stopped.

In the past she would ask me about her body for hours. Like---what I found attractive, why I found it attractive, what about It I liked. That if I liked her when she was thinner. I initially tried commenting very little about her appearance and just telling her I love her and that she's sexy to me. She hated that and felt ashamed and thought I was skirting around her appearance. I expressed twice that this made me uncomfortable.

The apartment has been a mess. In august it was an extreme mess, as in you could barely walk without bumping into something. She'd become overwhelmed if I tried. We were moving me in, planning a vacation and doing multiple things....but for months it remained that way. I finally cleaned the entire place up when she wasn't feeling good one day and finished up while she slept from morning sickness.

She's telling me I'm putting a lot of resentment on her (I think I am) and that I'm tearing her down. I have expressed being upset, that it feels hard for me. I've told her that sometimes it makes me feel sorry for myself. I've expressed how upset it can be with constantly not knowing what to eat. She feels dug at and hurt when I do. She said when she's critical of herself she sometimes hears my voice now, which I feel bad about.

She dreads seeing her nutritionist. She also doesn't tell her therapists anything. She tells me she doesn't get anything out of them. She obscures a lot to them and keeps it very surface level.

I expressed wanting to join a support group, but she shot it down. She said when I've gone to them I make it more about the eating disorder and made her feel like shit. I asked if we could do couples counseling, she said only if I am in individual therapy (Which I am). She said tonight that couples counseling isn't what she wants right now, she said she doesn't want me to dig into her and hurt her feelings. She dislikes my current therapist. I've had two therapists tell me I seem ok, with the exception of overwhelming events that have occurred the past two years. I'll be honest, hearing this tonight made me feel extremely isolated and gaslighted.

She feels I'm putting too much on her and not looking into myself. The sad thing is, I'm a therapist. If my own client came to me about all this, I think I'd be astonished. I just feel so stuck. And leaving a pregnant woman seems atrocious. I'm becoming so depressed, exhausted, drained. I cannot believe I've gotten myself into this.

In summary, I moved too fast with someone, her anorexia has really become an issue, I think I have become resentful and feel stuck. I also feel burned out.

Honestly, I'm so unsure what to do. I feel like I need help or some liquid courage."
1438,BPD/EUPD - Should I take my meds or should I stay true to myself?,"Hello! I've been diagnosed with EUPD something like 3 years ago. In the first month after diagnosis, I took the prescribed medicine, but decided to not take it, because I feared it would impact my personality, in a way, that after it, I will not be the same. I was afraid the medicine would rip me of my absurd humor and creativity. I could live with the disorder without any help for quite some time. I knew I will have extremely good and extremely bad times, but for the last years my moods did not change so frequently, like before (both happy and sad phases would maybe last a few weeks, wherease, before that the best case was maybe some days with the same mood at max). I could control it pretty well. But lately I started noticing a sudden shift in the mood swings' frequency. I would, again, snap in an instant and would change my mind about things pretty fast. I've got again nervous outbursts and panic attack like mood waves rushing over me, just when a second ago I was on the top of life and was overly happy.

This whole thing got me thinking, if it were better, if I started taking the medicine? But if I take it, I can't drink with my friends after uni and I fall asleep pretty fast after taking it. But these are ""just"" physical inconveniences, taking it would go against my principles and I fear, as I've written above, I would lose the essence of my personality.

I am torn, please, if someone has ever had the same problem, some advice would be greatly appreciated!"
1439,Can i please talk to someone?,"Hi i was wondering if i could to talk to someone please? I have just been feeling really down lately and have almost, but stopped myself from ending it multiple times in the last 2 weeks. I just want to talk about anything i don’t mind. More of a distraction idk. I have been crying a bit today and yeah. I guess i just need a distraction from everythibg at the minute before i probably try again."
1440,Even if nobody reads this..,"- writing is a form of therapy that releases the pressure in my heart and brain and allows me to cope. For those who don’t personally know me, I am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle I’m facing inside. I’ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty. Watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors, laughter, gatherings, hot meals, and an ear, to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways I never thought possible. People I’ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place called home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I’ll ever feel family like I have over the several years I’ve built and nurtured my circle. I don’t believe for a single moment that I wasn’t meant to experience the connections and the love that I’ve felt here, but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes. The halting end of a time that saved my life. Nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the Navy, but it never gets easier. No more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where are respective families are absent. No more beer pong nights with 90’s hits, or spontaneous card game nights. My world has fallen silent. Laughter became tears, joy became pain, and I don’t know what to do with the things that I feel. You’d think I’d be good at this as I’ve been away from those I love and grew up with for 7 years. However, I am not. I am truly weak inside and empty. I didn’t know how else to express the grief that I feel other than to write this out, though I know not many will make it this far into the novels that I write about my internal war. Please hold your friends close while you have the time, because tomorrow you could be moving across the country with nothing but a pack pack and shoes and nobody to walk beside you. And that pain, I don’t think anyone deserves to feel."

1442,Mixing Lithium and Marijuana,"Hello, my little brother has bipolar depression and takes lithium. He's been smoking marijuana a lot more (about 2 times a day) and I was wondering if it's bad to mix lithium and marijuana? Does it affect body health or mental health the most? If he feels fine right now, is it okay or would it be building up towards a future breakdown/episode? Thank you."
1443,Would be Fine if I didn't Hate People so Much,"Hi,

I deeply and sincerely regret being born. I hate people so much. Everything they do and say gets on my very last nerve. Mostly they are just stupid, angry, judgmental, and vindictive. I feel like I will never win with them no matter what I do. Even if I work hard, lose weight, and have a decent personality, I will always have the same slow, stupid brain (ADD or maybe LD) that has always caused them to make fun of me. No matter what I have going for me, that will always hang over my head, and they will always be able to knock me down a peg. Another very irritating thing I have noticed lately is the lack of objectivity that most people display when dealing with politics or anything that is connected to them emotionally. The only time they are ever objective is when they are judging other people.

I don't even want to see the good in people because the good in them is not worth the rest. I get angry when I see the good in them because it is the only reason they have not purged the earth of the curse that they truly are. I would rather them just go ahead and have no empathy so that they wipe eachother from this planet.

Please help me want to see the good in people."

1445,Feeling bad after breaking own moral rules.,"Hello.

I am 21 and I always was really sensitive person with large capacity of love and natural need to help other people. However my biggest dream was to have happy family. 

But 3 months ago I finally broke up with my ex-boyfriend who was using me for sex and telling lot of lies without any guilt and making fun of me being stupid. First I couldn't understand how people be like that and stupidly believed that he is not truly like this but finally I left him and I am ok with it. The bad thing is that during that time I prostituted my self 3 times... I know it was my decision but I really felt like I dont deserve anything. I dont know what to do right now. I feel like my love life, dreams and nature are destroyed. Who would want to be with a person like that. I cant imagine living my life just for myself or for money or with another sensitive person but with lies about my past. Only thing I can think about now its that I can become some volunteer if I wotn have family. Thats really hard."
1446,Men And Mental Health,"Men are “**strong**” and “**powerful**”. Men don’t need to show off their emotions as they can take care of it.... this isn’t true. Men *NEED* to talk about their own Mental Health, instead of keeping it in themselves. So, this brings the million dollar question, **why don’t men talk about their Mental Health more often**? Well, there are many different answers to it.... 

The *International Men’s Day* in 2015 created a survey for over 1,000 people to uncover men’s attitude towards their own Mental Health... here is what they found: 

- 77% of men have suffered with stress/depression/anxiety once. 
- According to the men in this survey, work (32%) is the biggest pressure in their life, while **Finance** comes in at 31% and **Health** at 23%. 
- The vast majority of the men who participated in the survey said that their Mental Health is having a negative impact on their parenting ability, their performance in work and relationships. 
- 40% of the 1,000 men said that they would take suicide and self-harm thoughts than to get professional help. 

That last point is a crucial point to look at. Instead of receiving the help they so desperately need and deserve, they would rather cram their head with negative and dark thoughts. For all the boys or men reading this, if you’re in a bad place, get help as soon as you can, the longer you wait, the worse it’ll get. **Please, if you’re in need of someone to let out your emotions and thoughts, *WE* are here for you**. 

Here are the main **reasons** as to why men don’t want to talk about their Mental Health: 

- 1. I’ve learnt to deal with it - (40%)
- 2. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone - (36%) 
- 3. I’m too embarrassed/ashamed - (29%)
- 4. There’s a negative stigma around this type of thing - (20%)
- 5. I don’t want to admit that I need help or support - (17%) 
- 6. I don’t want others to see me as being weak - (16%) 
- 7. I have nobody to task to - (14%) 

Almost a quarter of the men (22%) admitted during the survey that they would not feel comfortable talking to a GP or any other professional as they believe they would be wasting the GP’s or other professional’s time. 

There’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed about when it comes to Mental Health. After all, it is a life or death discussion. Being able to talk about how you’re feeling will help you greatly, you’ll feel the weight of the world falling off your shoulders and a breath of fresh air. Men go through different situations, we all make mistakes, some worse than others, but no matter what it is, you’ll receive the help and support that you deserve. It’s time to talk, and the time is NOW!

- Your Mental Health is important. It’s as simple as that.

- To encourage care and support. 
- It will lower the risks of suicide.

1447,I need to be in a institution?,"It's dark and empty inside, my health is not good and I have a mind of a child.
I do things without understanding the outcome, the more I understand things the more depressed I become.
Sometimes I would rather die than being in my situation, alone. I've had nights where I walk towards cars, motivated by the temporary happiness over the prospect of ending the pain. Have not got hit by a car, lucky that nobody got out a car to confront me.

True, if I hate my situation so much then why don't I change things? Well I'm already am in this process but the covid shit is making everything take such a long time and it's always the weekend when I want to make changes, I'm a complete night owl. My mind doesn't work through the day, I sleep until the afternoon, and my mind works at night then I get depressed about the awareness of the situation.

Sometimes, I just want to go out and go on a murder spree or something dodgy, just to show what it's like to be me. But I'm gonna not do those things and die alone, just so I won't hurt people. Best to put the bomb in a secure place so it doesn't cause damage. I'm just a ticking time bomb.

My emotions and thoughts don't work it stops me from wanting things, and it stops me from wanting relationships or being able to form meaningful relationships. I feel closer to the warmth of my own blood than pretty much anyone, blood makes me feel warm and so do hot baths."
1448,I posted this on r/askdocs a while ago don’t get any response,"Update: this never happened again after those 3 times so I don’t know how serious this is is also all of them were at night 


I 16F heard and so someone that wasn’t there


I suspected I might struggle with depression and anxiety (also struggle with self harm if that matters ) for a while and tried to speak with it with my mother and wasn’t taken seriously at all and I was hospitalized a while ago because a pretty bad panic attack that made me pass out. 

The doctor said I was showing symptoms of anxiety disorder even tho I wasn’t able to be fully honest with them cuz my parents were in the room they did a bunch of tests and nothing was wrong with my heart or anything physically and the doctor concluded it was a panic attack after few other visits I was given a medication that helped with physical symptoms of anxiety it was called procoralan and I just stop taking it because I was told to take it for 3 weeks only I also take ventoline as needed for my asthma.


Here is the seeing stuff part I was just laying in bed trying to sleep and I say a man and heard him say something I wasn’t really sure what it was for 3 seconds and that was it this the most recent rime it’s happened just now. Also this happens 2 other times and it scares the shit out of me and I can’t sleep after it and I’m sure it wasn’t just a dream because I was wide awake (but zoned out) screamed “what” and my sister asked me who I was taking to. Also it happened 3 times in total and all experiences were the same and I don’t remember when was the first time it happened."
1449,Tips for waiting until ADHD-diagnose,"Some info. I am a 24M who has a strong suspicion that i might have ADHD.

Through all my childhood, my parents have heard from teachers and friends that i might have it. They have always thought it was ""over-diagnosed"" and therefore have never sent me to evaluation. Now, i've taken the step to go to a psychiatrist after reading about the symptoms myself. My wife and i can't believe how many of the symptoms fit, and how much it would help to get treatment, both me and us as husband/wife.

Here is my problem: I have to wait 10 weeks to see a psychiatrist, 10 WEEKS! I don't know if i can wait that long!?!

While many say 10 weeks is quite a short time, i can't help but think this seems like forever. The thoughts about me possibly having ADHD are so strong, that i focus on anything else (marriage, education, friends, hobbies). It's like a parasite in my brain that i can't get rid off! The feeling of a thought invading my brain like a virus is not new, but usually i don't have to wait 10 weeks for it to resolve!

Have anyone of you had the same feeling or been in the same situation? Would love to get some advice, because the wait is killing me..."
1450,Anxiety Affecting My Life,"I know you guys like it short and simple, but over the past few years, anxiety has been preventing me from making any progress as a human being. I'm going to bullet the issues that anxiety has for me so that you guys can easily refer back to them in order to help me out here. 

\- Friendships: I get really bad social anxiety when I'm with them in person, and that leads me to eventually act up and do something I would eventually regret later. For example, my friends would be talking quietly and I would automatically assume that they are talking about me. Due to this, I start to get irrationally irritated and angry for no reason which can be seen in my face. They then conclude that it could have been something that they did so they feel kind of weird and anxious too and avoid contact with me. It's little things like this that make me frustrated easily and can ruin my entire day. After the hangout, I'll be ruminating for hours on end and sometimes will lay in bed at night for hours as well thinking about all the subtle things I did that could make me come off as weird or anything that is not chill. I'm tired of this because it clearly bothers my friends and makes them think I have a problem with them when in reality it is me. I then try to patch things during the hangout by consistently trying to make conversation with the person who I acted up to, making me seem like a weirdo and a kid for even acting up over a small thing. I'm mature but my mind keeps playing games with me. 

\- Work: I automatically assume everybody only deals with me because I work there and we have to collaborate together, other than that, I can tell they feel a certain way about me and think I'm kind of weird. When I approach other workers I can tell that they sometimes act inauthentic or sometimes seem a little anxious just being around me and it sucks. I only have a few friends at work who put a little bit of effort into making it seem like we're cool. I feel like a kid. 

\- School/Hobbies: I deal with my social anxiety so badly on a daily basis that I have no energy to do anything else. I feel like my brain is going crazy and that I can't stop having these thoughts. I put the most minimal effort in all my schoolwork and when it comes to working out, I usually prioritize entertainment and having fun over discipline and hard work. 

Overall, I feel like my anxiety is causing me to lose motivation to do anything remotely productive, and is making me become an extremely toxic person who I wouldn't even want to hangout with myself. I'm tired of making my friends feel like they have to always pick me up and acting like a crutch when we hangout, and I'm tired just myself overall. In no way am I suicidal, as I feel like I have the strength to carry on and would never stoop that low, but somehow I've managed to stoop this low and it's killing me. I just want to reiterate that I am in no way suicidal so no worries on that. I have a family I have to take care of. I just want peace of mind and to be happy with my life. 

As of right now, I feel like I could potentially have multiple mental illnesses due to my inability to take care of myself and I just need help with how to start becoming me again. I come off as a very insecure people pleaser and a person who tries to hide their emotions only to have it blow up in public and embarrass himself, looking like a full blown kid when it's the anxiety that is making my life so hard. I'm 22 years old now and I don't wanna waste any more of my time with this issue. When I talk to other individuals, I hyperfocus on what they may be paying attention to about me and it's hard to have eye contact with them as I can't seem to hold a decent expression without either becoming shy or becoming emotionless. I stopped hanging out with my friends because I don't want to go out and cause problems for anyone. I feel like a mess and I have a terrible outlook on life right now."

1452,Should I see a doctor ?,"I don’t know where to post this or anything but: 
I’ve had a problem for a while now. I was always shy and reserved since childhood and never very outgoing I guess. But during adolescence I got very mad at the people I was close too (only my family, never friends). But I calmed down a bit after so I thought everything was fine until summer of 2 years ago. I had a hard time socially with my « friends » and I almost cut myself, I had serious anxiety and I got mad at my family and myself. (Even though my parents had no idea I was suffering and were mad at me for being annoying which is understandable). I thought it was gone after a while but about a year ago it all came back, and I can’t help myself. I have a bf (I got with him that summer before things went bad) and I told him everything, about my anger being out of control etc, but I always get mad at him for no reason and I don’t want to be mad. He can’t help me and I can’t help myself. I don’t think I could ever talk to my parents about this because they would just brush it off, but I know something is off. I get mad for hours for no reason, then I cry then I laugh, it’s like I can’t control my emotions. 
When I get mad it’s impossible for me to calm down, I can feel in my body that I’m mad and I just can’t stop it. I also get sad and have moments where I get super anxious, but I really think my anger is the bigger problem here.
I’m also afraid to go to the doctor, I’ve never talked about mental health to anyone but my bf 
And I don’t want to get mad at him anymore...

1453,Am I too attached?,(15 year old female) I have OCD and the only people who know what my intrusive thoughts are is my mom and brother (only because they asked what the thoughts were) my dad and other brother know I have OCD they just don’t know the thoughts but I have a hard time being comfortable around my brother my dad( I have a wonderful relationship with my dad and brother! They have just never asked what the thoughts were because they know it’s personal) and my friends or friends parents because I’m afraid I will accidentally say one of my intrusive thoughts I feel like I am too attached to my mom and brother and they are kind of like my reassurance which I know is bad (I am in therapy and just started medication) does anyone have any advice?
1454,Don't know what to do :/ (this is long),"&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I’m writing this cuz I don’t really know what to do anymore. I just cried really hard for about an hour, something that’s become a pretty common occurrence as of late. Everything just seems to be getting worse and there’s no end in sight. I really don’t know how much longer I can take it. I’m not suicidal or anything but I feel like with the way things are going I might start to be n that’s really scary, but as of right now I don’t wanna die it’s just really really hard to exist. It’s winter now where I live, or starting to be winter, n daylight savings just happened so it gets dark around 4 something n that’s definitely fucking with me a ton. I just don’t know what to do with myself and all my hobbies don’t bring me any joy anymore, nothing really does at the moment. So I just sit in my room n scroll through whatever on my phone for a while until it’s late enough to go to sleep. N I don’t have any close friends where I live, I have a group of friends that I grew up with and we’ll all hang out every so often but other than that we don’t really text that much, especially about how we’re feeling. I also don’t really connect with them about anything, I have completely different interests than they do. That’s fine obviously but it becomes really isolating because of it, especially when you pretty much know everybody around where you live and it’s not even like I can go out to look for other options. I have some closer friends a city over who I connect with on a deeper level than my hometown friends but they’re all more of acquaintances. We’ll respond to each other on social media n that but that’s about it. N it really sucks because I always see all of them hanging out with each other on instagram n shit n I know that if I just lived where they lived I would be hanging out with them too n shit would be different but it’s not n I can’t leave where I’m living for another year pretty much. I try to travel over and visit as often as I can but it costs money I don’t have and can be a bit inconvenient too. I also just broke up with my girlfriend of a year (who lives in the city over) like two months ago and she was the only person I’d really talk to on a daily basis and we’re still good friends but she has some trouble talking to me for obvious reasons. I really miss being in a relationship and intimacy and it really sucks because I know if I lived in that city where allll of them do I would have opportunities to find romance or new friends and all of that. But I literally just can’t right now and I don’t know what to do. I’m the most alone in my life I’ve ever been and can’t seem to figure out how to be happier. This has been going on for a while now too, it’s not just recent. N now shit just feels like it’s getting worse. I’m really trying hard to hang on but I just don’t know what to do. Thanks for letting me vent, any comments are appreciated."
1455,I dont know what to do about my friend,"My (online) friend and I have been together for a year or two,the thing is that i dont know if i should keep talking to him or not,he always criticize me about everything i do,i tell him something about me that hurts me and he doesnt says anything to me about it or makes a joke about it,he tells me to shut up,and he always say im bad at all the things i do or i think i do good,and im always sad.

But if i befriend him i would not have more friends ro play with or talk to,and i enjoy playing with him,i dont know what to,and i would appreciate some help.

PD: sorry for bad language,this is my second language."
1456,I don't know what to do,I don't know what to do. I'm always feeling like 3 seconds away from ending my life. I've asked for help from my parents and even some of my closest friends but they can't understand what I'm going through and it's almost as if they think it's a phase. I've become aware about how easy it is and it's terrifying me. The only reason why I haven't done it is that my mum's been really stressed lately and I can't just add to that. But I just don't see any point in living anymore.
1457,Gf broke up with me over my anger issues. Have I just destroyed my chances with her?,"She said “K then, I don’t know if I will talk to you anymore because I only make you mad. I’m not enough. You deserve better. You’re out of my league. Sorry for everything.”

I asked her if she was gone forever and she said “I don’t know, I don’t want to leave you but I just don’t know how to make you happy anymore.” She unfriended me shortly after which she did explain why she wasn’t going to talk to me.

So she said this after I got mad at her twice over minor things. She shouldn’t be scared of me because this was over text and we haven’t really been physically together since a few months due to my job, and that’s when my anger issues started. My ex gf does have low self esteem and depression also, so that explains the things she said, I probably made her feel worse.

I do have depression and have been seeing a therapist  but that’s no excuse."
1458,For those feeling anxious and that things are still up in the air in regards to elections,Idk if ppl who has some level of PTSD can relate to this but as much as I’m relieved... it’s hard to truly celebrate when it’s not declared official “official”. Like lemme see the speech and all to know it’s for REAL. Anyone feel this? Asking for a friend ☮️

1460,Feeling hopeless,"I’m so sick of feeling like this. I get better and I think it’ll be okay, but I always end up the same way, broken. I wish someone would see how much pain I’m in, I wish someone would listen to me. But the worst part is it doesn’t even feel real. I feel like it’s not bad enough to mean anything, I tell myself everyone must feel like this, but deep down I know that’s not true."
1461,I feel myself slipping again,"I feel myself slipping again, playing into this depressive loop that's plagued me many times before. These past few days I've found myself confined to my bed - not having the energy or desire to leave. I've barely eaten which has caused me to become even more sluggish. I have plenty of food around, but cannot be bothered to prepare anything. When I think about all the washing up I have to do before and after, along side the prep itself, my willingness to get something to eat falls. I have found myself in a loop where I need to get up and look after myself but lack the energy to do so. This isn't the first time I have found myself in this situation and I know I can pull myself out of it. It's just that when you're in this state you find yourself in a deep pit with no clear way to pull yourself out. I struggle with talking to others about things like this, so I thought reddit would be good place to start. Opening up with how I feel is for sure the best first step and I know this won't last forever. Thanks to anyone kind enough to take the time to read this. I really appreciate it."
1462,Guitarist who lost his passion,"Hey all, hope you're all doing ok during this crazy year. Remember to talk to friends/family when you can if you're struggling with things!

So, I've been playing guitar for close to 15 years, but recently I've lost all passion in playing. And not just in guitar, just in general. My hobbies don't get me pumping as they used to, hanging out with family and friends can feel like a drag, and guitar just feels like a waste, expecially when I compare my playing/instruments to my friends who I think have more drive/passion than me. It's incredibly crippling, combined with the struggles I'm going through with self esteem. As a result, I turn to less savoury things (which I won't go into detail) that provide short term relief, but make me feel crap afterwards.

How do you reignite passion, or discover a hobby that you've been meaning to get into? Any tips or help would be appreciated! Again, stay safe all"
1463,Not All Therapists Are Terrible,"I have severe depression, severe anxiety, CPTSD, SAD, they are pretty sure BPD. I also deal with chronic pain due to a birth defect in my spine and a reverse cervical curve in my neck. I've broken hearts, destroyed my life repeatedly, given away all my belongings 4 times so I could get ready to kill myself. I was a meth addict (14 yrs ago). After I got sober and rebuilt my life... i blew through $35,000  in 9 months just on stuff and shopping. Then I was a workaholic. Then I was just anxious and sad and borderline alcoholic. I  have  had weeks without getting out of bed over the years.

Another 10 years of being like this would have killed me. I don't even know if I had that long.

I did ALOT of research on therapists and types of treatment before I contacted my therapist. Everyone i had talked in my life said that therapy doesn't help them and they went to a session and nothing happened. I pay out of pocket for all my various treatments. It's expensive. But the alternative is that I will die.

My therapist has CHANGED MY LIFE. I've been seeing her for 4 years. She has a lot of the same values/lifestyle/agnostic and she's young, and so easy to talk to. In the beginning I had troubles opening up to her because she seemed so perfect (she's also incredibly beautiful IMHO) and  in a very professional manner she told me that she isn't, and the way she said it was believably. Anyway, it took like 5 sessions to even really start in. Each session is $195 and ive done this almost monthly for  4 years (with one long break because I didnt want to do the work required so wasn't any point of going if I wasn't going to do the work, though I did get into building routines up). Consistency is the key, to everything, and then being gentle with myself when I am not, and then trying again. Over. And Over.

You know what? Its fucking HARD work. I work harder on myself than almost any one else I know as far as I can tell.  I'm literally rewiring my brain. That's difficult. You know something else? My therapist makes me mad sometimes cause it's hard to hear some of the things she says and its terrifying to change. I keep going back. I do my homework, I sit with my uncomfortable feelings and I honor my body  (sometimes) and I fucking wake up every day and even though my first thoughts in the morning are terrible... I still try. Every. Fucking. Day. 

And that's how healing works. 

You have to be you every day for the rest of your life, if you want to be better then you have to put in the work and learn to change. You have to sit there and look at yourself and decide what you need help with and who you are. Then you need to get on the internet and look and keep looking till there's someone that sounds relatable. And then you gotta listen to what they say. If they say shitty things that don't make sense, please keep looking at alternatives.  Also. If finding your therapist means leaving where you live, do it, if you can. Its easier to heal when your trauma isn't sitting nearby. I moved 3000 miles away from my traumas though it still carry them in my solar plexus (more work to do)

For me, the changes are small. But they are there. 

Once in a while i have a small feeling of self-worth, and i can sometimes feel q bit of self love. Once in awhile I can look myself in the eye and be OK with what I see. I have healthy routines now. I still have a lot of issues and the work is not done..... for example yesterday I had a bad morning and I threw a pair of leggings across the room and then bought a laptop for $1500 (I'm WFH and computer died right before a meeting). Then I cried in my fiances lap and ranted to  him about how hard it is to change and to grow and that I have to keep doing it forever and thats so hard too. He hugged me and told me I was brave and he is proud of me. I'm off my psych meds (therapist and doctor approved with the understanding that if I'm off the walls in 6 weeks then we find new ones). I microdose shrooms and im on a  vitamin routine (blood works done to make sure nothing outta wack)  I've quit smoking cigarettes. I've joined a rugby team (im the most obese and shittiest person on the team but they haven't asked me to leave yet), and exercise regularly including daily yoga. Right now im prepping for my annual Big Sad (its a planned thing now cause happens every year). I am engaged, and I've been with the same fella for 4 years which is a huge change. I used to joke that my relationships had a 1 yr expiration date but usually went moldy after 4 months and needed to be tossed.  I've been stable (financially and with my housing) for 3 years. I havent taken a mental health sick leave from work in 2 years or rage quit and burned my bridges or anything like that since (4.5 years now!).

1464,I've been denied by every clinic in my area. I don't know what to do,"I've been diagnosed with BPD, DP/DR, Depression, Panic Disorder, PTSD, and I'm trans, so I deal with gender dysphoria as well. On top of all that, my psychiatrist thinks I also have Bipolar 2, but isn't sure yet.

My GP has sent referrals to every clinic in my area, including CAMH, the Canadian Centre for Addictions and Mental Health. I've been denied by every single one for being ""out of their scope."" She's even sent referrals to universities training psych students and they've all denied me. 

I was starting to consider going to a psych ward, but I realized yesterday I can't, because i mimic other people's symptoms subconsciously, so being around other mentally ill people would just make everything worse.

I don't know what to do. I'm suicidal. I want to self harm because no other release is working. I've managed to hold back so far, but I don't know how much longer I can last. What do I do?

1469,Balancing physical health vs mental health,"sorry on mobile!!!! hi. im a 21 year old living w a roommate (expartner) and i struggle greatly w my mental health. 

i was wondering if its better to purchase convience food (fruits, granola bars, sandwiches, microwave stuff) instead of not eating at all or ordering takeout. 

i buy ingredients for cooking meals, such as spaghetti, chicken and rice, etc. these meals arent hard to cook, bur im mostly too depressed and have too little energy to cook even these simple meals. i also struggle with an ed so when im too tired to cook, i eat nothing or i order double takeout (""for rwo meals"") and eat it all at once bc im so hungry.

i waste money on takeout and i was just wondering is it okay to go for the convience food from the grocery store? i know how processed food like this can be bad but my mental health just isnt there to cook. 

ive talked to some friends and family and some were kinda snotty about it. like im 21 i should ""know how to cook"" now. anyways i was just wondering, thanks."
