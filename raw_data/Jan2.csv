0,Hey all,"Hey,


About two months ago my girlfriend noticed cuts on my thigh. She made me promise to stop, but was very understanding about the whole situation. Like I said, it’s been two months and the temptation to self harm again is increasing. Especially because of the lockdowns in place. With me not being able to see her because of lockdown, as well as other factors, I find myself lost. I’m a musician who will often turn to songwriting as therapy, but even that doesn’t seem to be helpful anymore. If anyone had any tips I’d be very grateful.

Thanks a bunch :)"
1,How do I get my energy back? Is this chronic stress?,"I don't really know how to start this, but I've been noticing my energy for certain things gradually depleting, I think I might be experiencing chronic stress but I'm not sure, I'm hoping to get some advice for what I'm going through 

Skip to the '***' for my actual problems, I just feel the context might help explain what I'm struggling with:

Context: I've noticed the issues I will state later gradually increase in 2020 (some are completely new and others I have experienced my whe life but have got a lot worse in 2020)

January - March:

- I was stressed about my A level exams (exams you do when you're 18 in the UK) that were due to be in May and June 

- I was very stressed about which uni and which course to go to, to the point where it would be constantly in the back of my mind, there was no escaping it 

March - April:

- A levels get cancelled, I was devastated as I had worked so hard but overall it was a chilled out couple of weeks 

May-june: 

- Arguably the worse two months of my year, I still hadn't chosen a uni, for the these two months my routine would be the same: 
- wake up and force myself back to sleep to avoid thinking about it
- get up and over analyse every detail about the uni for the entire day, or procrastinate doing this
- at 00:00 I could finally relax as it would be the next day (hard to explain this in short)
- repeat 

August 

- recieved A level grades that I wasn't happy with 

September-October

- started uni, realised I didn't like my course, after agonising over whether to change, I decided to change course 
- contracted coronavirus and had to isolate for 2 weeks
- uni got put into tier 3 so uni experience was essential over before it had begun 

November

- catching up on new course 
- no social life at uni

December-January 

- stressed with 5 essays to plan and write 
- stressed with not knowing where to live in second year 



*** so that brings me to now and the issues I'm struggling with: 

- I'm spending around 7 hours per day on my phone

- Apart from my 3 closest friends I cannot bring myself to reply to people on text, I will often wait a number of days or weeks in extreme cases - the thought of replying to people is exhausting and I don't know why 

- I don't even look at my university email anymore

- I have this whole housing situation for next year to deal with and I'm just ignoring the group chat because I can't face talking about it 

- I have so much uni work to do but im just burned out from the 5 essays I have written in the space of 4 weeks

- I procrastinate so much in my life even when I know I need to do it


I was just wondering if anyone could help me work out why I'm struggling with these things and how to fix it? 

The things I'm procrastinating are just weighing on my mind and it all feels like too much that I have to do, so I just avoid all of it"
2,I have anxiety and ptsd,"I am trying not to watch the news all day or call my mh provider. I am on several different medication that mellows me out I guess day and night. But the news, this climate America seems to never shake. It’s like I am stepping back from the all the forward steps I made. Watching those guards attacked doing their jobs I couldn’t sleep for several days even on the pills."
3,I have so much anxiety over exercise,"I’ve been trying to loose weight but whenever I try to exercise I get so anxious I end up just covering my head in the fetal position on the ground. I know why I’m like this, when I was a kid I was over weight and I knew I was overweight, so I told my parents I want to lose weight, purely for health and I would feel healthy, but both times I asked them they would freak out and yell that I don’t need to lose weight and I was perfect the way I was (my mom had an Ed before so they were probably worried about that) but I genuinely just wanted to be at a healthy weight. But now when ever I work out, even if I’m alone in my room with the door closed and the blinds shut I just shut down and feel embarrassed. I think what’s even worse is that later in life, maybe in the fifth grade, my doctor started to tell my mom I needed to lose weight because I’m m fukin fat and then I hated working out because of how they reacted. My mom tried to get me to run outside with her but I basically refused. My mom would get me outside in running gear and I would just walk and refuse to run. And god, everytime she says this at the doctors office I cringe so Fucking hard. My moms side of the family is obese. Like my 600 pound life kind of fat, 1000 pound sisters kind of fat, so everytime my doctor would bring up weight she always says something runs in her side of the family that makes them fat, bitch the problem is no one on her side of the family runs. Anyways, what do I do about this. How do I stop feeling so anxious about it?"
4,"Hey, everything hurts. It's subtle, but it's bothersome.","I don't really need support-support, some encouraging words are welcome. Maybe things like ""I understand,"" or just a ""hey, I see you."" 

So, I typically hang around the BorderlinePD subreddit. Sometimes here. 

And, well... I like to help people. And I'm aware that I can never help everyone. There are days when I scroll past and I see people struggling, but I myself just don't have the energy to go in there because I've already burnt myself out helping others. Other days I'm typing paragraphs upon paragraphs, trying to dig into people's psyches because I want to share my knowledge. I'm aware that I have a gift for it, even though I'm also aware that it's not like I always have the keys to someone else's problem.

Despite me being someone who loves to help people, I don't often ask for help myself. I'm too afraid to ask, but I feel that I need *a lot* of help. Sometimes I'm a burden to my friends. Other times, when I ask for help, I regret it because it didn't resonate with me. And other times, I feel like I wasted my time because I ended up beating around the bush or talking too much about an irrelevant issue. These make me reluctant to ask again.

I don't have that one person in my life who makes me feel good. I don't think many of us do. Maybe they don't exist. But for sure, I don't have enough things (whatever these ""things"" may be, whether they come from myself, they come from other people) to keep me afloat or I wouldn't be in this place.

I'm dying everyday, struggling everyday, like you all are. And I just want someone to say something to me. Oftentimes I get too deep in the details and it doesn't help, because I'm telling myself the same stories and shunning myself to the same answers. Maybe if I kept it surface level I would feel differently. 

I'm just lonely, world. I'm just hurting. Hello, planet."
5,Just got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder after living with bipolar disorder for 2 years.,"Really wondering how I’m supposed to cope. I’m only 17, still in high school, and I can barely function most days. Social work department doesn’t seem to give a shit, neither do my teachers who refuse to make accommodations for me. I’m failing everything. How do I get through this?"
6,anybody else rearrange their room a lot?,"i do it like once every month or two. my room will just get so depressing and everytime i'm in it i feel so shitty, so i rearrange it in order to get a ""new room"". it's like a fresh start and then i eventually get really depressed in that arrangement as time goes on and the cycle continues. just wondering if anybody else does this or if anybody has advice on how to get out of this cycle? i'm moving in a few months and i won't have any room to rearrange so i want to make sure that i can get out of this feeling."
7,Very Lost need a place to vent,"I need a place to vent and have no one to really talk to so if you're reading this thank you so much. 

I feel really miserable inside and have never truly been happy. I struggle to stick anything out and get so bored easily. With school I changed my major once racking on an extra year only to now realize I hate the major I switched into immensely. It makes me extremely depressed just thinking about attending class, and doing the work. The thought of having to work with other students makes me feel ill. There's so much group work and my social anxiety is just awful right now (even though everything is still on zoom). Just thinking about my program makes me feel horribly depressed. I don't know what to do. It's a specialized major and everyone there is so passionate. Meanwhile I feel like some big fraud who can't seem to make her mind up. I can never stick anything out jobs, school and it sucks. My social anxiety is so bad and I am so lonely. I have no real friends, and when I tell my family I feel upset they just tell me it's in my head or I'm being crazy. After getting out of an abusive relationship, I didn't really have any friends afterwards as most turned on me when I entered that relationship. I now struggle to date or even make friends and feel so alone. My social anxiety just makes things so difficult. My career just feels stagnant at the moment (I'm in a creative area and the competitiveness and rejection is just a lot. I feel ignored by everyone around me,  It would be nice to just have someone listen because no one ever does. I feel guilty to complain, it feels selfish. I know it could be worse, I just can't help but feel this way."
8,I‘m kinda scared,"i‘m just gonna go straight to my issue, i keep having thoughts about suicide or killing my parents, siblings, pets or just people that i‘m supposed to love. I don‘t even feel anything. I laugh when i see dead bodies or when i‘m scared, i don‘t really care about dying or living and i‘m constantly planning the murders or my suicide in my head. I know it‘s probably normal to randomly think „i could stab myself/someone“ while washing a knife or something but i can‘t stop thinking about it, i‘ve tried to distract myself so many times but the thoughts just won‘t stop and i don‘t know what to do. I don‘t think anyone could help and tbh i don‘t judge you cuz i wouldn‘t know how to help either which is obviously why i‘m asking lol. I have been diagnosed with depression and an adjustment disorder. I don‘t know if that has anything to do with it but i think i should just add it. Thanks for reading"
9,How to love yourself?,"So my mental health has crashed completely. I’m suffering from depression, anxiety and OCD (21F).

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to love yourself in a time like this? Every day is hard. I haven’t ever felt this low, and I’m really trying to get back up again.

How do I love myself when I don’t even want to get out of bed in the morning?

Please help :) thanks x"
10,Why do I always ruminate and only live with the memory of who I was or at least thought I was?,"23M here. Long story short, after a series of traumatic events (most of which I caused and inflicted on other people), I've come to the realizatiom that the things I've done were totally outside my moral values and I would NEVER do them in a normal state. I now just live with the image of who I used to be."
11,Do i have skizophrenia,This has been happening for a good 3 years now and its happening more and more often im seeing stuff what isnt there all the time and hearing stuff and recently beem smelling stuff what nobody else can smell. Also today i freaked out because i saw a spider on the wall and my dad looked over and he didnt see anything and most of the time i will hear scratching at the side of my bed or hear breathing even when i hold my breath i can hear breathing so it aint me but i also see a man like a tall figure with big eyes and a smile and he is just black he speaks i tell my mum but she doesnt beleive me does anyone have any answers
12,Living with my family is beyond depressing,No one ever speaks to me. I feel like everyone in my house avoids me and I can’t even have a normal conversation with my father. This hurts especially because my mum passed away last year and it floored me. I haven’t felt like I had any real support from my family since it happened. I feel like people are uncomfortable talking about it because they know how much it affects me. It seems like my family just tolerates my being here. I don’t feel like I belong and I really just want/need to move out but I can’t rn
13,Is it possible to become a psychopath for absolutely no reason,"I've read a bit on psychopathy and sociopathy and learned that psychopathy leans more into genetics than trauma as a child,and sociopathy seems to lean more into childhood trauma than genetics,but is there a possible way you could just become one for no reason?"
14,Could my mother leaving be the cause of my emotional numbness?,"When I was four years old my mother left. I don't really remember her visually and have no memories of her at all, not even her voice, almost everything about her has been deleted from my memory. There is one memory I have of her though, I remember the dogs were fighting and my dad was trying to break them up and I was really really scared. So, my mum picked me up and held me in her arms on the sofa to try and comfort me. But in this memory i dont remember turning to see her face, so I still kinda don't know what she looked like. There are some videos of me and her though, her making me laugh and going ""Where's daddy?"" And I would reply ""at work"" while laughing for some reason.

I would say I had a strong bond with her, like most children do, so when she packed up and left one night I think it hit me quite hard, but then at the same time I don't remember how I reacted, I dont remember asking where she went or crying because she had gone, I remember none of it. 

As I've grown up, it's always been hard to show or even feel emotions for anything or anyone, I've never felt love or true happiness, I've felt sadness sure but its never been extreme when I'm some cases it should have been. I just feel numb, there's nothing, I feel grey almost, that's all I can associate with it, the colour grey. 
I feel like my brain rejects emotions, when people show love to its like it just bounces right off my skull, I can never reciprocate love for anyone. 

Could this have been caused by my mother leaving?"
15,Focusing,Hi everyone! I have pretty bad ADHD that’s gotten progressively worse over the years! I was prescribed Lexapro but I’m pregnant so I don’t want to take it. I for the life of me CAN’T stay focused on one task for more than a few minutes and I have so much I need to do everyday. Any tips on other methods of trying to focus myself?
16,Does anyone else ever start randomly thinking about their trauma?,If you don’t know what I mean for example I’ll just be sitting in class and then I start to space out and then I’ll just randomly start thinking about it and then I get really upset. I feel like this is just me
17,identity crisis or whatever this is [rant],"Basically i feel like an absolute failed investment. 

If you read this whole thing thanks. If you didn't I don't blame you it has no direction. 

My parents are reasonably well-off and I lead the most average normal life of middle-class or high-class (idk) child. Any child from a less privileged home would be delighted to be born in my shoes. 

I'm grateful for everything and everyone I have in life, but I'm depressed and it makes me more depressed than actual people in worse situations because I have every reason to be happy but I'm not.  I feel so stupid and dumb for not being happy. I wish people born to abusive families and other rough shit like that could live my life because i truly feel like I'm wasting it and I know they'd kill to be me. I feel like shit for not being happy with myself and I have 0 self esteem even though it may look like it. 

I'm the more art-inclined person in my family and I am thankful for that but honestly artists in this day and age go nowhere and I don't want to live a life of struggle when my parents have worked so hard. It's worse for me and unfair to them. I have friends but nobody knows me and it's frankly because i don't exist. I don't know me either. Every hobby I can remember having in my life has been dropped for some reason or the other. Thinking about it now makes me feel even worse because all I can think of is how much money and time my parents wasted trying to cater to my interests and now I'm not even in to them anymore, except art, but honestly it feels like work to me most of the time. I know my addiction to social media definitely has to do with the joy I get from watching other people live their lives while I waste my own away. 

I don't act the same around anyone. I've gone to 6 now 7 schools in my life and I have a separate personality for each of my friends. I got into the habit of gossip when i was about 13 but I haven't done so ever since. Even my siblings don't know who I am. The only way I make friends is by making people laugh because I actually don't have a personality and without forcing humor I'll make things so awkward. I avoid anyone who I can't make laugh. And I desperately run from boys that like me because I sincerely don't know if I like them back and again, I have no personality. I don't know how, when or why this happened but I've never met someone who is as distant as me. Interviews about anything get me nervous because I can't answer any questions about myself certainly, apart from my name and my date of birth.  

I have homework to do at the moment but no motivation to do it because I don't see my future amounting to shit. I want my parents to put me in a public school so badly because I'm wasting their money every second I breathe. I wish I knew what was wrong with me and how to fix it because my parents don't deserve me after all they've worked for. I wish they hated me a bit so I'd have a reason to be so troubled but they're both so supportive and I should be a better person with all the basic privileges of life but I'm not smart enough and the one thing I'm holding onto is art because it's the only thing that makes me feel like a resourceful being. I am not useful in any other way apart from cleaning the house maybe. Every situation in life forces me back into this corner and now the most coincidental occurrence, our art coursework is centered on identity and every class feels like aggressive therapy while I watch other people answer the questions so normally. 

I don't see myself escaping this and I don't think it is logically possible for me to be missed if I kill myself because I am nobody, and I can't be missed if I don't have a personality. The only thing stopping me from leaving is the fear that I'll be on my way to hell. 

sorry you had to read my rant about my privileged life, especially if you're going through something worse."
18,I need a little advice.,"Okay so I’m a 17 year old Female. I do think there’s something genuinely wrong with me, I don’t know what. This has been going on for a long while. I think I have what it’s repressed anger or emotions (I don’t feel like happiness, anger etc - only just okay, sad or annoyed) , I have very much massive grudges for anything even from years ago too, I get into very much high and moods most of the time. Very easily distracted. I’m a massive over thinker and I’m just annoyed at anyone and everything, I have no motivation for anything, I don’t want to do college anymore, my memory has gotten really bad for remember such as the smallest of things - I also cry a lot on my own, like too much. See my problem is I don’t speak about it, because the people I’m close to have dismissed it or see me as dramatic and think I’ll get over it. It’s been that way since I was little, so I don’t think I can get out of that habit yet (but when I have tried no one takes me seriously or thought something could be wrong, but I do think it’s embarrassing to say what you’re feeling, so maybe it’s coming out wrong.) I bottle things up to the point where I know I’ll explode, I won’t because I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings. So I would talk to someone but there’s that constant fear of people thinking I’m dramatic and that it’s actually not something. However, I do believe the people i’m close to think nothing is wrong is because of this ditzy, positive front I have on and if I acted anything different they’d question it - which annoys me because I created this front to the point it’s now a personality trait and I don’t like to be questioned. So in overall I know that most of this my doing as I don’t open up and expect people to figure there’s something with the hints - which is wrong. I would just like some advice if that’s okay?"
19,"I’m an incredibly vain, impatient person.","We are in this pandemic and I really don’t care for it all, I’m so fixated on my cosmetic surgery for my eye. I have been waiting a year on lists, being referred to people etc. I seem to not be able to accept being average looks wise and I’ll do anything to get surgeries.

Last week I attempted self surgery and got in the bath so blood would just wash off instantly so I could see and started making incisions on my skin. It was a bit painful but the water was very hot and it kind of Dulled it for some reason. I stopped because I started bleeding a lot and was concerned with infection and most importantly scarring.

I did this out of desperation. I have been promised surgery a year and the pandemic has delayed it. Thought getting citalopram for depression on my patient record would hurry surgery but no. I thought trying myself could have worked.

It’s like I’m never going to be happy with my appearance. In my head I need to be this 6’4, muscular and chiseled assertive man and I’m currently not it and it’s unbearable. I feel I need to be the most attractive person in the room, have sex with the most women and have the most followers on Instagram.

I just need to be the best in every way possible and I can’t stand having flaws. I can’t stand people with flaws and I feel contempt for them. This comes back to me though and i have these feelings as I’m flawed as well. I think it’s toxic masculinity messing with my head or something.
I only care about myself, my status and looks."
20,I have got a problem,"So in the past week I have just been losing interest in a lot of things and a lot of stuff has been stressing me out like school and stuff. Today has been a pretty rough day for me and even hanging out with my girlfriend doesn't seem to be fun, along with everything else seeming boring. I have to go back to my dads tomorrow but I really don't want to because all I do there is work and get yelled at for some minor mistakes. I know I have some issues like being unorganized or procrastinating, but I'm try to improve on myself. I just don't know what's going on because I'm failing all of my classes and I was a 4.0 gpa student last year.

I just need someone that is experiencing the same thing I have or roughly the same mindset or maybe some advice. I have had no suicidal thoughts I've just been.... Numb... I guess.

I hope someone can help me or tell me what's going on.

This is my first post in this community and I thought it would be a good place to post about my current issue."
21,One year!!,"Checked my sober app this morning, realised that I’m officially one year clean from sh.
It hasn’t been easy but it is definitely worth the feeling when you achieve something like this.
If anyone is out there who is struggling just know that it will get better and that I’m rooting for you and so is everyone else on this sub Reddit 
❤️"
22,Just a bit of motivation acquired,"So in the last few months I've been lacking in motivation and have lost interest in things that had once made me happy. Just getting out of bed and walking around my small apartment drained my energy. All I did was lay in bed and watch YouTube. All. Day. So I'm happy to say that I made chocolate chip cookies! And worked on my science fair project. These may seem small but they mean so much to me. I would like to add that baking the cookies didn't really make me happy: at most it gave me the slightest bit of joy that I actually finished it.
Now I have to take a small walk. I've been telling myself to do that for a few days now-


(I would've added the picture of the cookies but I'm to dumb to know how to)"

24,One of the best explanations of mindfulness I’ve ever heard,"Hey all,

I wanted to share this video with you all today, titled: All It Takes is 10 Mindful Minutes. It was a Ted talk given by Andy Puddicombe, founder of Headspace.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the concept of mindfulness, it can be a powerful tool to help you identify some of the things you might be either thinking or feeling without necessarily realizing it. We’re all so busy in our day to day lives, and it is so easy to get wrapped up and lost in our own thoughts that it can be very easy to lose sight of how our bodies are feeling. The emotions we’re all experiencing underneath the surface. 

Andy is a former Buddhist monk who grew up in the UK. He has a unique talent in taking these eastern meditation concepts, which may seem foreign and unfamiliar, and translating them into a westernized approach.

In this Ted talk Andy discusses the concept of mindfulness is a truly brilliant and succinct way. I highly encourage anyone who has 10 minute to spare to check it out. Well worth the watch in my opinion.

25,I Wasn't There,"Someone I love has OCD. Thankfully, he feels he can dismiss the thoughts pretty well by just telling himself, ""It's just a thought."" Anyway, the other day he told me he had a hallucination.He said his eyes were open and he had sleep paralysis after taking a nap. He told me he had a conversation with me, but it was weird because I would have been sitting on his feet or the cat at the end of the couch if I had really been there. He also said he heard a family member talking as well, but he couldn't see that person, however the voice seemed like it was coming from behind the TV which sits in the corner of the room. As far as I know, he has never had a hallucination before. Can someone tell me what might be going on?"
26,I don’t even know what to say or do so here’s something.,"Don’t even know what to fucking say. I’ve been ‘talking’ to this super hot woman for months, told her about my anxiety, our plans seem to fall through, she seems genuine though, I hate dating, I hate antidepressants that make it so you can’t fucking cum, I hate how people are attracted to each other, I hate how sex is some big and involved thing, I hate how humans are primal, I hate how I am mentally ill, I hate my friends for condescending fucks sometimes, I hate this stupid bitch for being offended I said she was cute, I hate how I have feelings for a couple female friends and they won’t go away, I hate my family for being pathetic fake people, I hate how people revolve their lives around politics, and I hate how I’m not loved sexually."
27,Advice on this? Is this normal?,"When in a situation, or about to do something. I calculate every possible outcome, and I mean every outcome, I don't do it on purpose I do it subconsciously, my brain automatically does it. Now because I know deep down every outcome, I know the bad ones, I also know the best ones and how exactly to get there as I have calculated the probability of something happening and all the factors and therefore know the best route. My brain does this automatically and the issue is it's a burden, a massive one. As I know all the out comes I know the worst case scenario and my brain focuses on it heavily. Say I was going to do something considered bad, I factor in EVERY factor not on purpose my brain does it by itself it's annoying. I then know the best way to do the task without getting caught. This normally comes into play during relationships, I know the worst outcome and I can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes it can even make me depressed. My partner could tell me they won't do this or that but I know because I've calculated all the outcomes it's still possible. Even if I know it's highly unlikely it still pains me. Is this normal? If not what is this does it have a name can someone futher elaborate"
28,What can I do to help my friend?,"!Heavy topic! Mentions of suicide, among other really heavy topics. 

My best friend has been depressed for the majority of her life. 

It’s been three years since she first told me she was suicidal, but I know she’s felt this way longer than that. It’s been two years since it became serious. Ever since October of 2019, I’ve talked her out of suicide almost every night. She says the most graphic stuff, and she knows how heavy it all is. I’ve called suicide hotlines myself, to try and get advice on how I can create a support team for her and an environment she can grow and heal in. I’ve told people at our school, I’ve reached out to her parents, her therapists... all of our mutual friends know how she’s feeling. I made sure it wasn’t something that was just going to slip under the radar.

Her home life has been awful. It’s too much to summarize. Any kind of emotional abuse you can imagine, she’s probably been through. Because of this, reaching out to her family did nothing. For awhile, she would say if she had to live in that house any longer that would be it. So I told her to move in with me, and she has been living with my family since October of 2020. 

She’s not getting better and I feel so lost. It’s every single night that she texts me, but tonight she said that “this is it.” I’ve taken her myself to the mental hospital twice, and both times they never accepted her as inpatient. I just dont know what to do. It’s gotten way past the “just be supportive and tell her you love her, hear her out etc.” thing. She’s gonna die and I don’t know how to stop it when all of our resources have run dry and I can’t force her to get better. I also can’t handle the weight of her life on my shoulders. I can’t lose her, I love her so much. She’s none of the bad things she thinks she is. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m asking for. I’m asking for anything. I don’t know what to do."
29,Schizophrenia,"I'm a junior in high school. I need to know if I'm going schizophrenic. I've been hearing voices at night it sounds like someone is talking downstairs and I can hear them talking, but I can't really hear what there saying although it always fits into what I'm anxious about that night. Like if I failed something the voices sound like my parents talking about it. I talk to myself all the time now and not just talking either I yell at myself and insult myself. I'm so disorganized right now to my sister came into my room the other day and was scared of how my room looked it was so messy. My speech has been noticeable different lately, I don't get my words out fully sometimes. i stutter now which I've never done before. I don't do school work for weeks at a time there are multiple big projects in school right now that I either haven't started or I'm waiting till the last minute to do the bare minimum. I saw something today that kinda crushed me too. I don't have Instagram anymore but I was wondering how my friends from my old school were doing (I'm going to a new school this year) so I found my friends insta and there was a picture of us at a dance and he cropped my friends face on mine. I never really felt to close to anyone of them but it really hurt it was the first time I cried in a long time actually cried too not just a couple of tears. Sometimes I wonder why I'm still here like what life can I live that's worth living. I'm a fuck up who's going to end up living with my parents till I die. I think about killing myself more and more nowadays, Recently mostly. I'm terrified that I'm schizophrenic going to spend my sad meaningless life alone. I'm so scared of asking my parents to go see a therapist. I have real issues with communication, I don't talk to people a lot so its really hard
Anyway leave me some advice please, don't just tell me to get help"
30,I have a strange compulsion to replicate feelings on both sides of the body. What is it?,"Hey, I’ve had this for a while now, and it’s been very noticeable in the past year or two. 

I’ve had a very strange compulsion to replicate a feeling on both sides of my body. For example, if I were to brush against someone with my left shoulder, I would feel really weird until I brushed against someone or something else with my other shoulder. 

I have it in normal day to day life when the sensation is more noticeable. 

But, when I’m upset or otherwise in a negative mood, it gets to the point I need every sensation on my body to be the exact same on the other side. 

I’ve brought this to the attention of my family but I don’t really know what kind of doctor I could go to for help. 

Has anyone heard of this/know what it is?

Thanks."
31,Have a hard time trying,My whole life i’ve been naturally gifted at school and i never really had to try i just did well with minimal effort. Well i’ve reached a point where i cant just cruise anymore i have to put in alot of effort and because I’ve never had to before its really hard and I don’t know what to do. Is there anything i can do to make this easier i feel like i don’t have the experience to be prepared for where i am right now.
32,"Turned self into hospital for depression. Was in for 8 days. Diagnosed with BiPolar. How to explain this to my job without them considering me an unstable emplyee and pushing me out for ""other reasons"". Amwrica","Turned self into hospital for depression. Was in for 8 days. Diagnosed with BiPolar. How to explain this to my job without it coming back onto me another way so they dont get hit with retaliation. American (obviously)

Hi all, not sure how to handle this. I work as a solo Sys Admin for a company in the US. I love my work. One of the few things that keeps me grounded.

I reached a point where I knew going to the hospital was the best idea for me. While i was in they changed my diagnosis from depression to BiPolar. I'm in a new better treatment plan with new meds and therapy and a nee diet plan to help stay stable.

I go back to work Monday and have to explain my time gone... I have a dr note of course... but I feel if I go in there with ""due to my mental health I felt the need to seek help. They decided to hold me for longer than expected. Btw I'm BiPolar"". Ti me this screams unstable employee in which case I feel they will find another, unrelated, reason to push me out of the company. 


Idk what to do. Any help is appreciated."
33,Do you ever see yourself in third person and feel really uneasy about?,"I’ve had very high levels of stress lately and so much so that I’ve locked myself in my room because of the anxiety of the outside. I constantly am worried about how I look or how others would judge me. The negative voice in my head is so strong I have constant internal dialogue. Is it schizophrenia, anxiety, or just insecurities?"
34,Feel like sleeping is a waste of time,"Hi Everyone, 

Different post than usual but wanted to see if anyone else is like this and/or feels the same way. Or even if I should consult a doctor or something.

So, since the age of about 11, I’ve always hated sleeping, I mean HATE it. I feel like it’s a waste of time and I will do all I can to procrastinate going to sleep. It’s not that I struggle to fall asleep, I just find something to do just so I don’t sleep. 

I live on about 4 hours of sleep a day, then will end up sleeping in on a weekend or when I don’t need to get up for work etc, but once I’m awake, I’ll have to get up and do something or I’ll feel counterproductive, I will never sleep in on purpose. 

But yeah, just seeing if it’s something I should be concerned about."
35,College is affecting my mental health and I don't know what to do about it.,"I never thought I'd be making this post or anything but I feel like I need to at least try and reach out to someone here. I'm going to try and include as much detail I can with this and hope that I can get something out of this. 

So let's start at the beginning. After 6 months of lockdown, I was pretty excited about having my life turned around for the better. Unfortunately, this was one of those cases where I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. From the first day, I was slapped across the face with a shit ton of work. Almost every lesson ended with all these assignments and essays due at the end of the week and it felt like I wasn't getting the experience I signed up for. 

And just when I thought things couldn't get worse, I was sucked in to an even deeper, darker void. From the start of December up until now, I have had all of my lessons be online and it has really taken a toll. And I may just be overreacting by saying this but the work only seems to increase more and more when I'm online compared to when I'm actually at campus. And it's not like I haven't tried to reach out for help from any of the teachers, I have. And it doesn't really help me at all. 

One good thing I can say about this course is the other people taking it, they really are some awesome people, they're the types of people I wish I had back at school, and they all have the same issues that I do, some better, others far worse. And I wish I could help them but how can I when I can't even help myself right now. It just feels like the same repetitive bullshit every week where we're set tons of work for those first few lessons and Friday is just like judgement day.

Anyways, in the middle of December, I almost just about had it and I told my mother everything about how I felt, saying that I'm thinking about dropping the course just to better my own sanity. But she talked me out of it and encouraged me to stick it out a bit longer. She says that I am well suited for this course and doesn't want me to make any major mistakes. And another thing that just convinced me to stay on was the fact that I had literally no where else to go if I do end up dropping out. And she promised me that things would get better, and I believed her.

Now, I don't blame her for doing this, in fact I actually felt grateful that she was looking out for me like this, it's just that things just don't seem like they're getting better, they're only getting worse. It's completely destroyed my motivation not just to do the work but to do anything else. I lay in my bed for long periods of time, feeling like complete garbage. I can't concentrate at all anymore and just think about wanting to leave.

And like I said, it's not just me that's feeling like this, almost everyone in this course has had their lives even more fucked. And I just feel completely lost right now. I feel like I've got this void in my stomach and it's slowly devouring me from the inside out. And I've just got so much pent up frustration and anger that it's driving me mental. And we have all tried to explain this to the college department but that hasn't done shit. They're expectations of us are just way too high that they'll just take whatever we say as just lazy excuses.

At this point I'm just completely lost as to what to do. I haven't felt as bad as this my entire life, even in school because I always told myself that there was this light at the end of the tunnel, that I was going to be out of this hell hole soon. With this, I don't know what my future is going to be. I'm open to absolutely anything that you guys can offer me because I'm desperate. Any questions, I'll answer to the best of my ability. I know my situation may not be as serious as anyone else but I'm just trying to figure out what my options are right now. I don't want to drop out just so I'll end up completely lost but I don't want to waste my time with this course if I'm just going to end up failing in the end."

37,Never been more pissed in my life,"I haven't self harmed in a very long time and I reached a snapping point two days ago and I cut my leg. Not bad not even enough to bleed just enough to break the skin. My girlfriend yelled at me to give her the knife and after a brief exchange of words we calmed down and I was messaging my therapist on better help and she was going to order food. Next thing is a knock on the door so I go answer it thinking the neighbors are going to see if everything was ok but nope ot was the Cops. They pull me out thinking it was a domestic dispute and pat me down. I start hyperventilating and they let me sit on the ground. I was completely honest with them because I was worried they were going to arrest me or take my girlfriend in for questioning. I was quickly separated from her and was told I have no other option but to go to the hospital for a screening so I didn't want to escalate things they said it would be an hour and I could leave whenever I wanted. So I cooperated and I regret everything. I ended up being stuck with no resources for 16 hours overnight finally a therapist talks to me for 20 minutes and says I should make a list of my problems and tell my therapist that I already have and that I was already going to do before I was forced into self isolation for 16 hours. So she said I'm free to go once the paperwork was done, 3 more hours later. I was isolated for 19hrs and it took an hour to get my personal belongings back. I am so pissed off and in worse shape than I was before the cops came or ever in my life. This crisis prevention bullshit is a broken system. I am not happy in the slightest. Alot happened in those 19 hours that pissed me off too about how other patients were treated and how I was treated. If someone who was really going through a mental crisis was in the same situation I had I guarantee it would make them 2xs as bad if not worse. I felt like I was abducted no understand of anything whatsoever. I am so mad at myself now and the situation. Also I probably have covid because the nurses to the mask protocol as serious as a toddler."
38,Losing memory for just a few seconds after a panic attack,"My (20F) mom (51F) has been having panic attacks since the pandemic. I have had some too and I suggested that she go and see a doctor but she refused it bluntly. Last night, she had another panic attack followed by a headache and she laid down for sometime. I got her a glass of water and after she finished drinking it, she did not recognise my for like 10 seconds. She asked me who I was and asked my father who he was. Before we could even call for an ambulance and take her to the hospital, she just got back to her usual self and even remembered very specific details like leftovers of last night's dinner. She didn't have much energy left and laid down for sometime but otherwise she was fine. Father and I decided to take her to the hospital but she refused to come. We have an appointment next week when we are planning to take her, but I tried to google her symptoms but nothing shows up. I am worried for her. Can you all help me understand what had happened and how to proceed with this further.

TLDR: Mom (51f) could not recognise me for a few seconds after a panic attack. I want to understand what happened."
39,I really would rather not exist,"Can anyone take me out of my misery?

I live in a first world country, have food on the table, have a few amazing friends, yet I still feel alone. The loneliness is worst at night. I just feel like no one really cares for me, it's not like they even show it to be honest. My depression keeps me in the past, with stupid situations and stupid people that don't even give a shit about me, and I still feel guilty about it like did I fck things up? It's like no they were just an asshole to you and don't deserve your attention. Also with friends I used to be super close with but then they moved away and the friendship fades away, that shit hurts deep. I just don't feel worthy to be alive, maybe if I was somebody that existence mattered to , but I really don't care if I exist or not because either way some days are hell. And please don't tell me it gets better because it really hasn't and I've suffered with depression for 10 years. People on here always offer their help but eventually ghost me. What's the point in even trying to seek for help? People and humanity just suck and are filled with narcissism and greed."
40,i’m completely lost and not sure why i do this,"hey! i’m fourteen and female. not because of this necessarily, but i’m not diagnosed with much. i have a tic disorder and anxiety. but nothing else i’m sure of. though there is something that’s frustrating me lately and i’m not sure how to deal with it.

i’m really bad at dealing with strong emotions i’ve noticed. and it’s starting to get physically painful. i’ll squeeze my hands and curl my toes and i’ll start having tics (primarily in my neck. but also stomach, eyes.) and it really hurts.

i’ve had these type of issues before. but i’ve been extremely anxious due to band class so  this past week so it’s been worse than usual.

it’s extremely hard to eat dinner with my family most times anyway. i mean really hard. my dad chews quite loud. and he doesn’t stop so i’ll just have to leave the table.

i know this is misophonia. which i’ve always known i’ve had. my tics have made it hard enough. but now because of this new tensing up of my body and way more tics, it’s near impossible. 

the night after i first started having tics (end of november), i was eating dinner with my family. we were having soup and it really set me off. i banged my head right into my plate involuntarily and it hurt awfully.

now it happens almost every time i hear someone eating, typing, making food. it even is too much to play computer games at times. my neck will force itself down and i ball my fists and squeeze. 

i’ll have these moments just as similarly when i see something i love. my best friend will tell me i’m good at video games, i see a really pretty dress at the store and i’m allowed to get it, i’m watching a colorful cartoon show. 

i’ve also been stuttering a lot. i was trying to tell my dad something earlier this evening but i couldn’t stop stuttering and it was extremely hard.

i’ve heard that neurodivergent people stim which is very close to what i’ve been experiencing. could this be what’s been happening?  i don’t know if tic disorders fall under the nuerodivergent umbrella, though.

i just generally need help knowing what’s going on and what to do. it would really be appreciated. this has been making school tough for me."
41,Recovering from depression really feels like I’m trying to stay “sober”,"First I’ve never had to deal with substance abuse, and if what I saying is insensitive please let me know.
 
It really does feel like what I imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like, but instead of that, your abstaining from bad choices. For example, can’t stay out with friends because if I don’t have a regular sleep routine, it will drastically effect my mood. Can’t drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood. Can’t drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood. Can’t think those negative thoughts or otherwise I will spiral. Can’t stay in bed all morning, or otherwise you’ll stay in bed all day or even several days. I have to perform basic hygiene even though it is really hard today, or else you’ll feel ten times worse.

Was wondering if anyone else felt like this?"
42,Imposter Syndrome,"Hi guys. The whole story is so long that I just can’t keep drafting it but I’m trying to keep it as short as possible. 

I’m (24M) from an old British colony (irrelevant). When I was four, I accidentally lit a fire that burned down my parents house which lead to their inevitable divorce. I’ve never had a real relationship with my parents and I give credit to that being the reason. Growing up I never really had any close friends but at the end of high school I moved in with my partner at the time who turned out to be emotionally abusive, physically abusive, manic depressive and suicidal. I lived under her thumb for 5 years while she slowly degraded me and isolated me from what little friends and familial connections I had. I didn’t sleep, or eat or work. She was an addict and every dollar I made was spent on her addiction. To escape this, I often considered and even attempted suicide (half-heartedly) a few times. If anything, I would’ve died of malnutrition or lung cancer from the cigarettes. 

But in early 2019, I met a girl in a cafe who turned out to be from New York. We got to talking. It was a Wednesday, and on the Friday that week she told me she loved me. I loved her too. So I left my abusive partner immediately and started spending all my time with the American girl. 
Unbeknownst to me at the time, she turns out to be of some immense prominence in the New York social scene and is from a well known family. Her Dad is a pretty well known businessman and if you were from New York you would’ve heard of him/them no doubt (it’s not Trump lol). 
In December of 2019 I packed up what was left of my life in Aus and moved to New York to be with her. It’s now 2021 and we’re married and deeply in love. 
I finally have a best friend, her, and her family have ushered me in as one of their own. Her brothers are some of my closest friends and her own friends have become a sort of family to me too. 
So I have a wife who loves and supports me, a real family and genuine friends now. Along with that, I have mental and financial stability. 
I can’t believe the life I live now and the people I interact with on a daily basis and the home that I now live in. 
I understand that this is a far cry from receiving any sympathy whatsoever and I can assure you it’s not what I’m looking for. My problem is I can’t accept that this has happened to me. I think because the first two decades of my life were filled with such loneliness and misery I can’t accept that something genuinely good has happened to me. The old calls of suicide still linger in my head and while all these amazing things have happened to me, I still feel like dying. I still feel like I have nothing to live for and for the first time in my life, I do genuinely have something to live for.

Has anyone had trouble accepting the good things that happen to them? Surely I’m not alone in this"
43,Looking For Advice to Overcome Trauma,"if this isn’t the right place, please feel free to delete. i don’t really know where to go

between 2015 and 2019, i endured two long term friendships that turned out to be extremely toxic and damaging for my mental health. and to this day, i’m still struggling to overcome it all

after reflecting back on my entire life the other night, i’ve come to realize that this trauma and these feelings date back even farther than 2016

long story short, the abuse i endured has made me feel undeserving of love. i have so much love for those who are important and mean the world to me, though i feel like i don’t deserve to be loved

but i enjoy hearing i’m loved. it makes me feel better to hear those verbal reminders that the people who mean the most care about me, and it does wonders for my mind

unfortunately, my mind is extremely cruel to me. it’s constantly telling me that i’m hated, i’m unlovable. it beats me down, and it’s embarrassing how low my self esteem is. for some reason, it’s so easy to believe the negatives (despite being absolute lies) rather than believe the positives (which is all true)

i’m at a point in my life where i’m fortunate enough to have three of the absolute best friends i could’ve ever asked for. they love me endlessly, they’re always here for me and offering support. and one of the big things: i’m able to express my feelings to them without them getting mad (in the toxic friendships, my “friends” would ALWAYS get mad if i express how i felt). i’m extremely blessed, and i thank my lucky stars every single day that i’m finally where i deserve to be

but i’m still struggling. i think my mind gets overwhelmed with it all — getting that “it’s too good to be true” mentality — so i start getting extremely overwhelmed. my brain likes to give meaning to things when that meaning isn’t there (example: if i say i love person A but person A doesn’t say it back, they don’t love me. even if they’ve done absolutely nothing to make me think that, my mind panics)
and when i get overwhelmed, i get extremely afraid of messing things up. not to mention, i’m afraid of loss. i lost two people who were so important to me (the toxic friends), and it hurt me so badly. i’m afraid of losing my current friends now, despite there being absolutely NOTHING that would plant these thoughts. my mind just panics

at the moment, my brain feels there’s something wrong with one of my friendships. and i get such a pit in my stomach
then i remember there’s nothing wrong. everything is perfectly fine, as great as it’s ever been. my mind is just — once again — being so unnecessarily cruel to me

i think therapy would benefit me greatly. however, i’m unable to afford the cost, and this isn’t something my parents would understand. therefore, it’s — unfortunately — not an option for me at this point

is there anything anyone could recommend that could help me begin healing and overcoming this trauma? i can’t take it anymore. i feel at such a loss. and i’m not entirely sure what to do that could help me

i feel like low self-esteem also helps play a role in this, so does anyone have any tips for building that?

i appreciate all advice. as i said, i’m at such a loss and don’t know what i can do to help myself. bc i don’t deserve to live like this"
44,If you've been inpatient before did it actually help you?,"Hi there, 
I've battled with depression for over a decade now, I've been inpatient myself and honestly felt like it was a waste of time and money. I currently work in a inpatient hospital, and we have a adolescent unit, many of the teens have told me they've been inpatient multiple times throughout their teenage years and that it hasn't helped them at all. If it helped you, what made your stay worthy?"
45,Did this count as self harm?,So I have been clean of self harm for like 6 months but yesterday I got a bad cut on my foot and the first thing I did was poor rubbing alcohol on it. I didn’t do it at all to clean it just to feel the pain. Dose this count as self harm?
46,"What are some good mental health apps or strategies to help anxiety, depression, and to get motivation back?",I’ve finally accepted that I need help with my mental health but I have no idea where to start. I don’t want to jump in with therapy. I would like to find some apps (preferably with a good free version or trial so I can see if it fits me) or some strategies to help me. I have anxiety and depression but I don’t know how severe. I can elaborate on my symptoms and stuff like that if it helps anyone suggest anything. I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask but I don’t know where else to.
47,My parents seem to understand but it's not enough,"As it says in the title, my parents can see my anxiety. However, they never seem to acknowledge it at the length that it is. I've had hypochondria (not the joke title, like I truly cannot consume media about illness without at least aa moderate level of anxiety) for the past year and a half, possibly more. I've been uncontrollably shaking, either in the middle of the night or randomly, for the past year. Even more recently, my stomach has been on a rampage, going through all kinds of symptoms. As someone who basically developed emetophobia since an incident that happened in march, any type of nausea really just sends me to the moon in the most negative way possible, so this part has been particularly hard on me (I am getting better though slowly, I started a food diary and everything just in case). 

But then, whenever my parents, specifically my dad, talk to me about my behavior, it's all about how I'm draining them. How every time I compulsively tell them about every little detail because I'm worried about dying, it affects them more than it affects me. Like bro? And then my dad really wants to get me to read a book about psychosomatic symptoms...man I would think experiencing them for over two years would get me pretty well acquainted with them!

Somehow, they end up acknowledging my anxiety while simultaneously invalidating me about it. 

And the funniest part is that I've literally gone to therapy in the past for something pretty serious, it's not a foreign concept to them -- but I doubt they really saw anything about it besides the money, as evidenced by this one comment thread on one of my mom's old instagram posts...

Anyways my final note is whenever my dad tells me I'll feel better in college I literally want to scream. Yeah I probably will because I'll have the chance to actually get help :|"
48,"Dear self, It's hard to help you when I hate you so much. I'm so tired.","I sometimes wish I could help you, but it's so hard when I hate you so much. I hate you and the life you create. I hate what you've done to me. I feel so hopeless when you're understood. I don't see you like I should.

Suicide thoughts come and go like an ocean wave. I know you can't die right now, because you need to be here for other people right now, but I still fantasize about your death. You forced me to commit to you, and it gives me the worst pain and anxiety.

Late nights are the worst for me, they bring out the worst thoughts in me.

I'm tired of being in hell.

I’m tired of remembering.

I'm tired of crying.

I'm tired of fighting.

I'm tired of being scared.

I'm tired of being alone.

I'm tired of being stuck.

I'm tired of being lost.

I'm tired of being hurt.

I'm tired of being abused.

I'm tired of feeling pain.

I'm tired of needing help.

I'm tired of losing loved ones.

I'm tired of my heart breaking.

I'm tired of being different.

I’m tired of being embarrassed.

I'm tired of feeling worthless.

I'm tired of wishing that I could start over.

I'm tired of losing trust in myself.

I'm tired of comparing myself to others.

I'm tired of being a failure.

I'm tired of dreaming about a life I'll never have.

I'm tired of not feeling loved.

I'm tired of all the evil in this world.

I'm tired of being with myself.

You promised me that you would stop thinking. You promised me that you would numb out emotions once more, but you just make me feel more hell. The physical pain is just felt more tonight, as I'm trying to fight all the nausea, heartaches, and headaches. The bricks on my chest are getting heavier, the nausea is more intense, and my head won't stop pounding.

It's a waste of faith to believe in you. I'm so tired. I'm sorry we have to still be alive. I hate myself.

49,Has anyone been shamed by their doctor? Insulted and screamed at for 30 min?,"I had this happen to my Monday and I’m still traumatized. I switched doctors that day. My family doctor, whose been prescribing my psych meds with no problem for a year and a half, literally yelled me like I was his kid who got a bad grade. All while the student shadowing him furiously sat in the Corner loudly typing. He was screaming because apparently since I asked to fill my Adderall prescription one more time my psych needs my records first, was totally weird and suspicious so
I must be a fiend. I have not gotten Medication from him since September due to situation out of my control, which I told him about and was completely valid. I asked for all my psych meds  not just my Adderall. I’ve been taking Adderall on and off for 15 years abs he literally acted like I was so crazy fiend. Apparently, being on Adderall at 33 is suspicious and since I’m not in school, I don’t have ADHD anymore if I still need to take Adderall , I have problem. Excuse me? Does that also apply to my anxiety? Sorry dude, mental illness doesn’t really just disappear when it feels like it, sometimes
 You may feel better, but is there. He made a HUGE deal abour me taking this drug test ( which is normal and they do it randomly, I was expecting to take, and have never failed). He’s literally screaming like I’m laying on the floor kicking and scream of refusing to take it.  My favorite past was when, I told him the differences that I feel while on my Adderall abs his response was “OH IT MAKES YOU GOOD? THATS NICE, so does Cocaine”.. it was weirdest, make uncomfortable experience of my life. And to
Make this better, I specifically wanted to go to a psychiatrist because I don’t feel like my meds work anymore , and my stress arn anxiety have been worse than ever. I wanted to see if there were other Option it took me a good 3 months to finally have the appointment.

Then, this lady who I literally haven’t even met and had a zoom appointment l. Tells me that I’m wrong, she doesn’t think it’s meds. My life is just stressful.. So im stressed. Also she wanted records from my psycho dr Before shell prescribe me Adderall is not the dr originally diagnosed me 15 years ago, and I don’t remember his name.

The Doctors, I have never had a dr refuse to presxribe it, accuse me of being on drugs, or have any suspicions that I was abusing it. I give up"
50,How do I take steps to be more comfortable about a part of myself surrounded by so much trauma?,"&amp;#x200B;

(might be triggering as I bring up some assault and church stuff)(sorry if this is a little ranty I just need someone to know and need to feel less alone)

I'm 18 ftm and now on T (2 months). I am an extremely active member of the trans community online.

Firstly im going to ask a question. Is there small steps I can take to be more comfortable being trans in real life? Is there some way I can tell my parents im trans?

(here's the ranty part)

I have never said the words I am trans in real life. To anyone. My brother knows and my friends know but I've never said the words. My parents don't know and I still live with them.

I wanted to get to the point where I could proudly say i'm trans to my parents, who would support me, but I just never seem to be able to utter those words aloud. It just brings up so many bad memories and thoughts, I just shut down and cant say it.

My family is extremely liberal but growing up it was so much different we went to church, and live in a conservative town. After I told my mom I liked girls we stopped going to church. But the damage was done

Nobody really knows this in my real life but in highschool I've been targeted due to my gender and sexuality, I was followed home several times and had the life beat out of me. I grew up in a church that had some spicy opinions on the lgbt community my first intro to this community. It really set the idea that if I want to live I cant be this. By the time I hit middle school they had stamped the idea of homophobia and transphobia into my brain.

It took me so long to be OK on my own and I thought id be fine with just me being the only who knows until I turned 18 got on T and am living as a man outside of my personal life. Even in a house that loved and accepted me I never told them who I dated or anything lgbt. It felt like a dirty secret I had to keep. I've known for so long and everyone thinks i'm just very confident and secure in who I am. But i'm not. I have so much internalized hatred of myself. I've always learned to keep it to myself.

I've been trying the look in the mirror and saying over and over. It doesn't stop hurting.

I want to love myself but its really hard when something that is such a huge part of me is something I've been taught is something that will put me in danger.

I just want to be able to tell my parents I am trans without thinking i'm going to hell or am going to be kicked out or the long list of unwarranted worries that I've developed over the years.

I tried therapy but without being able to tell them who I am or anything of a sort it goes nowhere. I cant talk about my trauma. I cant talk about the reasons id get beat up. Or the reasons church messed me up. All because I cant say I am trans.

I just don't know how to move forward in my life if I cant tell my family who I am. I cant handle being called she or being called my parents daughter because i haven't specified who I am.

I have a loving family but that doesn't mean anything if I cant tell them who I am.

(Tldr: i'm stinky and my brain hates itself due to trauma related to being trans.)"
51,Don't know what this is and need help identifying this. (M19),"Long day of work today. I have a hands-on and strenuous job, so I can get pretty tired. Pretty much a normal work day, Nearing the end of the work day, which is 5:00, my legs felt weak and I felt like they were about to collapse on me sometimes. I felt really tired all of a sudden. I had to force myself to move for the next 30 minutes until we were off.

I get in my car and drop my coworker off at his place, then grab something to eat. I sit in the parking lot of Panda Express for nearly 30 minutes in midst of texting back when I find myself experiencing a feeling similar to vertigo, where most feeling ceased and I pretty dissociated from myself. After some time I come back into reality and go in the drive through in a slight haze.

I come home, my roommate is in his room and I can faintly hear him talking on his gaming headset. I sit down to eat at our kitchen table pull out my phone and watch some random YouTube stuff to pass the time. When all of a sudden a wave of chest/stomach pressure hits me hard. I take a shower since I'm filthy from work, and once I'm out another feeling of dread and anxiety hits me hard. I go to my room, which has been a mess the past couple of days (I usually keep it tidy and clean) and lay in bed.

I'm starting to have trouble breathing and before I know it I'm hyperventilating and tearing up. I have a feeling of dread and want to die just so I don't feel this. I'm desperate for anybody to come help or calm me down. I text me friend (who's an amazing person) and tell her I don't feel good. She tells me to drink water and asks if I need a talk. I say yes I'd really appreciate it.

Right now I'm waiting for her to reply (I sent my text asking to talk like 3 minutes ago) and the feeling has subsided for the most part besides a lingering chest/stomach pressure, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of anxiety I can't shake. I'm currently struggling to keep my composure.

What is this and what can I do about it? I've considered therapy (I sorta have some stuff going on) but I've almost never experienced this in my life. It hits hard and fades quickly, lingering close by as if it's going to strike again.

Please, I need help. Anything is appreciated."

53,Growing up with twisted parents,"has anyone else had experience with parents who have been abusive, but also would try and act like you where crazy to think there actions where wrong?

My dad would always yell at me (swearing, calling me a piece of shit, threatening to kill me, and always tearing me down). he also would occasionally hit me, throw me against the wall, push me on the ground, and bend my hand in half until it would almost break.

he would rarely take responsibility for his actions, and even if he did he would blame me a young kid for his terrible actions. my mom was manipulative at times and would never stand up to my dad or say what he was doing was wrong. 

I am 22 now but it kinda fucked my head up and i’m just trying to see what people would suggest to help get over it. also should i have a relationship with my parents now?"
54,I have a problem,"
Ever since i was younger I’ve been dealing with different forms of abuse whether it be physically or mentally. Recently an incident occurred with my mother that brought back memories that i thought i got rid of and they keep coming back in due to mainly certain noises but some words trigger me as well. The slam of the car door, loud rustling, or just random loud unknown noises in general will scare me and i don’t really know how to stop thinking about the worse possible things happening to my mother, me, or anyone else around.

I’m kinda wondering if this is some form of ptsd or something and i would like to know how to deal with it better."

56,Opinions on Journaling for Depression and Anxiety?,"Hello! I (F19) have been struggling with Depression and Anxiety for a few years. It worsened when I moved far from my home to attend college. I’m working hard to fix my mental health and learn to love myself more. So far I have taken up therapy and been on medication for almost a full month now. 

It’s been wonderful but I was wondering if anyone has done journaling before? If it actually helps you or not in terms of mental health. I answer a set of questions I’ve found online everyday since January 6th.

If you don’t do journaling, what do you do besides therapy or medication to help your mental health? I’d love to hear it :) Thank you!

TL;DR I wanna hear some thoughts on journaling for depression and anxiety or what you do to better your mental health!"
57,"I miss feeling things, is this normal? What can I do?"," Lately (the past 3-6months) I have been feeling kinda dull and numb, don't find much joy in things I used to do, I don't feel sad with things that used to make me sad, I don't feel happy when things are going good or something good happened to me like (passing the admission exam in University), I also stopped enjoying people company, I don't feel annoyed or bored, I'm just living the day by day

 I would want to cry again watching a sad romantic story, I want to fall in love with any girl that give me a little of attention like I used to do before :P, I want to laugh out loud at silly jokes made by even more silly youtubers, I want to feel something again!! I'm with my bland face all day looking at the phone or doing my homework, I started watching animes and series again but they don't produce me any feeling, I read comments of people saying how the episode made them feel and I just can't stop thinking in what's wrong in me that I can't feel the same.. I noticed that it's affecting my social life alot, this one being really bad already, now I feel like I'm too boring for them and I understand if they would stop talking sooner or later."
58,I need help I have an obsession with my ex-best friend,"So I’ve known this girl for a couple of years. We used to be good friends in high school. I met her when we were 14 years old. When we were 17 she got together with this guy who is a little older than us and they are still together to this day. This year we turned 20 we are no longer friends we just stop talking and drifted apart. I have not seen her in two years since I’ve graduated high school. She dropped out and moved in with this guy so she didn’t finish high school. I have made fake Facebook accounts to to stock her page and see what she’s doing with her life I have an obsession of seen her and her and her boyfriend to break up because I feel that he ruined her life and was a bad influence and made her drop out of school. I just can’t believe how long they’ve actually stayed together, I thought they were just gonna break up six months after they got together like everyone did at 17. Months will go by and I will forget about them but whenever I think about them I just have to go on Facebook and check them out and see what they’re up to. Why do I have this obsession? I feel like it’s draining, because some days they will be only think about and I will just check out their pages on and off. How can I find a way to just forget them and get on with my life. And ever since we have stopped being friends and I haven’t made new friends and I don’t have any. I don’t have anybody but my husband and daughter. It is really hard to make new friends and keep up a relationship to keep them as friends I feel uninterested and bored trying to do that. What is wrong with me?"
59,Physical affection,"To begin you need to understand a few things, I do not go to school nor am homeschooled and I consider myself lucky that I never was in the toxic environment that is school, I think this combined with some financial problems and my family not trying to “protect” me from the real world has caused me to be a bit more mature than others my age 

But, because I never went to school I’ve never had many chances to make friends. When i was 6ish I had some friends who I played games with and while I met them in the real world we only really ever talked online and after a year or so we lost contact

I had another friend who I’ve known for about 6-7 years but we aren’t very close, she started out basically babysitting me since she was 1-2 years older but I’ve grown since then but I still wouldn’t consider us close I saw her whenever my dad went to work, and she doesn’t like physical contact.

My family is also not very physically affection when I’m at my dad’s for a week per month I get a couple hugs but while I’m at my moms I rarely even get one the whole time I’m there

I do have a really close friend now of 2 years but she’s an online friend and while I love her to death you can’t hug someone through a screen.

Things started to go down hill when quarantine came about since I haven’t seen my real life friend but about 3-4 times since it started so any physical contact I managed to get from that is gone, although before that I did have albeit uncommon occurrences where for about a week or maybe two I’d get incredibly sad and basically desperate for physical affection where I’d even started dreaming about it once, but I eventually got over it.

But since quarantine it’s been more frequent and for the last two months roughly I’ve been stuck in this just bleh state, I don’t exactly feel sad but I feel as if there is a weight/hole in my chest at the same time and everytime I fall I asleep I do it by imagining im hugging or snuggling with someone and what’d it would feel like, usually it would be long over by now and I’d be fine again for awhile but it’s not going away and I just feel horrible all the time I don’t even really want to talk my close friend anymore at times.

I have other issues such as I’m fairly sure I have issues with empathy as I almost never feel sad for other people unless it affects me in someway(like I’d feel sad a cat died because I can’t pet it or hang out with it anymore not that a cat d i e d, We’ve actually had multiple cats die and I never felt really sad or cared and I think it’s because it just never really affected me) the one exception to this Is my close online friend, she’s basically the only one that I can remember really feeling bad for and not just feeling guilty that I don’t care. But that’s off topic.

That’s all I really have to say, I’m far too emotional drained already to really continue, I might delete this later because a couple people that I know online use Reddit and I don’t want them finding this somehow because they would probably recognize my style of speaking or something else from my profile"
60,Parents fighting is effecting me,"I am a teen living in the U.S. . I grew up without a biological father. Single mother making less than 30k. Now, let me set the stage.

About 4 years ago I moved into a small 2 room/living room/ basement house. It was in a rough neighborhood and had constant problems. It was built in the 30's and needs up keep. 
Through out those years I had no role models other then in my family. I was still a happy up until the months we were there. I suddenly had anxiety issues, panic attacks, things like that. Soon after mom met a guy and things took off. We moved into his house a couple months after they started and things were great. My problems seem to be non existent and I was happy. Everything was prefect up until last Sunday. They started arguing to the point of yelling, I don't know context but this has been happening every night for the past 5 nights. During the day there is no real problems but then at around 4-5 (sun down) things heat up a little bit and last til about 8. They try not to argue in front of me because of the past (not arguing about me just my feelings on it) yet I still hear them. Before you ask, no, no one is a alcoholic and there is nothing really mood altering going on. Now for the past 2 years I remember them arguing like this maybe 3 times? But it only lasted around 10 mins and after they were fine. Now this is happening all the sudden and it is effecting me. 

I feel sadness, fear that they will split, and anger that they are arguing. I don't know what to do and try to ignore it by watching videos but it just maintains a foothold in my head, constantly thinking of endless possibilities. Please don't be scared to hurt me I want 100% honest opinions.

Where will the future go? 
What can I do to suppress my emotions?
Should I step in?

I can't stand arguing between couples I would say it is my number 1 hate. It makes me feel different ways all negative, so please, what can I do?"
61,"Spending any amount of time on twitter makes me irrationally angry, what's wrong with me?","I'll be on twitter and see all this horrible stuff with climate change and politics, and then I see pedo/zoophiles openly posting about their shit online with no fear of reprisals, and the world all just feels like it's collapsing. I never get that angry any time else, but every time I open twitter it just pisses me off more and more"
62,Just need to tell someone.,"Broke my 300th body today. I have averaged one every 11 calendar days for the past 9 years. I dont wear gloves anymore to handle them unless they're really rancid or crispy from a fire. Something about cooked human. 

I almost attacked my 4 year old when he pointed a nerf gun at me. Instinct. People don't point guns at me all that often but I rehearse the scenario so much that its never far from the front of my mind.

I watched my body camera footage of a 120 mph car chase from last week. I was singing ""Brandy"" by Looking Glass. Wondered why I was doing it then i realized I got bored after a couple of miles. 

I can only sleep during the day because my wife is awake to guard the house. 

Im hypervigilant and react in unpredictable ways to loud noises, yelling, crowds. Sometimes I go into a panic. Sometimes I become super efficient and focused. My mouth gets dry. I lose feeling in my hands and feet. Lose fine motor skills. Get dizzy. 

When the metaphorical defecation is hitting the oscillation I'm perfectly fine. Very calm and rational. I make quick, sound decisions. Handle business and don't really think back on it. Then I go home and dream about it for weeks or more. 

My mind is compartmentalizing trauma and I know its happening but I cant stop it. It feels like a soda thats been shaken up with a cap on it and then opened. Its not effective enough at containing it and the excess seeps out of the edges of my brain. 

The therapist they made me go to after my friends were killed in the line of duty said its called compound or collective PTSD. A life of trauma that never really goes away completely but is so common place to you that you don't even associate it with something abnormal. Like when wood burns it leaves ashes (humans do too sometimes). The real meat of the problem is dealt with but there is residue. That residue accumulates  like grease or something and can't really be cleaned up; just smeared around.

PTSD, depression, anxiety. They have no meaning because they have been turned into buzz words that people use to relate every day problems and sound important. So there are no words (with any real significance) to describe this feeling. Its like the word ""awesome"". Given its root, connotations, etc it should only be used to describe God. We use it to describe pizza. 

I have a weight. It pushes down on my shoulders. I can feel it. My back hurts because of it. My muscles aren't tight. I have an actual weight on me. But my body can't sustain it so it pushes through my shoulders into my chest and builds up there. There's nowhere for it to go.

There's so much pressure from the weight and it bursts sometimes. But its like pushing on a bruise. It doesn't make it feel better, it makes it hurt more but something about it is comforting. Like the pain is addictive in some way. You catch yourself pushing on the bruise unintentionally. You don't know why but you like it. The weight is like that. I'm so tired of it but I cant stop trying to feel it. I like being aware of it because it gives credibility to all of these feelings. They're not buzz words. They're real. Anxiety feels like fingers pushing outward in my lungs. Depression feels like a gnawing in my sides and towards the front my stomach right at the place where the ribs end. PTSD is the bruise. Its in my heart. Not figuratively. I feel it. My heart is bruised. 

I was happy. I enjoyed life. Now I just wait for the next moment so that it can be over and the next one will come so that it can pass too. I dont want to die. I'm not suicidal. I just want the moments to pass. It helps to stay busy. I forget about the weight and the moments pass faster. 

Have you ever been in a heated argument that dragged on? At a point you stop caring if you win, or if they understand your point. You're just done. No hard feelings, anger. Just nothing. You want to go to sleep because your passion for the argument died. Tomorrow it won't matter. You're just done and want the moments to pass until its better. 

I dont want to die. I just want all the moments to be passed. Im tired of the argument. The weight is just so heavy."
63,I can't sleep or leave the house anymore,I ve been humiliated and insulted in my previous jobs the people who did it have took up residence in my head I left but was stalked for a while after. I can't stop thinking about all these horrible people and the things they did I ve been stalked belittled been creeped on heckled on a daily basis. I meet on a daily basis when I step outside I don't know why but I seem to attract them to the point I'm starting to think a conspiracy has been made about me I don't trust anyone anymore I use to go walking in the hills to calm my mind down but the freaks and weirdos have followed me up there too the areas overpopulated by wannabe gangsters and drug dealers I'm afraid to leave the house now I can't sleep and I ve started coming up with plans to kill myself as I think this would be the best release unfortunately killing yourself is incredibly painful. my paranoia has gone through the roof now I usually just sit in the corner not making any noise for the day. I actually look forward to dieing

68,Trazodone?,"Has anyone here been prescribed trazodone for bipolar/mania-induced insomnia? If so, how does it make you feel? I assume it’ll make me sleepy enough to actually get some rest, but my mother said it’s addictive and everyone around me has done nothing but warn me about it.

For context, this is my first time hearing of it or taking it. I was told to take 50 mg daily, but to take an additional 25mg “when needed”. 

I don’t want to start something serious for a problem that could potentially be solved with something more natural and easy like marijuana or melatonin."
69,Please help,"I am going through something. I am in a constant battle with my thoughts. I am trying to learn how to observe my thoughts. I know my thoughts are not me. I feel a thought of guilt that yells at me and judges me for not working out, etc... I feel as if I have one person making me feel guilt and one that is listening. I feel like me observing is the person trying to listen. But the person trying to listen also asks questions to the person trying to make me feel guilty. I am struggling to identify if the person listening is me or if I should disassociate the listener as well. I have tried to disassociate the person who is listening as well but it really make it difficult to observe myself after that. I am saying people because I am trying to disassociate the thoughts from myself because I am the observer and I don’t belong to my thoughts. Any advice or direction is appreciated greatly. I am not religious. I wanted to put this in r/mindfullness but I dont have enough karma. "
70,Why is it so hard to just keep take your meds?,"I have so much cognitive dissonance with this issue and I know I’m not alone, but it’s so frustrating! On one hand, I’m extremely logical and have enough self awareness to see that taking my meds as prescribed helps everything. As I start to move toward the thought process of stopping my meds it’s like I can see myself in third person and the irrationality of the decision and how frustrated I would feel as an outsider, but I’m not an outsider. Being me, I can come up with million reasons to try and rationalize why I don’t need them.

Why do we do this to ourselves? If we know it’s better to stay the course and things are okay why would we want to change things and make them bad again? Why do we feel the need to rationalize ourselves out of taking meds? Sure some of it is societal and some of it is a coping mechanism- but why? If I know this why can’t I turn off these thoughts and just do what I goddamn need to do to be a worthwhile me?

If I try harder I wouldn’t need meds, so if I just keep trying hard and stop the meds I should be fine...I should stop being lazy and using meds and just get off them and put more effort into myself like everyone else who isn’t on meds.

What if I don’t even have ADHD? What if I have the same struggles as everyone else and I’m just being dramatic about how hard I find some things?

My PCP isn’t filling my prescriptions that I’ve worked for a year to accept and stabilize likely because of a misunderstanding- why am I so unwilling to just tell her that? Why am I so worried about her burnout and not wanting to make her feel pressured to prescribe drugs she may or may not feel comfortable when she has never indicated this that I would rather just self taper off everything and not talk to her about it?

Why can’t I just accept who I am and that I need drugs to be able to survive in today’s world and achieve the goals I have?

Why does everyone have to be held to social standards created by neurotypicals? Which are not built for who I am at all and I can’t seem to force myself to conform to. Why can’t I have goals which aren’t so intertwined with being successful in a world not made for neurodiversity?

This isn’t meant to complain. I am just frustrated and genuinely asking what your, or what you’ve seen, the reasons are for why we make simple things like taking our medications so hard on ourselves? It doesn’t have to be. We could just take the goddamn pills and not think about it again if we could all just accept it."
71,Should you date if you have mental health issues?,I'm 19(f) and deal with severe manic depression and childhood inadequacy. I feel like my crippling self esteem makes me an impossible candidate for having a healthy relationship ever and I feel like I've never been  able to maintain a balanced relationship. Is there hope or will I and others inevitably bring suffering into the lives of everyone we try to be with? All I want in life is a family but it feels so unattainable. I feel too worthless to ever be able to make someone truly happy.
72,What does this behavior fall under?,"I’m going to keep it vague and describe the behavior of someone in my life. It’s gotten to the point where I’m wondering if something bigger is going on.

Behaviors:
Someone who lies frequently, and often. Someone who doesn’t feel shame about lying but more upset that they were found out. Someone who manipulates constantly, and lies constantly about little and big things. Struggles with emotion (showing it, and actively avoids it at all costs, would rather pretend to show fake emotions). 
There is constant disassociation as well. For lack of better words, this person says that they constantly feel like they don’t have a personality, Becuase they have no interests or desires for their personal life. This person thrives at work, and loves work, but struggles with personal relationships.

These behaviors are starting to damage relationships. I’ve tried googling, but I’m not for sure what I’m looking for. Does this behavior align with any disorders or illnesses? Either way, I am encouraging them to see a therapist when they are able."
73,Not sure I know what love is,"I (18M) have never had much luck with relationships of any description.

In Grade 10 (16M), I became unhealthily infatuated with my crush (16F) after learning she liked me back. We were “together” for less than a week because I expected a romantic relationship like I’d seen in all those movies (16 years old, remember) and she took advantage of my naiveté. Only a few days had passed when I saw her tongue-kissing a new guy in the hallway.
Knowing that she will always be my first kiss makes me feel dirty. If you’re reading this:

Fuck you Chelsey! 

I currently have zero real friends. Nothing out of the ordinary. In Grade 11 I had a small group of “friends” but I always felt like the outsider. Haven’t spoken to them since I spontaneously flipped out upon realizing they were all underage drinkers and/or drug users. My junkie dad ran away before I was born because he didn’t want to kick his morphine habit to raise a kid so I naturally loathe anyone who risks developing an addiction to maintain their party lifestyle. So fuck them.

I rarely make friends with other guys. I know it’s cliché but I really am not like most other guys my age. I was never a gamer, an aspiring tradesman, a stoner or a football player. I was the kid who did math homework for anyone who asked, scaled abandoned buildings during breaks and invoked Satan as part of a presentation for my religion class (I got 100%).
It also seems like I can’t be friends with girls. Why? I always end up either falling for them or becoming tired of their presence. And when I fall for them? They’re always lesbian. Why? Because the universe hates me for existing. That’s why.

I hate my family. I’m currently stocking up on camping supplies because I don’t want to pay $400 monthly to live in someone’s basement with three other guys. To clarify, I plan on making a home in the woods and living a simple life, against the wishes of the government and greedy corporations. Anyway, sometimes my mom will ask if I love her. I say yes because I’m still somewhat dependent on my parents but, in reality, I don’t know what familial love is. I feel only disappointment in relation to her and a slightly irrational hatred toward my stepdad. My half-siblings are just obstacles, not even worth considering.

On top of all this confusion about relationships and the meaning of love, I’m no longer 100% sure about my orientation. I definitely find women attractive. Sometimes I want to cry because, as a grocery store cashier, I work with a lot of beautiful women and I. Can’t. Have. Any. Of. Them. They’re all either taken or just outside my age range (dating a 17yo would make me a sexual predator, dating a 20yo would be pretty awkward). 

Anyway, I definitely don’t feel that same attraction to guys. The idea of gay sex makes me want to throw up. Sometimes, though, I can imagine myself being in a platonic but emotionally intimate relationship with certain men. Not of the macho variety, but the chill ones with long, straight hair and a thin build. It started with a couple of well-known musicians, both of whom are deceased. One of them, to a lesser extent, is Kurt Cobain, about whom I am a walking encyclopædia. The other, to a much greater extent, is Terje Bakken, a.k.a. Valfar. My god, I could absolutely be with that man platonically if he hadn’t died in 2004. And I’m not just talking about enjoying his amazing compositions, I’m attracted to his looks, too. I want to compose music alongside him, wake up next to him each morning and grow old with him.
Surely that doesn’t make me bisexual, but maybe I’m heterosexual and homoromantic or something? Is there such a thing? I also felt a similar but lesser attraction to a (living) male student in one of my online university classes. I think it’s the Nordic look that really gets me (Nordic women too!).

The problem is, if I can’t really differentiate between the various kinds of nonsexual attraction, how will I know if someone is the right person for me? How will I know that I love them enough and in the correct sense of the word to sustain a healthy relationship? How will I know they love me and won’t betray my trust again?

I’ve put off dating a long time now but I’m sick of being lonely. Feel free to comment on any of the many ridiculous sentences this post contains, but what I really need is support because I am a damned confused guy right now. Thanks!"
74,Stigma must end,"I work as a psych tech at and adolescent facility. I was discussing a patient with one of our nurses who stated that she thinks said patient has BPD. This nurse went on to tell me that people with bpd are all attention seeking and manipulative. I'm sure some of us are those things, but everyone experiences their symptoms differently. I just feel like the nurse was generalizing and it really got under my skin. Those working in psych need to be better educated about what their patients are facing."
75,"I need help, i found this on a forrum on ghosts and mediums, but as soon as i read it, it felt like symptoms of schizophrenia,(im no expert) but can anyone say if i might be right because if i am then the OP should be made known he/she seems unaware and i only want to help. 👇the article","Hello, I recently have been trying to figure out whats going on inside my head. I hear voices in my head, but they're not my own. They're not my thoughts/ internal monologue. They are their own voices and are distinguishable from each other. I only hear whispers and sometimes laughing. They're are a lot of them. Or at least they are very loud. I know there is a man and a women. I never have been able to understand them. The best to describe is, its like listening to a conversation through a wall. You know is talking but you can't understand them. This has been going for as long as i can remember.

76,"Nearly had my first girlfriend, and then the world nearly ended","Growing up, I had a tough time connecting with people, and have a pretty low self esteem. In high school and college when all my started dating and I wasn’t successful at finding a girlfriend I would make the self deprecating joke about being forever alone and getting a girlfriend would be a sign the world was coming to an end. Last year I meet a girl, we hit it off instantly, didn’t officially date, but would hang out a lot and sometimes make our. In early January of last year she tells me that she started a real relationship with someone else. I get heartbroken naturally, and upset. I try to pick myself up and tell myself it’s not the end of the world, and low and behold, 2020.

I know this is all ridiculous, maybe more funny than it is concerning. Still that was now a year ago and the pandemic has kind of forced me to sit with it all this time, and made it hard to get over. On top of that with this being first thing I can consider being close to a real relationship, it does give a whole Jesus cries blood when I try to find love vibe to it. Like the world was telling me to look for a relationship growing up, and when I didn’t listen it punished me and everyone else for it.

Any ideas on how to stop feeling like this. When I look online I find a lot of advice on how to get over relationships, but none that talk about in a global pandemic."
77,Confused about if I can trust my own judgment or not/ struggling with feeling unloved bc of mental illness by family,"Hi everyone. I (19f)  wanted to come on here to ask for some advice relating to my family. For some background, I was diagnosed with OCD around 10th grade of high school, and I have struggled with obsessive thinking patterns (regarding social situations and skincare) and anxiety (intrusive thoughts but less now)  my whole life. Recently I’ve been wondering if I may have Aspergers,  but I’ve never been diagnosed. I used to take Lexapro in high school, but recently I’ve gone off it. I’ve felt happier without it, but I have been more anxious. My anxiety hasn’t gotten bad to the point where it’s debilitating or distresses me to a point I can’t handle though. So far it’s mostly manifested in my skin care obsession. I’ve been managing it really well in my opinion, but my mother and twin sister are both adamant that I take lexapro again. My mom has always wanted me to be medicated, and it’s been an insecurity of mine that my natural state (me with my anxiety and all) annoys her and that I’m “easier to deal with” on meds. My mom says that I am irritable and that I “latch onto things people say like a pit bull”. I’ve done reflecting over this, and sometimes someone will say something and I am unsure what they meant , so I ask them what they meant and I’ll even bring it up way later in conversation. She says this is me being paranoid and insecure, which may be true, but I honestly can’t tell what people are thinking when they say things sometimes and I often ask. Today she said that I act inappropriately and overly aggressive during conversations (her example being that I won’t let other people talk, and that I wanted her advice about a friend this morning and we talked for about 20 minutes and she told me she needed to finish her grading - she’s a teacher- and I felt that she said it in a rude way so I told her it was rude and she told me that my anxiety over my friendship was “just my OCD” and that I “need to go back on lexapro”. I realize now that I should have left her alone when she said she needed to work but, my anxiety over my friendship was because one of my closest friends had confessed their feelings for me, and I was stressed over possibly hurting them because I wasn’t sure how I felt. Which I feel is a completely normal reaction to a confession of love that has nothing to do with anxiety or OCD. Later in the day, I went to talk to my twin about what she thought (like was I in the wrong, or was it my mom); she said that I was in the wrong because most people don’t get anxious over “small things”. I tried to explain to her that my friend had confessed his feelings to me, and that’s why I had been stressed. She then wouldn’t look at me, and just nodded and said “mhmm.” I started to tell her that me worrying over a friend is a normal response, and she cut me off to say that “conversations like this is why you need to go back on lexapro”. I said okay and left, but this really hurt me because my sister confides in me about every little detail regarding her relationship, and work life; and I always listen and give her advice. Then later today, my mom, sister, and I got into a debate about feminism and what feminism is and isn’t. My mom and I agreed about something that my twin didn’t and my twin left, and I felt that my mom and I were getting along really well so I mentioned to her my feelings that she wants me to go on medication because I’m less annoying when I’m medicated. She then went on a long tangent about how when I’m not in my medication, I don’t think clearly and I don’t respect when people want to end conversations and that it inhibits my intelligence because my emotions are too strong. I know more about ocd than her, so I told her that those aren’t symptoms of ocd and she says “oh that’s just you’re ocd that makes you think that”. I’m starting to wonder if she’s gaslighting me? Yes I have ocd, but not everything I do is caused by my ocd. I told her that I thought I might have aspergers after she said that, and she immediately brushed it aside and AGAIN tried to say that I only think that because of my ocd. I explained to her that ocd (pure-o in my case) is only worrying about things that go AGAINST your ideals and who you are, and that the idea of having aspergers doesn’t upset me but she brushed it off. I literally feel crazy because I can’t tell if I’m wrong or not. I’m trying to trust myself but she’s literally telling me I can’t and that every single thing I do is mental illness. Anyways, our convo ended with me telling my mom that if I were to take medication it would only be for her, and my mom telling me to go ahead and not take it as long as i can not let my anxiety make me self absorbed when people are busy  and I want to talk to them or during debates (saying I raised my voice too much even though from my POV I was just passionate about it, and my mom and sister weren’t letting me finish my point and interrupting). But maybe I was talking a little too much during the debate, I don’t know. My mom also said that I have to understand why people don’t want to be around me if I’m not on my meds, and after I expressed to her that I felt like she only loved me if I was medicated, she tried to say that she wants me on meds so I feel better. But it hurts me badly because I can’t shake the feeling that it’s for her. Sorry for such a long post, thank you so much for reading, any advice at all is appreciated! Sorry for so many run on sentences

- Also I’ve been off Lexapro for 8 months now and for the majority of the time I lied to my mom and sister that I was taking it, and they never said anything like this or even knew that I wasn’t actually taking it. Only recently did I tell them I was off it, and now everything I do is “because I’m not on it”."

79,"I’m depressed due to a medical issue, and I’m mad at my doctor for being too slow with treatment","As the title says, my depression symptoms are almost 99% caused by another medical issue that I have. My doctor who treats me for the medical issue is taking things very slowly treatment-wise(for safety reasons), but I don’t think they get how I feel. I was dying to get treatment because I’ve been depressed for so long, and now my doctor is giving me small amounts of medicine and making me wait months before appointments, when I already know I need to increase the dosage or try another medicine. When I’m depressed I have a habit of literally ruining my life through eating like shit, smoking, slacking in school, etc., so I can not afford to be depressed any longer."
80,Long read(Sensitive content) I Don't wanna be here anymore. Everyday feels like more of a reason to end it,"I was born with F.A.S (fetal alcohol) and N.a.S (neonatal abstinence syndrome)which led to me being adopted when I was 5 because my biological  parents were pretty shitty and didnt care at all. My dad used to beat me and throw me into the walls and choke me, eventually I lost it and tried to OD when I was 10, shitty part is that they never payed as much attention to me as my brother so I almost died and they had no clue and to this day no one knows. I don't want to disappoint my family so I never told them, since then my parents split and my mom and my brother and I  moved to a shitty apartment with nothing and no money because my dad kicked us out,i spent middle school in my new town alone with no one.

When we moved out of the apartments I dealt with sexual assault, didnt tell anyone either until the legal system did it for me, which was one of the worst times I've been alive. It really fucked me up because it was my first time and it was that. Once again I was on the edge of suicide.

Things started looking up after that year I had two jobs and hella money I met the first girl I'd ever deeply care about and started dating her after a little bit, months passed and we broke up, being my first actual relationship it hit hard it only made my mind go into darker places. Shit got worse with family and became very dysfunctional hated being home and I just wanted to be gone and leave everything and everyone behind.

Junior year I met my latest ex who was the light in life, the only reason I woke up and kept going, I dated her for my entire junior year but we broke up going into senior year this is around the same time I lost both. My jobs due to Covid. Ever since I have been working off craigslist to make some money, my ex and I got back together wich didnt last long. these feelings of uselessness and emptiness started and I turned to drugs, I started with pills and tried stopping  after my friend ended up in the hospital, that didnt stop me taking drugs no I started taking psychedelics took them for a few months every few weeks and ended up taking pills again when I couldn't trip I stopped taking hard drugs 3 months ago and only smoke weed now.  But I think about it a lot and wish some of it never happened it hurts so bad knowing I screwed up and did something I cant take back.

There's a kid who died who I think about now, I used to smoke and chill with him at the park before he changed but he wasn't a bad person he made shitty choices and did stupid shit. When he started changing he started getting toxic to be around and a jack ass to everyone, by second semester in our sophomore year I cut all ties with him I stopped talking to him and gave up being his friend. It wasn't until recently I found out he was runn over running from the police, I feel guilty because I knew he would end up in jail or something like that I could've attempted to help him turn his life around and not run around doing stupid shit. This changed me now I try my hardest to help those who ask or need it, this keeps my mind off thinking about it all, when I'm home im always alone no one around me can understand my problems. I don't feel like I have a purpose or a need to be here. Everyday I am reminded of my mistakes and reminded nothing I do will make it go away or make it ok"
81,My Downward Spiral,"I've been on a downward spiral, it's hard to talk about so I might as well post this to the internet so random strangers can read. So much has happened in the past few months that it's hard to remember everything, well let's start from the beginning

This all started when my best friend abandoned me, this person had actually completely stopped what I thought would be my downward spiral two years ago, they abandoned me due to something that happened while we were dating. (no, I didn't rape, I didn't physically abuse, I was somewhat manipulative) At first, this didn't even phase me, in face I felt something which at the time I thought was relief. The next day was when the guilt hit once again. I had already beaten myself up for this before, around the time it happened. But only now did I realize what I did was horrible, not bad, horrible. 

A month or two pass, and I'm somewhat happy once again, I have been spending a lot of time with my friends, who I brought together from different groups. We all got along nicely, now at this time I was dating one of my friends who we will call C. C and I got along so well, but since it's me we're talking about, there obviously had to be an issue. C was 13 and I was 16 at the time (I say at the time because my birthday was recently) every single day I felt disgusting even talking to C, but there was some fragment of hope in me that this was making him happy, so I had to keep up with it. Enter friend 2, who we'll call V. V is mentally unstable, in fact the reason I kept in touch with this guy was because he was outted from my other friend group and I wanted to stay in contact with him. 

V, because life can NOT be easy at all, gets a crush on me, and this is a huge crush. We flirted often, mostly because I was on the verge of attempting suicide if I stayed with C any longer. The best part about V (and come to think of it, the only good part) was that V was the same age as me, if I decided to leave C and accepts V's feelings (he had confessed to me at this point) I thought I could finally be happy. This is what I do, and in the next few weeks I finally return to my passive state. 

This comes with a consequence, because life is not a video game where the story will move on without any thought put into what happens to the characters. C becomes severely depressed, and I even feel guilty for it, I try to talk to him, but every conversation ends up being him begging me to get back with him. I couldn't stand it anymore. Now we go to V, who seems to be happy, but I don't think I have described V's personality yet.

V is the definition of what happens when someone with a mental health issue is neglected, abused and angry. He tends to act tough for no apparent reason, he constantly tries to prove himself to me, and constantly tries to make everyone believe the same way he does. In the group he was outted from, he called someone who only answered his questions a ""rapist"" ""pedophile"" and other vulgar things. The person identified as Non-Binary, which everyone accepted, except him. He tried to say that they only do it for attention, which clearly was false as they only brought it up once or twice ever. 

So what do you get when you cross me, a person who only seeks to improve themself, sees themself as nothing and everyone else as God's gifts to the world, someone who only wishes to feel something other than emptiness and regret with someone like V? Well, a pretty stable relationship.. high maintenance due to V's persona, but not high enough to where it becomes frustrating. 

Someone from V's old group contacted me, I told them about our relationship and they asked me one simple question

""Will he understand if you say that constantly dealing with his behavior is exhausting, or will he blow up on you? Please answer honestly.""

I did not answer honestly, I lied

""He doesn't blow up on me, he never has "" 

Two weeks pass, and that question is still repeating in my head, over and over and over again. I think about it for a long time, and I finally come to a conclusion. No, no he would not. I confirmed this by previous conversations with him where I told him that he should find things to calm him down, only to be met with anger, telling me I'm in no position to tell him to do anything. 

The time has come to break another heart. 

He takes it well, surprisingly well actually, in fact, he's taking it the same way I took being left by my best friend mentioned at the top of this depressing auto biography. I didn't realize it at the time, but this seemed like clear real life foreshadowing. He makes remarks about me leaving him, but they're nothing to aggressive. And for a while we all seem to calm down and be friends again. 

I didn't mention this person before, but it's time to introduce a new character, named P (wow these one letter names are getting annoying huh? Well sit back, we're not done yet.) P is the definition of an egotist, everything he does is solely to prove that he is the greatest. And what would you know, P also has a crush on me. But, I don't take this very far, we have one sexually charged conversation before I realize I am slipping into the same crack as I did with V, I get very very distant with him right after. 

But P doesn't like that, P thinks he deserves me due to how great he is. So he begins to demand me for sexual favors, or at least talk dirty to him again. Both of which I refuse, I just want to be alone now, I just want to take the time I need to cool down. But, sadly that's not how the world works. P begins to berate me, belittle me and harass me in many many ways.

With that, I finally broke. 

What I used to be was no more, the good hearted person who understood everyone he came across, the person who wanted to make other happy even if it costed himself harm. He had just died, he had been murdered. 

First order of business was to make P fuck off for good. I took a few screenshots of his text messages to me and sent them to his ex girlfriend (they were planning on getting back together) her response?

""Thank you for telling me, I can’t believe I was contemplating getting back with that jerk""

and that was P done with.. no, let's make him suffer more. Let's get some other friends of mine to threaten his life, let's get thing to threaten so much, even type publicly some personal information about him. He contacted me, begging me to make it stop, I only smiled and told him ""I enjoyed poking and prodding with you, toying with you."" and he fell silent, never to hear from me or anyone else I sent after him again

Next, I think C deserved a little poke for making me suffer (I know, it was me who made me suffer, I'm trying to type in the mindset I had at the time) so I hit him in all his weakpoints. Oh? He has a anime girl body pillow? How pathetic, let's tell him how pathetic he is. 

C, now emotionally destroyed and confused, I wanted V to suffer next, but not to roughly, this man can actually defend himself after all. So let's gently nudge him every single day, reminding him that we totally care about aaaaall of his insecurities, we love how fucked up he is and how we care for him. Hell, let's even give him hope that I'll get back to him, in fact, let's go back to C and do the same thing. 

This goes on for awhile, both feeling terrible, thinking it's their fault that I'm being this way. But then, a sparkle of hope shines on me, this person, named K, they understand me, they understand that I have been pushed around so much that I just snapped. They know I'm still a good person deep down, they want to help me. 

It was my turn to get a crush.

My crush on K quickly became an obsession, I constantly talked to them, taking every chance I could get to spend time with them. They also identified as Non-Binary, and claimed to be assigned male at birth, but we all knew it was a lie. Though it didn't matter, after all your gender only determines minor things about you right? 

My obsession became clear, not to K, they were blissfully unaware that there was a disgusting person thinking about them for the better half of the day, every, single, day. C was the first to point it out, calling me a ""simp"" which, I didn't mind because it was probably true. When V found out, he told me that he needed time away from me, that we shouldn't speak for a few months (he later added ""or ever again."") V was out of the picture, my mind thought 'good riddance, what an ass' and continued to pursue K (who was very openly asexual) 

C decided to leave the situation alone, though he was very angry about it. And it was down to K and I, this is all I wanted, and it took so long and so much pain to get to this point, but there I was. It was time for my confession, it was time to let it all out.

I got rejected.

I didn't mind, I knew this would be the outcome, my obsession slowly reverts to a friendship, some might even say 'best' friendship. I was happy for once, finally out of my shell, I didn't even mind what I did, that was in the past. And now it was time for me to focus on the future, the future with K by my side, a duo of friends who would take on the world and everyone in it.

They left a week later. 

...

All that was on my mind was silence, I don't think a single thought passed through for nearly an hour. I looked at myself in the mirror, thinking of everything I had sacrificed, all the pain I endured and all the pain I caused, just for that.

I was neutral once again, there was nothing anymore, nothing to poke at me, nothing to love me or to hate me. Just silence, this is what I wanted after all, from the beginning I just wanted to be alone. A month passes, it takes a month for me to recall everything horrible I have done, and I want to apologize, though I don't seek forgiveness, I just want them to know I regret what I did. First up to bat, C

""So, for the last time, goodbye"" - C

now let's try V, for a few days we talk, he tells me a few interesting things.

""K does not want anything to do with you, don't even bother.""

Interesting, though he began to speak ill of my friends. So I had to tell him to back off a little.

""Go groom some more kids."" - V

Well, that's that then, all three don't want to talk to me. I can't blame them, I'm just a disgusting piece of filth. But, I have returned to my state at the beginning, I am now back to being a kind person, I understand people and help them. But, I can't go back fully. I still feel the urge to hurt them, even though I know I have no way of doing so. 

That's my story, I know I'm not a hero in it, not even in the gray area. I thought it would be interesting for people to hear what a person like me is like from their own perspective. 

I also, beg for support. I don't want to hurt people, but I see myself do it, it feels like I have no control of it. I have tried therapy several times. Please do not suggest it, every single time I felt nothing, all it is is a person taking my money and telling me I'll be fine. I want actual help, actual suggestions and support. Maybe some of us could become friends? I find that hard to believe.. but I always hold onto hope. 

And to C, V, K or P if you're reading this, I'm sorry, at least you know how it was from my end now, maybe it helped you click things together? Maybe not, I'm not asking for your sympathy, only for your understanding. 

The same goes to anyone reading this, I don't wish for sympathy, I only wish for help and understanding."

84,Feeling really sad and hopeless lately.,"These past few months, I’ve been feeling really down. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I lost my high-paying job so that has been hard. I also live alone and the pandemic has really isolated me from all of my friends and family. I don’t know what to do. It’s gotten to the point where I struggle to get out of bed in the morning and do things like take showers and brush my teeth. The crazy thing is I don’t really have anything to be sad about... my parents are very supportive of me and I have friends that love me I just haven’t seen them recently. I haven’t told them how I feel because I don’t want them to worry about me. Sometimes I reflect on my memories before Covid happened and start to cry because I miss being around my friends and family all the time. I miss going to concerts and bars and get together‘s and traveling. I just feel so hopeless at this point. Like this is no way to live life. I’m also quite bored as I can’t seem to get a fulfilling career related job as of right now. (I would like to note that I’ve gotten a temporary retail job since this happened). Is anyone else feeling really down lately / isolated?"
85,Need help pinpointing what this feeling is,"So I don’t really know if this is the place for this but here goes.

I get this feeling every 25-60 mins, and I don’t know exactly what it is, but the best way to describe it is like what you feel when someone’s walking up to, like you just feel their presence coming closer. Like my hearing changes and sounds like if you put a cup around your ears and my head and brain kinda feel like they’re getting fuzzy/fluffy and sometimes my back starts to tingle.

This has been happening for a couple years and I’m thankful enough to have never dealt with any trauma that could’ve caused it, if anyone shares this feeling or knows why this happens please elaborate. Thanks :)"
86,Am I too immature for my age?,"Context: I’m an 18 y/o girl, not diagnosed with anything

I get told to grow up so much by my parents. I watch and obsess over cartoons like Steven Universe and Adventure Time, I have a ton of stuffed animals, I move around and fidget a lot when I’m supposed to be sitting still, only eat a select few things, do the same things over and over, get bored easily, and don’t do well with socialising. I wish I could count the times I’ve been yelled at to act my damn age, grow up, be an adult, etc.

Thing is though I’m not naïve or stupid, I have the same knowledge any adult has. It’s just my demeanour that makes me seem immature. Is there something wrong or creepy about the way I act?"

88,OCD - intrusive thoughts,"I have had OCD since I was 5 years old and I've always had intrusive thoughts, but now randomly as a 21 year old, I've randomly gotten completely debilitating intrusive thoughts that are starting to even pop up when I'm talking with friends and family, they are so bad that my body physically cringes and shakes its head when ever they start to appear and they are happening literally like 50 times a day. Why is this happening and what do I do? How can I stop these, they are really scary and make me extremely sad. If anyone has any tips on how to stop or cope with these thoughts please send them my way."
89,Is it bad to constantly be in a creative mindset?,"I've noticed that I'm literally constantly noticing shapes, and patterns' potential for an artistic foundation.

 For example, making faces out of the patterns in chipboard. Absolutely adoring making noise and using it as a tool for ""mental music"" (basically filling in the missing music in my mind). Drawing a scribble and making an entire drawing out of it. 

Is this a bad thing? I have very severe ADHD and I sometimes think I may land on the spectrum."

93,Delete Instagram?,"People that have fully deleted apps like Instagram and Facebook, did you feel better afterwards?"
94,I don't think I'm ok,"For the past few years I haven't done much. I've tried my best to make friends and be somebody. Make something of myself. But I can't remember anything good of the past few years. Everyday, day in, day out. Nothing new happens. The same faces all saying the same things. Criticizing me for not doing something new. I feel like I've been dead for a long time. 

I don't really have any friends. Not any that I feel like I can talk to, or friends that I can actually go see, regardless of the pandemic. I have friends online, and I do thoroughly enjoy their company, but as soon as I get off my computer, I'm reminded of how alone I am. I used to have friends when I was growing up, but after my mom died, we moved away and I haven't really had many friends since then. I promise it's not for a lack of trying. And I'm tired of my family constantly making it a joke of it. They constantly make jokes about me and how I'm going to ""build a robot wife"" since I don't go outside much. It's not for a lack of wanting to, its that I don't have a reason to. There's nothing for me out there. I don't have friends, The prospect of getting a girlfriend seems completely out of the question, and I hate being around my family who constantly laugh about my problems because they don't have the same issues I do.

The main problem I have with this is that in the past few years I decided to do something with all the nothing I have and I started streaming on Twitch. I'm actually very happy to say that it's been going very well. As of a few days ago, I hit 4,250 followers and I recently received a paycheck from Twitch for about $537. I'm not famous yet, but I'm aware that's not something many people can say they've done. I'm not trying to brag about it, but it's important because I feel like the success I've found has done nothing but make things worse for me. I don't have any friends offline, but as soon as I start my streams I'll have 15-20 people join and tell me how great I am, and how they love to watch my content, and they love the energy I bring to my streams. But then the stream ends and I'm left alone in my silent 1 bedroom apartment with no one to talk to. Obviously, a lot of people have said that they want to do stuff with me off stream because they want to be my friend, but I've given that more chances than I should and I feel like every time I play game with somebody they're just trying to make me laugh because they want me to like them and they want to be on my stream with me. I feel like a lot of people don't see me as a person, but as some faceless internet entity they can leech internet fame off of. Obviously this isn't true for all of my viewers and I've made some good friends, but I feel like its put me into a very stressful position.

I feel like when I'm offline, I'm just another friendless nobody. But when I go online, I feel like a lot of the people who say that they like me, don't actually like me; they like the idea of me. I'm tired of acting like I'm happy so I don't upset the people around me. I'm tired of having to keep up this upbeat atmosphere because I'm not happy. I honestly don't remember the last time I was truly happy. There have been moments sure, but nothing that lasts longer than a few passing moments. 

When I was 16, I attempted suicide. I waited until I knew my family would be gone for a few days and I tried to overdose on painkillers. I don't know what happened, but I couldn't keep them down. I felt a truly primal fear I've never felt before nor since that compelled me to throw up what hadn't been processed already. By that time, my hands and feet had already gone numb and I was terrified I had made a horrible and irreversible mistake. I fell asleep on the bathroom floor and woke up 16 hours later. My dad never brought up the missing painkillers, so I never told him about what happened.

A few months ago, my grandfather passed away. He was the father of my mother who had passed away about 11 years ago. When I learned the news, I was upset. Not because my grandfather, who had been there for my sister and I while I was growing up, had died, but because I didn't feel anything. I felt nothing at the news of his death. That was the exact moment I knew something was wrong with me. He had been there for me when my mom couldn't. He taught me how to shoot my first gun, how to fish, how to swing a bat. And I didn't feel anything. I loved him, and I didn't feel anything about his death but guilt that I felt nothing.

I feel completely alone in my life. I don't feel that I have any real friends or family. I feel like most of the people who say they want to be my friend only want to use me for their own gain, and my family doesn't care about who I am, only that I'm blood-related to them. I feel emotionally dead from my lack of excitement towards the great things that have happened to me on my channel and the lack of anything that I felt when my grandfather died.

I feel like I've been dead for years and that my life is happening without me.

I want to get help but I don't have insurance and I don't have much money. I live in West Texas and I don't think I'm ok."

98,Random sentences keep popping up in my head and they don’t make any sense.,"I’ve been having problems for years where when I’m doing something and I go to auto pilot (where I stop thinking and just end up doing what I’m doing automatically, idk what else to call it) I will just randomly start thinking sentences that don’t make sense. Usually I will eventually tune back in and catch a few words and be like “what the heck was that sentence.” For example, one time I was doing dishes and I zoned out and when I came back I caught myself thinking “butter is a strange linen to me.” I know that doesn’t make sense because butter is obviously far from being a linen but I don’t know what is causing that to happen. It happens a lot, earlier today I though “pineapple on a chair and a rug in the basement.” Does anyone have any input on this, I’m diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder but I don’t know if either of them is what causes this."
99,Loud thoughts??,"
I often experience having very loud thoughts. It’s kind of hard to explain this issue, but it feels like there are several different thoughts having loud conversations in my head. They aren’t voices, at least I don’t think they are. However, the loud thoughts doesn’t feel like they are coming from me. More as if they are inserted in my head. Because the thoughts are often questions, and sometimes I respond to them out loud, because the thoughts are so extremely loud. I don’t know why I experience this, I didn’t have this issue 4-5 years ago.. is this normal when struggling with anxiety and depression? Or should I talk about it with my psychologist?"
100,How do you open up (tw suicide),"So I’ve been seeing a therapist every two weeks for the past year, but i still can’t properly open up to her. She’s great and makes me feel safe but every time there’s something going on I can’t tell her. I’m scared and feel ashamed to tell her. 
I started seeing her almost exactly a year ago because i was feeling very suicidal, but i never actually told her, i said i was “maybe a little depressed” and when she asked me if I was thinking about suicide i said no. I lied because i’m afraid she wouldn’t understand and invalidate me, even though she’s never actually done that. 

And I keep lying, i keep saying I’m fine, there’s nothing going on, and I don’t know how to change this. I gradually started to feel better, and around summer, I thought i was ok, i felt hopeful, but it all started going down again in october, and December has been the worst period of my life. 

I am tired, and I don’t want to keep living. I feel like I’m wasting everybody’s time and space. 
I want to tell my therapist but what if she doesn’t believe me, I don’t have a reason to feel this way, and i don’t look like I’m depressed, i’m studying and doing stuff. What if I’m faking it all, which just makes me want to die more, because if I’m the kind of person that fakes it then I don’t deserve to be here.

I'm awfully tired of myself, let alone answering and explaining how I am doing - because I'm exhausted of it all and it physically hurts to explain.

104,Dealing with my father and his anger issues,"Hi everyone,

First off I'd like to say that this post isn't really about me as much it is about the declining state of my father. I came here hoping to find some advice to help him.

A little background you should know is that he is a great father, as long as things go his way that is. He never failed to provide food, shelter or money when our family needed it and I do love him, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to put up with his crap day in day out.

We already had 2 fights before which were usually followed by months of silence between us.

This last one happened about an hour ago and wasnt nearly as bad as the others were. I'm working the afternoon shift this week which means I'm home throughout the morning. I usually spend that time on the computer creating music. I have a small heater next to me since the house does get cold over the night and doesn't get heated untill the afternoon. He comes home and wants to let some fresh air into the house and tells me to turn off the heater (mind you I'm already wearing a jacket and boots indoors), I tell him that I'm cold and that the heater wont use more electricity just because the door is open. After some back and forth I once again do as he says. Ten minutes pass and I close the balcony door and turn the heater back on, to which he gets angry and starts yelling at me. In turn I get aggravated and yell back ""So I'm not allowed to warm myself in my home?"". This does not diffuse the situation and he starts shouting that I'm provoking him. He takes the heater, and throws it over the balcony wall into our neighbours garden. I call him sick in the head and leave to my room which surprisingly ends the conflict

Now the point is that this is a prevalent theme in his behaviour. He's irrational, angry, impatient and short-tempered. And when you back him into a corner with nothing more than reason, he gets violent. Everything has to be as he says, and if it's not, it goes from 0 to 100 real quick.

I don't want to be on bad terms with him, like I said, he's a  good father most of the time. But I also don't want to tolerate and encourage this behaviour. I feel conflicted and don't know how to reach out to him as he doesn't respond to reason or rationality. Im 20 years old and I'm frankly sick of being the voice of reason to 60 year old man who acts like a spoiled child.

Please, if you have any advice on this, or have any resources on how to deal with someone who's acting in that manner, don't hesitate to leave a reply. 

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you for your time."
105,I never posted here but I don't really know what to do,"I feel so very lonely. Uni is making me feel sick, anxiety is getting even worse because of the pandemic. I've been seeing a therapist for the past year but I still can't fully open up to her. I'm wasting money. I told my dearest friends what I'm going through and I asked them please to be patient with me and they said yes but suddenly disappeared. I only have my boyfriend with me and he is the sweetest, kindest person I know, but I don't want to make him feel the things I'm feeling so I try not to open up too much with him about this (he is seeing a therapist, too, even if for different reasons). The worst part is that from tomorrow because of lockdown and various restrictions I won't be able to see him again for a while and he is literally the only person I feel comfortable around, because in six and a half years we went through everything together and he never left my side.
And I don't think I can handle all of this, the loneliness, the anxiety that leaves fucking rent free like a brick in my stomach and the pressure of university and my parents that expect so much from me.

109,I am so thankful for my husband,"My husband has been nothing but supportive of me. I truly couldnt ask for anyone better in my life. He is my rock, my baseline, my love, my best friend, my everything. Through all my ups and downs he has been by my side, never hesitating to offer what I need. 

When I felt like my world was ending he drive me to the CSU. He helped me check in and decide to defer to the staff to determine the next move. I think both of us knew what was going to happen but we weren't ready. I know hes going to suffer a lot of guilt over my hospitalization but I wish there was a way to make him understand that this was out of both of our hands. We knew they'd Baker Act me if I didnt go willingly. 

I needed the time there. And when I needed him while in there, he'd always be right there on the other end of the phone. I dont know how we're paying for this, but somehow he's figured it out and is taking care of it. 

I could have never gotten this far without him. He is the best thing to ever happen to me. Without him, I would not be alive today, and I could never thank him enough."
110,I am a poor man.,"I don’t have much money, how can I get my mind in a better place? My mind is tormenting me because I feel I will eventually run out of money. There is a huge recession, jobs are being lost, terrible financial crisis, etc. How did people who lived in the Great Depression and WWII cope? I know a lot of them committed suicide, but how can the mind continue in incredible stress and difficulties? Does it get better?"
111,I finally am going to get help from a professional.,"I ended up telling people about my issues with the hallucinations and paranoia, and It went well. I had talked to my mother and apparently this runs in the family so it's not anything I did wrong, just genetics and stuff that makes my brain like this. 

My mother told me about stuff she experienced and it all basically summed up sort of what I've been going through, it felt weird seeing someone so successful say that they were in a mental hospital, I don't know how to describe the feeling though.

I guess I'm happy that I'll finally get to talk to people, but I also just kinda feel weird about this. It's like I've been hiding all this my entire life and now people just know and are somehow still able to have normal conversations with me? I don't really know what I expected but I didn't really expect this. 

Anyway so yeah the 25th of this month I'm going to start seeing a behavioral counselor about it."

114,The doctor came into the ward yesterday,"I was in the community meeting and a guy walked in and kept staring at me from across the room, when I looked at him, he kept lifting his eyebrows. The nurse said he was a twilight shift and he’s been here before, but I’ve never see him here. He said he knew me, but I don’t recall seeing him before. They know why I sleep in the corridor instead of my room and now they know that I know, and now they’re getting closer. I had a small dose of the drug last night, they told my mom if I didn’t take it, I’d get an injection of it instead. I said I felt sick and went to the bathroom, then tried to shut the door. My 1:1 wasn’t very happy about this and kept opening it, I tried pushing her out of the way, but then she pulled the alarm and staff came over to restrain me. I eventually fell asleep and trees are waving gooodbge to me but I can’t smell them properly because the blinds were shut, but now the curtains are open and they’re not moving anymore, I feel very tired.

116,Friend keep draining me out,"I have a friend who is obviously going through something but refusing to seek professional help. For the past few weeks, all she has been doing is sitting with people looking very drowsy and said nothing, just eyes shut and basically hovering. After awhile, it feels very mentally draining to be around her. Plus, I am going through a situation myself; bad dreams, hot flashes and strong pulsating heartbeats every time I sleep causing me to feel tired all the time despite how many hours I sleep. 

She did come and explain herself to me; saying she couldn't be around people but isolating herself is very mentally harmful to herself. I try to be empathetic but I can't help but think she is not seeking the proper help she needs. Right now, everyone she went to feel very drained by her presence because of the energy she radiates (she sit for hours in silence and just stare at people) — we are final year students in the mid of final examination period, living in lockdown in our own compartment bedroom *not a very big space so when I say she drained us, it is very real and is affecting our mood entirely. 

I have advised her to seek for professional help but it is quite hard considering that we are in the mid of a lockdown but it is not impossible for her to admit into psychiatric ward. She gave many excuses and keep thinking being in the company of people is a coping mechanism but her conditions are harmful to other people as well (because she is mentally draining to entertain) On top of that, she also expects me to ensure she eats 3x everyday. I can sense that my mental health is also declining. 

Please tell me what to do. I'm losing my mind, I can't sleep well in my room and always paranoid that she would randomly come and invade my privacy with her negative energy. Am I a bad person for not being able to help her, for not wanting to be around her? I feel like she needs help but not from us her friends, because her conditions are bad and she is not communicating and bc we are not the help she needs, helping her will cause more harm to us than to her. Please help me. What should I say to her?"
117,I hate society,"Honestly I hate our society I know there's good stuff there's good people out there but there's so many things wrong with it that just confuses me with how long they stayed and how even to this day people still believe its right earlier I was scrolling through a media platform as I was procrastinating, I then gone to a familiar part of the Internet.

The part where people may it be adults teenagers and such talk about their shitty childhoods etc. I saw various posts of teenagers or adults talk about how parents should teach children and tell moments when other people commended other parents that punishing their children is good that their a ""great parent"" I hate how society views slapping or hurting your child is right or comparing your children is right and various other toxic things are right. I simply fucking hate it, I hate how hell bent our society is to make every one ""normal"", how they're immediately scared or hate someone who's different I hate it I wanna change it I wanna make it so other people realize that it's wrong that stereotypes are fucked up gender norms are fucked up

Every thing most of everything about our society is fucked up and they should realize it I wanna live in a society where I don't hear or see my friends and other children/adults suffer for something they couldn't control for something it wasn't their  fault I wanna die knowing I made a difference in our society that millions of children in the future don't live with the fear of being unaccepted or have trauma or just feel shit everyday for something they couldnt control/ something they didn't want

But then I fucking remember I'm just a teenager whos a fucked up human being who says they wanna help people but they don't do shit about it and are stuck living with  people that make them feel like shit everyday a teenager who's insecurities make life so much harder and many more reasons. I hate society"
118,Is this ROCD (Relationship OCD)? Please help.,"I've been talking to this guy recently who is really awesome. He's the first guy that I could really see myself being with long term. However, I've been struggling. I've never been diagnosed with OCD but I believe I have it. When I was young, I had thoughts about suicide and harming others that scared me to death. I would avoid being alone just to avoid the thoughts. Over the years, I have obsessed over many things. Recently, relationships have been extremely difficult. When I started talking to this new guy, I had two panic attacks. He didn't say or do anything wrong. My brain kept panicking. I had thoughts like ""Do you really like him?"" ""You're going to hurt him"" ""You should stop talking to him"" ""You don't find him attractive"". I finally got over those thoughts. And now I think my brain has latched on to another thought. He sent me a picture a few days ago of him and his brother. I was looking at his outfit. Then I noticed his brother next to him. And when I saw his pants my brain went into panic mode. ""Why did you look there?"". I started getting weird thoughts. I've been trying to remember if I looked there on purpose or not. I don't think I did but I don't know. Now I keep thinking his brother is more attractive. And I'm so scared it's true. I feel kind of sick to my stomach and I feel like a horrible person. I have to meet this guy in two days and now I don't want to go. I've been having this problem quite often recently. Like if I see a guy, I look there. And then feel immediate guilt. Please help. Does this sound like ocd? Should I still meet him? I feel so guilty and I can't remember if I did it on purpose. I deleted the picture so I don't have to look at it anymore. Idk what to do. I even get nervous when his brother is brought up in conversation. And I'm scared to meet him in case I actually do think he is more attractive."

120,Things going downhill really bad..,"I've been thinking about making such a post for a very long time, this is kind of hard for me, to get my thoughts right, im sorry for any bad grammar and typos.
Let's start with this i used to be suicidal alot, i think i had no motivation to live back then and i had too much problems to fix too many hard choices, truely it was a hard time back then.
For now i ditched this idea for good,
I feel like im suffering from severe anxiety, and im in despair, theres a saying in my country that goes like after a thunderstorm beautiful flowers bloom, but its been rainy way too much, im feeling so dull and nothing good is happening, just jumping from a disaster to a disaster, i feel like venting my thoughts here is some what therapeutic, therapists are really bad in my country not a considerable option, family and friends cant help i dont want them to look at me like that, everyone has enough of their problems and their pain,
No matter how much people try to motivate me, i'll probably get motivated for a short while then go back to being the old me,
I can't but act happy around people because otherwise im afraid they think im doing this for attention or such, 
When i was young i always had good self confidence, somewhere around in my life this confidence shattered and turned into ashes, 
Whenever i feel self confidence i tend to remind myself how insignificant i am, i think people are just my friends out of pity, im not an interesting person and no matter how much i tried to change its still the same, online or in real life, people always ignore my existence.
always wanted big closeness to other but not everyone feels mutual and it happens to everyone, 
I want to be strong, i can't anxiety is suffocating me
I want to be reliable, i can't
I want this i want that, but i dont get this or get that, im just thinking too selfishly,
Everything is feeling so dull, i wish i could go to sleep for like a week wake up and feel better... but i either sleep 3-5 hours a day because of me overthinking about problems in my life or 12-14 because i find sleep as a way to escape reality and its really nice..
i could go on forever but thats enough, this was really boring wasnt it, im sorry, thanks for reading."
121,Moving apartment due to mental health,"In November I moved to a new apartment in within the same building due to a loud neighbor. I moved out after only 7 months living there. My new apartment is a little better, however I'm still not happy here.

I am extremely sensitive to sounds. I get very anxious and terrified if I hear noises. I don't think apartment life is for me. I've been looking to rent a house to myself but there is not much out there in this area. Also I feel like my landlord will not give a good reference because of me switching apartments.

If anyone can help me out that would be great."
122,Am I the only one?,"Hello there, first time posting on here and I'm not really sure how this will go or if anyone will actually understand. 
I've been on antidepressants for about 5 years and have been told by a doctor that I have asperger's (albeit very minor) I'm well aware of my own mental health and for the most part I'm able to understand my triggers and how to control it.
I've got this one question and it's bothered me for years, I'm not sure what it is and because of how vague it is to explain I've never really told anyone because I never know how to express it. But here we go: whenever I think of times in my life when I was a child and I begged for things, like at a shop or how I think back to asking my mum if I could have money to go to the corner store, or maybe a memory of me crying because I didn't want to leave a friend's house. You know.. normal child begging and tantrum stuff.. I get DEEPLY uncomfortable. I just feel super guilty and like I should never have done it. In my head I know that it's totally normal for a child to do those things but for me I just feel.. bad about it? Is this something others have experienced? Am I the only one 😂. Please note I'm very light hearted about this but it does strike me as odd that I feel so deeply guilty about this.

Hope that kinda makes sense."
123,I’m afraid to live bcoz I’m afraid of dying,"Hi everyone. 
My realisation of mortality appeared when I was on my COVID-isolation. I had no serious physical consequences of the infection, only tachycardia and temperature. But mental part of me suffered a lot. I had panic attacks everyday, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I could not be alone, I was afraid to die whatever I did. 

I’ve read a lot about fears in general, about fear of death, I’ve read what others think about it and how to struggle against this. I visited my psychologist. It helped a lot to stop my panic attacks. Now I can eat and sleep.

But the problem is that anxiety is still there. This fear of death is passive now. I can’t do anything without a thought “what if I die right now”. It doesn’t let me feel happiness and build even small plans bcoz I start thinking it is all meaningless. I tried to spend more time with my friends and yeah it’s cool, but sometimes I need to be with myself only. And being alone doing my favourite things doesn’t bring me pleasure anymore, it hurts. 


Avoiding these thoughts makes it only worse. Nobody can avoid death, it’s the fact. But living with 24/7 thinking about it is difficult, even when I accept these thoughts. 

If anybody had the same problems, please, tell me how to live with it and be happy still :("
124,Do you find Psychiatric Nurse practitioners better than Psychiatrists because they are more knowledgeable about medications and have more empathy and time for you ?,"I have found psychiatrists to be useless over 30 years , often no nothing of new meds and therapies . Psychiatrists often are rude and condescending and lack empathy.
    I have found Psychiatric Nurse practitioners to be far more compassionate and will spend plenty of time discussing meds and reasons and to to you not at you."
125,What does this sound like,"I’ve been thinking and I want to know what it is I’m going through if anything at all
1. I hate myself 
2. I have these weird periods where I feel such extreme emotion
3. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere, not with my friends or even my family"
126,absurdity,"Chronic return to the past in my head without living the present or thinking about the future.

It's all here in this post (no drama, no lying, everything is true)

Parental bad behavior, learned helplessness, bad education, worst childhood, above than poverty, 

Psychological abuse, bullying, bad treatment from parents, teachers, friends, family, job, 

violence,violence and more violence early head trauma,, bad job at early age, maltreatment,darkness

Poor nutrition, no hobbies, no entertainment, time wasted, low self-esteem, 

Still life is going on, living normal life like everyone, until the storm start 

Results : at teenage: 

Anxiety,cryings,fear,suicidal thoughts,suicidal trying,poor mental health, poor physical health, 

running away from home; financial troubles, family issue, again parental disrespectful;hopeless,

school missing, alcohol addiction,depression, symptoms like attention deficit disorder, emotional pain

ocd,anger, screaming in my head, tiredness, the same routine everyday. 

A year later: feeling better, but poor cognitive function, all focus is only in emotions. 

A year later(20) a light in the tunnel, better feelings, making friends, life going on

a year later(21) better and better until : 

Again, we can't run from the past, developing rumination and so on. 

All the results become a normal routine, a normal life.

After the quarantine(mach 2020) worst depression ever, learned helplessness, was nearly to death. 

At summer, things become better, after, the circle started again. 

All of this fucking messing and still without diagnosis never went to a doctor"
127,Help just tried to kill myself,I just took weed Ritalin and alcohol I just tried overdose on Pandoal should I call ambulance
128,I almost always feel like I'm unimportant and annoying,"Is there a term for this? Is this part of a personality disorder? 

I'm 33/F

Essentially, in any given situation, I feel like I just need to get out of people's way and stop talking. I firmly believe I am too ugly, stupid, and/or awful to be anything special to anyone. 

For example, sometimes I feel like the one friend I have is my friend only because she feels sorry for me. I also feel like I'm the least qualified person at my job."
129,"I am bad at everything, pls help","Well... the title kinda says it... I am bad when it comes to school, I have pretty much negative talent when it comes to sport or anything creativity based and (to top it all off) I am TERRIBLE at games (which eliminates the option of pro play), which are the only thing in this world that I enjoy (besides spending time with friends). Plus (bcs there is not enough) my dad gets pretty mad when I mess up in school.

What should I do? I don't want to hurt/kill myself, bcs I kniw what won't help. (I mean theoreticallx yes, but you kniw what I mean)"
130,How do I go about being diagnosed with something?,"I’m not exactly sure what I could have, but I’ve been doing research and stuff and a lot of my “symptoms” (not sure it’s the right word) align with mild autism and narcissism/sociopathy. 

I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, they both work under the same company so my psychiatrist has access to my therapist notes, which helped diagnose my depression and ADHD for which I’m being treated now and it has been pretty great. 

I imagine this is something I have to bring up with my therapist but something I struggle with A LOT is expressing myself and being honest. I’m a compulsive liar so a lot of times my therapy sessions just revolve on “everything is fine just the same old”. I love my therapist and she’s very sweet, I just don’t know how to say what I’m feeling a lot of times. 

How do I (properly) ask my therapist to find what else is wrong with me?"
131,Does anyone have self-help resources for ADHD and depression?,"Hello. Apologies for bad english, as I am not a native speaker.  
Explaining Situation (cw self-harm, suicidal thoughts) : I am very slowly coming to accept therapy and medication will never help me due how utterly pathetic the infrastructure of mental help in my country is. I changed like six or so therapists after I have been diagnosed with mental ilness and three psychiatrists. All of them are extremely stubborn to admit I may have issues beyond a simple, first diagnosis of social anxiety. Their advice on overall is absolutely not helpful and all of them ignored my sexuality and belittled it.  Keep in mind, my symptoms are way out of the ballpark of simple ""social anxiety"". I am extremely paranoid, scared of everything, always down on myself, I picked up an habit of alcoholism as a way of self-harm which later turned into physical selfharm and I attempted suicide once. This is not even taking into account the mass of symptoms I have which indicate ADHD and autism (yes I am aware self diagnosis is not gucchi. However, adult diagnosis is all but impossible where I live and it is expensive to even try. And even if I do not have the ailment I do need to do something about the symptoms). While social anxiety is a part of my issues it is absolutely not everything. So basically... I give up on my professional help. However that is all the internet advice ever. By now, even trying to tell me to just get help will get me to get extremely angry and terrified and sad. To me it just implies I should just give up since I can not get that help. As such, I am asking if anyone has some resources - any resources - for dealing with depression and autism or adhd on your own. 

tldr: mental health professional in my country dont care, and are, more often than not harmful. as such i am seeking guidance on how to get help. please refrain from just telling me ""exercise and eat well!!"""
132,Idk what I'm doing with my life,"My birthday was not so long ago and I still haven't dealt with the thought that I'm 17 now. It feels unreal. In no time in gonna be an adult, I'll have to move, get my university degree, and find a job. I have no ambition, no motivation to move forward. I feel like I'm gonna end up in a shitty job hating every second of my life and just hoping to go home just to do it all again the next day. I feel like I'm gonna end up killing myself at 25 or something. Why are we all here anyway.

I used to be able to do my homework and deal with school but I've been just procrastinating this past two months or so. I have tons of missing assignments and homework and I can't even take care of myself I haven't been eating well and I just spend my time on my phone not doing anything productive. And I feel like an ungrateful piece of shit. I live in a good country, I don't have any impediment and have a good family and I feel like I shouldn't have all I have, I don't deserve it."
133,Having a lot of anxiety/stress about going back into my office. Can I get a Dr’s note to work from home permanently?,"Like many people I (29F) have been working from home since about April 2020 and it has been pure bliss. I know not everyone feels this way but honestly I love it and really fear going back into the office. I don’t know if I can. 

Before the craziness of 2020, I worked in a crowded basement with my 10 coworkers and the other half of the room is a Call Center. The noise level was constant and annoying. I’d keep headphones on almost all day just so I could focus. I’d often come home with a migraine. I also work with several people who don’t know the meaning of personal space and it was a daily struggle to put boundaries in place. Now I wake up peacefully, make myself a lovely cup of coffee and just enjoy the calm. I don’t dread my days like I did. I have way less anxiety and stress than I did. I honestly didn’t realize how miserable I was before all this, and I feel I am a better person because of this change. I am a calmer and happier partner to my SO. I am healthier because I can cook at home and have the energy to do so, I can stretch and do mini workouts during the day. 

We have all been coming in 1 day a week on rotating schedules to man the phones and this has been fine. It’s been kinda nice to have a reason to wear adult clothes for a day lol. But lately my manager has been talking about bringing us back more frequently and possibly back in office full time. I get a pit in my stomach every time I think about this. My mental health has been so great while working from home, way less migraines, I feel more at peace and I honestly get more accomplished quicker without people distracting me. So I was wondering if push comes to shove could I get a note from a Dr (or maybe a therapist) stating that I work best from home and should continue to do so.

I know some of you might suggest just talking to my manager, and to be honest I don’t want to risk it going badly. He’s a bit of a stickler for rules and doesn’t see things the way I do. If I get a note from a Doctor I feel this is the only way to ensure I can keep working at home. Has anyone been through something similar or have suggestions for approaching this? I really am just filled with dread at the thought of going back to how it was."
134,Do I have ADHD? What is my problem,"I never before seemed to have a problem following directions or paying attention or sitting still. Over the past couple years I’ve developed anxiety I’m not sure if it has something to do with that, but I can’t sit still, and my attention span is on and off. Directions are so confusing to me, like majority of the time I have no clue what they mean, then I end up not doing the work because I feel stupid, I wasn’t like this before."
135,Anxiety advice,"So for the last couple months my nerves have been on edge and I begin to just randomly feel pain in my chest, left arm, neck and head. But after checking my blood pressure and getting a EKG everything comes back normal aka a healthy 22 year old. So my question to yall is how do you deal with it? I don't really want medications because it's not crippling but it does affect my daily life. I do have a lot going on in my life and work in a rather stressful environment."

138,Transfer,"yesterday my therapist told me that since some of my problems were to do with college issues, I could be transferred to a more specialised therapist that knows more about dealing with education related stuff. 

problem is, I've been with this therapist for around 8 sessions and only got properly comfortable around 1 or 2 sessions ago, I really don't think I'll be able to adjust to a new therapist. but I feel like it'd seem quite stupid for me to reject the offer, it feels like I just cant bring myself to say it, and I don't know what'd happen if I do reject the offer."
139,"diagnosed bipolar 2, new medications","good morning friends! 25F. i was first diagnosed with bipolar 2 a little over three years ago, after being diagnosed with both depression and anxiety. i wasn't exactly sure the diagnosis of bipolar was fitting as my hypomanic phases aren't clear, but due to my anger issues/irritability, severe mood swings, insomnia and adhd symptoms, my new psychiatrist confirmed a diagnosis yesterday of bipolar 2 disorder. i was already on medication before (20 mg lexapro daily, 5 mg buspar daily, and 50 mg hydroxyzine prn). i am still having symptoms, including depression, anxiety, mood swings, and occasional thoughts of self harm. my new psychiatrist thought it would be a good idea to tweak my medication cocktail. currently, as of today, i am taking 15mg buspar twice daily, 150 mg xr bupropion (wellbutrin) once daily, 20 mg lexapro (which i hope to get off sometime soon) once daily, and then 25 mg seroquel once daily at night. does anyone out there have any advice for me, or been on these medications together? it seems like a lot, and i would like to get off some but i would do anything to feel better right now."

141,A Dialogue with Doubt,"This is a post about mental habits. It takes you through a moment in the lives of two people, who have developed different mental habits, as they respond to the exact same internal event - the arising of a momentary feeling of self-doubt. 



**Characters**

Person A: A person with slightly better mental habits

Person B: A person with slightly worse mental habits. 

Here we go. 


**The Event**

A feeling of doubt begins to arise within each person's mind...
At this point, it's vague. More like the beginning of a thought,
than a completed thing. It points at the self and says something like..
""Are you ...sure?""


**Person A:**

Person A sees the doubt, and asks himself for a moment: Is this worth
noticing? If I notice it, is it worth thinking more about? 

Person A's belief system kicks in.
(our belief systems determine how we evaluate the data we receive from the world).
Person A's belief system contains a belief like: ""I don't need to doubt myself."" 

(Although people who have beliefs like that rarely ever go on to Depression or Mental Health forums!!)

(In the case of yours truly, the author and humble narrator,
the belief system may say something like ""Self-doubt has never really been a productive
use of my mental efforts, and it has never taken me any place that I really
wanted to go. I have decades of experience with it and I know this
now for a fact."" )

Person A basically ignores the self-doubt internal prompt. 
Because our inner and outer worlds are offering a basically constant barrage
of cues, stimuli, feelings and so forth - soon the self-doubt
disapears, replaced by something else. ""Oh look, a bird!"" 
""Oh look, a project I am working on!""
or ""Oh look, that reminds me of a trip I went on two years ago!""
And Person A advances productively to the next point in their mental/emotional 
slipstream. 



**Person B:**

Person B sees the doubt, and says: ""Oh, Doubt!! Come in! I was expecting you!""

Because they are used to seeing Doubt, they never say No. They can't refuse him or overlook
him! 

""I remember, I just doubted myself this morning. And last night as well. So it makes
sense that here you are again.""

Doubt says: ""I just wanted to aim this question directly at your chest..""

Person B: ""OK, I'm ready.""

Doubt: *(leans over coffee table, looks intensely into Person B's eyes)* ""Are you...sure?""

Person B replies ""That's a good question! I'm going to have to think about that.""

""Am I...sure? What does this mean?"" 

Person B remember's a bunch of times when they were unsure of themselves. 
These memories and thoughts are sticky and they stick to other memories 
and thoughts with a similar emotional feeling of uncertainty/
anxiety/self-doubt/dread. 

Then Person B remembers a time when they did something ""stupid"" (in their opinion),
they replay the movie and say: ""Wow, I found one reason to doubt myself!""

Person B then remembers another time when something unfortunate happened and then they think:
""Maybe it's good to just doubt everyone and everything - myself included!""

And so Doubt and Person B sit together, replaying old movies and telling old stories,
on the theme of Doubt, and how you can never really trust or believe in yourself to
do anything, because you're so worthless and bad. 

As you can imagine, this feels both really familiar to Person B (because they do
things like this all the time), and also really, really terrible. 

By the time Doubt is ready to leave, he has given birth to children. 
(This can happen with emotions, who don't need to physically have sex to reproduce). 
There is Little Ronny Doubt, Little Jimmy Doubt, and Little Annika Doubt, 
and they are already growing up fast!

The Doubts, now grown into a family, bid Person B adieu, and leave their house,
promising to return soon - and as often as they can! 

Person B waves them farewell saying ""Come back soon - here you will always have a warm
meal and a place to stay!""


**End scene.**"
142,i wanna induce a manic episode,i know i shouldn’t but i wanna be productive and start the semester strong bc i started last semester with one and it was perfect. but i know it probably isn’t good lol. idk.
143,I’m not trans anymore?,"(Not sure what flair to use lol)

As of a few days ago, I considered myself to be a trans woman. But when I thought of myself actually transitioning, living as a woman, wearing makeup etc, I realized that I don’t feel the desire to do that. I don’t want to look like a woman and I don’t want to be a woman.

I then had a revelation - when I think about being a trans woman, I visualize myself in a different life situation than I’m in now (namely, I’m older and have moved out), so in effect, I’ve created a fictional version of myself, and this version just happens to be trans.

(To make this shorter and easier to read, instead of typing “the trans version of myself” over and over, I’ll call the trans version of me “Bianca”, the name I picked for my trans self)

I’m a maladaptive daydreamer, which means that I daydream about fantasy worlds that I’ve created in my head, as a distraction from reality. I can be someone else instead of who I actually am. I know of course that the people I am in these daydreams aren’t real, that I’ve made them up.

But maybe in the case of Bianca, it’s taken until now for me to discern between fantasy and reality. It’s easy to know when what you’re dreaming is fake when you’re some other person in the daydream. With Bianca, she’s someone who I could theoretically become at a later date, so I always considered her to be me, just in a couple years or so. It took until me imagining my current self transitioning to realize that perhaps Bianca is some other person. She’s a fantasy that I’ve created in my head and is not real, therefore I’m not trans.

Or maybe I have two personalities, or I’m two people at once. “Reality me”, (who is me right now, at this point in time) is not trans, while Bianca is trans and wants to transition. In this situation, Reality me has retaken control of my brain from Bianca, and when I was obsessed with wanting to be a girl, that wasn’t me thinking those thoughts but Bianca. Or maybe I am Bianca, so it was me wanting to be a girl??

Then there’s the explanation that maybe I don’t want to transition because I’m simply scared. I get severe anxiety sometimes (I almost passed out and threw up before a test one time), and I’ve gotten unreasonably nervous/scared before job interviews etc and felt like chickening out.

I like to imagine being independent and such but reality me is afraid of change and the big adult world, I don’t feel ready for it. So instead of working towards being an adult I just fantasize about being an imaginary future version of myself. Maybe it’s the same with being trans?

Realistically, I’d probably be terrified to go out in public dressed as a woman (but if I did get over my fear and anxiety and do it a bunch of times, I imagine reality me feeling apathetic about the whole experience).

Going back to my religious upbringing, maybe this transgender stuff is Satan tempting me, or maybe I’m being possessed by a demon or something.

I guess I’ll conclude here, thanks for reading, and I hope you can help me. Maybe you’ve felt like this too? I feel like I’m alone in these thoughts, like I’m uniquely crazy."
144,memory loss,"i wrote a vent post a day or two ago and what happened to me and um,, that night i had my usual weekly breakdown with screaming n crying n harm as i do but, i lost my memory. i completely forgot who i was and thought i’d been kidnapped. people messaging me to see if i was okay since i went AFK made it worse and i didn’t know who my friends were and they were sending worrying messages to me.

i only have some memory now as my boyfriend ran me through the past 2 years of my life to get it back but, i can’t remember things still like who certain people are and what they’ve done to me. it’s scary and i don’t know if it’s coming back:/// any advice minus “go get help”?"
145,Needing advice. I can never focus and I don’t know what’s wrong w me but am too anxious to bring it up to my therapist in case I’m just overreacting,"I cannot focus anymore on really anything, but especially class work. I have D+’s and below in all of my academic classes because I just cannot do work. 

I’ll open assignments and even if I’m feeling motivated I can hardly ever do anything. It feels like my eyes don’t work and my brain can’t process anything.

I don’t know what to do. I have to apply for colleges next year and I’ll never get in anywhere with my grades like this. I don’t even know why I can’t focus. I mentioned it briefly, in passing to my therapist and she said it was from my anxiety but I haven’t gone into detail for her.

I hate this so much. I can focus on some stuff sometimes- sometimes I’ll get into the zone and I can do a whole assignment in one sitting. But that’s rare and my grades are paying the price for it.

For reference I am diagnosed with social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and OCD. 

I’m really upset rn and I don’t know what to do because I feel like no one believes me when I say I can’t focus. It’s not like there’s something specific distracting me, my brain just hates me. And I really wanna do work. I enjoy learning and for the most part I understand all the material. :-/

Any advice or ideas as to what’s up with me would be really helpful.

Thanks


EDIT: thought I’d mention that I suffer minority from derealization. It’s nothing crazy severe I don’t think, but my therapist said it’s on account of my anxiety/trauma. Not sure if this helps"
146,Can you take melatonin and zopiclone together?,?
147,I Wish I Could Just Die,"I suffer from a variety of mental disorders including OCD,Bipolar Disorder/Depression,and anxiety.I also have an eating disorder(the main reason for this post) and self harm tendencies.
I am such a burden to my family and I KNOW for a fact because they’ve made it very clear,both through their mannerisms and verbally.I don’t want to die and I know that but there’s no other way that this pain will end...
The only thing keeping me here is my family and my cats....I’m so sick of fighting my eating disorder and hearing the comments my family makes as well as the constant accusations and questioning(I purge a lot and they feel the need to constantly ask if I’ve thrown up)
I’m tired of being a burden to the people I care about most and truly believe they would be better off without me and all my issues..
I hope you all are doing better than I am,stay safe and know you’re loved🖤"
148,How to help a friend with depression?,"Hi all,

I have a friend that is very important to me that is currently struggling with Depression. It's sort of an on and off battle. 

I know it is mostly something he will have to do for himself, but I want to help. I hate seeing him like this. 

He lives 2 hours from me and I want to get in the car and go see him, even if it is for 2 minutes to hug him, but I know that likely won't help and he ""doesn't want to see people."" 

I can't tell if that really won't help, or if it is the typically ""depression response"" to sort of close off and push people away. I don't want to overstep or make it worse, but he's very important to me and I want to help. 

What can I do?"
149,"my partner was hospitalized, help please","she called me just now to let me know she was hospitalized last night. mental health has never been a topic we've shyed away from, it's something we discuss very openly, but im anxious out of my mind. they aren't taking visitors due to covid and she's not allowed to have her phone for extended periods of time. i don't really know what to do with myself, i really just want her to be okay. sorry if im rambling here. any advice is appreciated, i don't really know how im supposed to spend 3-5 days not knowing how she's doing."
150,Trying to help a depressed mom...,"My mother (65 yo) has suffered depression (and many of the cognitive distortions that come along with that) for her whole life. She has been in therapy on and off, she has tried medication... but nothing consistently. Frankly, I would love it if she would stick to a program but I am trying to understand her and meet her where she is at. (I think she also may have AADHD)... 

I've noticed more symptoms of her depression with COVID (obvs - everyone is suffering to a degree) and sometimes we'll be having a 'normal' conversation about something, it turns ever so slightly contentious and she starts crying. I get upset at her for getting upset... and I probably make her feel like a basket case.... but I'm trying to help her ""see"" that everything isn't as bad as she thinks... I know this is probably not helpful - however, using logic (IMO) is better than either sitting there silently while she cries and rants, and/or me getting overly emotional and losing my cool....

 I'm (37 yo daughter) currently working through my own childhood issues with a therapist and am really having some breakthroughs. I have not suffered like my mother with my mental health, however, about 5 months ago, I realized I needed to sort out my own cognitive distortions or else I was going to end up very unhappy.

The question is, how do I support my mother on her journey without pushing her away? For example today, I caught myself pointing out that she was exhibiting 'black and white' thinking and that she was attaching her own happiness to the actions of others. 

Here's the gist of the convo: ""I'm worried your dad isn't doing enough exercise... I'm worried he's not going to be able to stay mobile in old age.... He will NEVER be motivated to exercise... his parents NEVER did...."" Conclusion therefore being: ""I must be the one to MAKE him be motivated to exercise or else it will NEVER happen and I will be unhappy because we can't do things together..."" This is my moms line of thinking. 

My response was something to the effect of ""mom you can't make dad do anything, he has to find his own internal motivation.., you bugging him to do anything, especially exercise, is not going to result in him wanting to do it... - focus on yourself and your exercise routine and maybe he'll be inspired but at the same time, do not count on it... Let him do what he wants and if his body fails, that's his doing...."" And also ""don't hitch your happiness to the actions of others..."" 

The question is: Should I just be a quiet by standard and not give my thoughts and opinions on this? Because my mom was not too happy with my response... let me tell you! lol - Am I helping or hurting our relationship? 

Someone with depression and black and white thinking tell me, is it good when a loved one points out your flawed thinking or does it not help at all. Should I just sit back and agree? ""I hear you mom, dad is a lazy bum and it sucks that it's your job to try to fix him...""

TL/DR: Depressed mother, should I try to help or should I be a shoulder to cry on?"
151,Sleeping disorders.,"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-sleep-disorders-may-precede-parkinsons-and-alzheimers/

I seen the above study in another reddit group and I'm abit worried. I suffer from PTSD from being bullied as a kid. I'm 27 now. I also used to have housemates who would sneak into my room in college and talk to me in my sleep and I used to act out the dreams that would coincide with what they were saying to me. An example would be them telling me I was playing a hurling match and this led to me swinging my hurl around my room in my sleep. My memories of that period aren't 100% and I often get flashes of then but I'm not sure how much is true and what is just from those dreams. I'm just wondering would this apply to the above study or would it just apply to, and i use this losely, normal sleep walking etc. If anyone could shed any light on this that would be great. Thank you in advance."
152,Notebook,"Once we're back to normal and out of lockdown I'm going to book an appointment as I'm really struggling with my mental health and feel constantly restless, edgy, unable to focus and I panic whenever I'm going out, especially when out alone and even just going to the shops. The thing is I find that I struggle with telling other exactly how I'm feeling or symptoms and I'm wondering if if would be a good idea to write in a journal about what I'm truly feeling like."
153,"Am I going ""insane"" ?","I had a very big accident about two months ago, before that accident i was smoking about a gram of hashish everyday. As my accident was very important, (about 15 fractures and lots of internal damage) I had to stopped smoking so I basically did a cold turkey. I already have important mental issues (depression, anxiety, BPD) and I was taking my meds and smoking. (Celexa, Seroquel and Concerta).

I Just recently started Imovane (Zopiclone) and I began hearing some kind of voices, but it mostly ressemble my little brother gibberish (he does not talk even at 4 yo)

I think my abuse of THC really backfired on me (started at 13, at 15 almost 16 now) .

I had a lot of times where i was smoking everyday.

I wonder if it really is the THC or something else"

Due to the quarantine (march 2020) i found my self jobless, also i had school so i didn't found the money to pay. So, i developed a depression and emotional pain, i was literally out of mind conscious

state, they was the worst days ever, after 3 months later, things become better.

Until i had another financial trouble so at november i start feeling totally miserable, learned helplessness..., Now, depressed again and worse, why i analyze past in my head!

i feel guilty, about how i was, such weak, nearly to death, lost of my mind,

I think it didn't heal; i start developing bad thoughts: living only in the past and asking what if what if

what if i did that and so on..

The worse, it goes more than that time, i start living all the past, all the worst moments..

A single mistake lead to many mistakes .

I feel terrible,upset, mad, indignation, i don't know how to start living the present and focus on it and the future? should i just keep going like that until i back to normal, or going to have some alcohol drinks to stop those thoughts?"
155,Mental health and relationships,"Was thinking about breaking up with this girl during a period that my mental health was feeling low. Now a week later I feel completely different. I spent time with her last night and felt so happy to he around her. I am realizing for the hundredth time that people with mental health disorders can’t always trust their feelings. My advice is that anyone suffering from a disorder such as depression, ocd, anxiety, schizophrenia that makes them feel overwhelmed: don’t be afraid to step back and wait on making decisions. Nothing has to be immediate.

(This advice doesn’t apply to toxic/ abusive relationships. Get out ASAP)"
156,"My 17yo sister has been self-destructive(cutting,drugs,...) for some time now, today she's gone to the hospital from own initiative with hope that it will get better with professional help. She's got restricted phone &amp; pc time, what can I buy her so she can pass the time and hopefully feel better?","Thank you for any tips.

We are not very close, I've moved out 5 years ago and we weren't very close before that either."
157,"19 days clean and lemme tell you, a cup of coffee as im maintaining what this Abilify does to me.. Idk if that was english","but, I do know I felt like a Sim that just NEEDED to go for a walk and I did with my dog, I thrive in cold weather too, L.

158,"Strange attachment to forgotten (or blocked) memories: Is it therapeutic to remember them, preserve them? I'm the last stop for boxes and boxes of family correspondence, nobody else alive who cares about any of it but me. And I should want to forget much of it.","TLDR: Just another sappy grief story. Just wanted to vent. It could be much much worse. It feels good to post this. Thank you.

My mom was 47 when she died. She would've been 69 this year. My grandmother was in her 90's and I was closer to her than my own mom. Covid got her, my grandmother 'just' died about 8 months ago. All of my immediate family that I knew would be there no matter what are gone. No siblings, children, parents, grandparents are alive any more. With my grandmothers death, her house was cleaned out and sold. I now have just become the final stop for 47 years worth (I am 47 years old) of postcards, personal letters, greeting cards, childhood projects and report cards from kindergarten on. Before the internet, my family was disbursed and wrote frequently. We also seemed to take just as many pictures with film as people do now with digital. That's a lot of pictures. There are literally thousands of long letters written between now all dead family members, random pictures. So with going through all this stuff, I am now, again, dropped into this new level of low, grieving, horrible, suffocating, smothering feeling of permanent loss and orphaness. I cry throughout the day, for weeks now. Memories about what happened to and between family haunt me like ghosts. But I am irrationally scared of losing all this stuff (which should've likely been thrown away decades ago) and have some weird desire to keep it. I'm also very thankful to have it, as a memory, so I can always be reminded of it. My thought is I'm taking quick scans of each piece, so I can store and save it, and then I'm shredding it and recycling it all. I'm thinking it should give a sense of finality, but also let me save it - electronically. Is this a good plan, will this help me, is it the appropriate thing to do, will it help me get over/through it? Or is reading through many of the (sad) things which happened bad for me, does it need to be discarded perhaps without being read? I do not know what to do. I miss them all so much. If anyone reading this dies before I do, please tell all my family I love them. (I am not and have never been suicidal and know it will all pass with time, but if I should go first, I will tell your family you love them too. :)"
159,This shit ruins everything,"Sorry for the rant. I’m just tired of being mentally ill. About a week ago I met the cutest guy, we were texting everyday and getting to know each other, I was so happy (Being in love is one of my favorite feelings), I thought my life was going to be different this year. Then I have a panic attack out of nowhere while on a innocent car ride with my family. Felt out of breath, chest pain, tingling hands and really nervous. I feel better as soon as I get home. But then, a dissociative state comes out of this panic attack. It’s been almost a week. I feel like my head is just a head, with no brain inside. Like I’m floating. I can understand things that are occurring around me, but I can’t properly react to them. I have an insane fear of losing my mind and going psychotic and this feels so close to happening right now. I have dissociated before, but not like this, not for days. It always passed. I am so afraid that it’s not going to pass. I’m also starting to feel depressed, with little motivation to do anything (Which is something I’ve also felt before, in June 2020 I had a similar depressive episode that lasted like a week, but again, I am afraid that it’s not going to pass). I don’t understand why things have to be this way for me. How can I go from feeling really good with everything to feeling like I’m dying in the shortest period. I am still talking to the guy, but I am afraid that this shit will get worse and worse to the point I won’t be able to do that anymore. He mentioned wanting to go out with me a few days ago. I really want to, but I know I won’t be able to if I don’t get better. Not to mention that my birthday is coming. I don’t want to spend my birthday like this... I just want the happy and safe headspace I was into like five days ago... I’m sorry. I just needed to talk.
Just to add: I am diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD. I don’t know if I have something else. And I really hope I don’t.
I’m on therapy, but not on meds. I am really afraid of taking antidepressants because of all the side effects (I’ve experienced it before and couldn’t handle it). I know I probably need them, but I don’t want to... I don’t have time to have my symptoms increased because I’m adjusting to the meds. I’m just starting my life, I’m becoming an adult... I just want to live like a normal person..."
160,"I think something is wrong with me, I need some advice!?","I'm going to try and cut this down as much as possible so I'm separating it into a sort of category~

•about me: 
So I've always preferred being alone even as a baby, I have a lot of siblings who would all play together but I would rather be on my own. To an outside perspective I'm a calm, laidback person with an impulsive streak, but to myself I'm quite the opposite; I have a lot of pride in myself especially on the fact that unlike everyone else I'm not 'trained' to compare myself to someone and lower my self esteem. I dont have many hobbies that really stick, I jump from thing to thing because I lose interest so quickly (usually a hobby lasts a few weeks to around 2 months). 

•Issues:
I also have something called maladaptive daydreaming which is basically- extremely vivid daydreams with their own characters, settings, plots, and other detailed, story-like features, this can distract me from day to day tasks like sleeping or eating. Because of this I prefer to daydream than be around actual people, to me anything bad is someone elses fault, whether its arguments or accidents. 
On top of that unlike other people who plan out the future and have a dream life I cant do that, planning ahead has never been something entertaining for me and instead it disappoints me especially when I want something and I have to wait for it. 
The same when I'm thinking about jobs too I cant think about working somewhere for the rest of my life to slace away with no satisfaction in life.

•Relationships (all types):
My family is pretty much broken, I dont talk to my dads side of the family, my mom has bpd, adhd and anxiety. 3 of my brothers also have adhd and so does my sister, so everyone in my family is constantly hyper and always doing stuff and there is usually an argument or a fight going on. My mom used to have really violent fights with my sister and always took her stress out on her (did it too my brother b4 he moved out and was told it would happen to me) but my mom used to drink out alot too so she has been held in a cell more than once (idk if shes served actually time). The 3rd youngest brother (11) is obsessed with me, he always tries sneaks into my room, I found out he has repeatedly using my toothbrush so i have to keep mine in my room now and i also have a lock, he tries to look at me getting changed or showering so I'm constantly overcome with paranoia doing anything.
 -theres more but those are the key things that stick

For a few years now I've been building up a hate towards them (mom and younger brother) it's become so bad that when I think of them I just want to hurt them sometimes kill, and I'll usually punch something near me as a kind of reflex. But the hate I have for them has grown into hating everyone around me, I constantly think about hurting other people and the more I feel I hate them that thought becomes a temptation. It's always been hard for me to build an emotional connection to people and even harder when if I look at someone all I see are flaws.

•ideals:
 I dont really place value on things like family, I place even less value for people in power like the government or the queen. I have many ideals on how the world should be, and most of them consists of killing people off, getting rid of buildings and a majority of things man made. One thing they have in common is nature, this is one thing that calms me down and stops me thinking about hurting others consistently."
161,Free mental healthcare?,"Hello all. I have a friend (yes really, not me) who is actively seeking mental health services, but unfortunately he does not have any expendable income at this time. Does anyone have recommendations for free resources or services available?"
162,!!!ATTENTION!!! PLEASE HELP ME HELP MY FRIEND I LOVE HER AND I CANT TAKE SEEING HER LIKE THIS,"A friend of mine has adhd and a number of undiagnosed mental health and is heavily in need of someone who understands / relates to her problems. I suggested the internet. 

I feel like i should mention that she suffers from 
Adhd, depression, panic-anxiety and they are thinking she has bipolar disorder. Multiple personality disorder. Ptsd and trauma from being brought up with a mom who only gave her love but no real help or direction in life and a gangster dad who never really was there (seperated parents)

She wrote:

Does anyone relate? Any advice / help, anything really would be much appreciated."
163,Hypercritical and dramatic mom that laughed at me when I burned my fingers and hit me with a bag of metal screws. No apologies or regrets. What do I do!?,"My mother(47F) and I(16F) get along pretty well most of the time. I am a fairly decent kid with good grades that mostly refrains from arguing and concedes to any command. However, as much as I love her, I get super scared of her. She is really unpredictable and will yell and scream at me over the littlest things, and even go as far as calling me ""evil"" and similar attributes when she knows very well that I mean absolutely no harm. Even friendly, casual conversations slowly morph into lectures about how I'm not good enough. Not too long ago she shouted at me and called me ""horrible"" simply because I accidentally turned my iPad away from her a little when we were both looking at it. It might be important to mention that she unfortunately had an unsuccessful foot surgery back in August and has a condition known as fibromyalgia, which has a heavy impact on the entire nervous system and is known to affect mood. Perhaps this is what could be contributing to her recent bursts of anger.

The day before, after I was done with my e-learning, I was met with hisses and insults right when I emerged from my study room, though I did nothing wrong at that very moment. All that racket was, for the love of God, about some bottle of homemade shampoo and how I had better use it or else. Later, my mom shoves a container of yogurt in my chest for me to hold it, and again, *I had better eat it or else*. A couple hours later, we went to clean a bookshelf upstairs. Not only was my mother shouting at me way too often (despite me trying to maintain a positive atmosphere), we kept running into things in that bookshelf that brought back bad memories, which my mom decided to dwell upon. After cleaning the bookshelf, I get a sudden lecture about how I don't ""work with my hands enough"" and that I should do something in the kitchen. I brought up the idea of making bubble tea, and my mom made me start on the boba at that very moment. As someone who is not used to being in the kitchen, I understandably became overwhelmed and stressed, which made me very clumsy. I ended up not only tipping over a cup of juice, but unintentionally pouring boiling water on the middle three fingers of my right hand whilst trying to dump the water in the sink (I do not think it was that serious since my fingers feel better as of now). When I burned my fingers on accident, my mom began to roar with laughter. At that moment, I lost it. The constant insolence was too much to handle. I told her to stop laughing but she did not, so I found myself screaming at her. My dad witnessed the situation unfolding and disapproved of my mother's reaction, but encouraged me to stay patient. Later that evening, she told me that I deserved to have my fingers burned, and retaliated by striking me with a bag of large metal screws, even though my dad advised my mom not to physically hurt me. The worst thing is that my mom feels that she did absolutely no wrong, and I am the one receiving the silent treatment. Things seem to be settling down and maybe we will make up after some time, but I doubt I will see my mother the same after this. What she did to me was undoubtedly terrible.

How should I treat my mom from now on? I still want to treat her with kindness but I might want to have a little space, how do I do it? (My mom is pretty clingy.) Anyone had similar incidents with their parents? How would you analyze my mom's personality? I honestly have never felt so betrayed in my life. The person I love the most gave me the worst treatment I have ever faced. I always knew she was a rough person, but I never expected it to go this far.

TL:DR; My mother has been overreacting at the littlest of my mistakes for some time now and has been outright cruel. Recently she laughed at me when I burned three of my fingers with boiling water, and when I reacted negatively to her inconsiderate, heartless gesture, she retaliated by hitting me with a bag of metal screws. What should I do and what are your thoughts on this?"
164,Urgent: Mental Health Apps?,"I‘m currently unable to hold my much needed, weekly therapy sessions due to my current school-related obligations, which makes me anxious about the possible declining of my mental health. Therefore I‘m asking if some of you could please recommend me a few mental health apps, preferably for free and with the option to add existing diagnoses? I‘d really appreciate it since I‘m genuinely needing this kind of support. 
Thank you in advance! :)"
165,Kinda being reckless again lately and hoping I die without having to commit suicide,"I dream...

Lol I love being reckless"
166,Idek I have so many thoughts idk which ones to focus on,"Why? How could I be so stupid to think that my life could be better? Why did I have hopes? Why did I even let myself believe that my life could get better?

Someone please help me.. actually, don't.. idk how to get out of this house"
167,Cat Pee Girl,"Throughout my childhood years, I received my education, Grades 2 through 12, via the award-winning Jeff Davis County Schools. Part of that educational process included the attendance requirements for being in class. And thus, being poor, a free ride to school came in the form of a big, yellow school bus driven by none other than the infamous Mrs. Dollie Lee. 

Mrs. Dollie still drives past my house each morning and afternoon. Her twice a school day yellow streak out on the highway always makes me smile, as she passes. I love Mrs. Dollie. She’s a pistol. Brilliant, sharp, fiery, loving, protective, hilarious, and not a person you want to disrespect, or tangle with negatively. She’ll win. 

She treated every student on her bus equally, and expected her rules to be followed without fail, because her primary focus was always our safety. We lived near the very end of the 20+ mile long route of students for whom Mrs. Dollie was responsible. We boarded the bus before daylight, and arrived home late in the afternoon. 

One of the stops along our route, included one of the trailer parks that still sits just on the outskirts of Hazlehurst, Georgia. Being a park filled with trailers, meant that there were several spots along that road where Mrs. Dollie would pick up piles of even more poor kids. 

There was one particular trailer in this particular trailer park, which was a dreaded stop. Heartbreakingly, two sisters would board the school bus, and immediately the air was filled with the odor of cat urine. This was the kind of cat pee smell that you know means the cats(sssssss) aren’t just using litter boxes, if those were even available.  Overwhelmingly ammonia-like. 

The smell of those students would literally make nearly everyone gag. Mrs. Dollie had a weak stomach, bless her heart, but I never heard or saw her treat those girls any differently. Except, perhaps, encouraging those of us who’d been on the bus all morning to vent the windows just prior to our arrival at their trailer. We learned to do that. No one wanted them to be mistreated. 

In the Fall of 2019, after being unable to complete the opening of my restaurant Eat at Roman’s, I was heartbroken and defeated. I had just lost my best friend, my yellow lab, my Sweet Butters. I was humiliated, and could not speak publicly about the egregious circumstances of that restaurant endeavor abruptly stopping, due to numerous legal concerns. I couldn’t take much more. 

But then a dream girl showed up. She posed so beautifully throughout our beautiful county. Y’all saw her. She met my closest people; my inner circle. She even got to meet my Mema. It’s rare for someone to meet the threshold and requirements I have for affording someone the opportunity to meet my Mema. I believed her words, her touch, her heart. I had a longtime connection to her family, and it just felt right, in every single way. 

When I was forced to stop the Eat at Roman’s endeavor, mentally and emotionally I was a wreck.. But, we fished and frolicked and had a dream month. During that time, I shared the struggles I face daily as a disabled combat veteran. As the tears rolled down both of our faces, while sitting on the very loveseat upon which I’m typing this story, she said, “Come back to Los Angeles and let me take care of you. We’ve got UCLA, the best programs for PTSD and help with your eating, and anything else you need.”

We both wanted a family. We both are in our mid-thirties. We both had experienced good and not-so-good relationships. And hell, her twin sister was my best friend for nearly 7 years. It was a dream. My dream girl was falling for me; my dream girl was jumping for me. We planned for me to come visit, stay for a while, get treatment and support, us together explore each other, the new relationship, and share the world. Faith. Hope. And blind love. 

A few months into that dreamy stream of beautiful instagram posts and moments of bliss, I found myself packing my belongings to quickly exit our home, because the abuse I was silently experiencing, and which was internally destroying me, manifested itself in her in such a way that led to her hitting me, and then pulling a knife on me, one of my own chef’s knives, at that. Ain’t that something?

Eventually, I got out as quickly as possible. I caught the next flight out of LAX to Jacksonville, Florida, where Mama picked me up. She knew what happened. I called and shared with her prior to my hasty departure. Mama begged me for weeks to come home. Every friend I had pleaded with me. Even Mema’s doctor, Bonnie Blakeslee Pittman spoke to me via her cell phone and said, “Roman, if you saw and heard this happening by a man directed at a woman, what would you call it?” I replied, “I’d call it abuse. I’d intervene. I’d help. I’d beg her to get out.” Mrs. Bonnie said, “That ain’t love, Roman. Come home.”

So, I did. I eventually made my way back up to my little house here in Denton. But I was a wreck. I was depressed, heartbroken again, and my anxiety was uncontrollable. I wasn’t able to eat, I lost weight quickly, and couldn’t sleep. Frankly, I was fading fast. 

Late one lonely, scary night, I eventually called a mental health hotline for veterans, and asked if there were any resources in our region for a veteran like me...in crisis. They quickly referred me to a local behavioral/mental health organization, who immediately got me in for an appointment. 

I did not want to kill myself, nor did I want to harm anyone else. But I wasn’t sure how I was going to be able to continue waking up to so much hell and hurt and loss. 

I drove the 12 miles north to Hazlehurst, and walked into the offices of the behavioral/mental health folks. A lady greeted me. She was expecting me, but she was only the receptionist. She gestured for me to have a seat, and encouraged me that a therapist would come out for me very soon.  

After a few minutes, a woman opened the door, walked over to me, and introduced herself to me. I immediately recognized her name, and when I looked in the eyes of that social worker, I saw the eldest of the Cat Pee Sisters from the trailer park. I’m not quite sure what she thought, but my eyes must have grown very large because she quickly asked me if everything was okay. 

We made our way into her office. She closed the door. She ensured me of confidentiality, and Roman Coley Davis fell apart. I unloaded. I explained that I’d exited an unhealthy relationship, that I was not having very positive thoughts, and that sort of thing. 

She held out a box of tissues for me, and then pulled out this picture of the “Anger Iceberg.” She began to discuss how valid feelings are, and how relationships are challenging, and I don’t remember much else. I was pissed and stopped listening to her. I didn’t need a coloring sheet. 

I wasn’t angry, I was sad, heartbroken, abused, borderline suicidal, etc...I actually didn’t become angry until I saw this piece of paper. It made me so mad that at one of the lowest points I’d ever been, the solution from her was this “Anger Iceberg.” She hadn’t even given me a fresh one! It has White Out on it circling the words “helpless” and “hurt,” covering up another patient’s selections! What the actual heck?!

But suddenly, in the deepest part of Roman, I felt an overwhelming feeling. I can only describe it as calmness. Not peace, but calm, as though someone were in control. 25 years ago this social worker, through no fault of her own, smelled like cat pee and made me gag, morning after morning, as we grew up together riding Mrs. Dollie’s school bus. 

Iceberg or not, I melted. I left her office humbled. I left her office knowing that I wouldn’t harm myself. I left that office knowing that that all of those years ago, all of those bus rides, and all of those morning gags, led to this little girl turning into the one person on Earth who was speaking to Roman, not knowing that he didn’t want to live anymore. 

Her words didn’t matter. What mattered was the moment that I realized she smelled of shampoo and perfume.

God does not always speak through crashes of thunder and flashes of lightning. Sometimes God does not speak with a majestic chorus of trumpets and angels. 

But, sometimes God speaks with a small voice that says, “Roman, I created and loved and led Cat Pee Girl through all of her life, on every school bus ride, through every bit of her training, and put her in that office today as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with one empty time slot in her schedule, with that “Anger Iceberg” worksheet to show YOU, that I can bring even the lowest, even the poorest, even the smelliest to a place and time, decades later, to do a work on my behalf, to intercede in your loneliest moments, to be there for you with those tissues. You know everything on that worksheet. But, I wanted you to see her, to smell the air, and to remember that I am in control. Be still and know.”

I think I’m gonna frame this, White Out and all."
168,Just had a huge confidence knock and I don't feel I have anywhere to turn,"So to give you some backstory to me (M24), I have high functioning Asperger's syndrome and as a result, very severe anxiety and severe depression. My confidence has never been amazing because school was shit to me in terms of bullying (from both teachers and students). After leaving school, I studied astrophysics at university until I dropped out primarily due to the fact there was a girl in the group of friends I had who I fell in love with but never made a move because of my severe anxiety (which stems from a lot of areas itself), eventually the group of friends forced me out and all of this led me down a very dark road of alcoholism to combat my insomnia, suicide attempts and becoming a recluse and choosing to stay in bed for a lot of my time at university avoiding both going to lectures and meeting up with friendship groups. 

So when I was back at home after leaving university, I lived with my mum and was similar to at university in terms of staying in bed and not wanting to do anything although the suicide attempts stopped because I reached the point where I was like ""well I clearly don't have the balls to go through with it"". Then my sister got herself a new boyfriend and they had the room next door to mine and understandably, being a new relationship, you can guess what I had to listen to every night. So I said to one of my other sisters can they have a word with her they said they did but then it continued so after a few more attempts of saying things like ""could they go to his house instead?"" And asking if my mum or my sisters could talk to her eventually I snapped and lashed out at her boyfriend and got kicked out of the house and sent to live with my dad (who I've never been close to, never had any issues with him, we just have different interests and stuff).

So I currently live with my dad and have been applying for jobs over the past 3 years (you'd be amazed how reluctant employers are to hire someone who has partially studied an astrophysics degree) alongside doing voluntary work in a shop. 

So the issue I had today is when I went downstairs to make myself a drink (I very rarely head down because I don't get along with my dad, my step-mother or my step-brother) then my step-brother's child (about 2 years old I think) turns round and says "" 'Madden284747', you're a freak"". Nobody else heard this because I was in the kitchen and they were all talking in the living room. The thing that bothers me about this is when you hear children say things like that, it's learned behaviour so that has really upset me and due to what some would probably call overcompensating for my autism and everything else, I jump through hoops to keep people happy, which is mentally taxing as it is, but then when after all of that, I'm hearing via my step-brother's child that they think I'm a freak, that has really shot my confidence. It always feels like I try and keep people happy all my life and the way how I get repaid is by finding out that behind my back they think I'm a freak. 

My reasoning behind posting this here is, because I can't turn to either side of my family because of reasons mentioned above and after everything at university I don't have a girlfriend who I could turn to because the girl at university was basically the perfect girl for me; beautiful looks, a lot of shared interests. She was basically a female, more beautiful version of me I'd say, and since I've experienced that I feel like I wouldn't want to settle for ""just another pretty face"". 

I mean, I don't know what I'm expecting from this, whether it be advice or just a way for me to get how this made me feel off my chest. Because I'm at the point where in terms of searching for a job, I'll take whatever I can get, then as soon as I have a job, I'll get myself a flat somewhere and just last out the, like 40-50 years I'll have left, alone since I'd be surprised if I can find any girl who will match up to the girl from university who will want me since due to my autism, anxiety, depression amongst other things which are a lot more embarrassing to talk about, I feel I'm more of a hassle to a girl than it'd be worth.

Sorry if this became a bit ranty or whatever."
169,I feel like my mental health is getting worse and I'm not sure what to do,"I'll preface this with some background information about myself. I am currently a teen who has never been diagnosed with any mental illness. I also don't know anyone in my family who has been, besides my sister who was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder.

It started about 6 months ago when I had some exams and I was feeling stressed. I was working hard and felt worried about my results. It was around this time where I had a really strong urge to retract from social interaction and keep contact with other people at a minimum, idk if this is stress or what but it's a feeling I still have now. After that I started feeling flat. I don't know how to describe it but I wasn't happy nor sad, just neutral. I spoke to my mom about this and she brushed it off as hormones. Now is where I get concerned. I have started finding patterns in things like car registration plates and I believe that there's some kind of code for me to break. I know this is absurd but I still partially believe there's a code for me to break. This has slowly become more common and I starting to worry.

Is this normal for people my age (ie. is it just hormones)?  If not who should I talk to?"
170,"Dear Diary, I still hope to try to go to sleep forever and end my book.","Dearest Diary, 

I’m such a burden, worthless, and I want what I want so bad. I have no idea who that girl was a year ago. She was so different. 

Life will always be just pain. I hate myself. How do I finish my life book? I’ve been asking for a year. Why can’t I just get myself to finish the end of the story.

The guilt pushes me back so much, but I have a pen in my hand and I know how to write it. I have everything setup and what I need to just finish the end. I just need to do it. Why can’t I do it?

171,"Almost killed myself and realized I need to get help. How do I go about getting help, whether online or in-person?","Hi guys, 21F from the US here. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for many years. I've spent a lot of time researching and practicing overcoming these things. I don't really have friends, but I can at least hold a job and do the housework. It's mostly the depression that has been getting me this past year. (Context follows, skip to TL,DR for question detail)

I used to love playing games on the pc and doing lots of things. I slowly worked on myself until I was happy and able to do these things. However, as I eventually got accustomed to my ""new life"" being more happier, I learned that my fiance (lifelong best friend) had been cheating on me for months with the very people that I played games with alongside him, and that he had exchanged pictures with minors on the internet (using my usernames, accounts, etc. without my knowledge). I lost my friends and everything and had to start over, and it felt like I was knocked back to square one with all the progress I'd made on myself.

Now, a year later, I live a new life.  I have a well-paying job and my coworker/friend lives next door to my new apartment. I built my own gaming pc two weeks ago. I have a car and life is quiet.

However, while I am no longer troubled by much anxiety in my daily life, trying to go on discord is an insurmountable issue. I am overwhelmed by the anxiety that the people around me secretly have it out for me. I am just restless these days, walking around my apartment or driving around aimlessly. I cannot focus enough to even play games. I am so overwhelmed by sudden suicidal feelings and worthlessness that I have just about pushed away my only friend. I feel so content some days, but it takes one little bad thing to completely offset me into feeling like a suicidal worthless pos. Basically, I wish I wasn't so depressed all the time, and I wish I could focus on the one thing--gaming--that used to help me take my mind off things.

edit: Richmond, VA is approximate location

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR:*** I want to get help but I have no idea how. I am scared that I will get a wrong diagnosis or some medication with awful side effects or that they'll lock me in a psych ward, which I'm sure isn't the case anyway. I don't have insurance and I don't know how going about this works. I would prefer an online service, as I am looking into Cerebral, but I don't know what's good and what isn't. Something that allows prescriptions if so. Sorry for the long post, first time here. Any help is appreciated. Thank you friends."
172,I can't recommend Wellbutrin enough!!!,"Hello.

I've live with major depressive disorder. Diagnosed in my late 20's so pretty much that entire decade and more was incredibly hard.

Finally I found a doctor who I clicked with. We went through a few attempts, but the latest attempt is her putting me on Wellbutrin. It's been a revelation.

Link: https://www.verywellmind.com/wellbutrin-bupropion-side-effects-1066745

I feel completely different. For the first time in perhaps 13 years, I am actually optimistic about life. I am still sometimes shocked at how much of myself I had completely forgotten. Yes I now have to repair the damage I did to myself during those really bad years but I now have a chance to make something of my life again.

There is no silver bullet, but my goodness I do feel that those pills may have saved my life.

Please ask your doctor about Wellbutrin. Maybe it may work for your case. Because as much as society still shuns this topic, the fact is that you can't just get over a chemical imbalance in your brain. I've made peace with that I will be taking these for the rest of my days.

Stay safe. Kind regards,
Happy-Zulu"

174,For anyone dealing with anxiety. This is what works for me and I think it could work for you too.,"I dealt with severe anxiety to the point where I couldn’t go anywhere where people were. I could only leave my house when it was dark. I was constantly worried about judgment. I let my self do whatever and whenever and I lost touch with reality. It may be hard to hear but I think the best way to get rid of your anxiety is to have more discipline. And it doesn’t have to be a daunting or scary task. Just take it a step at a time, brick by brick. Discipline is so important to combat anxiety because for a lot of us, anxiety comes from us feeling incompetent and worry comes from us not reaching our fullest potential. When you start to accomplish little tasks you set for yourself, naturally, you’re going to feel more proud of yourself and ultimately you’ll gain more confidence. Confidence is built little by little and the bar gets higher every time. First you learn to ride the bike with training wheels, then you gain the confidence to ride on two wheels, then maybe you get so confident you can ride with no hands. Life is a lot like that. You are better than the standard you hold yourself to. It may be harsh but don’t be so easy on yourself. You are much more capable than you think you are. You are not the person your brain tells you you are when you have low self esteem. It’s time to build the confidence! What a more perfect time than now?

Standards you could hold yourself to everyday.
1. Brush your teeth
2. Take a shower
3. Eat healthy/eat on schedule(not past a certain time)
4. Work out (even if it’s just for 15min)
5. Get out once a day(even just light walk)
6. Limit the time you spend on phone or computer
7. Meditate for 5min
8. Turn off electronics 30min before sleeping
9. Read at least 5 pages of a book
10. Drink plenty of water
11. Stay off of drugs/alcohol 
12. Try to stay off of social media

It doesn’t all have to be at once. Just take it a step at a time. The key is consistency and momentum will take you to where you want to be. Constant growth!"

21M

My girlfriend of 3 months broke up with me 3 months ago. She talked about marriage, children, rings, and future bank accounts. I was dead set on marrying her and I thought things were going very well. She was my only ever girlfriend. She said she needed space out of the blue, then two two weeks later she broke up with me. 

While she needed space, I went crazy. I started checking her location and social media constantly. She started hiding her location (she didn’t know I was checking it). I noticed she followed this guy on Instagram and TikTok that we had both just recently met. Then a friend of hers posted a Snapchat with a guy sitting on her lap in the background. I asked her about it and she said it was her gay roommate, which I believed. One week later she broke up with me. She didn’t really give me any good reasons and said that we could still be friends. I confronted her about the guy who she followed and she said that she hadn’t seen him since we both saw him last in person. 

A month after the breakup that guy posts a picture with her that makes it clear they are dating. 

I texted her a long message with the evidence telling her that this hurts a lot. She denied everything and said that she only started talking to this guy one month after we ended. I texted her that I still care about her and she didn’t reply.

I follow her on social media and she posts pictures with him. And it kills me. For some reason I still don’t hate her and if she texted me today I know that I would be at her apartment in an hour. Every day that she posts a picture, even if it’s not with him, I get anxiety and start thinking about her. If she posts a picture with him it ruins my day. I have not been happy since she dumped me. I thought we were perfect together and she is beautiful. There’s a part of me that thinks we might still end up back together if things end with this guy. 

She was the only girlfriend I have ever had. I’m not good with women. I have social and performance anxiety and I have not made a new friend in several years. I keep my current friends close. I only want a relationship, not a hookup. Friends have told me to download Bumble but the idea of meeting someone new, especially taking them on a date, scares me. I think having a girlfriend would make me happy but I’m too scared to take the initiative, and I can’t imagine that a new girl would be better than my ex. My ex was perfect. 

I sat in front of my computer with the number for campus counseling open and cried. I can’t bring myself to call. I’m avoidant. 

I live in a dorm two hours away from my hometown. I have no friends on campus. If I’m not in classes then I’m in my dorm room alone or with my roommate who has his own friends. My friends back home have girlfriends and I’m very happy for them but it kills me inside. They talk about sex, share sweet messages from their girlfriends with me, and seem very happy. I really wish my dad was still around so I could talk about this situation with him. Friends can only be so helpful. 

I’m studying to be an actuary. I graduate next year and I’m scared of getting a job and starting something new. I’m scared of the interview I’ll have to go through. I guess that is normal. 

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated."

184,I can’t accept failure,"3/4 of my grades are very good (half of them As, half Bs). 1/4 is very bad (one E and one F). All I can see is the bad ones. And I can’t get over them. 

And the worst thing is that it’s both math grades. I should obviously consider paying someone to teach me besides school (I know there’s probably a name for it, but idk the English one) but I really don’t want to. I’m too lazy and also not interested in getting better at maths. I hate it, and it’s no use for me, because I already know the important stuff. I’ll never hae to use what we’re currently doing. 
And now I can’t do the basic tasks we have to do because our teacher thinks we’re all Albert Einsteins and learn fast. I don’t. Not when it comes to mathematics. I remember how I thought I would fail college because of math. Now look at me, after half a year of college. 

Honestly this all is getting out of hand. This was a great week but I’m sitting here, crying while typing this and I can’t even get over it. Told my boyfriend I don’t want to talk, although I didn’t see him all day. I can’t even get myself to turn on the TV or do just anything to make me feel better. A moment ago I just stood in my room and thought about what a useless human being I am. I’d honestly like to breakup with my boyfriend, throw everything that’s on the line to the ground and end my life. I don’t really see the point why I shouldn’t do this. I’m a failure. A waste of resources. Waste of time. And I can’t change this. And I will fail college, so I’m just nothing. Not worth living at all. I’m so done at this moment."
185,"Grad student struggling and seeking support (love, dating, social, etc)","Hello,

For obvious reasons I am not posting this from my usual Reddit account, but I am reaching out for help or encouragement or perspective because I don’t know where else to turn.

I don’t really know where to start, but the other night I had so much suppressed pain and negative emotion bubble up that I entertained suicidal ideas for the first time in years. (I’m not at risk - just an indicator of my mental not being in a good place)

I think a combination of external pressures (Pandemic, career pursuits, etc) and internal suppressed issues (past dating failures, childhood traumas, etc) are slamming me simultaneously &amp; I have no idea how to navigate or cope.

I’m a first year graduate student and have not made many friends in my new home. I moved to the town of the university but we are still primarily a virtual program because of COVID. I found one quality friend In my program but we had a falling out and now I’m in a remote location in a 1BR unit with no one. 

I’m extremely isolated. I go to the gym every day but other than that I’m in my hole alone 24/7. The weather also sucks here so please don’t suggest I go outside lol.

I met a girl on a dating app a couple of months ago and really like her but I put too much pressure on her because I felt isolated and subconsciously tried to cling to more time with her to escape that isolation. After a few weeks of things going great she predictably began to distance. I would have too if I were her.

I am upset that I am not seeing her because I do have genuine feelings for her, but the isolation has pushed it to a point where I cannot stop thinking about her and the pain is excruciating. We’re still in touch and I expect to see her again, but it’s a very one way relationship at this point. My feelings are probably best described as strong infatuation, but the pain has been particularly brutal. Maybe I like her that much or maybe the state of the world magnifies it. Idk.

I am also in the middle of applying for internships. I’ve been rejected by every company I’ve applied to thus far. The “society rejection” simultaneous with me not being able to shake this girl from my mind has me feeling even more inferior and insecure.

My family is generally great and supportive but they’re all dealing with their own shit and even when I reach out with a cry for help the calls quickly turn to a “ok talk to you later” tone which means “I don’t have time for this.”

I have very few truly quality friends &amp; my interaction with them is almost always me reaching out to them. Although I am so grateful for them being there for me, it sucks having no one hit me up because I was on their mind.

I knew going to school in a pandemic would be a massive challenge and I’m glad I took it on.

But - having the success I’ve imagined for years come into clearer focus has only made me more aware of how empty and deprived of genuine love my life is. 

I know the pandemic changes everything but short of eating Xanax on bad nights I have no idea how to cope. I’m so alone. I know people love me but if I were gone, would they really care after the initial shock is gone? Again - I’m not at risk - I have way too much to live for - but feeling that’s how those in my life regard me makes me feel even emptier. 

I’m sorry this is not concise or well organized and all over the place. That’s just where I’m at. Please offer any words of help you may have. 

Thanks for your time and support."

tldr: Creating a “anxiety jar” of activities to do when wife is feeling anxious. Need suggestions!

Hello All!

My wife has struggled with anxiety for most of her life. In the past year she has taken many strides to combat it and I’ve noticed a great improvement! I’m so proud of how much she’s working at it.

But as her husband, I feel useless so many times and honestly find my self getting frustrated because of it. 

One of the things I’ve noticed helps her a lot when feeling anxious is just getting out and about. Recently she was feeling very anxious and she brought it to my attention (HUGE step forward, In the past she would just shut down and now she lets me know!) and I suggested we go to the beach. So we did and she was feeling much better after a while listening to the waves. 

So I’ve been working on an “anxiety jar” (I have a better name for it that is an inside joke) with slips of papers for things to do! So whenever she’s feeling anxious we can grab a slip and do that thing! 

I have a big list of stuff already, some examples below, of things I know my wife would love. But would love more ideas, anything out of the box would be extra appreciated!

Go to beach
Bake
Get cookies
Get milk shakes
Go for a walk
Go for a bike ride

I was 21 and hadn't worked a day in my life.I got a little sister who does well in school gets good grades. I got high hopes from her. My parents didn't really say anything but I knew I had to find and own place and carry my own weight. I know that it's their job to raise me but it's upto a certain point. I do love my Mom and Dad but to be honest, the only reason I left because they were my safety net and now when I'm in a foreign land my safety net is gone which has made a disciplined and responsible man. I feel like I'm getting my life together. I'm eating well, working out and even reading jordan Peterson books. Step by step if we work on making ourselves better people we can surely be in a good place mentally. ❤ 😊

So this brings up my question. Do I have trauma? I've been through some sh*t and have had to do some things that I never thought I would have to do. A friend once showed me she had cut herself the night before at lunch in fifth grade, and the same friend I had to try to talk out of committing suicide on discord while privately chatting with another friend to try and get her help. (Both friends are alive and getting help now) It still affects me and I refuse to let others be upset if I can help it. But I am unsure if that is trauma.

But every few months I get a horrible depression that’s lasts around a month or two and then go back to normal. During this depression, I experience things like loss of hope, general sadness, horrible anxiety, fear of the dark, and an extreme fear of death. It gets really bad, last time I had one of these episodes I became dangerously underweight due to the correlation between the brain and stomach it was too painful to eat. I feel this episode coming back and I don’t want to have to do this. I’m not sure if other high schoolers deal with this and I don’t know what to do.
I thought I could be more specific, in these depressions I often times will scream and cry all day. It’s like I’m detached from reality and can’t think straight. I don’t do drugs or anything, I don’t know what it is."

194,Looking for advice on extreme mood swings,"Hello everyone,
Not sure if this is the right r/, but I am getting desperate. Also posted on r/mentalhacks. 
Obligatory, this is my side account &amp; I am on the mobile (sorry for formatting) and please don’t share my story. And I am aware this may be above r/ paygrade - I WILL be seeking professional help, but I need a coping mechanism to be able to get to that point. 

Recently i have been in a funk of sorts - moping around, no energy - the works. 
Two days ago I had a major anxiety spiral (work related ) and something that can only be described as anxiety attack after months of stress (and ignoring of said stress). It has been building up a while. 
Yesterday night, after some partial (possibly major) fudge up at work I went full on into despair - as a solution my brain kept coming up with suicidal thoughts (very specific, matter of fact solution) and I had it all thought out and visualised as if it was a matter of fact (like a laundry list).  Did not do it, bc I realised it would cause more issues than solve. Ended up thinking that major injury would do as well. Part of me realised that that was still insane, so the next day I was extremely aware of ALL my actions. The day ended up with hysterical break down and admission that I actually do want to live and somewhat of a realisation that nothing is final and things can be changed. 

Today,I woke up sick to my stomach, had a mild fever ( got worried it may be covid- tested negative during lunch, yay). Here comes the kicker. Nothing changed in my situation. Nothing. But half an hour later or so I ended up in a completely different state - energetic, feeling like I could do anything and wanted to do anything. I WANTED to do everything. At once, no middle ground. World is my oyster. I kept talking a lot, had a never ending stream of thought of ideas and wanted to do them all. I did not realise anything was weird until was with my family who saw my depressive spiral. 

I realise something is off. This is not my neutral state, this is not even my usual happy state. Yesterday was not a normal bad state. I blew way over what is usual for me. 

At least that is what I thought. I was told that I am “back to the usual me”. I know I had depression during uni. But I also ran several projects and associations. I worry, that for a while there has been a pattern where I go for a time between “so many things I can do!” and “i want to just lay here and disappear”. Only now it has been switched in between literally in hours and I just did not pay attention to it before. 

I am currently mellowed on wine. This however is not a long term (or short term) solution. My family (who I am in bubble with) does NOT want to interact about mental health. There is no abuse history, my mental health has no reason to be bad (good childhood, education, work, living situation) and mental health is simply topic that they express is nothing but a way people can make things about themselves. So no, talking with my fam is not helpful. 

In two days I will be going back being my own “bubble”. Given what was my state yesterday I am afraid to be alone. Neither the hyper or depressed stage is sustainable- i need advice on how to make it until therapy. Please"

198,Help with depressed/delusional mother/partner,"Having trouble with my sons mother. There is a lot to cover. I am copy and pasting a lot of things from a conversation I have had with someone. Adding things here and there. So I apologize how choppy this is going to be. But all I have is a crappy half broken iPhone six...my wife bought the new iPhone 12. Something we can not afford. She had to finish paying off her new iPhone 11 or 10 or whatever the one before was...she was supposed to give me the old one...so please excuse the format and choppy-ness. There is just so much. 
 

Yes she had some issues before we had our son. She started working on herself, we both did, and she got so much better her entire pregnancy and first few months after or son was born. I had so much hope. I was home for six weeks back in March-April out of work. Every second of it was incredible to have time like that with my son. She slept every single day at least until noon. Sometimes 5pm. And then she would wake up, maybe make something to eat and that was about it. 

When it was time to back to work in May  she just never came back. I went back to work and right into my summer busy season. 12 hour days 5-7 days a week for 6 months minimum 

I would come home from work exhausted working in 125 degree attics (Hvac) and age would “clock out” drink and smoke and be done. Every night I put our son to bed. Every night he wakes up at 2-3am and she rolls over and kicks me out of bed to go get him. Every single night.

Halfway through the summer I had to break down and cry and beg for her to help me. She wouldn’t.

She helps with nothing. When I get upset and frustrated and beg for help she says “look see you’re hysterical! You need help!”

Yes. I needed her help. 

She wouldn’t even make a phone call to ready my debit card numbers to pay a bill. It was “my bill” because my name was on it. She keeps telling me I need to learn to do this things on my own...I felt like a single parent with a lousy baby sitter who sticks around after I get home and screams at me.

I know things are better sometimes when parents separate. But I honestly know that as soon as I leave that is it. She will control the time and the narrative. It will be the beginning of the end of me and my sons relationship. And he will have no one to help him anymore. So I don’t know what to do. I have been journaling. We actually start couples counseling tomorrow morning believe it or not. But she will lie through her teeth. Every horrible thing that she does, she spins it and tells me I’m the one doing it. She will literally do something to me and immediately turn around and scream at me for doing what she just did. I don’t know how much more I can take without losing my mind completely. I don’t know how I can bring myself to leave my son behind. Especially with corona the courts may take a year or two to decide anything. And he will be alone with her until then. 

Thank you for reaching out. Just. Pray for my son. If you believe in that sort of thing. Just for him.

(Asked if she is on meds? Doing therapy?)
No. And no. No. We are both on methadone since we found out she was pregnant...please don’t judge...im coming up on two years sober  this April. I will two years of documented clean drug tests. I have the maximum allowed dose take homes. She has failed tests. She has no take homes and needs to go to the clinic every morning to dose. During a pandemic where they’ve been hanging out take homes to anyone they think can handle the responsibility. They took hers away. But she accuses me of using still. And says she only goes to keep an eye on me and that she never needed it. She claims she helps her counselor with her problems more than the counselor helps her.

She tells me everything is 100% my fault and why should she go to any more therapy or be on meds when I’m the one who needs help. 

I can admit that I might need some help sure. But she refuses to believe she might need any help. 

I could go on for days. I have hard physical proof of her gas lighting. But even when I show her that I have proof, she’ll make some excuse that I’ve learned photoshop and doctored the images or altered our bank statements or you name it. 

I am so scared for my son

How do you deal with someone with their head stuck this far in the sand? Her mother was the same way. Grew up without her father. Her mother abused her. And now she abuses me. And is starting to abuse and neglect our son (psychologically so hard to prove) 






She already uses him to punish me. I may get home by 7 and have an hour or two to play. But if she’s angry...7 is that days new bed time. And she will fight and struggle with a screaming squirming baby for three hours until he wears himself out and falls asleep just so i can’t play with him. And the accuses me of neglecting him and never making time for him.

Last week I worked 13 hour shifts 6 days Monday through Saturday and about three hours on Sunday. I took pictures in the morning and then again when I got home of dozens and dozens of toys. Every toy box. None of them moved all week not one inch. I came home every night and he strapped down in front of the tv. He screams bloody murder while I shower until I unstrap him"
199,Is there a term for when you’re in distress and need help but as soon as you’re getting help you feel completely fine?,"I’ve been trying to google this but I’m not getting any relevant results. This keeps happening to me and it makes me feel like I’m faking. I’ll cry all week and feel a tremendous amount of pressure, but as soon as i’m talking to my doctor all I can say is “I’m fine” and in that moment it’s not a lie."
200,Not sleeping or sleeping late on purpose!,"So i have been doing this for like a couple of weeks now either i don't sleep at all or i just sleep really late even though I'm really tired just because I don't want tomorrow to come. I'm always trying to escape tomorrow, i feel like time is moving too fast and I'm afraid of anything that could happen in the next day like if i get bad news about a loved one, anything bad that can happen or responsibilities like if i have an assignment i should finish or an exam is coming etc. and I'm not ready in any kind of way i just don't sleep because in the middle of the night nobody can want anything from you everybody just expects you to sleep and only at those late hours i can feel like i have no responsibilities and even though i should make myself feel more peaceful i actually feel worse because i know I'm wasting my energy for something i can't even control i just try to slow time as much as possible i have come to the point where I'm afraid of sleeping afraid of time passing or anything that could happen when i wake up in the morning. I don't know what should i do since getting out of these kind of problems can be difficult especially if you got used to it but i guess i have to find a way... 

Thanks for reading this by the way i really appreciate it :)"
201,Filling Your Cup (95),"It starts with the moment you wake up. It starts with your first movements out of bed. Do you say thank you for today? For being allowed to wake up? or do you reach fo your phone and check social media notifications? I suggest saying thank you for allowing to be alive for a new day. Without that, there is no checking social media.

Do you read? Do you get right to focusing on your passions/craft/work/tasks? Do you stretch? Do you meditate? Do you make coffee? 

Something I have learned and constantly am trying to practice is putting myself first before others to make sure that I am starting my day right for me, instead of others. Then once I feel that I have the spiritual, mental, emotional capability, I tap into the world. This has no length of direct time, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour ? etc., its up to you and how you feel, but its necessary before getting your day started.

Listening. Listening to music is something that helps me really ease into my day, soft piano pieces, lofi hip hop, to really feel the emotions of how I am feeling right now. 

**Today:** Do what you love to do today. Try something new that you have been wanting to focus on today. Message someone you haven't spoken to in a while and say hi, they may really need it right now.

**I love you.**

202,Emotional support human,"Emotional support human

Basically, my college isn’t allowing visitors in our dorms at all. The problem is me and my girlfriend came to college together and we live in the same residence hall just a few doors down from each other. I understand that the university doesn’t know that we spend every waking moment together and she really does support me emotionally as i have very bad anxiety( medically diagnosed). So if they asked her to leave my room or vise verse and they threatened disciplinary action on either me or her, would i have any solid ground to stand on? Could i explain to them that I really do need her around me to function or would they not believe me? Not trying to finesse the system, I just want to look out for my mental health as it is deteriorating and my girlfriend helps me a lot! 

TL;DR 
is there any justification for breaking campus visitation rules for mental health needs?"
203,I'm curious... How do you get an emotional support animal?,I personally couldn't at this time but I just am really curious. If you know please let me know &lt;3
204,I've been waiting years for help,"My mental health is getting worse everday and I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been really sad and terrified of talking to people my whole life, I never really had any friends until a few years ago. So I went to the doctors because I was just scared of everything, depressed, really ashamed of my body and had a lot of intrusive thoughts. And they put me on the CAMHS (because I'm under 16) 'waiting list' but nothing really happened, my family said that I may be autistic so I brought it up to the doctor after countless visits and was eventually diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and they gave me a few months of therapy. The therapy didn't help, if anything it made it worse because it made me realise how terrible I am at talking to people. So yeah, but I've been on the CAMHS waiting list for the past 5 years, which is one third of my life, and I've just lost hope. Plus with all this coronavirus stuff, the NHS has, in the words of my GP 'stopped helping people and only care about those with the virus' so that has just slowed it down even more. So yes, I really don't know what to do anymore, I really need help, I'm just so scared of everything. I know autism probably means that I'll have other conditions too as autistic people tend to have about 3-4 mental health conditions alongside autism. So why aren't they helping me? I just need help so bad :'("
205,"Friend refuses to seek help, what do I do?","Basically i've known this guy for a long while over the internet, and he clearly has depression and other problems. The big problem is he refuses to let these problems. He doesnt go to group therapy sessions or anything like that, and i've offered to help him with venting and such but he refuses. I really wanna make sure he gets better. What do I do?"

207,Is it normal to think of suicide every time my spouse is mad at me?,Whenever my spouse is mad/upset at me my thoughts always go to suicide..  just wondering if this is something others experience?
208,Man this boulder in my gut is starting to get annoying.,"It's a gut feeling, my mind can easily tell me nah, I have a big house, great friends, a supporting family et cetera, but no matter what I do I have this big heavy ball in my stomach which doesn't go away and makes me feel so negative about everything. I've tried breathing and mental exercises, methamphetamine-based medicine, everything.

If it's about tricking my mind I'm all for that, it's just annoying at this point."
209,Not sure what's going on.,"Im not sure if this is the place to post but here it goes.

I am so unbelievably unhappy it's crazy, I've never been this unhappy in my life I've lost all passion for my job I have no effort to put in I'm on the verge of being fired and I wouldnt even care. When I'm home I just lay on my couch or bed and dont move just thinking how much happier I'd be if I didn't exist.
  I can barely make myself eat I just dont want too untill the point where I'm unbearably hungry. I've stopped exercising I dont enjoy any of my hobbies, if I'm not at work i just lay there with background noise on and stare at my phone untill I fall asleep or decide I should go to bed.
I dont think its cause of the pandemic I was doing great at the start of it, still working and exercising I was doing everything I loved an was happy. But since October-November everything has just been spiraling down I cant get my head straight. I've had things like this happen before but never this bad or for this long. I have no idea what's happening or how to get back to being myself.."
210,I daydream to the point I need I cant feel this world anymore,"I just vented on this sub a while back but here we go again.

All my life I've daydreamed, I relied on fiction to bring me out of the real world for a while. At first, this was healthy I guess, I don't know I was like 4. I'm like 98% sure that others do this but I've created my own life, as I said before, it started off reasonably healthy when I was like 4, I would just create a shallow character and place them into the anime I was watching or the T.V show I was some what invested in before I went to sleep: these little stories were often filled with tragedy, I'm not sure why, but they always have and still are . Now my daydreams are very in-depth and detailed- I've got my own character who portrays me I guess, with their own name, age, appearance, skills, and personality ever so slightly based of myself. We'll call this person ABC just because I'm not comfortable sharing this information as its really important to me and I can't think of a name to call them in this post. I've slotted ABC into an anime I watch- its not my favourite anime but I'm somewhat in love with a group of characters in the show. 

ABC has their own story line, complex psychology and follows several different stories depending on how I'm feeling. They're an OC but more. But along with ABC, I have an entire cast of characters, there's at least 17 different characters, which show up regularly, not all of them have names but they all have personality's, back stories and somewhat in depth relationships with ABC. ABC has complex and detailed relationships with all existing characters, taking their personalities, head cannons,  goals and even there relationships with other characters into consideration. 

The thing is I find myself drifting off into my own world in the middle of the day, in lesson, just chilling. I feel closer to ABC then I do myself. This world doesn't feel real and I can't see myself in it. It feels like I'm looking through a pane of steamed up glass, or rather the way steamed up glass looks is the way my head feels. Sometimes, it hits me that this is all real, that what I do matters, that I will meet new people, that I might get married, I might have kids, I will die someday and its like suddenly the glass is crystal clear and so is my head but still, it all feels fake. It's not that I've convinced myself that this is a dream but more that I honestly can't see myself anywhere in this world. 

I don't feel like I belong anywhere, like I don't want to be here, but I don't want to be anywhere here, I long to be ABC, and spend time and be friends with the characters ABC is and I know I'm only practically in love with the idea of spending time with them is because they don't exist and even though they do have their own flaws, I don't have to put up with that in real life- a couple of the characters I know would be unbearable in real life but they're not here and I can react to how they act however I want because I'm in my own head

I know other people have their own second lives in their heads but they seem so present in this one, and I just feel separate. Is this a normal thing- I have no idea. But I just needed to get this out there. 

Thank you any kind stranger who takes the time to read this :)"
211,How do I cope with anxiety when I currently have no access to professional help?,"I just started seeing a psychiatrist right before they enforced the quarantine even more in my country. I'm unable to meet my psychiatrist physically, but my mom suggested me to contact her via online. I know it's bad, but I just can't bring myself to do that. I hardly spoke to her when I met her face-to-face and I felt really uncomfortable. I know that she's there to help, that's her job, but I'm just afraid which is silly. I haven't been fully diagnosed yet, but I am pretty sure it's some form of anxiety. My anxiousness is constant and it's been really detrimental to my sleep. I've been getting insomnia a lot lately and I really just want to sleep properly. I ran out of antidepressants so I really need to find another way to calm down. Is there anything I can do to at least relieve the tension to the point where I can sleep well?"
212,What is it called when you do something weird after having suicidal thoughts or panic attacks?,Today I was having suicidal intrusive thoughts while going for a walk and had to talk myself out of getting run over by passing cars. Afterwards I ate snacks by my bathroom sink and showered in my socks to feel something else. Ive done this before so i asked my friend if she does that and she does so i wanted to know if theres a name for that.
213,I’ve struggled with poor mental health for over half of my life. How do I keep from letting it define who I am?,"As a young person in their early 20s, I can’t help but feel like I *am* my depression and my anxiety. They’ve been with me for as long as I can remember. Although I’ve been in therapy for a few years and my mental health became a lot better fall 2019, it took a deep nosedive after March 2020... everyone has a myriad of reasons and ways the pandemic has affected them so I won’t take up more space with my own. 

I feel like I’ll end up being and dying alone. 
I feel like withdrawing even more. 
The future looks so fucking pessimistic and bleak. The worst case scenarios for situations seem more and more likely to happen every day. 

And I don’t think anybody in my life cares. When I see those quotes “Remember you are loved” - yea, by who? I can’t name anybody and other people sure as hell can’t. It just reminds me more how broken I am."
214,Determining my value on the basis of potential opinions of other people,"I have felt really down for some time now because im underweight and im a F27 virgin with trust issues.  I feel bad cuz i dont think guys could find me attractive when i get naked. I feel bad when i think of ever telling a guy im a virgin, cuz he could be mean about it. I overthink of these potential bad scenarios and i sabotage myself and run away when sb shows interest in me. 
I would try to gain weight, exercise, but eventually just get kinda depressed and give it all up. I envy confident ppl so much.
The only time when i feel awesome is when i da dream of being handsome and confident."
215,I’m finally starting therapy next week and I’m nervous,It’s time for me to stop running from my emotions and into the arms of drugs. For far too long I’ve used drugs to numb the pain but now I’m going to address and defeat the pain instead. I’m afraid to truly unpack what goes on in my head but I know it needs to be done. Hopefully I stay sober for good this time. Wish me luck guys
216,My Biggest Fear,"Im terrified of wasting my best years, never experiencing the things that most people do in their teens and 20s, never having a friend group, never flirt with a girl, never go to a party, never hang out at a friends house, never go on a vacation where i am not on my own or my parents, never have a love story, the list goes on.

The worst thing about this, is that unlike the fear of a shark attack, falling, flying on a plane or whatever the most common fear is, this is not something i can avoid or escape from, the passing of time is unavoidable, every minute that passes is a minute where i'm missing out on doing the things i really want to do.

I'm already 21 and i already missed out on so many important experiences, i feel like in a blink of an eye i will be 30 and all i will have from my past will be regrets."
217,I can’t keep track of the little simple things and it’s leading me to think my wife sees me as a disappointment.,"Hi all, not really sure what to do with this since it’s my first time here but I’ve been having serious trouble, well now as long as I can remember, with remembering simple things. This stems from the fact my wife’s birthday is approaching and she had asked me for a specific item. In the past I’ve been more often than not awful with figuring out gifts for her or anybody else really, and even this time when she explicitly told me “I would like this item” rather than me guessing, I just didn’t recall it pretty much at all. I have issues remembering details in conversations, like when appointments are, what needs to be done a certain day, and more. My work stuff for the most part is not an issue, it is just stuff in my normal every day life that are slipping up in my mind. I’ve realized this was an issue and I’ve tried harder and harder to be better about this, legit I have, but I can’t seem to  get my head straight with this. I feel like I’m a let down to my wife, I feel like a let down to myself, and I just need someone to help me figure out what the hell is wrong with my brain. Any sort of info helps or just ways to help myself out. I don’t want to let her down anymore..."

220,Should I change my therapist?,"Hi, im a black 20f junior in college. For the 2nd half of 2020, since I turned 20, I have been almost obsessing over the fact that I am still a virgin. I’m very shy so its hard for me too meet people, especially men.

Recently I’ve decided to stop obsessing over that so much cause of the unhappiness that resulted from it. I told my therapist about that today but I also mentioned my lack of good friends. After my session I basically concluded that I have no friends and I don’t have a single good or meaningful relationship, my family included.

I want to focus on myself and develop myself more as a person but I don’t wanna spend too much time so that when I finally do “find myself” I’ll be too old.

After the session I kinda felt a bit discouraged. I know that she is telling me this because it may be good for me in the end but I just really wanna have a good friend group and a boyfriend.

For this reason I’ve been thinking that maybe switching my therapist will be good for me. 

Thanks for reading"
221,Exhaustion,"I have not been able to sleep well for 6 weeks now. Hot flashes and pulsating heartbeats made me feel even more tired every morning. Bad dreams come and go, it started when the whole pandemic started but is getting more frequent now. Plus recently I barely have any appetite but I still make sure to eat a proper heavy meal once a day. I also experience sone migraines and chest pain. I've been under a lot of stress mentally, physically and financially. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what should I do?"
222,Bpd rage!!!!!!aaaaghh,"Yea it might seem primitive yet I’m raging!! I’m raging over the fact that I was ignored by message. We kept ghosting each other yet somehow found the way back to each other. So now he messages me, gets what he wants and when I try to make a convo he reads the message and then ignores me. On my fucking birthday!!!!!! How fucking dare he??? I’ve been nothing but nice!! It makes me angry to the point of screaming. I want to inflict the most intense pain on him and fuck physical pain I want him to suffer mentally. I want to wipe his ego and make him feel so small and worthless!!!! And yea it’s so irrational but this aggression and evil thoughts within me, make me feel empowered and I’ve been nothing but nice!! being wise and taking the high way leaves me feeling empty and victimised. Fuck being wise and nice some pricks will never learn untill u teach them !! I know it’s best for me to let me emotions cool and get rid of that cunt but all I wanna do is pay him a lesson because I’m not the one to fuck around with . Yet my healthy voice telling me to chill, it’s so not worth it. Almost like bringing him down will heighten my dignity .. ugh what shall I do?"
223,Never had Social anxiety??,"I'm literally sitting in my car after this just happened.

My boyfriend is a bartender and got called in tonight when we had plans to hang out. We resolved to go hang out after he got off but in the meantime he texts me to come sit at the bar until he gets off.

I just went in there and there's a billion people. Like line out the door and a 45 minute wait. The bar is full for what little seating they have rn due to covid.

I went in and told him I'd come back later after the rush claimed down a bit and he said okay and I walked out. He calls me back and asks if I want to sit next to his coworker who's an older woman (like late 30s and I'm 26) who I've talked with before in one occasion I wouldn't even recognize her outside of the restaurant he works at. I said sure, and came back in and realize I don't remember what she looks like we'll enough, and he walks up to the woman who's sitting at a table of like 5 people including her and I just stop, deer in headlights like.

Suddenly I feel this crippling anxiety and briefly made eye contact with my bf before turning and running to the bathroom. I've had panic attacks before. I know what anxiety feels like I don't know why all the sudden I felt it in that moment. Why suddenly I'm terrified to interact with these random people and the one woman who I sorta know. I text my bf that I'm leaving and I'll come back later but now I'm freaking out like how can I even come back?

I've never experienced social anxiety before, I've always been pretty social, I'm not the most talkative but I'm not afraid of being around strangers. I walked in that bathroom and nearly cried, like why? Why am I crying over absolutely nothing? Why am I freaking out?"
224,Will i ever get better?,"I have been diagnosed with bpd, adhd, psychosis, general anxiety disorder, and depression. I have been in the process of trying to find the right medication and therapist for 6 years now, but still nothing is helping. I feel like i'm in an endless, pointless cycle of trying to get better. Every step i take forward is always another two steps back, and i genuinely don't know what to do anymore, i don't even know how much longer i'll be willing to live at this point. Has anybody gone through this and actually gotten better? I feel like 6 years is a point in where i should just give up.."
225,I think something's wrong with me.,"Before I start, this is the first time I've ever tried to put all of my thoughts into words. I'm not good with explaining things like this, so my apologies.

I usually only feel one thing, constantly. I get short bursts of excitement and anxiety, but otherwise, nothing. I can't describe this emotion and I have nothing to compare it to. I've learned to just copy what other people will say and do, but this leads to me taking on other people's personalities. I lie on a daily basis, whether it be small, innocent lies, or my identity. I have people who consider themselves my girlfriend and best friends but don't know my real first name. Problem is that I don't think I'll ever tell them. One day, I'll just get bored of them and never talk to them again without warning. I've done it for short periods of time before, (months, sometimes just weeks), yet I always come back for the thrill of reading their reactions. I hate talking to them again, realizing the restrictions are back on me, but I know I can't do it multiple times within a few months without them not replying anymore.

It honestly feels like I've been blocked out from my thoughts. I can't remember anything, even major events that directly effect me. My inner voice is silent most of the time, but when I do hear it, it's either like hearing people talking in the next room or someone, sometimes multiple someones, are laughing at/berating me. I can't do anything anymore without zoning out at least once which of course makes me miss what's going on around me. I can't talk to people, eat, hell- writing this is a struggle. Nothing keeps my focus, though, and when it seemingly does, I get lost in what I'm doing for hours on end without being able to remember what I was doing afterwards.

Sometimes I feel so empty that the ringing in my ears get loud enough to cause a headache. These headaches aren't good for the detachment I feel from my body. Objects don't look like they belong anymore. As if they were in layers of reality, and I could see the contrast between them. Real life doesn't feel real. It's like living in a VR headset, forever trapped in exhausting pain, struggling to move because everything feels so heavy but non existent at the same time.

It's so pathetic, I can't tell anyone that I don't think this is normal. Everytime I go see someone, I say I'm fine, because I might as well be fine if I can act like everyone else. I can't tell family, because for reasons I won't disclose, fuck them. Why would I bother telling my so-called friends and girlfriend? It won't matter in the long run. The only people I can tell are strangers online with an account I'll never use again. At least I got this out, so I can go back to normal.

Thank you to anyone who reads this, I suppose."
226,I don't feel like I fit in anywhere,"My tastes in things are different from others. For example, I love the anime Sailor Moon Crystal over the 90's version. Here's the thing, most fans prefer the 90's version. I love classic novel and jazz which most people find boring. I'm a Polytheistic Pantheist, a religious point of view that fell out of favor what two-thousand years ago? Even my politics gravitate towards monarchy and a return to more tribal-kinship based ways of life. My ideas are so different I just don't feel like I fit in with others."
227,rap about stress and depression and anxiety and OCD.,"Been real tired lately 

Energy?

barely have any.

But all of this stress and my problems there’s plenty 

not that much money

And this excess anxiety…
It’s fucking crummy.

It isn’t funny

Things I regret, yeah I sometimes feel like a dummy

Sometimes I feel like a reject, and I have been depressed. and yeah that is not lazy, but that is a damn fact. 

And drugs I might need, and wine I might need a damn vat.

but my heads full of stress and my minds full of damn crap.

Minds on a trip, and I feel like my minds in a damn trap

Minds feelin’ ill and I might need a damn nap

I might need some pills for my ills, yeah I might need some new drugs for these hills so I can run this damn lap 

For my pain, my mind might need a Cain, Im not lazy, and I’m not insane. 

Might need some weed, yeah I might need some cash 
Might need some sleep, so I might need to crash, on top a bed, that is no cap. 

This is no song it’s suppose to be rap.


And I wash my hands so damn much, that sometimes my hands bled 

Sometimes they would get so painful
But I kept washing them, and put cream on so the pain became more Dull 

we are all flesh and that means we are all mortal.

I’m depressed so I might talk slow and walk as slow as a turtle."
228,getting feelings for a girl and its making me think less of myself,"So I started a new job as a Christmas temp at one of my local stores and there is another Christmas temp who I thought was cool at first and the more I talked to her the more I realized we pretty much have the exact same hobbies, listen to the same music and bands and I cant speak for her but for me at least I love every second I spent with her, I remember there was one day we were on a break together and it was dark outside so we took a walk around our town centre and it was lit up it was beautiful and I admit I only felt a little spark of happiness but that's more than I have felt in a long time and no one else has made me feel that way. We are in a national lockdown now but we are texting each other and I feel we are getting closer and closer but the closer we get the more I feel less worthy and not good enough for her, even though I make her laugh but its gotten to the point where this is constantly on my mind and I don't know what to do, like I just want to go for walks, play games, listen to music, and travel with her but it I just feel like I'm not worthy and the thought is making it harder to make our friendship stronger, the thought of not being good enough is just getting me down and then when it comes to talking to friends I'm just constantly low and just cant think of anything to say so its affecting my other relationships too like I tried to manage it at first but its getting unhealthy at this point. I don't want to let her go I want to at least give it a shot in getting to know her better and asking her out but I want to know how I can manage it currently so it doesn't get me down."

230,just had an episode with my family,"not too long ago had an episode with my family about something simple as washing the dishes. 

the issue didn’t really escalate until feedback from how they felt was said and I couldn’t respect it. it showed a sign of disrespect and it quickly became a problem. I don’t know why my sister felt the need to keep egging me on when it’s just words at the end of the day.  

im already stressed out about a lot of things but most importantly my health. the simplest thing like GERD is making my stress level go up and making me paranoid about the littlest things. 

like literally everytime I feel some type of way I go on google and look up what it might be and then start to panic and it’s doing me more harm then good. 

like even at work my mind is all over the place but it doesn’t effect my work it just my body feels empty as if im hallow and my spirit is gone. feels weird but i want to get back to when i was energetic and full of life."

Know that I want to drip myself in cloaks of clotted blood and razors
And when I am numb
That I want to hang by the twine a bird carries around their talons

When I’m lonely
Know that I want to die every second
And know that as much as I love you
That you can’t drag my feelings back from hell

When I’m sober
Know I want to cry every second because I love you
And I hate so much to do this
That I will put it off

When I’m with you
Know that I’m the happiest I’ve ever been
And I love you so much
That I have to tell you over again

When I kill myself
Know to love me still
And find another 
That you can love

In death
In death
Memento Mori"
232,I'm not sure if this is a mental health thing or not but,"I tried googling this but couldn't find any results, does anyone else when they watch a film/tv show/ read a book/play a video game, experience the media as if its your own version or concept for a media. I seem to do it with everything and its really frustrating cos Im always experiencing media in my mind as if its part of some story im writing. I'm curious as to what the name of this phenomen is or if anyone else experiences this."
233,I feel like a bird in a cage,"I've been working with different healthcare professionals since April 2020 to work on my mental health. 9 trying months later I'm doing a lot better, but currently I'm facing challenges that at least resemble ADD/ADHD-PI. I'm going to be working with my psychiatrist to see what we can do to address these challenges, but I feel distraught just thinking that it could take weeks to months of trial and error to modify my treatment plan to allow me to be more functional. My mood on average is 5/10, my anxiety is manageable, my OCD is manageable, but I'm still struggling. My mind is excessively novelty seeking, and I'm struggling with executive functioning. I know I have a lot of potential but it feels like I'm a bird in cage, and the only thing that can set me free is an effective treatment plan."
234,Issues with communication,"I genuinely don't enjoy conversations with more than two people and talking about myself in general, most of the time I zone out after a while and get really tired. Because I think this is kind of disrespectfull I try to keep up with the conversation, but instead of listening I tend to say stupid things I didn't really think about, just to say something, so there are a lot of people that think I'm dumb."
235,My brother been acting strangely,Hey guys I have a question my brother started acting strange lately and I don’t really know what to do. So he’s spending countless hours watching streamers on his phone and idk if they can hear him when he responds to them. There’s that but then there are times where I think he creates a story or something in his head and he’s arguing talking shit to these ppl. He says a lot but says nothing if you get what that means. You can’t talk to him without him feeling attack I’m not sure is he’s sleeping a lot or any for that matter. I don’t know what to do and my parents are the ones who are hella worried about him. Anything helps thanks
236,I'm losing hope,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this not sure if it'll do any good. I feel a constant need for improvement to better myself. I don't feel welcome or happy in my skin. I try everyday to workout to be healthy to grow confidence and be happy.

I don't see a future whare I'm happy I feel like my happy days are gone and the best I can hope for is to just not feel bad or depressed. 

I'm 23 almost 24 I haven't achieved anything in life I know who I want to be but I cant see myself getting there. I hate feeling like in I'm a constant state of being not good enough. I'm not good looking enough im not funny im a bad person no one likes me im ugly and I've done nothing with my life. 

Those thoughts come and go but I cant ever escape them I cant ever feel like im good enough. Not sure what I should do. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far have a good night and sorry for my lack of good grammar."
237,I give so much for so little in return....,"I've been sick (just a cold) for the last two days and it's been getting worse. I still have to go on because I'm a parent and I have kids to take care of, who are also sick. My husband isn't sick, because he had this last week. When he was sick I took care of everything. Now that I'm sick though?

I just told him, ""why aren't you helping me? I shouldn't have to ask."" Which is true. I've been so worn down that I haven't been cleaning much at all. Two weeks ago he got mad at me and began saying things like ""You're *always* depressed. I don't feel anything between us anymore. I feel like you don't care anymore."" 

But....I've been trying....so...much...so often without anything from him....so yes, I stopped. And he finally noticed and suddenly I'm the bad guy. And I've been trying to get back to that point where he's at least happy and not upset with me (because I'm deeply traumatized and that's all I know how to do...) but I was at a breaking point today and began to just cry. He asked what was wrong, so I told him. 

Now he's pushing me away. This is my problem. Every time I try to get him to talk to me he pushes me away. If I get upset with him, he pushes me away. He never wants to actually talk. He just wants it to be over. 

And now I'm spiraling and so confused. Does he want to work on it or not? I'll ask abd he'll say yes, but his actions say no. I'm at my breaking point. I'm now feeling suicidal and I'm writing this to keep myself from self harming because I feel so lost. I feel unloved and abandoned..."
238,Weight gain psych meds,"Does anyone think that its an excuse that psychiatric medicines cause weight gain?

Like I dont know, for so long I've thought it was my meds causing weight gain. But I've been eating really healthy and finally the kilos are coming off. 

Its been incredibly hard but I wonder if they actually do make it harder."
239,Never Let your Mental Health Stop you from Life," 

Sandra Jean Smith born June 19, 1950, has left us with morning &amp; sadness however lightened by the past month she spent in her Daughter &amp; Granddaughter’s home, reviewing her life in peace and with gratitude under hospice care provided by Care Dimensions. As a child, she attended school in Medford, Mass. until her family moved to Somerville. The family moved into a triple-decker on Highland ave for several years before her parents Alton G. Smith and Theresa purchased a two-family home with the GI bill on Cedar street in 1967. The family lived on the second-floor Sandy and her four siblings Bobby, Eddie, Al and Karen all squeezed into a few bedrooms and one bathroom. Motivated by such a situation, as a young woman, she found her way out and married at the young age of 18. The marriage lasted a short time, after a miscarriage and a conflict with her desire to explore her passion for a singing career.

Sandra was an A student all through elementary and Jr High. In Jr High and High school Sandy was recognized for her beautiful singing voice. She led many school choir performances, as well as singing at the High School dances in the Somerville High Gym. After high school the rock n roll world of the late '60s and '70s was dominated by men, However, Sandy organized and became a leader of several bands. She sang in the style of Grace Slick and Janis Joplin (even though she did not like Janis Joplin)

During that time she also worked at Kennedy Butter and Eggs in Somerville. Like so many independent young people she had many jobs. As her free-spirited self, she picked up and left for NYC, where she landed a gig as the lead singer in the national touring show of HAIR. In Iowa at the conclusion of the national tour, there was a breakup cast party in which Sandy was celebrating and unknowingly was given, which in those years was common to celebrate with psychedelic drugs (LSD). Sandy had a bad reaction and her father had to fly out to bring her home. Sandy struggled with mental illness from this point forward and that ended a hopeful career of a successful professional singer in the music industry. After a few years, she recovered and met Charlie Casey and had a daughter, whom they named Darla Casey-Smith her only child, but she had parents who supported her and Darla. Unable to raise her daughter at age 6 her parents helped take on the responsibility but she was always involved with the family.

Sandy had found balance during the 1990s and was working as a cashier at Johnny Foodmaster when a criminal stole her identity. Due to the failure of the courts to update their records, she was falsely arrested at her home for a crime a woman posing as her committed. Handcuffed and disrespected as she tried to get the papers that were inside her home, the police took her to jail. Her court-appointed lawyer called a brother and told him, ""We know there was a mix-up and that your sister is innocent. The best way to deal with this is for her to plead guilty and the judge will drop the charges”. Sandy and her brother refused such an outrageous solution. We hired a lawyer and eventually, in court, she was exonerated. This horrible event that lasted months set Sandy back and after a short stay at McClean Hospital she was free, but the scars of that experience caused her harm to the point that she never could work again. One good thing came out of her false arrest. Senator Pat Jehlen of Somerville was informed of her case and wrote the first law in Massachusetts that dealt with the new and rising crime of identity theft.

Living at senior housing on Warren Ave outside of Union Square for many years, Sandy enjoyed visiting and advocating at Ruby Rogers Center in Union Sq.

In 2003 her granddaughter Emma Rose was born, this lit up her life and Sandy would take care of her while her daughter would work a few days a week. Her granddaughter and her had a bond immediately. Emma’s first laugh was from Sandy’s interactions. Emma learned all about makeup and dressing to the T from her grandmother. As Sandy got into her later years, her mental illness reemerged and made it very difficult for her to maintain her own personal housing. She found a sense of community in living at the Linderman shelter in Boston. Here at the shelter, she met many young adults who were experiencing what she had experienced in her 20’s and she was able to counsel and give hope to these young adults. She found happiness in this but also enjoyed her freedom and independence even though it was in a dangerous setting for an older woman. Her family worried constantly about her living there, tried to convince her to get into housing, but she made this choice and her choice was freedom over security.

Last year Sandy had many MGH hospital visits because of her physical illness. She and her family were always treated with respect and we were amazed at the unprejudiced care a homeless person would receive there. A year ago Darla was informed that Sandy had serious health problems that at any time could end her life, but every time she came out of MGH her spirit was so strong it was hard to see the threat. That was until the last time when hospice care was offered and we knew this time was different.

Mid-December of 2020 a few days before an impending snowstorm, her daughter Darla once again asked if she would like to stay over and she agreed. This time she found herself living in a townhouse with her Daughter working full time at home, a 17year old Granddaughter Emma in a virtual school, three rescue chihuahua/mixed dogs, four fish, and her brother Al who would visit daily. Good food, Music, Laughter, Jokes, Cigarettes, Sweets, and every request fulfilled Sandy's humor and spirit blossomed. Sandy was very aware of her situation but she shined every day. Sandy was so grateful for the loving care, peacefulness, and the time to celebrate the holidays with her family. What was to be a short respite at her daughter’s home turned into 26 days of reconnection.

We can keep these memories alive and be thankful that her passing was peaceful. Sandy's love and fight to maintain her freedom will continue to inspire us. With love honor respect and dignity we embrace Sandy's spirit as it lives on through us all. We leave you with Sandys final written thoughts unlike her usual strong verbal declarations: A huge blizzard blew me into Darla’s doorway millions of snowflakes pounding on my wings to bring me into this warm cozy kitchen where I have my place!"
240,"What are your experiences with mental health specialists like psychiatists, psychologists, therapists and such? Do you think they do enough?","I am asking this because I have always had very bad experiences with these so called specialists. I wanna known if it's just me or this is pretty much common, because from what I know, this is very common in my underdeveloped ass country (Slovakia in Europe). 

You can skip my story if you want and just go to comments if there will be any. I also hope reddit won't screw my formatting of paragraphs. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - 

My story: 

I was forced to be visiting 3 psychologists during elementary and high school (we don't have middle school in my country), because I was bullied and apparently misbehaved a lot (3 because each time one got pregnant they migrated me over to another one lul).  All three of them literally just discussed events that happened at school and home and were mostly just a punching bag for my venting, so no effect on me here. My mom later thought that maybe I have some mental illness, so she took me to the psychiatrist to figure out something, but all that doctor did was just criticize me and prescribe me medication that caused very weird side effects which would make this post NSFW, while also doing nothing with my misbehaving. 

This was probably just a very bad decision from my parents and teachers at school. Understandable, they didn't know what to do with me because of lack of knowledge or not good problem solving. I forgive them. However the following text is what haunts me till this day. 

When at uni, I hung out with classmates who I called my friends. Because of me being delusional, they damaged me so much I fell into severe depression. My mom later called an ambulance and I was forced to stay at hospital for 2 weeks with patients who has much more serious mentall illnesses than what I was experiencing. Also I sprained my ankle due to complete accident that I literally just stepped wrong on my foot and my ankle went bonkers. I was crying on a bed and they refused to take me to physician because apparently they deal with many hypochondriac patients (like I could somehow just lie with having swollen purple foot). They believed me in the end but I spent hours of shivering in pain. Doctors were just listening to me like I was another #WXYZ patient, gave me pills so I don't complain and just made me believe that all that foggy experience is actually good because I am no longer depressed. Food there was terrible, I gained like 5kg in those 2 weeks making my self-esteem even worse. There were people smoking everywhere inside and I know it's unbelievable, but THERE WERE PATIENTS ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN A HOSPITAL. After I got released, I recieved no help from my uni professors and got no signed paper that I was at hospital unable to study, which eventually caused me to fail uni and all my years spent there from state dotation went out of the window. Now I am struggling to find a job and cannot pay for another shot of uni. 

I found a local psychiatrist in my town who just kept prescribing me escitalophram, which caused me side effects like headaches, worse vision and inability to climax and later prescribed me some other medication which literally just made my all emotional senses numb, so I couldn't even be happy, sad, angry or scared. I also found a ""therapist"" who instead of helping me wanted to employ me at his office, so I could help him with his databases and documents. While I was happy I got some part time job, he completly forgot about me being his patient. I told him one day that I came to him for getting helped, not looking for job. I told him that I sometimes I have trouble understanding what people say and he just brushed it off with ""yea, just go get your ears checked, I cannot help you with that"". So I re-explained to him that I don't have hearing problem, that I also don't understand when it's written, that I cannot connect meanings of words together, like it's some cognitive disability and it makes me super frustrated and anxious especially when among people I don't know. He repeated ""go get your ears checked and get prescribed stronger pills, I don't treat this."" 

I no longer trust doctors and our healthcare systen after these experiences. 

- - - - - *End of the story* - - - - - 

If you actually managed to read through my rant, I officially declare you have some super power. 

And now I'm asking: How did this help me? I was forced to stay at hospital which was in terrible shape and it literally ruined my future and my mental problems have not been adressed till this day. I got beaten for getting beaten. 

I don't want other people to suffer like I did, this is absolutely not fair at all. Yes, I am that crybaby crying about how life is not fair, but before you mock me for that, what would you do if you were me? You probably wouldn't even make it till writing this post. I am sick of how this is called mental help, because this is more like mental hindrance. I am angry these people are allowed to work as mental health speacialists and I am angry at schools which gave them diplomas, because this is not helping people. 

So what are your stories? I seriously wanna read them, so I can mald about how this world is in terrible state and that my gen Z is actually gonna be the last because we will all commit suicide in the end."
241,Need Help: Nightmares,"Hello.

I've been needing help with something I've been struggling with for a while now.
I've been battling with depression since I was about 12-13, back when I started getting bullied. The trauma I have been through genuinely left a lot of other issues I've had to deal with up until today, when I'm almost 21. Mood swings which I never diagnosed, a softer case of DPD, social anxiety, etc.

Recently, maybe two years back I started self medication on melatonin, because everything I had just mentioned also led to nightmares and sleep paralysis, but recently, even on melatonin I keep having vivid, terrifying dreams.

The dreams vary, they go soft from simplest of things such as dreaming about my ex, who was a big part of my life and a person I was extremely dependent on back when we were together (to the point I couldn't necessarily see myself going on without him), and who I also recently lost contact with due to my new relationship.

Then most nights things get messy. I dream about death. Not to get too deep into it, as dreams are different, but I dream of dead people, people getting tortured, animals getting killed, there is blood, body parts, just last night I've dreamt of a lady who was dead, due to her brain being removed, but she was still moving, she was still somewhat alive. I had woken up paralysed and I couldn't move for at least 2 minutes. It was painful.

Sleep for me became exhausting. It makes me want to stay awake, read, watch Netflix, play games, anything to take my mind off the sleepiness just so I don't dream. Every night I close my eyes praying to God I don't dream, or at least dream of something nice. But those days are outnumbered by the days my sleep literally terrorises me.

I don't know what to do.
Please help me, advise me. Anything. I don't know who to talk anymore about it."

243,Everyday life is becoming too overwhelming and stressful for me,"I’m not really sure what’s going on. Things that shouldn’t be worth worrying over are stressing me out. I have a dentist appointment on Monday and it’s stressing me out that I have to go do that. I want to go shopping for a new dresser next week and thinking of doing that feels overwhelming. Things that I’ve done 1000 times before that I have coming up in the future are stressing me out thinking about having to do them and get them done. I don’t really know what’s wrong. It’s like I only feel at peace now if I have zero responsibilities or obligations, which is unrealistic. I don’t know what to do"
244,I hate myself right now,"I'm super critical about everything I say or do right now and feel completely socially isolated, I have very few friends and any time I try to make more they don't stick around, I kinda wanna just end it but not fully, altho sometimes I'm only a hair away from going and ending it I don't really want anyone to comment or upvote just read"
245,"I'm tired of living in this hell that people call ""life""","after the shit I've been through, all the trauma I've experienced, and my mum being who she is,  I am so done with life. people keep asking ""what happened?"" ""what's wrong?"" And I've just gotten to the point that I'm just tired of continuously talking about it. I'm tired of always trying to defend myself to people who will never take my side anyway.

I'm completely devoid of all hope.

i have a plan to end my life on Monday. i wanted to wait until a while after the 4th of February (since that's my brothers birthday, and i don't want to ruin it) but I just can't keep going. 

I'm sorry to my brother, sister, friend, my cats, I'm sorry I couldn't keep going for yous. i tried. I've been trying to keep going for over a year now. i can't anymore.

no one needs to reply to this, you honestly do not owe me a thing, I only wanted to write my feeling down somewhere where I wouldn't be shouted at."
246,Weird stuff is happening.,"I live in a very bland 60s style Student Home at a boarding school. I usually just work out or listen to music in the basement but i've been starting to see weird stuff. It isn't lack of sleep because I got to bed at 9 PM and wake at 7 AM. This started this badly about 1 week ago. I have seen it clearly once and its a blur that kind if represents a human shape and it looked like it was reaching for something on the ground. The second I fully view it, it instantly vanishes like I blinked. I don't really believe in these things but it is starting to bother me and I want to know what I can do to make it stop for good or this is just me being stupid. Thank you."
247,"Dissociating? (Psychologists words, not mine).","I would really like some help here. So, I’m at school in a different country than my home. The psychologist here I see describes what I’m feeling as dissociating? Basically I just don’t feel anything. I go through the motions, push everything aside and just basically exist. It will feel like a day has gone by and it’s been a month. I don’t know if it’s the correct terms, but I mean he told me that’s what it is and yeah. Now I don’t like him. I don’t trust him. I was on meds for a bit, and when he found out all he did was talk about the meds and how they will be my saving grace. I know it’s my fault for not saying I didn’t like that, but I just was too pussy to say anything. I saw a psychologist at home and I really liked her. She’s helped me with a bunch of things already, but in a month we only got so far. I’ve hit this “dissociating”/numbness phase and I hate it. I’ve never been properly diagnosed with anything, but was told by them their 99% confident it’s depression and anxiety. But like, I don’t wanna just say I am. But I know this phase leads to the phase of extreme sadness. It’s after this phase that my suicide attempts have happened. I don’t really wanna die rn, but I wanna stop this. But the therapist guy here won’t give me any useful tips, just says the meds will save me. I can’t talk to the one back home, because she legally can’t because I’m in another country. Any help is appreciated."
248,Finally at college alone again,"Feel miserable. I cried so much I feel numb now. I just can’t imagine how I’m gonna get through 3 more semesters here. I miss being home and feeling happy around people I love. Here I feel constant stress.

Most students at my college love it here and rather be here than home. They can’t even imagine someone wanting the opposite. My roommates ask me “aren’t I happy to be back?” And I have to to fake a smile and say yes. My roommates are so sweet but I believe I made a mistake when I first chose my school. I don’t like the administration and I can’t connect with people on a personal level because my life isn’t as conservative as theirs. I feel I have to hide who I really am and stay to myself.

All of this just makes me miss home more. I just either feel numb and give up or panic about the future. Idk what to do at the moment because I feel fear. I know it will get a little better once I get distracted with school work. I just can’t settle down my nerves and feel sick to my stomach and anxious."
249,I messed up at my job. I'm feeling like a total failure.,"I was testing something following an instruction guide. I missed a step and now I will look bad because another person who was also testing ran into a problem and asked my team. I think of myself as being pretty detail oriented, but I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself and now I look bad because I wasn't paying close enough attention or asking the right questions.

I'm new and still learning but I just look absolutely like a useless free loader. I'm so insecure and it's getting in the way of my performance. I just want to give up so I don't waste their time. And so I don't feel like a failure. 

If anyone has advice or suggestions that would be helpful."
250,everyday is a new rock bottom (f14),"since september i’ve just been stuck in this loophole of constantly getting worse. but lately for the past week it’s felt like everyday is a new rock bottom. things are getting worse exponentially. i hate my life. everyday is the fucking same. 

the only time i’m happy is late at night when i stay up til i physically can’t because that’s the only time i can be alone and at peace. that’s when i get more time to do what i want but even then i’m restricted to electronics because well it’s 3am what will i do? turn on my lights? 

it’s just all so fucking much, weighing down on me but at the same time i’m convinced that i’m acting and this is all a show. i feel like the hugest attention seeker and a faker and because of that i just hate myself more. i am an attention seeker. and it just makes me so goddamn mad at myself. my problems aren’t huge they are basic things everyone goes through i’m just such a bad person i’m sure of it.

i hate my environment so much. even if i could fix myself i could never be happy here. my parents are exhausting. i waste my life here i literally cant do anything here. whenever they’re around i LITERALLY can’t do anything because they make me so anxious and anything i’ll do will be judged so much and because they’ll see me doing it they’ll restrict it. but in the other hand i am so fortunate i have parents who provide for me and don’t neglect me. i have parents who do love me. why do i have to be so whiny everuone has it so much worse. my dad isn’t even drinking anymore right now i have no reason to be on edge all the time. 

i feel bad for eating. i feel like such a terrible person who doesn’t deserve to eat. i don’t deserve water so i don’t drink water for periods of times. i don’t deserve a good life. i scratch myself so hard i bleed because that’s what i deserve. i shower in burning hot water cause that’s what i deserve. i cut myself for validation. yes i do it because i hate myself but at the same time i can’t make myself stop because if i do then i know that my life is filled with meaningless problems. at least now i feel a bit better because my problems are big enough to have led to this point rigjt? so that counts for something, right? i knwo it’s fucked

i just i just i KNOW that i am an attention seeker and i’m a bad person i’m fucjing exhausting to be around. i ghosted my friends for like three days this week because i felt like a huge burden and i decided that they deserve more so i’d give them a break from me.

i’m so sick of living. but i think i’m making that up i’m not sick of living i’m probably just saying that for attention. i feel so guilty for writing this because when it comes down to it i write it so people on here will validate me and give me attention. i’m a terrible person."
251,How hard did adult life hit you?,I'm about to turn 19 and adult life sucks two courses and a job shoved down my throat. I feel like a zombie every day and then on top of that I have my parents who get mad at the smallest things. A year ago it was all different easier.. How hard did adult life hit you guys?
252,Great take on mental health/outlook: a podcast from prison changed my entire perspective,"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yNjg3YTRmOC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/YjE1NWY0NmEtNmUxOC00NTM5LWEzOGItYWI0ZjcwZTY2Njhm?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQkfYCahcKEwjw3d6dxJ_uAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ

This show is amazing—the host has such a heartbreaking backstory, and lifelong struggle against his own mind. His take on mental health—there’s a bunch of episodes where it’s touched on—is insightful, especially considering his circumstances"
253,0 motivation for things I actually want to do?,"All of this probably has something to do with the pandemic/quarantine, but either way something is definitely wrong in my head.

I seem to be bored with everything, or i get bored of things im interested in very quickly. For instance, I love playing video games. At least, i think i do. Ill sit there and look through my game list for ever before i decide what game ill just ""settle"" for playing. Even after i find something to play, i get bored of it after only a few minutes. Ill even buy a brand new game because i want to play it and enjoy the story, but once it finishes downloading, i just dont feel like playing it anymore.

Ive wanted to be a programmer for years. I used to have so much motivation to sit on my computer for hours on end and make stupid simple little programs with the easiest programming languages. But now, i log on to my computer with the intentions of learning something new, and after 2 minutes, i shut it back down because im already so bored. My mind wanders and i cant seem to focus. It reminds me of sitting through a boring lecture in school. Although, the difference is that i *want* to learn this stuff. Its all stuff i think about so often; every day, all the time. But when i put it into action instead of thought, i dont seem to want it anymore. I then go back to my daily routine of lying down in my bed and thinking, or watching something on my tv.

Im not sure whats done this to me, because it all seems so sudden. No significant stress has happened recently either. Youd really think i suffered some head trauma that altered my brain functionality. Memory is also a huge issue for me as of recently. Cant seem to remember anything people tell me, and sometimes i forget what i was talking about mid sentence.

Perhaps symptoms of depression is the latter. Im a firm believer of ""it will always get better in time"" but im really just getting sick of waiting for it to get better. I want to help myself but i literally just cannot find the motivation to do anything whatsoever. Im not suicidal, ill never harm myself, so i know my only options are to live every day the same and deal with it forever, or find a way to make things spark joy like they used to.

This post ended up turning into a rant, but my main question i really want to know; does this feeling go away? Is there something i can do to negate it at least a little bit? Im tired of lying on my bed thinking about all the stuff i could/should be doing.

Thanks for reading."
254,I’m feeling pretty hopeless...,"Hi guys and gals - I’m kind of struggling a bit recently. The thought of going inpatient is on my mind. But I’m worried. I’ve been restrained a few times for bullshit reasons and I’m afraid they’ll do that again. I feel like a lot of these places discriminate against me because I’m trans and feel I’m a threat so they resort to restraints at the first escalation.

I’m really scared because I self harmed a couple nights ago and likely did some long term damage. I’m afraid to go to my PCP appointment next week because they’ll see my arm during the full exam and immediately know what’s up... I’m hyperventilating just thinking about it.

I talked to my SW and he said I don’t have to go unless I do it again, or have intent to do so again. But I don’t know, should I go preemptively to protect myself? Should I just stick it out for the resi program I have lined up?

I’m really scared. Someone please help. The hotlines in my area are fucking useless."
255,"Is it to feel more inclined to help someone with a ""good looking profile pic""?","I've been feeling this way for a while and really just want some explanation  


So I (15M) work sometimes online on mental health servers on Discord. I know how hard life can be at times and really don't want anyone to come even remotely similar to anything I've been through. I mainly talk to other kids around my age and it hurts that people so young have to go through that, and that's why I'm planning on fixing the foster care system when I grow up, but I could only do as much as I can at my age. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I noticed that I feel much less inclined to answer a call to help someone with an ""unattractive"" pfp. I put that in quotes cause it's more of a subjective visual analysis. For example, I'm much less likely to want to help someone with a pfp of Peter Griffin than I would someone with a pfp of Todoroki or Killua. Not to say I wouldn't, no way in hell. But, if there's a chance someone else could, I'd just step back. I don't know why I feel this way... It's just, the vibes I get from these profile pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I bad for this? All I want to do is save lives and restore hope, I don't get how I could have gotten like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all answers are appreciated. Tear me to shreds if you'd like"
256,"I felt like writing a little story. It’s very therapeutic, and I really wanted to share it with people.","When I was little, I noticed the sky above my head seemed to crack, just a bit. I told my mother and she assured me, that with a little time to rest, my sky would be back to normal again. I believed her, because the sky above her head was not cracked like mine, so she must have known what she was talking about. I grew older, and my sky continued to crack. I looked above others heads, and their skies were whole, and untouched. Why was mine not that way too? I told my mother that it was still cracked, and not healing as she said it would. But no one believes a young child when they say the sky looks as if it may fall. People told me, what would your parents say if it did fall? Would you let it fall, and make them help you hold it? No, they said. Hold the sky yourself. Don’t be selfish. So I did. I held that cracked sky above my head for months, and when it looked at its worst, I gave it a bandaid and told it to hold out a little longer, don’t make others help you hold the sky. But one day, I ran out of bandaids. My arms were weak from carrying, and the sky fell. It took me a long time to pick up those shattered pieces and like a puzzle, put them back above my head. They were still cracked. Those same people who had said to hold up the sky by myself now said how strong I was to have held that sky, but how it would’ve been so much better to rely on others to hold it with me. I’m a lot older now. My sky has fallen since then. It’s still cracked. But now, people hold that sky with me. And when their skies crack, I have no trouble assisting them. I have learned to love those cracks above my head, but I can’t help but wonder. What would have happened if someone had believed that small child years ago when she said that the endless blue above her did not seem so perfect."
257,feeling,"lately, I've been feeling that I won't find love or that I'm not good enough for anyone to love me, like me, I always feel like the world is against me. I just want to be loved by someone but all feel is that they can see my imperfections, they can see my ugly face and body. I want to change the way I feel about or look but I'm too sad and tired. I just want someone to love me like their own to care for me. kiss me while we are together and love me but I'm too ugly and fat for someone to love, like, and care for me. but then I think back and say to myself that I don't need anyone I know the right person will come for me and give me the things that I am manifesting in my love life, I know that I am loved and cared for and most importantly I am beautiful."
258,Jealous,Really jealous of people living in this age with absolutely no mental illness. I don’t even know how that works anymore. I can’t imagine people living normal lives and being mentally healthy. This is probably me being jealous but doesn’t tons and tons of social media use kinda make you depressed? And also being isolated at home for long periods of time?
259,"NEED HELP, what do I do????","So I work a first shift at a restaurant. I get up at 5 am to start my shift at 7, then i clean the bathrooms and sweep and mop the whole place before they open at 10:30 am. I then clean anything that needs to be cleaned while customers come and go. Seems easy enough right?? While apparently my mental health cant handle what millions of normal people do every single day.

Every night before a shift and every morning of a shift, I breakdown, I cry, I'm always in a panic every single second of my shift until I'm finally off. Then the cycle starts all over again. Rn its 10:30 pm, and I should've been asleep an hour ago, but i cant take it anymore. I've been crying for 2 hours now with my whole mind and body wanting to run away so badly....I cant do it anymore.

The past couple days, I applied to a couple different places that are so much better options for jobs. I would have shorter shifts that would help my anxiety, it would be 2nd shift, and it would pay quite decently, so i wouldn't have to worry about not being able to support myself.

I want to just bail this job. So many things about it is driving my mental health to insanity where my thoughts and actions have been at their darkest...I've wanted to just bail on this job, but I at least wanted something concrete with one of the jobs I already applied for because that's the smart thing. But I cant sleep. I cant bring myself to go in. I've finally had enough. I'm torn apart. I'm broken. I'm literally thinking of walking into a mcdonalds tomorrow to get hired there for a bit. They'd most likely hire me right away cause u know, its mcdonalds. Plus I'd probably earn a little more than what they start off with cause I have quite a few years of experience plus I worked there before.

Idk....my mind is racing...my body is restless yet exhausted...all I know is that I cant do this..

My bf has to finish some paperwork in order to officially get this security job hes wanted, but until then, hes continuing to work his night shift where hes completely miserable like I am...hes just a lot stronger than me and I feel terrible he has to deal with the crap I have even tho hes always so supportive..I dont want to have him be the only one that's miserable working a shitty job...I'd feel so guilty. But I cant take it anymore idk what to do..I should be sleeping rn but I cant do anything other than cry and wanting to literally run."
260,How to deal with a weird type of loneliness,"I feel like I’m dealing with a weird type of loneliness where I know a bunch of people but feel like I truly have no one. For starters I’m a shy not very confident guy and don’t have the best social skills and never had a girlfriend(had a rough upbringing but that’s a story for another day). My whole life I was always the one friend nobody checked up on unless I asked how they were first. I always went out of the way to help my friends without getting anything in return. I got tired of having to make an effort with people when they seemed to not give a crap about me even though I gave them everything. I joined the marines after high school to hopefully change my life for the better and develop a better sense of self confidence. I feel like I’m still the same person. I’m still shy and not very confident and still have the exact same situation I mentioned earlier except now it’s with the new people I’ve met. Because of dealing with the struggles of military life and feeling alone I became more cold hearted, started talking even less than I did and stopped caring about anything. When I returned home for Christmas my old high school clan invited me to party and I gladly accepted because I could definitely use a little fun. They all noticed what I became and said I forgot how to have fun and I was too much of an ass and that being in the marines ruined me. I feel like they’re right but they don’t understand me because they weren’t there. So in the end I’m still lonely and I can’t do the things I used to love(fishing being the biggest one) because I’m always constantly busy. I was wondering how I can cope with this before it becomes too much for me to handle."
261,Long term effects of LSD or potential brain damage?,"I’ve done a pretty good amount of acid, but my last two times were really bad. One was four 100ug tabs, in which while tripping i had my first anxiety attack. I thought it was just a bad trip and that my head wasn’t in the right place, so I decided it would be smart to take five tabs. The five tabs were supposedly double dose, which was revealed to me afterwards, but i’m not certain. I’d say each tab was roughly about 130ugs. I have not touched acid since that trip about 6 or 7 months ago, because it was genuinely the scariest thing i’ve ever experienced, however the effects are still there. Any time I smoke weed or get a nicotine buzz, I have acid visuals. It’s like a transparent wall with the same swirls or eye looking figures i guess everywhere I look, but also I hallucinate other shapes.  When i’m sober, if i stare at any surface for too long, it looks like what I can only describe as colorful TV static overlaid on top of it. When I look at the sky and it’s clear and blue, I see transparent swirls, like the squiggly things you get in your eyes sometimes, but they’re fast and move around. I don’t know if this is brain damage or what, but I want desperately to see things normally again. I worry that it could be something related to schizophrenia, or just something that i’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life. Does anyone else have this, or is there any way to get rid of it?"
262,forgetting things easily/always doubt what happens,hello :) i don't know if this is the right place to share this but i noticed these past few months i easily forget things that just happened and usually when i'm anxious. like there are times where my boss would call me out of nowhere and ask about my schedule and my heart would beat really fast and when the conversation ends i forgot what i actually said and i would suddenly feel anxious and doubtful whether i said things correctly or if i said them politely. there are also times where i would write something and after submitting it i feel doubtful if i wrote things correctly and i would then think of scenarios where i would face the result of my actions and i will feel anxious because of it. My mind would also tell me that i didn't do this even though I'm sure I did it and I would feel scared that I actually didn't do it. I don't know if this is normal or something I should take seriously
263,What is happening?,"M16. Since the new year everything's been going down hill. Breakup, loss of a close friend, raging nicotine addition, etc. i don't remember exactly what caused it, but there was a event that happened that made me feel as if I was not in control anymore, and at the same time all the stress I feel working full time and at school completely disappeared, as things kept happening I just stopped feeling. Slowley over the last 2 weeks I started progressively feeling more and more careless, and it's not how I usually am. I have a problem overthinking everything and when something bad happens (even if it's small) I feel heavy and terrible. My parents are insanely religious and don't consider mental health to be a real thing. The closes thing I've found to what has happened in the last 3 days was stress induced psychosis. I had my hardest day about 3 days ago. I haven't done any school work for 3 weeks now but I decided to do my 3000 word English essay that I get to chose the topic for. I chose the negative affects the first war had on mental health. After that moment, I've felt as if I snapped. I completely lost control. I went into a complete manic state. I took my fucking bird to school for the last class, started doing completely random things at work that I thought I was doing normally. Such as spending 8 hours putting different logos on a shirt and then ripping it off. I kept hearing someone calling my name. I didn't sleep or eat whatsoever. Every night I would do impulsive things and would not feel anything. Last night got the worst. I took out everything out of my garage and put it in the living room at night. And then I started erratically painting these terrifying pictures (and I never draw or paint) and I used my hands and I got paint all over the first floor. I cut up my shoes. My family came downstairs in pure shock and started yelling at me. I thought I was doing the right thing. I went upstairs and bawled out my eyes for the first time in 4 years. My family thinks I'm going insane. I'm going to a doctor on Tuesday but I was wondering if anyone could fill me in on what this could be by then? This has been my only fear for a long time and I can't stop thinking about it. Am I still in this state? How do I know if I'm not still psychotic? anything helps because I don't have anyone with knowledge of mental illness to talk to."
264,Will it get better?,"As of today it's been 7.5 months without a job and 10 months since lockdown had first started here. The lockdown is over, numbers are under control, people are pretty much back to normal life, my cousin got married, another cousin had a kid, my best friend and sister started and finished one sem of uni, my dad went on a long office trip to China and came back, my birthday, holi, diwali, Christmas, new years. So much has happened and I have been lying on my ass all one in this one bedroom apartment getting financial help from parents at the age of 26, letting the hose become a mess( like the dirty hot chick Ross dated), having at least one breakdown a day, every few days breaking down almost completely and then trying to ignore / lie to people about how I am, eating only junk and delivery, no hygiene, no sense of time, forcing myself awake till the point I will faint which is basically lying in bed being up watch random shit and playing games, gaining weight, lying my ass off, declaring I will get my shit together but never doing it. 


I just don't understand why. All I have to do is get up and do it, it's simple nothing that requy me to think too much about or a lot of movements. Just get up and start off small to clean and feel good but I only get up to get food or go to the bathroom. 


There are people who have gone through and are going through so much worse than me and are trying their best to make life work but I am literally doing 0. It's just that I give up. I truly do not know why or how or for what is life worth living. The only reason I am not sucidal is cause I keep worring that it will be so difficult for my parents if I kill myself like this, I should atleast clean the house spotless of I even want to think that cause apparently that will matter. At times I think that maybe they might be better off if I was not there, but then I know I have to prevail as I need to take care of them cause my sisters are way younger than me and my dad will be retiring soon. I am still trying at times cause my sisters, my brother and best friend will never let me give up. But I have given up, I really do not know what is the purpose of even cleaning myself. I just pretend that I am ok, like not this far gone. 


What the hell is wrong with me cause it can not be my life, I have a good life with no major financial issues or parental issues, I have a lot of people who love and care for me that I am constantly making worried about me. I feel so weak, like am I really this weak that with such a good life I have somehow still reached here. I mean I have no major trauma or things happen to me that would scar me and make me like this.


I really want to try for my parents and siblings and friends, but I am not. I do not know how to do so. Or even what to do. Can I just give up, maybe that is better. Just give up and wait for life to end. "
265,General consensus of who I am,"Long post kept short. I’m at a crossroads. My whole life I put on a act. Literally. I’m a fake. I put on a show to please people. I’m a people pleaser. This pandemic realized how little respect I have for myself. Being isolated from the real world really put a mental strain on me. I feel like I lost my purpose and I lost my drive. I lost all sort of passion. I feel dead inside. Half my day consist of me staring at my wall to come up with something ambitious. I wake up every morning with no life force. Yes this is depression. But this is the type to literally take over your life. I’m at a loophole. This disease has contaminated every thought, and the process to create them. With my processor infiltrated via virus my processing speed is diminishing. I’m as useful as a spec of dust in my state. I just take up space. It seems any energy towards me is just negated. Anything could happen and I would be detached completely. I am very smart. I am very sensitive. With the combination of those two traits I came up with the idea that I would never express any sign of sadness. Because showing sadness meant problems. And people asking me what’s wrong. (Big mistake). Up to my age of 20, I never talked about my problems to people. I always worked out my problems. The only motivation given to me was myself. I was my only source of dopamine. I don’t really have a support system. I have nobody invested in me. I had gone through too many problems I am practically burned out. I push people out of my lives because I don’t want them to see me like this. Now they’re gone permanently behavior due to my naive ness. I always fond on the idea that true happiness is when you experience it with others. Now I’m isolated. I pushed everybody out that I’m virtually alone. Stuck in my head. I punish myself too harshly. I am my own worth enemy. And I continue to battle my inner self. 24 hours a day. You see, this cycle really destroyed me. Unlike the kreb cycle, I cannot find a way out of this system. I hate being an empath. I am tired of hearing people problems and feel like they’re my problems. I invest too much in people. I always give people my best intentions. And when those investments don’t work I piece of me dies. I’m so dead inside I don’t even want to get high. I don’t want to get drunk. I don’t want to improve my physical health. I don’t want to do anything. I had such a big outlook on life. Of course I get shutdown... by me. How do I move on forward from here on out?"

271,I (17M) realized that I’ve developed a coping method of shutting off my emotions,"I’ve had my traumas in my life that have led me to where I am today but somewhere along the way I subconsciously learned to stop feeling. I don’t remember when it happened but it’s saved me in a pinch in during Middleschool. Recently my life has started getting better and now a days I have a girlfriend who I hope to spend the rest of my life with. But I’ve started having spontaneous moments of depression again. I can’t really talk with it to her, we tried but it just never worked and just ends with her in tears and me comforting her feeling even worse than when I started (no screaming or anything, she just feels useless and it doesn’t help me). I started feeling the emptiness and numb feeling again recently whenever I feel sad for an extended period of time. I’m scared of this emotion because it’s erased my emotional attachments to people before and I can’t lose my girlfriend. Any ideas what to do?

Extra info. I’ve talked to my mom about going to therapy and we decided once covid ends.... yeah that’s not anytime soon and we had this convo near the middle of covid"
272,"Sometimes, I just need to sit in a dark enclosed space and ignore the world, but I can't get that anymore.","I think I've pretty much had this for... my whole life. I've always been a pretty quiet child and I never wanted people to see me cry and so I would hide away in my room with the lights off and under a blanket. My room at my grandmother's house had pretty big closets with one of those doors that fold open and closed on a track. Sometimes, I would just like to sit in the bottom half that was just tall enough to sit up straight in. Like, I wasn't crying or anything, the dark was just nice and peaceful, especially since I shared a house with four of my other siblings and I had to share a room with my sisters. The little space was nice.

However, I don't think this really manifested until I was ten or eleven. I had this desk and I would just sit under it and cry when I had to. Looking back on it, I think my depression started then. I had a day bed for about a year that had a big space under it. I would have my blanket cover the space and I would just lay under there with my pillow. I think I fell asleep under there a few times. I would go there to cry, too. I was really depressed for a week and cried every day after school.

It wasn't until last year, though, that I moved and got an actual closet to sit in. The closet's not perfect; it's tall and the walls are flimsy so I have to keep my sobs quiet, and it gets uncomfortable to sit in there and I can't lie down, but it's nice to curl up sometimes. It's dark and I can feel the walls, like they're grounding me. But, my closet's full of stuff and I can't find anywhere to hide in. I have no lock on my door and I can't just cry like that and risk someone barging in on me, and the bathroom's just a tad too big and there are five people in the house, so I can't go there either.

It makes me anxious and I feel like I can't enjoy just... pretending I don't exist, that the world doesn't exist. I can't fucking *cry* and that's so frustrating! I just need a small space to sit and curl up in without anyone seeing or hearing me and I can't get that. I don't feel safe to do it."
273,"Am I finding religion or losing my mind? (TW, suicidal ideation)","Hey reddit, sorry, this is a long story, but I'm really going to try to make it as brief as I can. I realize at first it seems like I'm veering completely off the headline, but keep going, it comes back to it.   


When I was an older child/young teen, I went through some traumatic experiences and, in order to get through them, I fell in love with a fictional character, at some point started believing that they were real, and started to have conversations with them in my head. This went on for a period of years. I did not kill myself because I promised this character that I would not kill myself.   


As a young adult, I have suffered more trauma and my suicidal urges came back with a vengeance and absolutely ruled my life for several years. It's taken a long time, but I honestly feel better right now than I have in a very long time, or even more honestly, better than I ever have before. I can honestly say I don't want to kill myself right now. A very large part of it was looking back and processing multiple major life traumas. Another huge aspect was the healing of a chronic physical illness.   


The thing is, now that I'm at a point where I don't want to kill myself, and I processed everything else traumatic, I decided that I wanted to look back and be okay with the whole thing with the fictional character. It's the one thing I hadn't processed yet due to both shame of how it'll make people think of me and fear that looking back at it will cause me to lose my grip on reality. The honest truth is that, even though I know that they are not real, during my worst suicidal times in recent years as an adult, I still had the thought that I cannot kill myself because I promised this fictional character that I wouldn't. It made me feel pathetic many times, but I still valued the promise enough to stick to it.   


So, I had avoided any media to do with this character for many years (since I was a teen), and I would burst into tears of shame every time they were brought up. I started interacting with this media again, and a flood of emotion has come out about the traumas they helped me endure (which I've learned is a good thing because it means I'm processing what happened), but as well, feelings about this character and their world. It's been hitting me really hard that I still love this character in a way, even though I know they're not real. Let me define what I mean by that: This character makes me feel safe and comforted, I am sexually attracted to this character, and even though I know this character is not real, I feel like my time in which they helped me was valuable and meaningful and I am grateful that they were in my life because I know for a fact that I would've killed myself (at multiple points) without them and their influence on me. I still value the promise I made to them. I'm trying to be okay with that. I'm trying to feel like it doesn't make me a pathetic person for a fictional character to mean so much to me, and it's hard. It's at the point where privately, I'm at peace with how much they mean to me, but I'm scared of the impression it makes. I'm afraid it'll alienate me from ever finding love in real life. I intend to speak openly about my experiences with mental illness and trauma in hopes that it'll help others, and I'm afraid that this part of my story is too cringe-inducing to handle.   


Which leads to this... awkward thing that's happening now, in the headline. As I've rekindled my interest in this character, I've also rekindled my interest in the world they live in, which involves ancient religious mythology. I was looking at the gods and goddesses of this character's time and place, and I feel... drawn to one? It's complex. I am agnostic. I quit Christianity while I was talking to this character when I was a kid. But now, I'm looking at this goddess, and I feel drawn to her imagery and what she represents, and I feel connected to it in a way. I feel like her values match up with mine, and when I think about the things I have planned, this goddess makes me feel even more like I am on the right path. She's validating. And it's very strange, because I do not consider myself religious, but I want to get more involved with this goddess? I've been considering buying religious memorabilia. I really like what she represents. I'd even go so far as to say that I feel like she was meant for me and I was meant for her. But I also don't actually think she's real, which to my understanding, is a vital part of believing in a religion. So I don't even know what to call what I'm doing here. I don't want to be insulting to actual polytheists who believe these gods and goddesses are real. But I also want to be true to myself. I think that maybe god/the creator/whatever-it-is made multiple religions so that people could connect with certain stories and images and feel helped or guided by them, which is something I didn't feel before this goddess (before her, I just felt like all organized religion was stupid and manipulative). And lately, when I let myself embrace this goddess's symbols, wear her colors, identify with her message, even consider praying to her, I feel right, I feel motivated, I feel comforted. And no religious image has ever made me feel like that before. But I also am aware that it's likely because of her association with this fictional character that means a lot to me, and the whole thing makes me feel like a very ridiculous person. If someone else walked up to me and said, ""I'm wearing this prayer bracelet for this goddess I feel connected to and I discovered her through a fictional character to whom I promised I wouldn't kill myself when I was a kid,"" I'd tell that person to please get help. I'm worried about myself. I'm afraid that my worst fear is coming true and that by exploring my feelings about that fictional character, I am indeed losing my grip on reality. Despite the fact that I just said that, I also am aware that I don't think this fictional character is real even though they're important to me, and I don't really think this goddess is real even though she feels important to me, and it's not even about what I'm thinking, it's about how I'm feeling and how that character and that goddess make me feel. It's not about real or fake, it's about what it means to me.   


Reddit, am I okay?"
274,My mind's eye is broken,[removed]
275,I just want someone to talk to,"I am a 20 year old male and this is my first time posting anything on Reddit , I mostly just read posts by fellow Redditors and this is the first time I’ve really reached out to anyone . I don’t know if this is exactly the right place to post this , but I’m seeking advice and maybe someone who could point me in the right direction, or just someone to talk to.
     For a long time now, I think I have been suffering from depression,  anxiety, and low self esteem. I think that the root of it stems possibly from my childhood , and the fact that I was bullied a lot and my relationship with my parents has been a difficult one . I don’t know how to categorize our relationship , wether it was abusive or toxic , or narcissistic, but it still bothers me now and has for a long time since I was a kid . 
     I have never talked to a counselor about anything like this because I have learned to bottle up my emotions from a young age , but it is hard for me to talk to people and is much easier for me to think clearer when I can write it out. 
     For a while now I can honestly say that I am not happy with my life and that it is deprived of meaning or purpose of existence. I feel like Ive been stuck in a rut  for a long time halting any progress from doing anything purposeful with my life .Each day seems to weigh down on me more and more because as much as I try to fight the current , I still feel like it’s inevitable that I will sink.

277,"Does anyone know why my mental health has suddenly deteriorates, and what I could do about it?","So my school holidays ended about 2 weeks ago, and I'm back in (physical, irl) school, and I've noticed that my mental health has suddenly worsened. Like I feel like I'm almost constantly miserable, and sometimes it fades into the background but it's always there. I've started to become convinced that all my friends hate me, or will hate me if i talk to them any more than i currently do, even though I've never had these kinds of thoughts and they constantly reassure me that this isn't the case. I get anxious over things that shouldn't stress me out, like earlier today I came close to an anxiety attack because I forgot a question I wanted to ask someone. I'm not fully sure why, because I have many friends I'm close to, and it's not like we've gotten any particularly stressful assignments. I'll go ahead and describe my holiday vs my school life so there's a clearer picture i guess?

&amp;#x200B;

Holidays:

I spent a lot of time just lying in bed and reading fanfiction honestly. I did have a lot more time to play my guitar, which has been hanging around collecting dust because I don't usually have the time to play it. I met up with my friends to play frisbee once a week (i do frisbee as an extracurricular activity and started playing during the holidays so I'd maintain my lvl of fitness), kayaked with my dad once a week, and maybe I'd go out with my friends once a week (this is excluding the Playing Frisbee) because if i went out more than that I'd feel really drained. I also took some embroidery classes because I'e been wanting to learn embroidery for awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

School:

School starts at around 8 and ends at 5 on average (so i get home at 6) as I mentioned earlier, I have friends to talk to and we havent gotten any stressful assignments yet. I'm genuinely interested in our classes so it's not like school is a drag. I still kayak and play frisbee every week, and on top of that I've gone back to MUN which I also do as an extracurricular activity. I haven't had the time to play the guitar or embroider, but I still don't see why that should upset me since it's not like I regularly did those things last year before the school holidays started. Generally after getting back from school i take a shower, eat dinner and lie in bed for like two or three hours before going to bed (I do my homework before classes start in the morning since I usually arrive at school at around 7.15, as well as during lunch breaks etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm being really obtuse about this but I'm not really sure what's causing me to be so distressed. This is the first time it's ever happened to me, in the sense that in previous years I've never had such a hard time transitioning from holidays to the school year. Does anyone know what's wrong, and what I can do to fix it? sorry for the long post."
278,I hate my life,"I got diagnosed with BPD and moderate depression, and this stupid mental illness has no medications that can work on it because it's all about my thinking and even though my therapist is great and understands me well I still feel hopeless and I wanna rip off my head"
279,i don’t know if i got manipulated by my ex or if i manipulated him and i need help and i feel so guilty for so many things,"
i don’t really know how to format this because there’s a lot of shit. i’ll try to explain it the best i can. you don’t have to read if you don’t want, but i’m just really struggling with guilt and confusion right now. 

background information: me and my ex boyfriend had been dating for over a year. i was 13/14 and he was 14/15 throughout the relationship (we were in the same grade.) we broke up a few months ago and he started dating someone else soon after. 

my personal background information: i’m pretty mentally ill and throughout our relationship i was struggling with OCD and my compulsions were to confess different things to him. i had also developed tendencies of self harm for the first time during the relationship. i had also gotten extremely attached to him and felt things that i had never felt in my entire life. i feel intense emotions. i often forget what happens after i go into episodes where i get overwhelmed with emotions. 

the main situation: he told my friends that i gave him PTSD by manipulating him. he says that he freaks out when people say his name in a certain way. i made fun of it afterwards. when i found out about it, i didn’t believe it. i was shocked and hurt. me and my friends made fun of it earlier today and i can’t stop thinking about it. i feel so guilty. i hate myself for this. this is also the first time i’ve had a compulsion in months. i feel like i need to confess the fact that i was making fun of it to him. we have each other blocked so obviously i can’t do it. 

he claims that i threatened to kill myself if we broke up and that i always guilt tripped him. i have no idea if this is true. i can’t remember most of the relationship. my friends tell me that he manipulated me. my therapist said that it sounds like he may have gaslighted me (i think she said that, but i can’t fully remember). i asked him about this and he said that he unintentionally manipulated me once and that he was controlling at times but that other than that he never did. i feel so awful about everything. i get flashbacks of the relationship everyday. i still cry everyday and sometimes i still cry for hours straight about it. i would never tell anyone this but at times ive had strong suicidal thoughts  over all of this. i never wanted to hurt him or manipulate him. i loved him and all i wanted was for him to be happy and to love me too. we argued constantly. the relationship was so painful. i wish i hadn’t gone through this at such a young age. i felt pressured into things during the relationship too, but i don’t think it was his fault. it all makes my brain feel foggy and it makes me feel like nothing is normal. i have felt like i was in some kind of nightmare since we broke up. it had gotten to the point where everyone told me it was toxic and i didn’t care. as long as we were together, then i didn’t care what he did to me. when he broke up with me i thought i was going to die. when i found out he was dating someone else, it was the worst pain i have ever felt. it was mental and physical pain. i was gagging on the carpet and shaking violently and sobbing for a very long time. after i calmed down, i just didn’t care anymore until the next day."
280,Why is everything so colorless?,"I've always felt this way but only in the last few years did I really realize that everything is so empty and gray to me. My spectrum of experiences goes from dreadful to tolerable at best and I can't seem to actually DO anything. 
I can't remember the last time that I felt happy. I don't know if I'm even capable of it anymore and my energy is at an all time low. When I brought this to my parents, my dad just asked me what I could possibly be depressed about, that I should be more grateful, and that we can't afford therapy so figure it out. 
I don't know what to do at this point because the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of a promise that happiness exists and that I'll find it or something. I can't give a rat's ass about anything and everything, not by choice but because nothing is enjoyable or pleasant. 
I could probably count on my fingers the amount of times I've felt happy, sad, jealous, emotional empathy, and so many other emotions in my entire life. I don't think I've ever felt lonely before. This might not seem too bad but I'm beginning to feel like I'm not even human anymore. 
To be honest, I just want to live alone in a far-away place with true peace and quiet. I'm sick of being miserable and I'm sick of being overwhelmed by nothing in particular. 

Nothing is fun, no food tastes good, nobody is reassuring, and I could be looking up at a beautiful sunset that I consciously KNOW is pretty, but I might as well be watching paint dry. 

I just don't feel like I'm even alive and yet I feel pain."
281,Suicidal,I just want to die
282,What to dooo,"What to do when you belive you may have a couple of mental disorders, one of them being anxiety, part of what triggers my anxiety is being around people i dont know, being in places i dont know, it doesnt matter if im with a friend or a group of them ill still get anxious. So with that being said, how am i supposed to go to a doctor if i simply cannot be in a room with them. on top of that, how am i supposed to tell them about all the shit i feel if i cant tell anyone i know irl, including my gf.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry if anything doesnt make sense i havent slept all night :)"
283,“Oh I think I have that too.”,"Hey all, first post here. I wish bipolar had a scarier name. 

So I returned to work tonight after a month of FMLA leave due to a nasty bipolar depressive episode. My boss welcomed me back. I guess he’d heard through the grape vine that I have bipolar and was dealing with some shit. 

He then proceeded to tell me how he’s pretty sure he has it too. He used to manage his mood with drugs and alcohol but he’s grown out of it. 

Ugh. All I could muster was a fake smile and a, “oh that’s good for you.” 

This kind of thing happens to me all the time. It gets old. I wish bipolar had a scarier name. Then people might respect it more. Everyone’s scared of schizophrenia. Ya know? But the two are so similar! It hurts to think they believe I can’t manage being in a bad mood or being moody as well as they can. 

Like no... I’m quite literally fighting my urges to destroy my entire existence bro. But I always just say, “oh good” or some shit."
284,does it ever truly get better? (tw: suicide),"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit and honestly I’m posting because I really need somewhere to vent. I have 4 mental disorders: depression, anxiety, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. I’ve had depression and anxiety for years but have just recently been diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD. Every single day is turning into a struggle and I don’t know what to do.

My depression has almost always been bad, but manageable until recently. I started having severe depressive episodes in June of 2020. The type of depressive episodes where everyday I thought about killing myself. Mixed in the bipolar disorder (which I got diagnosed with around April 2020) it has honestly become unmanageable. Here’s some of my story/background: I am a senior in high school and have had a extremely rough high school life. From sophomore year on, I was extremely bullied by every high school in my school district and it has really taken its toll on me. I am think I am pretty, but after being bullied and known as untouchable from every single boy in my district, I have developed extreme self image issues which I have struggled with all of high school. I feel so alone. I come off to people as that strong girl who doesn’t care what anyone says, but I am so far from that. Senior year (2020-2021) has undeniably been the worst high school year of my life. Covid ruined almost every single senior year activity, all of the sports I participate in, and school. Covid however isn’t the biggest reason this year sucked. I lost my grandma due to Covid, my bestest friend of 7 years stopped being friends with me, I lost so many of my close friends because of a fight I had with someone, and once again I got attacked by people from all three high schools for calling out a popular person who is racist. I lost so many people this year that I thought would be around forever. In august I started disassociating almost everyday. I told my psychiatrist about this and he said it’s probably my brain’s way of trying to get out of the severe depression I was experiencing at this time. Everyday I started having intense panic attacks because I thought I wasn’t real and nothing around me was real. Multiple times during a couple week period I seriously contemplated putting myself into a mental hospital. I didn’t, mostly because I am scared, but it’s getting to that point again. Everything calmed down for a couple months after august, but December came and killed me. My bipolar had gotten to it’s all time worst, same with my depression and anxiety. I would not wish bipolar on ANYONE. I have pushed so many people away because of it and get angry so easily now. Often days I feel like I have absolutely nobody. I don’t even think my closest friends actually like me. It is so so so hard for me to get out of bed anymore. I’m having anxiety attacks everyday also. Today I had one so bad I genuinely thought I was about to pass out. (Also, I’m on meds for everyone of these disorders, but I’m shit at taking the pills because I have 0 motivation to do anything) I seriously can’t live like this anymore. I’ve tried therapy, multiple medications, meditating, everything and nothing is helping. I am seriously at my breaking point, and the only reason I’m alive right now is because I know it would break my mom and my new best friends heart. I’ve come to the conclusion I don’t actually think it gets any better. Every single time things get even A TINY bit better something comes along and takes me right back to square one. If anyone is still reading, do you have any advice on what I should do or how to keep positive? even a nice wholesome story would help. I’m willing to do anything at this point."
285,Am I losing my mind?,"The title is weird but I’m 100% genuine with this. I’m 19, a college freshman, and I feel like I’m losing it. 

I’ve seen multiple mental health experts already but stopped because I feel worse and worse after each session. I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder. One doctor told me that I seemed to be facing “stress induced psychosis” at one point but the symptoms for that aren’t severe anymore so I was not formally diagnosed with it. 

The past few months have been so extremely stressful and mentally exhausting. I feel like this is the most stressed I’ve ever been in my life and I can’t help but feel helpless, I don’t know what else I can do. I have extreme family problems, and I can’t seem to hold a stable friendship for long. I’m struggling with an addiction (really trying to stop it before things get worse), and I’m afraid to start my new anti depressants because I had horrible side effects last time. 

For the past week I have been quarantining alone in my dorm room. I can’t leave my room because I don’t want to risk getting anyone sick. I physically don’t know how to handle this anymore. I have these awful feelings that nothing is real, I’m going to die extremely soon, and that people around me hate me. I can’t recognize the person in the mirror anymore, I cant find anything enjoyable and I keep finding myself making up false realities in my head. I’m here alone for another week at the very least, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve reached out to friends but they all have their own problems to deal with and this isn’t something I’m comfortable talking to my family about. I’ve also been unintentionally verbally narrating things I do. 

Am I going crazy? Severe mental illness runs deep in my family. I’m so afraid of losing myself. I can’t see my therapist or psychologist for a couple weeks, but I can’t shake the feeling that time is running out. Is there anything I can do to keep myself from literally losing my mind? I’m feeling really lost and I really need help. Thank you for your time"
286,I feel crazy,"I dont know what it is, but something just doesn't seem right. It's like my perception of the world around me and my internal conception of how things should be just don't match up. It feels as though things do not happen logically, or the way I feel things should happen. There seems to be some sort of distortion on the lenses through which I view the world around me. It feels like I'm being gaslighted but I'm not sure by what or how it's happening. Things just don't make sense to me. I know this must sound terribly vague but I'm not sure how to put it into more specific terms. In general, my reality just seems to be skewed in some way or another. I just can't make heads or tails of it."
287,Is this normal?,"Okay, so my ex and I had a very, very complicated relationship. I’ll just be straight — he wasn’t a good person. I’d go so far as to call him a sociopath because the things he did not only affected me, but he drug everyone else down with him. Nothing was ever his fault, and he always managed to turn the blame around on me and everyone else.
But I loved him. I really did. I was young, only a teenager, and he was the first person I ever loved. I was extremely naive, and I let him get away with far more than I should’ve, and it took me over three years to walk away.
I ended things in 2015, nearly six years ago, and we’ve not really spoken since. I finally moved on and actually met someone else, we dated for five years and recently got married. I was okay... until about two months ago. 
My ex added me on Facebook.
He didn’t say anything or really try to interact, and I accepted the request in an attempt to be civil and grown up about things, but it made my husband uncomfortable that I’d added him (after all he put me through, I totally understand), and I deleted him as a friend less than a day later.
Fast forward to now. We’ve not been in contact at all, but I’ve been dreaming of him multiple nights a week, and last night I actually had a sexual dream about him. What is going on? I KNOW I’ve moved on. A part of me will always have a love for him, but I could honestly care less where he’s at or what he’s doing at this point. I’m very, very happy with my husband, so I’m really confused as to why this is happening. 
Is there something wrong with me that a simple add on Facebook has brought this all up?"
288,All I do these days is choke myself/cut myself.,P.S. my neck hurts.
289,strange childhood...?,"I hope no one seriously judges me on what I'm about to say but I had just suddenly had a memory from when I was younger...The fact that I'm only thinking about it now seems quite belated but I hope someone can help me understand this...

From maybe the age of 7-13, I was infatuated with death and suicide you can name it all...I'd watch videos of people being hit by cars and I specifically remember many videos relating to suicide and people jumping and hurting themselves...not to mention people being hit by cars, being shot and all the sort of things a child should definitely not watch...I feel ashamed talking about it now and I cannot bring myself to say the worst type of video I had watched relating to death...

despite watching such gruesome videos and stories...I was not the slightest bit fazed and the only reaction I have about it is right now, thinking about why I would watch such videos and not be frightened or stop watching it

I can't figure it out...I don't watch things like that anymore 

I have a lot of things wrong with me mentally but I'm okay...I grew up in a very kind and loving family and environment .... I don't want to think this was just some weird interest from a 7-year-old it doesn't seem right...right?"
290,Constantly worrying about physical health,"Hey... I didn’t know where to go to people for this question so I thought it would be best to just spill it here and try to get advice. 

I recently lost my grandmother, who I was very close with to cancer. It’s really hard for me as I’m still pretty young, just turned 14. From that day, suddenly I’ve just been so conscious about every little thing about my body... things such as a little sore in my legs or breasts gets me worrying about whether I have cancer(as my mom had breast cancer before but she’s fine now!), heaviness in chest (most likely from grieving) gets me worried about the state of my heart. Although all these things have gone away in little time, I just can’t ease my mind.

I’m really tired of living like this, constantly worrying about my health and it’s been really bothering me lately. Maybe I’ve been on google too much... but I just can’t go without searching things up to sort of reassure myself which doesn’t always do so if that makes sense...  

Does anyone have any tips on how to just not to over think things all the time and scare myself unnecessarily? It would really help... if no one has any tips I’m just glad I was able to say this all out at once"
291,My life feels like it's on fast forward,"I believe my life is passing by so fast. It's such a weird feeling. Ever since I experienced trauma at age 16 I feel like I've been robbed of the last 11 years of my life. I was always the kid to study hard, help others and live simply. I experienced a traumatic event that led me to be unable to attend school. I would be sitting down and all of a sudden need to leave class with panic attacks. I dropped out. I earned my GED four years ago and went to college for Office Administration with legal and medical transcription.

I worked at Walmart for five years while attending college and due to the pandemic and low employment rates in my area I'm now unemployed. I cannot get work in my field nor can I get remote work. I feel like a worthless piece of space and my life is going too fast. I feel like I'm replaying my life and screaming from the other side to do something but I dont know what. I'm stuck. I'm lost. I'm making mistakes. I'm in debt. I'm crashing at my boyfriends family home otherwise I'd be homeless.  I just want a job and to make something of myself. Help please."
292,"feeling hopeless, why is therapy so expensive and hard to get into??","Hi everyone. I’ve been struggling so much lately. Well I have my entire life but I usually just try to find distractions and ignore it but it’s gotten a lot worse. I dont know if it’s just because I’ve been forced to think about it more or if my brain is seriously just deteriorating but I feel so unwell. Like my brain feels like it’s rotting inside my head lol anyways back in early November I called the psych department at the hospital I go to for regular dr appointments to start seeing someone and they couldn’t get me in until TODAY just to do a general 15 minute phone assessment about my issues and history and such. Then they tell me I can’t start seeing someone for medication until late March and I can’t start just regular talk therapy until the end of MAY!!! MAY??!!! it’s a joke. I need to go through that hospital because my insurance should cover most if not all of the cost, but I cannot wait that long I’m worried about myself very much. I was looking at other therapists in my area and everything it out of my budget. I looked into online services and same thing. I don’t make much now as I’m working part time at a minimum wage job which i’m about to lose because the store is closing. With that being said I especially won’t be able to pay for it because I won’t have a form of income soon and it’s really hard to find a job right now. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so so horrible, I’ve pushed all of my friends away because of my issues, I have no one close to me who I can really talk to. not that it really even would matter because I feel so crazy that I don’t even want to talk to people i’m close to about anything going on. I guess what I’m looking for is some advice for what the hellllllll to do. are there any VERY affordable options out there? Like any that won’t cost me a whole paycheck for a month of therapy? I’m so stressed and it’s making me feel even more hopeless than I have been because I feel like I’ll truly never get help. Also has anyone gone through this as well?? I can’t explain exactly what I mean i just literally feel crazy. I hate using that word but I don’t know how else to explain what is happening with me"
293,"Trying to cope with paranoia and anxiety, and it is kinda working","I have been trying to get over my anxiety with computer stuff and it is going well, but now I am constantly worrying about my phone. I think that I will be fine for now on, though. I have checked every installed app on my phone and it is safe. I think I will be able to use my phone regularly soon. I will maybe even be able to use the YouTube app. I think the goal for the end of the month is to be able to browse and watch youtube videos regularly. I'll post if I succeed!"
294,What is the worst thing that family have said to you?,"I live with my sister just because I just don't have another option at the moment and she constantly says ""if you are going to kill yourself don't do it on my house or near me""."
295,Is this empathy burnout or something?,"(I'm 13 so this could totally just be a phase or something but regardless)

So recently-ish, maybe about a year or two ago, i started losing the ability to empathize with people, even if i care about them. It's sort of like feeling ALMOST completely numb when someone is crying. I still want to help them, but I feel apathetic. It makes it harder to give emotional support, so I usually just attempt to fix their problems or something like that.

I'm guessing it could be several things. With the very small parts of my really early childhood that i remember, it could potentially be a trauma response. It could also be empathy burnout because for most of my life, I tried really hard to help everyone around me, and most people around me have chronic physical/mental health issues.

Maybe it's something else entirely, or just a phase of teenage whatever. Either way, thoughts and opinions are appreciated. As always, if I need to elaborate or if you have questions, do ask."
296,After Military,"Hello everyone. Im 17 and turn 18 next month. I have been planning on joining the Army for a long time but my biggest worry is, will I still be all good to pursue music after 4 years? Im not planning on going in for a combat role, instead for something in Science or Technology. I guess what Im truly asking is, will I still be the same? I don’t want to become a super serious and lost person after this. I read 1 in 3 vets feel like they can’t fit in anymore and thats what I don’t want. 
Thanks!"
297,CA Health Insurance to cover psychologist,"I’m going to try to sign up for covered California, they denied me last year and wouldn’t return my calls. But this year I’m a full time student with no income so I hope to god they give me something. 

ANYWAY none of the plans I see on there say anything about mental health coverage. That’s what I need the most and I’m having trouble figuring out which plan to pick. Does anyone have any advice?"
298,Does your mental illness and health get more affected by shifts in your biological chemistry or by external events or by both ? Can you explain or give an example?,I’m mostly affected by my biological chemistry and cycles of shifting internal chemistry. However traumatic events in my external world can induce massive internal chemistry shifts that can disrupt my bipolar disorder and cause catastrophic depression and anxiety and panic attacks
299,"I feel like I can’t talk to anyone, so I’ll talk to Reddit","I have people that love me, and I know I’m not alone. And yet, I feel so desolate, scared &amp; unhinged. I don’t know why my thoughts just always collapse on me, and I can’t seem to drive them away — it’s kind of like my thoughts are catapulting themselves at me from every direction. And I can’t stop to process a single one of them, and it is so fucking overwhelming. I go into panic, rage, anger.. and it is moments like these that remind me of how pissed off I am. I should really talk to my therapist, but I missed two sessions in a row, and I’m too ashamed to tell her it’s because I just didn’t feel like talking that day.

There is so much to be worried about, but at the same time, nothing to be worried about, if that makes sense? When I think about this clash, I start falling into that panic of being too worried and angry, and I spiral into this isolation — a place where I feel like nobody I know can truly understand the turbulence of my thoughts, fears, anxieties, exhaustion, hopelessness... And I hate myself for it. This lack of control. I get panic attacks, I can’t stop crying, I get so unbelievably angry that it hurts. I can’t escape even with sleep because I keep having nightmares. It makes me feel pathetic, disabled, lame.

I have a mundane, yet a beautiful life I should be satisfied with. I go to college, I have a job, I have amazing friends, a great boyfriend, a roof over my head, clothes on my back, food on my plate. And, yet the weight of the past and the future, and even the fucking present, seems too much of a burden to me. I have felt this same burden for years, even though I thought it was getting better. But it’s just not. I’m like looking at this daunting mountain right now from the bottom, and I just don’t want to climb to the top because it seems impossible. But I know I can do it. I hope I can get there and do it again when I’m at the bottom once more."

301,Loosing a friendship,"I have a female Friend who I have known for almost 5 years. Around end of 2019 we became closer as as friends andwas happy and peppy around me. Around mid 2020 she would become distant, and then come back and then be distant. She would be monotone around me and peppy with others, including the guy who sexually harrassed her multiple times. I asked about this the because I felt like i wasn't being valued in this friendship and I felt like I was doing something wrong and she said that it was my fault for misreading shit and that she wasn't doing anything. I apologized to her telling her that I wanted to be honest with how I felt  and got no response. Am I in the wrong for bringing up what I saw and felt? Now I feel like I lost one of the greatest friends I ever had and I feel really depressed about it and I'mnot sure how to cope with this."
302,psych ward experiences,"hello!! this is kind of a last resort for me, since i haven't been able to find this information anywhere else. i have schizophrenia and an active history with harm so i'm going to be admitted into a psych ward soon, but i've been hearing a lot that they aren't all that nice.

i've heard multiple things, situations where the doctors/nurses will hold you down and force you to do stuff? also i've heard that they don't really care about how the other patients treat you, and the experience as a whole will just make everything worse.

a lot of people's trauma is apparently because of mental hospitals, and now i'm terrified. what are your experiences with psych wards? are they really like this?

i'm in the USA, so does that make a difference?"
303,I just joined reddit and it’s made me feel like I finally have the support I have always wanted,"I have known about reddit for ever but I never joined I didn’t think I would ever use it. I’m someone that has 0 social media and haven’t for 8 years because it is just so so toxic but I joined reddit about a week ago and I have joined pages that support the problems I am going through. I can ask anything I want and I get support back. I feel like I can ask anything and get a response without judgement. I am so so happy and excited to keep using this app to share positivity and support for others and myself. 
Finally a social media app that is POSITIVE 
Thank you all! ❤️ ❤️"
304,Mental Illness Outlet,"Hey, beautiful peeps! 

I wanted to just share a non-profit movement I am starting to help people with mental illness.

If you, like myself, used an outlet to cope with your own struggles, I’d love to hear from you.

I know it’s difficult but there are so many times I’ve heard of people saying that opening up and hearing about how I got through my own illness really helped them and I just think that there are more people in who shouldn’t have to feel like they’re all alone.

I would really love your help, but I sincerely understand if you need your outlet to be a private one.

If you’re interested, please contact me on Instagram: @survivorzmovement.

Hopefully together, we can make sure people out there won’t feel all alone like many of us did.

Much peace and love to you! 😊

306,My Mental Health,"My mental health

This Lockdown hit me really hard; no gym and no potential social interaction really fucked me. I have no motivation to work out because I live in a small flat and it’s always raining and cold. I have no energy to speak anymore and when my mum confronted me (17M) she suggested getting meds to help- I’m not sure. Maybe they’d help but I’m conflicted because part of me feels like I have the energy to fix it yet at the same time I feel so drained. Is this normal or am I just being pessimistic"

So I'm putting together a feature article on people who deprive themselves of mental health medication. This is inspired by my own experience of going cold turkey every time I feel like a bad person and therefore ''don't deserve'' it. 

I'm looking for a broad range of reasons for depriving oneself. The reason why interviewees need to be is 18-35 is that's the target audience of the publication I wanna pitch to. I would likely need to include your first name and job.

He graduated two years ago but has struggled to find a job, he’s working retail which he hates. He’s applied for so many jobs and just keeps getting rejection after rejection. It’s really getting him down and he’s being very self critical and feeling like crap about himself. 

I’ve told him that I love him and I’m proud of him no matter what. We’re literally in a pandemic so job searching is hard for everyone. 

I don’t know how I can make him feel better about himself. It hurts me that he’s hurting."
310,Will it get better? Help....,"Hi.. so like a lot of people in this subreddit.. I am not doing so well .. mentally speaking... A month and a half ago I got cov-19 and since my recovery everything went down hill idk if it’s because of cov-19 or the general situation that the world is passing through or from lock downs or what..  my anxieties overthinking and fears doubled like never before.. Bad state mentally...I’m trying to get out of this vicious loop of thoughts.. but everytime I try there seems to be something that keeps sucking me back in... I don’t like to go to my internship.. or with friends.. to the point where I started feeling like talking to my friends is a burden.. I used to worked out.,eat well.., I try to push myself but I’m afraid of getting out of the comfortable cave I built for myself.. where I feel safe.. but I know I can’t stay like this because I feel like everyday I am a slave to my own thoughts.. some days are better than others .. I have set goals that I want to achieve and improvements I want to do with myself.. but I don’t have the audacity because I’m scared that things will go bad.. idk what to do.. every little thing I do now feels like an accomplishment little as taking care of my skin routine or cleaning when in the past I used to do them without thinking that they are burdens.. i was never fragile that’s what’s bothering me.. but now a lot gets to me.. and I hate it."
311,Family don’t believe in mental health,"Hello friends, so I’m pretty sure I have ocd,social anxiety, body dysmorphia and general anxiety although my main are ocd and social anxiety. 
I have all the symptoms (ocd - ruminations, intrusive thoughts, checking, some cleanliness, convictions) but I’m not diagnosed, family can’t seem to understand that I have the disorders therefore not getting me help or being supportive (I’m underage). I finally decided for the 50th time to say I think I actually have ocd whilst I was checking the cups to see if they were dirty (I really hate dirty utensils, they prevent me from cooking due to my fear of them), and my mother said “no you don’t have ocd, you’re just stupid”, the next day some of my family were there and my mums boyfriend and I was checking the cups again, my mums boyfriend said “u must have that thing you mentioned, ocd is it?”, my mum calls me dumb and my sister said as an insult (which is rude but I don’t have it) no you must have adhd”. They never believed my social anxiety either and always yell at me when I say I’m having trouble making friends and that I’m lonely. It also doesn’t help when you don’t have supportive family or many friends to talk to about it. 
My family have always excluded me, they grew up with an abusive which is understandable of why that must’ve been tough for them and that they didn’t deserve it, but they had eachother, I don’t have fun at Christmas dinner or go on family holidays that turn out good. They exclude me because Im the youngest by 7-8 years as I was an accident, and they sure do treat me like an accident more so mistake.
I don’t know what to do, all the time I end up just wanting to cry, they treat me so badly, apparently mental health doesn’t exist for other people because you grew up with an abusive father. I don’t know what to do. I’m lonely, no support, no help. I’m screwed"
312,Doubts about your diagnosis,"So, starting from the very beginning of this story:

This semester I finally got fed up with how bad my work ethic was, so I started consulting the psychologist provided for free by my university weekly. After multiple meetings the psychologist suggested that what I personally perceive as laziness may actually be fatigue. She urged me to consult my GP to see if there are any purely physical causes for this. From the tests I've done (though I haven't really done anything non-standard), nothing has had any deviations from the norm.

In my latest consultation with the psychologist she advised me to go to a psychiatrist directly, she said that there's little more she could do without hearing an another opinion. She directed me to a mental health center where I could receive a consultation with a psychiatrist for free. I called the reception, and was lucky to get an appointment just a week later (though I suspect because it's such a taboo subject where I'm from there aren't many customers).

Anyways, I had my consultation. In the end the psychiatrist told me that she's prescribing me with antidepressants (not sure if this means I was diagnosed with depression, I hope not).

I purchased the antidepressants (I was actually pleasantly surprised at the very reasonable price) and started using them the very next day.

This is where the problem comes: they *seemed* to work. However, they did so way too fast (just a few hours after taking the pill). This implies that what's actually happening here is the Placebo effect, since that's pretty much the only thing that can work so fast.

The immediate effects from the Placebo effect:

* Regained appetite (I can finally finish my breakfast again)
* Easier getting up in the morning
* Reduced feeling of ""time slipping away""

So, because I'm doing so much better just because of the Placebo effect, makes me certain that I greatly exaggerated my problems. I feel like I ""failed"" the interview with the psychiatrist. I think the question that screwed me over most must've been ""When did you start feeling bad?"". I answered the approximate time when I first felt suicidal (I also tried to emphasize *feel suicidal* vs *having suicidal thoughts*, as I never got to the point of any concrete plan or an actual attempt), which came out to about 2013 (though honestly I have no idea, now that I think about it may have been 2011/2012. If we're counting not wanting to have been born, it's even earlier, but that enters elementary school territory, so it can't be taken seriously), which both seems like a long time, and as if I've had depression in the past.

However, surely there must've been periods where I was feeling fine, and I just don't really remember them well. So I probably should have tried to figure out when the last ""feeling OK"" time was. But another problematic thing is that (obviously before the benefits of the Placebo effect), I didn't even feel particularly bad during this latest period. I just didn't really care (or barely cared) about anything, and was too lazy to do basic tasks (most notably, I would put off cooking until the hunger became unbearable). I tried to express this to the psychiatrist too when answering the question ""How do you feel? Good/bad?"", to which I replied ""I don't feel like anything really (in my native language this was 1 word, but I wasn't able to properly translate this otherwise)"". And since I'm not feeling particularly bad, I haven't felt suicidal in like 2 years.

So are these doubts normal for people who were recently diagnosed (though, once again, I'm not even sure if I was diagnosed)? Or are they just justified, and there was nothing wrong to begin with?"

316,No chance for toxic people?,"I feel like toxic behaviour isn't being looked at like a mental illness, but in my eyes it is one.
Recently I destroyed a friendship because I was toxic, but I didn't even notice that I was toxic until they told me. I thought about their words for days until I realized that I really am toxic and I need to get help. I tried to overcome it myself and wrote a diary of all my thoughts, but that wasn't enough. The world started to confuse me slowly, so i needed help to know if something is really toxic. I tried to contact the friend I lost, but they cut me out of their life already. I know I will just sound even more toxic by giving sites the fault, but I think I have the right to do so. I really tried to change and it's really hard without the help of someone who apparently knows my bad traits better than me. I looked up on the internet, how I can fight my toxic behaviour, but what I hot mostly instead was something like ""how to cut roxic people out of your life"" or ""10 toxic signs to look out for"" and honestly it annoys me. Nobody ever said ""talk to the person they might not be aware of their surroundings"". I am so angry at this. I give websites like these the fault why my friendship broke. I tried to contact the person and tried to apologize and ask then to talk about all of this, but instead I feel like she listened to those websites and just cut me out of her life. She blocked me everywhere and didn't even read what I had to say. I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I really just need to get this anger out of me, because everyday I'm either angry or sad about this and can't stop thinking about it. I am just that type of person who actually wants to be liked. I can't stand the feeling of guilt inside me when I know someone hates me because of what I've done."
317,I don’t know if this is a certain mental illness,"I have chronic depression and I believe I have cyclothymia or some form of bpd, but I live in constant fear that my parents will pass away while i’m still young. I don’t really have anything to live for except my parents, which is why I worry so much about them. They are in there 50s and very healthy, but I’m constantly in fear thinking about everything that could go wrong. I worry and worry some more until I have a panic attack almost daily. I don’t know if this obsessive worrying is linked to my depression or cyclothymia or if there is another illness I might be experiencing. Just thought I’d post here to see if someone goes through the same or knows exactly what’s happening to me."
318,"Rarely suicidal, Often want to die?","It's a strange feeling I don't know how to handle. I'm nearly 23 and I've been on and off suicidal for 4 years but more recently I find myself less of a risk but often just sick of my existence. I think about harm and methods but there's never any intent, I just kind of fantasise the idea of dying.

Rather than seek a form of escape, I pray that I'll get hit by a car or fall asleep in the bath and drown or something. Almost like seeking death without the responsibility of having to do it myself.

Would you still consider this suicidal? Any coping techniques you recommend? I often just try distract myself and rough it out, knowing eventually I'll have a better day"
319,Why does life hurt so much?,"Im extremely frustrated. To the point where i ask myself why keep going? School is so stressful, Covid sucks so bad, im forced to go to church, half of my family and my classmates considers me as the weird kid for being socially awkward, which i blame for how i was raised, as i live in a super strict household and i couldnt hang out with friends after school or did any sports at a young age. I havent made that much close friendships. Heck I dont even have friends. Church is so stressful as im forced by parents and my preacher to go in meetings and services 4x A WEEK! Its such a waste of time and its such a burden in my life. My church is so controlling and strict and its just horrible. Today i had the worst day and it just destroyed me and at the end of the day i was extremely frustrated and stressed and thinking about my everyday problems from school and church is making me cry from frustration and asking myself why im still alive? Life hurts so much. I want to be normal and act normal. I want school to be over already. I want my everyone to think of me as normal. I dont want to be considered the guy with no friends. I want my family to be aware of what im going through but theyre going to think of me as a weirder person if i tell them about my problems. Why is my life so damn hard? I want someone that understands the problems im going through and atleast acknowledge it. It just hurts so bad."
320,I want to cut contact with my roommate/ ex best friend,"I'll try to keep it simple and short. I'm really just here to vent.

I've been living with an asshole of a roommate for 2 years. He was my best friend in highschool but he's horrible to live with. Zero respect for me, extremely selfish, late on paying rent constantly, truly doesn't give a shit about anybody but himself. Around Christmas I had enough, and I decided I was moving out by February. I got my own apartment just a few days ago. I lived in a triplex with him and he can't afford the place by himself. Instead of terminating the lease and finding a cheaper 1 bedroom he decided to stay in the triplex and find a roommate. 
The power and the internet is mine. I'm moving my contracts over on the 24th. So far, he's been a complete dick to me. He called me several names, treats me like shit - he's mad that he suddenly has to pay for his own internet and power. He also isn't taking the roommate finding thing very seriously. In 2 weeks I will be officially moving out and he's had since Xmas to figure his bullshit out yet he is still waiting. Idk why. If he doesn't get roommates by Feb, he will definitely be evicted. Its emotional pain for me and also kind of expensive- my name is on the lease still and I could potentially get stuck with paying all the termination fees even though he was the one who wanted to stay and work it out. I want to cut contact with him once this is all over. He used to be my best buddy.

Not really looking for advice, I didnt really give a lot of detail, I'm just very annoyed and tired."
321,I need help,"I need help

I’ve been struggling with my body image for almost 4 years. It has been hard and my self confidence has always been very low, but it got way worse a few months ago. Mostly because of social media which I already deleted. It started with skipping or eating some healthy snacks. Than it got worse and I started skipping breakfast, which made me realize that I could also skip lunch. I created a lot of bad habits which are getting harder and harder to get out of my system. I’m scared that I will get worse but I can’t talk to someone because I really don’t want my mom to find out. There are only two friends who know and they really want to help me but sometimes I just don’t want to be helped. What should I do?"
322,I'm 14 and feeling suicidal,"I have been feeling suicidal for the past 3 years and in the past 7 months have been harming myself. I don't cut but I try and choke myself, I sleep with weights on my throat and I have tried to hang myself 2 times (there is no where strong enough in my house) and I just really don't want to be here.

I have a therapist, I have help from Camhs but I'm always lying to them about how I am, with fear that they will tell my parents and I don't want to have to talk to them.

I also can't tell my friends because all they will say is ""I'm here to support you"" without doing anything to actually help.

I'm self conscious about how I look as my parents are always saying about how skinny my sister is, I'm not overweight but I struggle to stay skinny, and my ocd and anxiety are just getting too much for me to handle. I also really don't want to die of old age, I want to die when I feel ready.

I get lots of sexual harassment from the boys in my school and I frequently see things that aren't there and hear voices, although nothing diagnosed in that area of mental health. 

Please respect my choices and I will probably regret sending this but have a nice day. I probably won't commit suicide yet but I needed to get that off my chest."
323,Any alternatives to getting drunk and wasted,I don’t feel anything when I’m wasted
324,Questioning my sanity because of lack of anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety for 8 years now. It started out fairly minor, one or two panic attacks a year, but as I’ve gotten older it’s gotten worse and now it has taken over my life. I go through periods where I am so anxious I can’t think about anything else or do anything, and it’s awful. 

However, I’ve always taken an odd comfort in my anxiety because I knew that if I was anxious, it meant I wasn’t crazy, nor was I going crazy. I always tell myself that crazy people don’t have anxiety, and this calms my fear of going crazy. 

The last few weeks, I’ve been feeling very different from normal. I haven’t been having anxiety, I haven’t panicked in weeks and I’ve been feeling more calm. 

This is scaring me to no end. I’ve now convinced myself that I have truly gone insane because I’m no longer that anxious. Even though I’m scared, I don’t feel my usual anxiety or panic. I’ve convinced myself that it’s finally happened; I’m crazy and past the point of no return. It’s so scary. 

I do take medication for anxiety, so sometimes I just say it’s the medication working, but I’m still so scared. Has anyone else dealt with this? The absence of anxiety making you feel crazy? I would really appreciate thoughts on this. I take solace in knowing I’m not alone

Thank you"
325,Let's grieve together,"Just a peaceful reminder why we joined this sub and looked for support instead of hurting/killing ourselves.

Anyone else?","I just re-read ""An Unquiet Mind"" by Kay Redfield Jamison and the way she describes her experience with bipolar disorder and mania is so closely related to mine. It reminds me that what I'm going through is actually so real.

Any other time I have seen it portrayed in the media, for example in the show Homeland or Shameless, it really sparks my interest and makes me want find more examples of it in shows, books, documentaries etc. I also read a biography on Marilyn Monroe that showed her struggle with bipolar and it was extremely interesting.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Books, documentaries, YouTube videos...etc?"

329,What’s some good advice for a 30 year old man who has insecurities about his personality?,"I feel insecure about being the quiet one at times. My “strength” as a person to be resilient or complete challenging goals. Sometimes I set goals for myself just to see if I can do it then fail and feel like shit. Tbh I have so much going for me I don’t know why I’m not more happy. I post on reddit a lot which I’m starting to think is just because I need peoples validation all the time. Although in some areas I’ve got sorted I still feel unfulfilled in some areas. Like I have a girlfriend, a mortgage and a job I’m proud of. But I feel pretty lonely I guess. And because of mental health issues in the past I feel ashamed for some of my actions. I did humiliate myself a bit (bipolar) but I want to see past that. I developed mental health issues and feel like I came out a different person."
330,Turning 25 in 3 weeks,"I am turning 25 in 3 weeks and I don’t know how to feel about it. 

I had a long history of mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, PTSD and OCD) since I was 13. It was so severe to the point where the school and everyone told me to stop my education for 1-2 years to get myself into the mental health hospital. I didn’t. I took meds meant for adults until I was 18. Apparently they gave me pretty heavy dosages. My condition only started getting better at 21. I stopped seeing all my doctors after 18 because I honestly don’t think they are of any help. 

I went back to counseling 1.5 years ago after a sexual assault and sometimes when I’m stressed out, I still think about the past (happens every few months). These meltdowns are different because I can control them. I feel depressed and scared (panic attack) internally but I just convince myself that my feelings don’t reflect the reality I’m in. I would still be able to function if I’m outside. My counseling stopped because of the pandemic but to be fair this counseling did help me a little.  

I lost some really great opportunities (one I exceptionally regret) when I was younger because of my illnesses. So now I’m a bit more aggressive in getting what I want because I always feel like I missed out the better parts of my formative years. And the funny thing is, I can’t remember much about them. A doctor said it could be the medication effects and also me not wanting to relieve painful memories. I was the butt of the jokes in schools and relatives because of my meltdowns before. This is why after high school graduation, there’s a lot of people I didn’t want to keep in contact with. 

I lived a pretty reckless and irresponsible life in my teenage years because I never planned to live past 25. I sat on the ledge of my window before but never had the courage to jump down. I swallowed a lot of pills with whatever alcohol I could find at home but I always woke up the next day. I put on my earphones, closed my eyes and crossed the road 3 times, and I’m still here. Sometimes when it gets too much, I still pray for God to take me home. (My faith is the reason why I held on. If it’s real, I get to Heaven. If it isn’t, I still would have lived my life thinking there’s a paradise ahead of me.) 

I graduated from university 2 years ago and now I am working in a job I like. I have a loving boyfriend and friends. My boyfriend and my best friend knows about my condition and that’s about it. 

Recently, I saw a letter I wrote from years ago to end my life before I turn 25. It was a real plan and I never forgot about that. Every year around my birthday, I’m reminded of it. I’m not miserable and sad anymore but I’m really afraid of what lies ahead. The letter reminded me of everything that has happened and I don’t know how to feel. There was always a plan to end this before 25 but I’m doing much better than I was a decade ago. There’s just so much emotions to take in. I know I could be leading a better life now if mental health had never gotten into the way of my education. I struggled so hard the past few years to get to where I am now, although it doesn’t seem like I have much. 

I guess I want to live on but I don’t know if I have what it takes to make my life better, I know I deserve to live happily, I just need to believe that."
331,Advice about my mother,"Hello everybody,

Hope you're doing well and that you are safe. 

So, recently (I wanna say like 5 years ago) my mom had a big back injury and she had to go under heavy surgery. She then lost her job because well she can't do a physical job anymore. After some time, she went throught a depression, anxiety, and she is still curently under some medications, but I wanna say that she's stable. The thing is, these last 2-3 years, sometimes (once every 3-6 month) she would just explode and go batshit crazy, I'm talking screaming, incoherent speech, hurting herself (not like using a knife on her but punching her face or pulling her hair), crying that sort of things. I'm not used to see this so it really scares me, it's like she's another person that you can't reason with. 

The pattern is this :

she go crazy -&gt; she goes into a state of ""being here but not being here""(she totally ignore whats going on around and do incoherent stuff like repeating a word or a sentence, that her head is going to explode stuff like that) -&gt; she go to bed and sort of sleep 

It usually last 1h-1h30 before she goes back to her normal self. Also, she is very tired when she wake up.

What do you guys think it could be ? I'm thinking a nervous breakdown but I'm not sure. 

Thanks in advance for the help"
332,Why am i so scared of being “ stuck “ in time?,"I have noticed that since i was a little kid i had an incredible intense reaction ( almost panic ) every time i had the feeling i or something was stuck in time. Like something or a situation was irrimediabile and couldn’t change and i/ it had to be “ abandoned “ there forever. It concerns from the most important situations to the smallest: like i hated doing something or going to the same place/school for a very long period of time for example. When i knew that other people were moving forward and i wasn’t the reaction is even more intense. Or when i noticed that an object has been left in a place for a very long time and nobody ever moved it somewhere else i feel incredibly uneasy and i kind of “ freeze “ on my feet and cant move, it happens also with vintage objects. The more the time passes the more i feel bad(?). 
Even when i notice that i haven’t abandoned old group chats i feel an intense urge to leave it. 
Its like im incredibly scared of being stuck somewhere and abandoned there. ( i have abandonment issues too but they are more a relationship thing ) 
Can someone make sense of this fear?"

334,Dealt with two triggers in one day and haven't been feeling good lately,"
{trigger warning}

Im a law student and this is my last semester, before this semester started I had to end an abusive relationship with my ex, it was a trauma bond and my mental health began to go downhill. Keep in mind that I have been mentally unstable since 2016 because of multiple traumatic experiences and began therapy in 2019.

I was absent for most of the time, the anxiety messed up my sleep and I just could not function properly. To add insult to injury, because of the virus situation everything is online. Including my young brothers and their school. 

My parents are abusive, very stressed individuals. My mother has to be with my brothers and their school work every day.

Because of this, I wake up to the sound of her screaming and verbally abusing my brothers. Her yelling is unbelievable and just ridiculous. During the night time my father would yell at them for not sleeping and such, last time I was hearing him whip them with some plastic stick. So you could imagine the stress I deal with while being emotionally unstable from a trauma bond.

My grades were dropping so I had to ask my therapist to give me a mental evaluation report to give to my law school. Days later the law school counselor called me asking me about what my mental situation is. She stressed that I tell her everything I am comfortable with so that she could help me. When I began to talk I just started crying and realized that I was dealing with trauma triggers every single day. Because as I child my parents dealt with me in the same way. 

It felt like I opened up to my trauma. Like everything resurfaced, and keep in mind that I never really cried when talking about this to my therapist but it just felt different talking to a stranger who wants to help me for nothing in return.

Talking about this issue opened me up emotionally, sadly in about of couple hours my mom began her abuse with one my of brothers. She began screaming, gaslighting, mocking and much more because my brother couldn't solve a question. My blood was boiling so much I was about to hit my mom, looking at her just felt like I was looking at someone else. Like there was this deranged witch screaming and yelling at my brother.

This happened a couple of days ago and I am not feeling myself, there is so much anger boiling in me that I just can not sit alone and sadly I have to sit alone because of the quarantine. And I just don't feel ""at home"" when I am near my parents. I can't even play video games without having a temper tantrum."

My biggest issue is struggling with my bipolar because I’m just starting to realize medicine don’t 100% fix everything. I’m proud of myself I’m taking showers and washing clothes everyday. I’m doing better and having better days. I just wish I would have gotten help years ago when I started to notice issues.  

It sucks starting over but I’m learning how to love myself and be a better person. I know some days won’t always be good but I’m learning how to live with myself and that’s what really matters."
337,Had a bit of a breakdown yesterday.,"Yesterday evening I was at a gathering with some of my classmates and their friends and it just hit me that this is how normal people live their lives. Being invited to a party, having a relationship, not being sad all the time. This is normal for most people, but not for me. I got really jealous of them and shut myself off for the rest of the evening. I have pretty good social skills I'd say, but I'm just sad that I've missed out on so many years of fun because something about me pushes people away. I  feel like I'm very forgettable; people don't pay attention to me unless I ask them to. People talk over me all the time, but I speak normally and confidently. I don't know what is wrong with me. Any ideas?"
338,Bad Habit of Ignoring People (Not on purpose),"For some reason, I've started to develop a bad habit of ignoring people. I would be talking to people and then suddenly start thinking of something else or daydream. I'm not doing it on purpose but I will out of nowhere just not answer. I hear and comprehend them but maybe because it's I'm focused on something else but, I won't answer. Is this a mental illness? I feel extremely bad about it and I want to change."
339,Think of this what you will. / Looking for advice.,"So there's this group of people trying to kill me, they go around and talk about me to random people they tell people I'm this or I'm that. They say shity thing and they gossip about me. The thing is these people don't know me but they act as if they do. People are constantly attacking me or being rude or acting as if I'm retarded or mentally incompetent in some way.  It's to my belief they are trying to kill me, make me sick in some way , or possibly drive me to suicide. I don't understand the motive of these people other than they spy on me through some way my guess is through possibly phone duplication. No one will tell me what's going on they all act as if they know me or know about me some how. I don't do anything and I don't have any health or mental problems that would course me to not remember things or black things out. Its like they all know what I'm doing but they don't understand I don't why or how that is. I'm only 21 and I'm not really someone who sticks out in any way. But all these weird people think it's okay to randomly herrass me or say shit that isn't true about me. It freaks me out because I'm afraid that if I say something it will get miss understood and someone will intentionally course harm to me.  I'm just trying to live my life, work and have steady relationships with family, friends and my boyfriend. But these random people act like I'm talking to them or about them when I don't know them. If I say a name everyone with that name thinks I'm talking about them. But people shouldn't know what I talk about with my boyfriend etc. My privacy is being violated someplace but I'm not sure why or how or even who. Who ever it is must make some good ecsues or lies to be able to still do it. I've tried telling law inforcment but they won't help or understand what's happening. People give me dirty looks or treet me like I'm crazy. But it's clear there is a munch of people herrassing me for some reason. Half the time its just weird, I don't understand what's going on with what ever situation I'm in because I don't have anof information on it so I can't get help or help my self. I know my family is not talking about me becouse they would never do that. The only thing I can think of is that people think I'm doing it what ever it is.  But I can't be sure anything is happening at all becouse no one will tell me. But I know one of there goals is to gass light me and make me seem crazy."
340,Behind every computer is a model,"When someone vents about their appearance, all there is to be heard is “No, you’re beautiful!”. Why do so many people think that truly ugly people do not exist? That somehow everyone who dislikes their appearance is some model who is blissfully unaware of their beauty. I want some people to just think that maybe, just maybe, the person who feels uneasy about their face could actually be ugly? There’s a difference between BDD and someone who is ugly and aware of this. Someone with BDD could be ugly, they could be average, they could be beautiful. Ugly people are just ugly. Even when someone like me wants to improve their looks, I am told that I “need counseling” because I’m apparently picking my looks apart. What do I need counseling for?? Why is it so hard for people to fathom the existence of ugly people?"
341,Alone,"I live alone in a studio apartment in a big city in Europe. Everyday when I wake up, I stay in bed for about 3 hours, trying to find motivation to get up and eat breakfast. Sometimes I skip breakfast...sometimes I only eat once a day. Just a little bit. My room is a mess most of the time. My roof leaks sometimes, ive complained about it many times but my landlord doesnt care. I have no where to go, except class sometimes. But I dont even want to go to class. For some reason I prefer online class now. It’s less stressful. I find myself being so lonely, yet I spend hours procrastinating grocery trips or taking the trash out etc. I don’t want to go outside. Unless I’m going to hang out with people, but that never happens anymore. My friends are stuck in different parts of the country for now anyways so I’m just here by myself living groundhog day. I want something new. I’m young but now I have no energy. I hate living alone. I want to get a cat, but my landlord won’t let me have pets. I’m moving in end of march. But there’s still a long time until then. I just want to sleep through my days and wake up when this is over and I can visit my friends again, hug my grandparents again, go to a concert, laugh and not have to take the covid test everytime i go to see my parents. I was already ‘weak’ before. Social anxiety, sort of depressed but only the average amount. And now I’m like the shadow of what I used to be. I feel like my essence is dissappearing and at some point there wont be anything that can make me feel alive anymore and ill just be like a robot because my life has become so boring. Sorry for the vent, im not expecting a response"
342,Is it really trauma or am I just a drama queen?,"Hello, first time poster here (and english's not my first language) so sorry for any mistakes.

I've recently been thinking about my childhood, as I've recently been introduced to the, to me, before unknown term ""CPTSD"". As I've struggled with my mental health for a long time, and have relapsed 3 times in 4 years, I started to wonder if my childhood had something to do with it, as some of symptoms correlate with some trauma symptoms.

I can only think of a few times in my childhood that could possibly have traumatized me but I truly can't determine if it ""counts"" as trauma, or if I'm just blowing things out of proportion. They are as following;

• Were pushed into a wall and lifted in a chokehold by the guy that tried to bully me in primary school to early middle school.

• Almost drowned when I got too cocky without my floaties.

• Pulled my cousin up by the hair to prevent her from drowning in middle school.

I also encountered my first influental death when I were around 12, but I remember having issues with my mental health before that. There were deaths before that, but I remember nothing or very little of it.

I just need a bit of a pointer, if they DO count as trauma or not, and if I need to see a psychologist for it?

Sorry if I'm unclear about anything."
343,Personality changing,"I feel like my personality is changing. I've been diagnosed with bpd and used to have most of the symptoms, falling In love easily, depressed mood, changeable mood from high to low easily, feeling alot of empathy about others suffering (although at the same time, getting angry at people for triggering me, which wasnt empathetic) I think at the time, as with most people with bpd I thought I was a really empathetic person because I did feel alot of emotions and did have empathy for people but on the flip side I disregarded people, got angry at them for no real reason and threw people away easily. I spent most of my life depressed. When I was working I used codeine painkillers and sometimes some alcohol just to get me through the day. I was a functioning addict.

After a suicide attempt 1 and a half years ago.everything changed. Not right away but within a few months. I became a generally happy person, very independent and positive. This may sound like a good thing, but I stopped having the high amount of empathy for people that I used to. I used to cry walking past homeless people, but now pass them without a second thought. I think what I'm feeling now is probably what most people feel, I guess it's not not normal to feel an extreme amount of empathy, yet its what i'm used to so life just feels strange now. Not only that, but I dont get crushes or fall in love easily now either. I also find I cant connect to people and prefer being g on my own. I am generally a happy person now, but this still weighs heavy on me that I'm turning into a different person. I dont like that I dont feel extreme empathy anymore. I'm scared of the fact I can take on challenges and deal with stress alot better. It sounds really crazy, as this all seems like a blessing, but when you cant connect to people it's very lonely. I have a bf who I have been with for about 2 years and he was the only person I felt connected with until I got my hair dyed didnt like it, went into a depression and felt like I didnt love him so much anymore. I guess that could be bpd related, and I know its not really about my hair (I like my hair now) but that's when that started. I still care about him but we sont talk much anymore. It is an online relationship and we havent met in person yet. We were going to but then covid happened. I guess maybe it's normal not to be in love with someone you havent met before? It's just not normal to me, and besides I used to love him alot before the hair change. 

I dont understand my emotions anymore. I feel strong and independent but so lonely as I cant connect to anyone, even if I try, I just find  myself not bothered by their company. I feel like I should be greatfull for not being depressed all the time anymore, but this weighs on me hard. 

Alot of the symptoms of my bpd have gone. I dont get angry at people for no reason, I'm pretty easy to get along with. Could It be that my bpd has been cured and that is why I feel like I have another personality? It's just so unsettling. Why am I scared that I am capable of things now? I'm also planning on looking for a job, which is hard because of covid, but I feel like I'm able to work now,  after 3ish years of not working I'm not that scared little girl hiding away in bed anymore. I used to be content with doing nothing with my life, but now I hate not having anything to do. I opened an small Ebay buisness in October. I find it really hard to sit still and watch TV I usually spend days doing alot of walking and organising  Ebay orders.

I've began to get an eating disorder again. It's the only thing that makes me feel in control, I feel so lonely all the time yet cant f0rm connections atall.

I wonder if I am truly happier or I am just stuck in toxic positivity refusing to feel negative emotions because I'm so terrifed of getting depressed again. It swings me into a sort of hypo manic state sometimes. 

I honestly just feel so alone and dead inside and I feel like no one understands becuse I am being positive and feeling happy (in a way) they just think I'm fine. 

Anyway, I've really gone on, if you have read this far I'm very greatfull to you. So to sum up the question is can your whole personality and outlook on life change suddenly? After a traumatic experience? And why can I not feel connected to other people? I feel like a phycopath sometimes. 

Thank you for reading."
344,Why can't ppl just be friendly?,"Why can't my mom just be normal? I wanted her to cut my hair cuz of covid and stuff i can't go to a hairdresser. She first of insulted me and the way my hair looks despite knowing that i like it. And then she wanted me to look in the mirror and i said i didn't want to. I have an extrem problem with my face and avoided mirrors and everything for like six or seven months now. I know how my hair looks cuz i've seen my shadows and silouettes. I know i'm weird. But that's a hairstyle i finally came to like. So now back to the story she went on insulting me and said that i should wear sunglasses as if that would make it easier for me to look at myself. And i told her to be quiet cuz my dad was in the next room and i know that he'd call me a freak for having those struggles but she said i should stand by it. Like bitch no it's not something to be proud of it literally destroys my life my i can't even let my boyfriend have pictures of me cuz i'd prbly see them sooner or later. I hate it that i am this way, i hate myself. But that all didn't have to be like that. If she had just been understanding and caring. If she knows that it literally fucks my mind so much that i can't do anything the whole week following and prbly even longer just cuz i've seen that the mirror reflects a face that isn't me and that i find ugly as hell why can't she just accept it and not act like it was bothering her more than it bothers me. Why must she be such a coldhearted bitch? I literally hate her for that i hate her for her ignorance for her judgemental nature. She's just absolutely nothing like a mom should be. She's just a bitch. I feel so down. I've almost killed myself yesterday cuz my boyfriend criticised me again and i spoke up and now he acts like i had hurt him and he said he needs distance. I just want the people to accept me and my flaws. Why can't i just be treated like a normal human and not some weird boy. My father also often called me a freak. I don't know if that's verbal abuse or mental abuse but i can't stand it. I'm just a mess nobody's able to clean up. I just want a hug or some warm words. I just wanna feel accepted and wanted. But rn not even i myself want myself. I just wanna die. I wanna slit my wrists and just show everyone how far they pushed me... and finally find peace"

346,"How Can I Fix Myself? My Life Feels Almost Empty, Is This a Mental Health Problem or Just My Teen Hormones Hitting Me Full Throttle?","I'm not sure how welcoming this subreddit is of younger people, so I should probably disclose immediately that I'm only 14 years of age, I've always considered myself someone who's healthy, both physically and mentally, so with these feelings I'm about to talk about, I don't know if everyone has these moments in their life or what, but I hope there's a solution because my life is starting to just feel empty and lifeless.

I simply don't feel happy anymore, my leisurely activities consist of anime and videogames, pretty typical, but they just don't excite me like they used to and it's getting worse as the days go on. But the thing is, it's not just happiness, I don't ever feel sad, angry, I mean sometimes I get annoyed but other than that it's pretty bland. 

Whenever I try consuming the media that I used to like I always feel like I'm forcing myself to say I'm enjoying myself, almost as if to convince myself that these feelings are getting better, but they're really not, I'll be using videogames as a reference example. Nowadays, when I complete a videogame, I never get that feeling of ""wow I really enjoyed that, I want to play some more"" instead I just think about what the game is, and not how it makes me feel, because it really didn't make me feel any certain way.

The reason I'm even more confused about why I'm having these feelings is because I lead such a normal life, school doesn't stress me out to much, I have a decent relationship with my parents, I don't get bullied, and overall I like how my life goes. Along with all of this, I'm constantly tired, but I can never fall asleep, instead I'm just stuck thinking about how I can fix what's going wrong with my life, which led me here.

To be clear I am NOT feeling suicidal, I do not want to end my life, I just am not enjoying life right now and am looking for a solution or at least an explanation, like I said I'm only 14 years old and hormones are at their highest around my age, this could be the problem and I just need to deal with it and wait it out, I don't know if this is really a ""mental health issue"" but I figured posting here might give me some good answers.

I'm extremely tired and I haven't been able to sleep so I'm positive my grammar or punctuation was horrible, but I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully I can find out what's wrong and fix it."
347,It took me to the point of no return to finally figure myself out,"I found it all out too late. I found out being the nice guy is different from being a good person. I just wanted to do right in this world and help everyone I could. I didn't. I realize that now. I thought I knew what real love felt like but it was just the nice guy in me. I have wasted so many damn years now always looking for their smile. Now that I live alone, I have no hobbies. I have no talent. I don't have a me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't know what to do, i spend all my alone time crying, hours and hours a day i cant stop. I tried for therapy again but it costs too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

damn this pandemic isnt helping either"
348,I thought I was helping my family and making our life better but now we're stuck and miserable,"I feel like so many people in the world are only out to scam you and if you need anything done you have to start from scratch and make it yourself- it's incredibly tiring to feel like you cannot trust and have to keep fighting people. I trusted my real estate agent and she encouraged me to buy a home 50% more expensive than I was comfortable with since it had two units. We are so new to moving and adulting that there were many many pitfalls we were blindsided by when we changed states- 

Our actual taxes and insurance ended up being more than double what everyone kept quoting us. Our new state taxes the shit out of our purchases, property,  AND our incomes. You can't fart without paying taxes here and yet they are letting crime and infrastructure go to shit. 

It is brand new home but in a sketchy side of town that I used to be comfortable in, but now crime is exploding thanks to coronavirus and I jump at every noise. It's also surrounded by a tow yard and big trucks are clanging all the time nearby. 

I think the guy that built the house didn't care at all about it and took shortcuts and did the bare minimum so we aren't even comfortable or feeling safe or happy with the house or have any peace that the house could protect us from bad weather or robbery or noises and even if we could rent it out I would feel worried that renters would hate it and move out ASAP because of all that. We are so far in debt and monthly payments I don't know how we're still making it so I tried to start a business and get business loans but I got scammed by a company that was supposed to help me do that they ruined my credit and charged me $5600 and counting for the privilege

My job hired me to work there and I moved to the state because they promised me monthly wage reviews to get me wages at least $1 per hour every month, but now that I make $16 and they put me on full time and pay tax and insurance I take home less than when I made $12 per hour as a paid intern and haven't had a wage review since being officially hired 4 months ago probably thanks to coronavirus losing us our biggest contracts.  I feel like I was hired because they thought I would be easy to take advantage of and overwork me for cheap too since I am doing a high skill technical job and wear many hats. Despite swearing and promising that they had millions of jobs for me to do and I had full job security, now it's feeling more and more like that's not true and not only am I not going to make any more money but also that my job is in danger 



The noise in my home is my biggest anxiety and causes me torture all day. I can't stand the loud banging and shouting and rattling and my heart tumbles and churns with every sound . If I was homeless at least I could give less of a crap about the noise because it wouldn't be chasing away people from renting in my home and chasing away my major income that I got sold this home for. I thought I was doing the best thing for my family and making an investment but it feels like we just bought a tombstone instead 


I feel like I'm trying to put out too many fires at one time while still fighting from getting scammed or suckered yet again and that there's supposed to be all these protections in place but nobody ever actually enforces them so you just end up screwed.  My body and face have visibly aged in the past couple months from this."

350,numb and tired but somewhat secure,"small trigger warning: covid/pandemic 


I am currently dealing with a lot of life changing (good and bad) things. so many things are changing yet i still feel alone and numb. i understand im not alone and i have my family, online friends as well as this lovely community but its hard to want to keep going and 'think' that i am okay.

 i have many secrets that i hold from my family (for safety) such as i am bigender and i get bad dysphoria and growing insecurities by the day. i can look myself in the eyes or look at my body and say i am beautiful but i still feel like crying because its not the body i want to see (most of the time). 

i loose motivation quickly, the pandemic had made me soft to the point i dont care much about..anything. covid changed many lives. but maybe we can think on the positive side and we can help try and find ourselves, like find a talent or get a new hobby. 

i also have been trying to ground myself into my education and trying to express my love for programming, computer science, english, history etc.  it seems my family supports me in the things i love to learn. even though i dont have a desktop device at the moment, i still try to learn programming and such, and im doing okay do far :)  (its easier for me to learn programming, history, basically anything if its on a desktop device). this could be a way to cope with all that im dealing with right now."

I want to give up. I don’t know what is wrong with me, I feel like there’s this emptiness inside me, it’s heavy, and painfully numb if that makes any sense at all.

352,i just need to vent about things,"okay so i’m 20 and i’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, ptsd, adhd, and ocd.  i’ve self harmed for 8 years now and since dating my boyfriend i moved onto hitting myself so it’s less noticeable. sometimes when i’m alone i get so paranoid that something is watching me and it gets to the point where i do see something watching me, i can start to believe it’s real in the moment. i’ve been to multiple therapists and psychiatrists i’ve given up. for as long as i can remember right before my period i get even more depressed. i get so suicidal and self destructive and i hate every single thing about myself. i have an amazing boyfriend but i’m so scared of trying to explain to him how bad everything gets. i feel like i’m wearing him down. i’m just so tired and i feel so lonely. and that kinda summarizes it. sorry i don’t know if this is the best place for this post but i don’t know what else to do."
353,Probably being a baby and idc,"I have a three day weekend. I planned out a whole self care weekend for myself so I could start again and really try to improve my mental health. It all crashed and burned.

Now it feels like a damn need instead of a want. Now it feels like I’m doing it for her and not for me. I told her this and seriously she was like “well you said you were going to clean it the other day and you didn’t. Your room should never get this messy.”

Now I don’t see any point in cleaning it much less my whole weekend."
354,Why am I like this?,"HI i'm D

BTW so for the grammar 

 I'm 18 and this has been going on and getting worst since I was 11 or 12, So I have a question. It took all these years but, i'm honesty tired of  this. When I was eleven it wasn't to bad or hard to dill with. I would occasionally panic for no reason at all, or I would start tearing up. I was typically able to hold it in and when I couldn't I would just wipe my tears and know one noticed. 6th grade to 8th It was all the as same except in 7th I started harming myself and it was off and on. I was able to stop by myself but, months later I would started back. The end of 8th I got a lot of pets and was taking care of them at this time I was fine it all lasted until the end of 9th. Nothing changed I still had my pets and loved them to death. Awhile later I re-homed them because it all started back again. I started not wanting to get up some days , harming my self off and on, setting in my room crying at night, I would get mad at everyone for know reason. Now i'm a 12th grader and once again its got worst. I now get up a hour before everyone that way i'm on time for school (tho some bays I still can't get up) and so i'm not being rude  to everyone. Sometimes ill get were I start crying if someone even speaks to me , and I get anger and just wanna be alone. I get anxious a lot more. The other night we were out eating with friends and family, I honestly felt like and outsider I didn't wanna be there, I couldn't set still and  my mood change so I wasn't in the mood to eat or be there, I just set there looking around at ever thing and trying to find something focus on besides all the people. By the end we were done eating and left  I was in a bad mood. All I  could thinking about was ending it or dumb I was and annoying . when I got home I sat up for hour listening to music trying to clam down and until I passed out. the next morning which is now when I got up I was in a perfectly good mood like like nothing happened and i'm finding it to be a pattern. Like the time I stayed up not able to stop moving and I was over thinking ever thing while crying , once i got up the next morning I was perfectly fine and was the happiest I've ever been. I really just want this to be over it annoying for me to deal with, I told my parents about some of it like the crying for no reason and panicking. It was like they didn't care tho. so nothing ever been said about if after that. I really to the point that I don't care if I live or die, but in all honesty I rooting for the last one it seems a lot easier.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna know if anyone knows why i'm like this?"
355,"Family members ill, much anxiety","I want to preface this by saying I know how self-absorbed it sounds to be concerned about myself when my close family are ill. I really care about my family members, and I want to be able to help, but I know my anxiety is irrational. 

During the pandemic, me and my family have been lucky enough to work from home and have stayed indoors aside from grocery shopping. We managed to be a covid-free household, and none of us get ill very often. 

My sister started feeling dizzy, tired and hot 2 weeks ago. She felt tired and feverish so we made her stay in her room for a week while we waited for the covid test results. The results were negative, which was a relief, but we still didn't know what was wrong with her. Eventually a doctor diagnosed it as tonsillitis (although we're not certain) and gave her antibiotics. Until a few days ago, we were bringing her food in her room, but she decided she wanted to hang out in the living room all day, on the sofa, cook food in the whole kitchen. I didn't approve of any of this, and neither did my parents, but they didn't assert themselves against her and she didn't listen to them. So I mostly avoided the kitchen and didn't go anywhere near her while she was on the sofa. 

Today, my mum randomly had vertigo, been sick multiple times (my biggest anxiety trigger, I have emetophobia), and other gross symptoms. The doctor on the phone reckons she has a viral infection, but we have no idea what it is or whether it is the same as my sister has. My mum works on her computer in the living room near my sister. 

It should be noted, whilst I am of course worried about my sister and mum, they're very lowkey people who have never really experienced anxiety. Me and my dad are the anxious ones, so even though they are ill, my mum and sister are pretty chill about it. 

My anxiety has been really high this week, and especially today. I'm annoyed that my sister doesn't listen, and that my parents don't assert themselves to try and stop her spending all day on the sofa. I'm annoyed that my sister uses the kitchen, touches all the doorknobs and doesn't wipe them down nor clean up after herself when she cooks, I'm annoyed that she's been careless and yells at me everytime I try to tell her to be careful. I'm annoyed about how blase my mum has been (letting my sister eat dinner with us, sitting on the same sofa after my sister has been there, refusing to force my sister to go back to her room). I'm not annoyed that my mum is ill, but I am annoyed that she is too, now being careless. She's touching all the doorknobs, leaving her room, standing too close. 

I feel like I'm living in a house of sickness, and the sickness is just inching it's way closer to me because everyone else is so careless. The worst bit is the anticipation...am I going to get sick? Am I already sick but won't know for a dew days? Will I have to spend the next week avoiding everyone and everything? 

Idk guys x"
356,"Lonliness, I feel untethered from the world","I usually end up venting an incoherent mess of all my feelings. So I want to try to focus on one issue, loneliness.

I went through a lot of trauma several years ago. Through that, I lost sight of myself and withdrew, losing contact with many people in my life. A lots changed since then, but I still feel separate from the rest of the world. I have almost no relationships, no one really knows what's happening in my life, theres nobody to share my achievements or troubles with. That sense of being untethered, not truly being a part of the world, makes everything in my life feel pointless. 

I've tried reaching out to old friends, COVID hasn't helped, but really the main issue is me. Im scared, I've forgotten how to interact with people properly. I know I used to be able too, bit now it fills me with anxiety and guilt. Im Tired of being that person wasting away with no one around to notice."
357,Why do I feel like I’m being too much by feeling happy?,"Whenever I see something that I’m very passionate about, I get really excited or happy, I feel an immediate shame. As if I can’t express that because I’m being too much, too fake, I’m forcing it to be true just so that other people can see. 

I don’t know why I feel that way, and it happens quite often. I was looking at the film books at a library and got really excited telling my parents how good was it and the shame came at the same time thinking “oh you’re only doing this so they think you like film”, “you only wanna make them think this is something that really makes you excited, stop being so fake” etc"

359,Would like some advice (sorry for the long post),"How do I help myself when I don't even know if there is anything wrong with me or if there is I don't think I want to even help myself out of (probably) fear. 

the reason I say I don't even know if there is anything wrong with me is because I am inexperienced (only 16) and I think logic and rationality is no help even though it leads me to the right questions but I can't answer any of them since I'm not qualified to answer those questions...but after reading stuff I see some correlation between myself and the effects that are happening to other people and which makes me realize my own mind isn't trustworthy which I already knew to an extent but it just makes me question every thought that I have if its truly what is going on or if it's just me self-manipulating/gaslighting without realizing it and its an endless loop where no matter how far I stand back to question and reason the thought process I went through to come to a conclusion then becomes the new thing under scrutiny and it just extrapolates into infinity  (idk if I explained that well but I tried) and I feel like a lot of my thoughts are contradictory and that I don't actually align with what I think but I'm unsure...because I forget them so I can't compare and contrast...but what I'm sure of is that a lot of my thoughts are filled with uncertainty.

and so then if there is something wrong with me...I don't even think I want to fix it because as stupid as it sounds I think my life will become boring...although it is already boring since I quite literally stay in my room only to use the bathroom and bring food back to my room to eat (I could blame Covid-19 but before Covid the only other thing I did from that is go to school but at school I just zone out like a drone only taking in information the teacher says which is why I find school so easy because the only thing I remember in school is the information the teacher says and multiple choice questions just triggers the memory) But if I don't have issues or anxieties over hypotheticals that would literally never happen plaguing my mind to burn hours of the day away then what will I think about/do?

&amp;#x200B;

Ofc I know the answer to that...talk to people and pick up hobbies but I live in a dead town and I don't really relate with the few people in it so real life is off the table and my procrastination is absolutely terrible so even though I'm hard working I find it impossible to get things started even if I enjoy them also talking to people is hard and I think I have the wrong idea about friendship and all that since I have never had any and so I put unreasonable ideals on what friends should be like and what a friendship is or maybe they aren't unreasonable how should I know? I just want someone to take interest in my hobbies and what I have to think but I already know the hard truth that no one gives a shit because they have their own circus of a life to run which makes the future look bleak...and don't even get me started with the way the World is headed right now. 

Life is hard I guess....I just stress to much about the future because my present is shit and it's all I have to do to waste time. (which I know is flawed thinking but bite me why don't you)"
360,Do I have a sleeping disorder?,"Hey guys, I hope this is the right sub.
So I have sleeping problems since almost two weeks now. I cant fall asleep unless it’s past 4 am and either sleep till noon or wake up 7 am if I have online classes, sometimes I fall asleep again around 4 pm. I am constantly tired, don’t have any appetite and have zero motivation. I don’t know how this happened, but I feel extremely depressed because I try to change it but nothing works. My best friends said that it can be a sleeping disorder and recommended pills (who are plant based) which I want to try, but I am so scared that they don’t work. Any ideas?"
361,Is there a chance I have autism?,"I'm a 17 year old girl. At 15, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety (mainly social anxiety,) and ADHD. I've had a feeling for a long time that I still haven't gotten to the bottom of everything, though. I've done a bit of research about autism in women, and I'm gonna talk about the symptoms I've read about that I think I might be having. I'd love it if someone who's more knowledgeable about this topic could help me figure out if I need to mention this to someone or not. 

I'm not particularly anxious around people, I just feel awkward. I'm not sure what to do with my hands, what to say, how much to talk, what to talk about, what questions to ask, what responses to give; anything like that. I'm drained from having to talk to people, and having to pretend I know how to. 

I've noticed that there are certain textures of cloth that I sometimes cannot stand. I don't notice that often, though. When I was younger I couldn't stand the texture of noodles. Now, it depends on the type of noodle, but I don't eat pasta very often, and I haven't found any other textures that I despise recently.

I've noticed that I might get overloaded by loud noises as well. I have a group of friends who like to tease each other. I get ""bullied"" a lot in the group, which I'm fine with because I bully back, but when people start yelling I kinda disconnect. I start feeling uncomfortable, sometimes I get so anxious that I'll leave a call (if we're in call,)  and sometimes I'll just completely detach from reality. 

I used to have a lot of problems with schedules. If I had a plan for the day, and something went wrong, I'd lose it. I'd cry, I'd get angry; sometimes both. I just hated it for something to go wrong. For the past couple of years, though, I've given up on trying to make plans for my days because it's too emotionally draining. 

I've heard that people with autism can have, like, a higher chance of having special talents? I'm not trying to brag at all in the slightest, but I've been teaching myself various different instruments since I was 11. I don't consider myself good at any of them except the guitar, which I've been learning for a little over 2 years now. It just feels natural to me. It didn't seem to take me very long to pick up the basics and run with it, but I feel like a lot of my ability on guitar is based on muscle memory. 

I'm researching as I'm writing this to make sure I'm not missing anything, and I've read that puberty/teen years are very difficult for girls with autism. I know that middle school was the worst period of time I've ever been through. I cried every day, I only had 2 friends who I could never see throughout the school day. If I had known at the time what suicide was I wouldn't be here today. High school is still difficult, too. 

I know some articles are talking about obsessions with things. I was very obsessed with BTS a couple of years ago, and recently I've reconsidered obsessing over people. It just feels weird, because they're just people that have a talent that I enjoy. I don't obsess over people anymore, but their content. And I don't know if I have an obsession with anything right now, though. 

I think that's everything I've seen so far that I experience that's similar to symptoms of autism. I don't want to bring it up to someone and find out that I'm just being over dramatic, so that's why I wanted to come here first. If there are any questions that need to be asked to clear anything I said up, I'm happy to answer. Thank you so much for helping, or even reading this far."
362,Life during pandemic,I had to cut off so many negative people out of my life but now I have negativity coming from my family members. I don’t get along with my brother not so much my father. I don’t have friends. People come and go in and out of my life. I do have mental health but I don’t let that stop me from doing what I want to do. I don’t know what people’s true intentions are. How would I know if I’m not getting stabbed in the back and I don’t even realize it. If it wasn’t for god I would be dead. God has saved me so so much from the good and from the bad and I bless him everyday before I do anything else with his saving grace. I can and I will!
363,can someone tell me what im experiencing?,"i think this was a long time coming because i havent been feeling like myself lately but just now i was crying but then all these thoughts just started to have a domino effect like one realization to another and it just wouldnt stop and then i felt like i just woke up from a dream like everything suddenly feels so real.. idk maybe ive been living this past year as if its just a really bad dream or something but i think i just realized that this is actually happeningand then i cried some more (btw this isnt a dream like im fully aware i wasnt sleeping). sorry if this is incomprehensible its 1am im writing this on my phone while crying lol. 
does anyone know what im experiencing? i think it might be some form of depersonalization but i might be wrong. 
i do have symptoms of adhd + anxiety if that helps. also i wonder if this might be related to my childhood trauma (i dont feel like getting into it because its a really long story but yeah)?"
364,How do find 1 person to be in your life?,"I feel so bad, I haven’t had a friend or family member in two years now, I spend my weekends just crying on my desk wishing I had someone just to ask advice for how to meet someone. I don’t mean romantically, I don’t even mean in a long term friendship way, just a person who thinks about me even once a month. I’m 22M, I’m even sad when I get my paychecks because I have no use for money I don’t enjoy anything that comes from it. I simply don’t know where to turn to meet someone, I don’t believe you can be in solitary for life, i don’t think it’s healthy. No exercise and diet are not going to help been at 10/10, if anything, being in public running is risky because I often break down balling. Where or how do you go from 0 to 1 friend, I can see from 1 to 2 as reasonable, but I feel like a burden to myself how tf is it fair to put that on only one person. Idk what to do. Edit - basically goal is n=1, but that’s not fair to the 1, so goal becomes n=2, but that first has to go through n=1 and that’s not fair so is it better just to be more comfortable with n=0? Can people be comfortable with n=0?"
365,42 people...,"For someone who only has 4 or 5 regular friends, whom I see each a couple times a year, maybe more: I've tallied it up, and 42 people would be affected by my death. +10 for my co-workers if I died before I quit my job and they somehow found out. 

It's so unfair, almost.

Should I be selfish? Or selfless...? My living and existing is an *intense suffering.* I'm resentful, practically! I stay alive to make sure these people don't get hurt, yet it hurts me every. single. day. to live -- because I cannot live like them. 

I try, but I just do less and less everyday because I am dying. But of course, because obligations and life, I eventually do something. But every day it gets less and less.

You know, time goes by. It's been 2 years and I haven't lifted more than a finger really. And I'm expected to be stuck in limbo for the sake of these 42 people. 

I could end it all in one blow, and everyday I ponder about it. I get closer. I make plans but I don't carry out any of them.

It sucks. A future is there, I'm sure, but it's simply too painful to live day-to-day. That future is too unattainable for me.

People tell me I'm smart, people tell me I'm skilled. And I agree, I have a lot to offer. I love to help people by sharing the knowledge and maturity I have acquired. But *despite all this,* it is painful to live. I care not how skilled or awesome or creative I am. It is painful to live.

Why do you not spare me? I understand it would cause large holes in society if people were willingly allowed to commit peaceful, medical-assisted suicide. But still, I feel that that would be a more peaceful option -- people could say they're goodbyes, people can have ceremonies. Instead of me being on the side of the road, bloody with my head shot off, and authorities scrambling to connect the dots and send off paperwork, inheritance, etc.

People tell me I have come so far, but that's only on the outside. (Yes, I've tried therapy and still am trying it)

I am chronically ill and I want out. Why do you not spare me? I'm forced to live and suffer everyday. Why do you not spare me?"
366,Weight gain on antidepressants,Has anyone else gained weight on SSRI’s? I gained around 15-20 kilos in two years (around 33-44lb). I’m coming off my medication now because I feel better but I’m scared that I won’t lose the weight again. Has anyone had this experience and did you lose weight again after coming off the medication?
367,HUGE Performance anxiety, I dont know what to do. I can not have a boner since I am always so tense cheking if I wil be able to perform. Sexual interaction with a real girl is really stressfull for me. I can fap with strong boners while watching porn but it is not that hard while doing it with my imagination. It is like I dont get turn on normally. I can not cope with my obsession and the intrusive thoughts that i am usless and wont ever be able to have sex.
368,Anxiety Attack that was intentional-Doc said,"One time I went through a really bad anxiety attack that left me twitching with muscle spasms on my whole left side. This had never happened to me before and it lasted for 2 weeks. I was sensitive to light and noises. Talking made me have neck spams and my speech was choppy. I went to 3 different doctors, and one told me I was doing it intentionally and just gave me a valium. Basically saying it was doing it for attention to get drugs. 

This really pissed me off because I had never gone through an anxiety attack like that, and he wasn't listening. 

After many neurological tests and ER visits, I ended up learning its a new way my body reacts to my anxiety. I started meditation and yoga with my regular anxiety meds!"
369,"Isolation made me uncover trauma. No insurance, and as an IT guy I’m isolated and in need","I’m in the US and not able to work due to the extreme emotions I uncovered while having less high stress (20 years of CritSit engineering 24x7)

I need medication, was too emotionally upset to file for medical by December 15, have no job, unable to work, and my trauma is connected to my core support family who I can’t speak to. 

I usually get over this (it appears) by going to bars and drinking, meeting people, and distractions of various things.

I need medical escape from the feelings that have no one to blame, accuse, or fault for severe life hindering abuse and trauma. 

I’m looking for non violent ways to deal with this on the App Store (mac), and am driving to scenic vistas keep myself from sinking. 

Looking for help to move past decisions that prevent me from socializing in person at all. My healing techniques and mitigation techniques have no traction these days … especially with how the world has changed in the past 10 years

What medication type helps with legitimate undiagnosed PTSD and trauma abuse. I just fully analyzed it and am unable to proceed without assistance of some kind. I need drugs to work though, heal, and more from feelings and physical ailments origining from a person that has Borderline Personality disorder and a few heavy metal toxic others. 

If you know of “ascension/awakening” or other related groups, that defies rational science (of today), then that definitely also applies. 

Assist needed, wanted, and I would be very greatful for. Where do I begin? I’m short on cash but will spend my IRA to heal."
370,CAN I PLEASE DIE??!!!!,"I wish death was nice, peaceful, and easy. I wish my loved ones could just *let me do it.* I wish medical assisted suicide was an option if you are mentally chronically ill.

I don't care how amazing I am, it hurts to live and I want out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am *this* close to selling my belongings and making slow arrangements so I can eventually off myself. But I still have those stupid social bonds -- some of which I never f\*cking asked for -- that prevent me from doing this!"
371,I need advice,I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this but is it normal to love 2 girls at one time? Its just really hard for me because I get a lot of shit for this and I feel shitty for it too.
372,I made a post saying I felt upset at a girl I’ve been talking to for months suddenly ignoring me and a guy made fun of me saying I’m a nice guy.,"Then he claimed its ‘not right’ to judge her for ignoring me. Okay? WTF? Then he said I’m ‘close to nice guy territory’. Then he said he wasn’t being condescending but he was initially rude. WTF?

So I told him he’s close to rude fuck territory and he needs to find a better hobby opposed to coming to ‘helpful subs’ and judging people for feeling emotions."
373,Struggling with eating due to stress,"Hey people of reddit.  


So I am in a really messed up relationship situation that has induced a lot of panic and sadness. All this stress is KILLING my appetite. I just don't feel like eating. It disgusts me for some reason. I do force myself to eat 3 times a day to function at work but I guess it is not enough. I am lightheaded and nauseous all the time and it sucks. Is there any way to bring myself to eat more? I am sitting in front of a piece of bread right now and it feels SO uncomfortable to eat it. I feel like gagging and the lightheadedness makes my mental health worse. What can I do?"
374,I will be homeless,Motherfuckers wont let me live a happy life cuz im failing fucking phisics. Wont be able to work anywhere else other than trash man. If the fuckers dont want me cuz they judge my entire worth by if i can solve a fucking phisics problem fuck them and their society bullshit im out
375,I’m scared to ask for help,"I’m feeling so numb and anxious at the same time. There’s nothing that makes me happy. I stopped texting friends or going out. I just sit all day at home. I’m not tired or anything, I have a lot of energy but it’s not the type of energy you can spend on working or meeting people. Those are just bursts where I become angry and irritated. I also get panic attacks, usually multiple times a month. World doesn’t feel real, I stop caring about anything because it doesn’t matter anyway. I self harm because it’s the only thing that makes me less scared. It also makes me feel more real in some way. I have suicidal thoughts almost all day, they’re so strong I can’t focus on school work.

I feel like I need help but I’m too scared to ask. Any doctor would probably just laugh at me because it’s nothing serious. My parents also probably would just tell me to focus more on school or something. Friends would probably think I’m just begging for attention.

Sorry for bad English"
376,"help :"")","so basically long story short my dad forced me to stop therapy when he found out i was gay and that was even before i could ask my therapist to go on meds. and now that 2021 started i am in serious need of them but i cannot afford going to therapy (in secret) again cuz my parents took all my savings and refuse to give them to me and they have gps on my phone and i absolutely cannot ask them for help. i live in jordan so basically if youre mentally ill they automatically assume that the devil possessed you :))) i still do occasionally talk to my ex?? therapist and she helps me when i ask her for advice but i doubt that she can prescribe me any meds cuz technically shes not my therapist anymore

&amp;#x200B;

do u think i should just give it a shot and ask my previous therapist for help?? or is there any other way that i can get meds prescribed for free???"
377,Why does it still hurt,"My ex(18f) broke up with me(22m) almost two months ago. For weeks I got obsessed trying to get at least one word out of her. She kept ignoring me and all my questions went unanswered. I tried to leave it but something kept eating at me. 

I did some digging (I know that social media stalking was wrong, but I felt like I needed answers) and I found this guy. It wasn't even that hard. He followed her on everything. I contacted him and indiscriminately asked him if they were together. Turns out he met her just before we broke up. He pretty much has my dream life.

Before my ex broke up with me she actually openly compared me to a guy similar to his description, telling me that a guy she knows has my dream job and a generally better life. She never really supported me in anyway, she always seemed so judgemental when it came to work and finances. 

I tried to just leave it at that and just go on with my life. A couple days later I was overwhelmed by this eating feeling, waking up in the middle of the night not being able to sleep from the intense panic attacks that I've been having since we broke up. At this point I had to confront her. I felt like bursting because of all these negative thoughts going over and over through my head.

So I just mentioned the name of this guy. Basically no reaction. I asked her if she left me for him. Same thing. Then I got really mad and started accusing her of disrespectful and unsympathetic. This triggered a response that I was totally surprised to even witness. 

Her ex (the second before me) contacts me and tells me to leave her alone. All I wanted was a simple answer, it all turn much more confusing. He claimed to be her new boyfriend. I thought that this other guy was the one but he wasn't the 'one'. Turns out she cheated on me with two guys. After this conflict I actually listened to the new 'boyfriend' and just left her alone. I tried to tell both of them that they were being played. None believed me. So I decided that I didn't want anything to do with it and just left it all alone. 

The next day I felt fine, but not long after the anxiety returned, though this time it was different. I had none of these thoughts that were haunting me but these. constant chest pains. I don't feel angry, sad, depressed or even happy. I just felt this pain that I have been experiencing on and off since we broke up. Usually I thought it occurred because I would start to continuously miss my ex. Now it's just the pain and I barely think of her at all.

For the first time in a while I feel better but some part of me still has something hurting."
378,How to help friend developing agoraphobia.,"Ok so a close friend of mine has become increasingly distant since the COVID outbreak. It’s to the point that she will not answer phone calls at all, will not leave her house and pretends to not be home whenever I (or anyone) come over. I’ve reached out to other mutual friends and nobody is really hearing from her. I am very concerned and have offered to help but either ignores the text or states she just wants to be left alone. I’ve been patient but am getting very worried. I know she had problems with anxiety/agoraphobia in the past and I think this is the same thing. I’m just not sure if/how I can help her.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to go about it?"
379,What was rock bottom for you and how did you manage to climb out of it?., I feel like I've hit rock bottom or very close to it so I'm asking. Theres soo many problems and I'm so confused about soo many things. I just turned 18 a year ago and from there its been a slow and steady decline for me so I wonder what was rock bottom for you.
380,Really just need to say I'm tired and how its becoming unbearable to be in my head,"I'm just writing this to vent I guess. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. I notice all my behaviors and am just sick of them. I don't ever see myself being in a relationship because all I want to do is control and manipulate people. If I'm shown even the least bit of attention by a female I become obsessed. I'm working 15 hours a day because I have a need to feel productive I guess. I'm struggling to sleep at night because my mind won't shut down and I wake up with my teeth clenched like a vice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my mid 20s now and over 3 1/2 years clean off drugs and I hate even mentioning it because it makes me feel like such a bitch. I figured that would be important to add here. I just need my mind to shut off and go into rest mode for awhile. I'm constantly worried about living a short life because I'm constantly anxious and overweight, I have high-blood pressure as a result of this. 

It's becoming hard for me to see drastic changes at this point. I work dead-end jobs and have no college degree, which I don't even think I want one. This feels selfish because I have enough money to quit working and put myself through school. I really don't know if college is the route for me though. I tell people this and the only answer is to get into a trade and earn a pension. Frankly I'm probably just an egotistical asshole but I struggle with the idea. I don't know, I have no hobbies or really any interests even, so how am I supposed to know what I want to do? I'm getting older and feel like I'm just going to miss everything. I've never had a girlfriend or been in any kind of relationship because I can't stand the obsessive feelings they give me. It is horribly unbearable, I yearn just to hug someone and be happy and content in their company. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just spilling every thought in my head into this post. so much more I could say but I'm so tired that I need to tune out for a bit. This is probably really cringy to read. sorry about that."
381,"Things aren't terrible, but certainly not great either.","Because of my mental health I know my future realistically will be me just existing for the rest of my life for my family's sake. The only thing valuable to me is them and all I wish for is that they live a good life. I think I will only get worse mentally, but I try not to also for my family's sake.

All I do is be anxious, worried about my loved ones, mildly to moderately depressed and exist."
382,The urge to want to die is getting stronger,"I've realized now that I need to go back to school and learn something useful that will help me land a safe career. The only problem is that I have no idea on what to study. I've tried college in the past and failed at it. I've tried learning different subjects while I was in school and also on my own, but I never found anything I liked. I've been doing this for almost 10 years and I'm still lost. The subjects I tried learning in these past 10 year have been: Graphic design, marketing, accounting/finance, IT, coding, business admin, HR, and medical. I was pretty interested in learning about each of them in the beginning, but then I found them to be boring or extremely confusing towards the end, so I just ended up quitting on each of those topics. 

I'm 27 now and I've been working 2 soul crushing jobs for the past 6 months. I can't be doing this because the jobs I work at are low paying and also pretty useless. I feel like one of them (call center rep) won't even be here in the next 15 years. My other job (bar tender) will probably still be around in the next 10 years, but I really don't want to be doing this anymore. It's a soul sucking job that's slowly turning me into a drunk. 

I have to be at my second job in about 2 hours. I'm just so tired of this shit. I just want to die. Like, how the fuck do people enjoy what they do for a living? I wish I could just find something that pays decent and that doesn't kill my soul. I think about killing myself every single day. I feel like I'll do eventually."
383,Important things to do but I have zero motivation,"I feel like I'm just being lazy even though I really am trying not to be. I am doing school online and there's assignments and studying I should be getting on with, and the annoying thing is that I KNOW I'll be less stressed in the future if I just get them done now. But something in my head is telling me that I would rather lay in bed doing nothing and let all my depressing thoughts brew up. Part of my mind, I guess, is feeling overwhelmed with the current state of everything and is thinking 'what even is the point of thinking about my future when it's so unpredictable?'. I just don't know how to get out of this useless cycle. I feel like I'm not getting anywhere but I also don't really have the motivation to get anywhere - but I know my future self would be annoyed at the current me."

385,Self Sabotage,"Hello. I don’t want to say that I was bullied in middle school because it never got physical but I did get laughed at and ignored when I wasn’t being humiliated. I didn’t take any of it too serious but it still kind of hurt. I didn’t let it take over my life at all. Until I realize I did. This behavior sparked a fire inside me with an attitude like “Prove them wrong” which is awesome but not for me it has gone too far. I now only want to jobs and careers that in my mind will make people “awe” and be like “ooh look at him” for example. 

1.) I want join the Army, however after some self analysis I realized the only reason I want to join is so people can look at like i’m actually doing something in life and look cool (I know this is far from the truth) despite the constant harassment and PT I would have to do. I was never an athletic person but Im still willing to join just for the way others will look at me 

2.) I want to become a famous musician so people can see me while they are at their boring work. 

I guess what Im looking for is validation, however I wrote this because I need some help trying to combat this need for people to look at in “awe” because its making me chase things I don’t  want."
386,Defying Odds,"This is a summary of my life and how I progressed to defy odds. My childhood was not like 'normal' children's. I was the quietest and the most immobile child you could ever see. In the early years of school I was mute and physically slow. My teachers thought that I had low IQ because I was such unresponsive so they refered me to a psychiatrist to give me an IQ test. However, it turned out that I'm gifted as I scored in top 2% of population. Moreover, I got diagnosed with autism, attention deficit disorder and selective mutism. My parents never fully accepted my diagnosis so they didn't search out for further treatment. I got good grades but I felt physically unable to raise my hand and ask a question in class. Also, I had been a loner most of my school life because I felt physically unable to speak. I was devastated because I was blended in the background and forgotten there in school, I sometimes wanted to vanish like a perfume spreading through the air and escaping from the window. My existence had been dismissed most of the time. I have always felt like a misfit. Selective mutism is extremely underrated, as most people don't even heard of the name of this, they tend to assume that mute people are just stubborn, arrogant, rude, boring or stupid. As I've never taken treatment for selective mutism, I'm still trying to overcome this in spite of people mocking me. I was completely mute in early childhood then in my late childhood and the beginning of my teenage years I became able to say approximately 10 words every day in school, by the time passing words turned into sentences and sentences turned into paragraphs. Now I'm 20 (about to turn 21) and in college I'm able to talk in class, even sometimes join debates, and make articulate presentations in front of class, and have conversations with friends. However, I still can't say that I overcome selective mutism 100%, there are still times that I feel physically stuck to talk but they happen much less. Despite this, I'm still untalkative compared to an average person. Also having autism makes it hard for me to understand social dynamics of groups and relationships, I still have problems with facial expressions, tone of voice and body language so I might appear socially awkward. Regardless of the struggles I face, I'm still hopeful about my journey as I'm improving myself. I might not had been be able to run as neurotypical people at the start of my journey but I first learnt how to crawl and now I can stand on my own feet and one day I'll run. Impossible is the product of our minds, if we don't believe that things are impossible, they'll become possible. I wanted to share my story to remind you that you can do anything you put your mind into. Even if it seems like you are going two steps forward but one step back each time, keep going because sooner or later you'll reach your destination. 🤗"
387,Struggling to find a reason to stay alive.. What's the point anymore..,.😔😪😢
388,"I'm very hyper right now, but also depressed? Is this normal.","For a while I've felt very depressed, and all of a sudden today I am extremely hyper, almost like I can't sit still. Even writing this on my bed I'm bouncing up and down a little just to keep moving. I'm still constantly thinking about depressing things, but I'm laughing and acting very unlike me. Kind of happened Monday too, not this extreme though. I also feel a weird feeling kind of like when you are nervous about something for some reason. Is this normal or a sign of something?"
389,I’m so confused,"TW: BREIF MENTION OF SUICIDE
 
((Heres a little bit of a backstory: 
I have been diagnosed with GAD since 13 and have struggled on and off since then. I was hospitalized at 16 for attempting suicide by overdose. ))

a few days ago, i (F19) went to the hospital and admitted myself to get formed for the psychiatric facility. I did this because earlier that day i made a huge Facebook post about how i can’t handle my depression and anxiety anymore and i was reaching out there as my final hope. Recently, my anxiety and depression have gotten so bad and i have no self confidence like i did last year. It’s like i gained 6 pounds this year and all of the sudden i think I’m huge and I’m more scared to go out or be around other humans. 

So anyway, i admitted myself because i felt like i tried everything; counselling, seeing my doctor, taking a leave of absence from work, trying to connect to my school counsellor, I’m in line for CBT, etc. They kept me in the psychiatric ward for 24 hours then let me go with 2 new diagnoses and 2 new prescriptions. 

Now I’m home and just confused. Nothing feels better. My sister was the main cause of me heading to the hospital the other day. She threatened to punch me in the face randomly and it sent me spiralling into the thoughts of suicide and me being worthless. I don’t know why i reacted that way. Today the same sort of thing happened, my sister was being rude to me and it’s made me suddenly super anxious and depressed. I all of the sudden feel like i don’t deserve to live all just because she said she was going to pour out my drink that was in the fridge in a mean way. I know my anger and irritability are caused by my anxiety and depression but when someone bothers me like that it makes my brain spiral out of control and makes me feel like i wanna just die. 

Idk if any of this makes sense because it doesn’t to me and I’m just confused. How do i get better and be able to deal with my sisters rudeness because it’s mainly her that causes me to snap. I’m just so confused and don’t wanna be depressed and anxious and all of this makes it worse."
390,i might be getting hospitalized. does anyone have any tips for me?,"they think I should be hospitalised because of how suicidal I am. 

i have anorexia, and I am worried they will force me to eat? will they do that? I really don't want them to :(

do I need to pack anything specific? 

I live in Scotland, so I'm not sure if they do anything differently to other places"
391,Struggling Everyday,"This past year I've learned a lot about setting my own boundaries with people. I've also learned the value of being more open with people who I can trust and less open with people who make me feel uncomfortable. I was an emotional sponge for many people for many years and, in turn, I'm sure others have soaked up emotions from me. 

The act of setting boundaries in my life has been a really difficult one. I've always felt extremely powerless when it comes to getting what I want out of relationships. I've always felt like people are conducting relationships with me on their terms and not on mine so for a while I tried to make it all on my terms and it worked but it was A) Exhausting and B) It prevented some of the better relationships in my life to flourish. 

I'm still trying to learn how to have boundaries that are strong but also not so strong that they cut stuff out completely."
392,How do you guys have friends that are interested in what you like and vice versa?,I'd kill for that
393,AAAAUGH,Im going to my cousins house for a harry potter marathon and I have this heavy pit of anxiety in my stomach even though I know nothing bad is gonna happen uuuggh why do I have to be this way
394,How to deal with an MFM threesome with wife and reduced self confidence and sex life afterwards,"So even on a throwaway I really don’t feel comfortable saying this but I’m deeply struggling with this and feel very alone in the world with my problem.

Stupidly, and I can’t stress that enough. Me and my wife had a threesome with a male friend of ours and it eats me every day.

First of all, I kind of initiated it and I 100% agreed to it.

I won’t go into too many haunting details but the whole MFM thing was a kink of ours for sometime and stemmed from me initially. We had an opportunity and took it and although it wasn’t a complete flop (although it had its moments) I am now deeply struggling with the fact and our actions and it’s having serious implications on my mental health and potentially marriage.

Since the event, our sex life has retracted quite a lot, I’d usually be happy for sex at any given moment with my wife and would more often than not initiate it. We would usually have sex 2-4 times a week and now it’s barely once a fortnight and on top of that, it’s usually my wife initiating now as although I still want sex, need the release and need the intimacy, I cannot bring myself to even try. It’s as if I’ve killed that Avenue with my wife. I can’t bring myself to initiate it, I feel ashamed, regretful and I’m literally haunted by it. I know it’s nothing I haven’t brought upon myself but I can’t shake negative thoughts and feelings towards myself and my wife. It’s a real ‘what have I done?’ Moment in my life. For the record it happened around 7 months ago, it’s still not going away for me.

Like I said, I am not overly happy or confident talking about it openly, hell I have stopped even taking to my wife about my struggles through fear of her realising I am no longer happy and to avoid yet another conflict about it. If someone can DM me who may have experience with something similar (infidelity, shame, low self confidence, sex problems) I’d like to figure out how I stop beating myself up every day and can try and enjoy my life which on paper from an observer should be perfect."
395,Do 1-on-1 virtual casual hangouts with new people exist?,"Was just thinking about this yesterday - everyone is way more isolated than before. People are divorced, feeling uninspired or unable to break out of their friend or family groups, pressured to always ""catch up"" when they really just want someone new-ish to have coffee, or work on a puzzle or do some yoga with. Is there any kind of meet-up platform that lets you schedule some 1-on-1 time with someone without judgement or expectation for romance, etc.?

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I know there are so many amazing online communities, but hanging on Twitch can only be so personal. Thoughts? Thank you everyone :)"
396,What could be my issue?,"Hello, I'm a 15 year old M having some issue's that a psychiatrist, couldn't solve.

I have had issues with focussing myself on stuff like school instructions, when someone is talking or remembering tasks at home, like keeping the bathroom clean, or locking the door. I also have a very different view on things then other people, I am a social outcast and I have trouble making friends or regular social interactions. My parents just keep screaming at me, calling me crazy and saying I am a  psychopath, while I actually empathize with people very strongly and care alot about the friends I currently have, I just have trouble expressing my emotions. As you see in me typing this message I have trouble organizing, and remembering. I don't know if this text makes sense but this is a shot in the dark trying to get some help as my parents wont provide me with any."
397,I'm always bored,I'm 16 and I have conduct disorder I have had it for awhile now and just need a place to vent. My life has been shit for as long as I can remember both my parents have ASPD and they were abusive for a long time. I use to get my ass beat on a daily basis. For as long as i can remember i have been bored the only things that entertain me is when I get adrenaline. I dont really care about having friends or relationships I dont really feel anything for people. I wish I was not bored constantly. I am a very emotional numb person most of the time I just pretend to be someone I'm not that's how it's been my whole life. I have never really had friends. I really dont know what to do I just need a place to vent I'm bored constantly and really don't know what to do.

399,I think I'm retarded,"I always had struggle at understanding stuff, making decisions and assimilating fast informations, I can't even learn from a text or a video (also talks irl) in a reasonable amout of time, this added to my extremely low attention span, but that's even another problem.

I watch my classmates while they understand and learn trying at max two times, and when they try to teach me using also the book I take half an hour just to understand one short paragraph, that I will anyway forget 10 minutes later.

400,I’m fucking mad at this girl I liked!,"No! It is not because she rejected me! It was about her attitude. Months ago… She said she wasn’t into me. Cool, whatever. Months later I said I appreciated her and she was cute. She fucking sent an angry emoji at me saying she was cute. WTF? We talk through it, I just tell her I had feelings and stuff, cool.

A few days later, today, I ask if it was ‘bad’ that I liked her. She said no but we’ll only ever be friends. I say cool. Then she said ‘that’s good because relationships end? And I’m like.... what? Pretty sure she told me she had ‘a few’ fuck buddies or whatever, or at least implied it awhile back, so I asked didn’t she have multiple partners awhile back?

Then she sent an angry emoji and said no. I apologized and said I misinterpreted I guess. Then she said:

&gt; Oh just accept my rejection with dignity and grace.

&gt; Uhh.... I’m not asking you out though? 

Then I told her this conversation was getting really weird and awkward and I don’t even know why I’m talking to someone who was fucking *mad* at me saying they’re cute.

Then she said I ‘wanted to debate it’ and I said no, I’m expressing how I feel. Then she said I was insulting her?

&gt; Oh you insulted me by saying there was no point in liking me and you implied I’m not worth talking to cuz I didn’t like it when you said I was cute.

Now she’s mad at me saying there’s no point in liking her! WTF? This is absolutely absurd. I thought about blocking her and telling her she’s a fucking weird person but came back to my senses, sent a sad emoji, and wished her a good day."
401,How can i still pas first year of college,"I think i might have ADD. The last 2 months i had major issues with concentration. What worries me the most, is i have 0 motivation. The first two months were great but after that i began to skip stuff, being on phone not making homework. I hate it, i was so motivated and now it's unlikely that i even pass the first semester. I always had issues with concentration but never went to the doctor. Everyone thinks im just lazy when i have no more energy to do something. I HATE IT. My parents didn't even consider sending me to the doctor when i almost failed school. So my question is, is there any possibility i make it through the first year? Im having finals in February and planning to go to the doctor next week."
402,People who don’t understand.,"I can’t stand people who don’t “get” mental illness, the people who’ve never ever experienced it themselves so they diminish other people’s feelings who do struggle with mental health issues. Like my family. My father has never dealt with mental health issued and has never understood why I feel the ways I do, hes tried but not really. And as for my siblings, idk if they really care. I know they too have their own struggles too but, we’ve been through different things. So they don’t really get it either. So all of them judge me. Im currently not working because if lockdown, Im in temporary lay off so my days consist of no structure and just misery, only thing that makes it better is my boyfriend is staying with us. I wanna be able to go back to work, for lockdown to be over for covid to be over so I can go back to work and save money to move out, so I can take my boyfriend to his appointments we need to set up for him. So I can get my license so I dont need to rely in others to get places and or do things. Important adult things. They don’t understand what we’ve been through and how it makes us feel. And they judge us for the ways we choose to help cope and heal (we were both prescribed medicinal marijuana) and its si stressful and frustrating!! It’s becoming so hard to deal with. Living at home. With my dad. Its not that I have anything to wrong with my dad and brothers. But my dad is kinda old fashioned in someways, just not very open minded or accepting and just being here and not having our own space is not a great feeling"
403,At least I am sticking with learning French,"quand j'etais petit, j'etais bien, mais je ne serai rien bien plustemps, je moi deteste. je suis pareseuse, je suis stupide, je ne suis pas sympa, je suis fou, et je suis cassé

I got the doctor to put me back on Antidepressants this week, after years without them. I found the previous popping out while I was doing some French language practice.

Unemployment has run out. No job. Moved out to a very rural area, to help take care of my old dad who hasn't bounced back very well from cancer treatment. 

But I have been down in the shit before. If you're going through shit, keep moving, because that is not where you want to live. That would be my advice to anyone. Remembering that anyone includes me should not be that hard."
404,"Met up with best friends, now I feel lonelier than ever","So I hung out with some of my best friends today (adhered to COVID rules, stayed careful, and it's safe where I live). They're the nicest people and while I was with them I had the greatest time. We just talked for hours, that's all. But now that I'm back home this sudden feeling of utter loneliness has washed over me. And this isn't the first time that's happened. Logically I keep telling myself that I have these people that love me, and that I am NOT alone. But that doesn't make the loneliness go away at all. It's this mindless loop of hating myself for feeling this way and then realising I'm being stupid and then questioning why I feel this way at all because ""hey if all's good you shouldn't have these thoughts deep in your mind"".  I don't know what to do."
405,I don’t post pornography,I just got banned from I can draw that. I never wanted to post pornography in the first place. I’m a Christian and I never wanted to be cruel. I am a nice person once you get to me but instead A username name Crystal Lord and other usernames say I need help. And now thanks to them I’m about to commit suicide. Reddit is the place where they piss you off and let you take your own life without even letting you get a chance to your side of stuff. And nobody better not banned me because I’m telling my feelings!
406,I cleaned my living room and craft room for the first time in over a month,"I took down Xmas
All the boxes and bags and wrapping paper from Xmas was still in my living room because I was having anxiety about cleaning it (covid related anxiety about if the items were clean and OCD related anxiety about insuring I clean it all correctly)
It took a lot of will power and build up but I finally cleaned it and it looks so nice
I even set up my easel I got for an Xmas present and I am feeling inspired to paint

I’m really proud of myself, this took a lot out of me 💕"
407,Wanting a near death experience,I keep thinking about this I don’t know if anyone else can relate or not. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed I’m just really not motivated to do anything with my life. I got all these dreams of going places and achieving great things but I can’t get myself to do any of it. I kind of just sit around wasting my time. I just need something to motivate me. Like death you know. I need something that could possibly kill me to get me where I want to go. Therapy doesn’t work for me at all. I seriously started thinking it’s the only way I’ll ever start to enjoy my life. Besides that to know some people do actually care about me. I got terrible abandonment issues and I feel like everybody continuously lies to me about caring about me because nobody will ever care as much as I do. Idk
408,Studying with Chronic Depression,"To those studying with a mental illness, how do you do it? 
I have had chronic severe depression for years now, as well as a newer but really debilitating anxiety disorder. I love studying, and am in my second year of a genetics degree. This is my fourth attempt at studying in the same amount of years and I graduated HS in 2016, so I don't have a good track record.
So far, every semester I've done I hit a road block a couple weeks in and can't recover from it. This year was definitely weird bc of corona, but even in cases where there isn't a pandemic, I still struggle. 
How do you keep yourself motivated, healthy and safe during study semesters? 
I'm on antidepressants, have a therapist and try to partake in the usual self-care activities (yoga, meditation, eating well) but find myself in this pattern of failure anyway. 

Please I'm desperate for some help!"
409,I matter to nobody,"Before I start, I just want to apologize for this being so damn edgy, but I wrote this during an emotional fit and I just can't be bothered to go over this again and fix this. Enojy.

I am nothing but a burden. Literally no one wants to spend time with me, and altough this may sound like simple whining, it hurts, because not only am I an extrovert that likes socilizing, I'm also trying really hard to make friends. I really wish someone would ask how I feel, I really want to tell someone about this, but no one will ever ask. And I don't want to come to people, because I don't want to be a burden. I feel like if I stopped being social, cheerful and happy all the time, no one would notice or care. I matter to nobody. And nobody cares. And even if I came to my family about this, they'd just dismiss me, because I'm in puberty. And I'm aware of this, I know this is a phase, but identifying a problem and doing nothing about it does surprisingly nothing. I just want this to pass. I just want someone to tell me, that I matter to them, at least a little bit. I mean, why should people actually care? Others have it so much worse that I shouldn't be even whining about this"
410,Feeling stuck and lonely again,"I'm (27F) feeling stuck again in my mental health.

About 6 years ago I started having problems with depression and social anxiety. At the time I couldn't get out of bed, let alone get anything done. I had stopped going to classes and I couldn't get a job because I had panic attacks any time I tried to get out of my house (even to do basic things like groceries).

I was very lucky and am very thankful for my mom and my boyfriend, that have been really supportive and have tried to help me as much as they can (still do).

I decided in 2020 to start again with university where I had left off (*very slowly*) and I also got a job related to my field of study (currently working from home due to covid). My doctor suggested (beginning of 2020, pre quarantine) that I stop taking my anti-depressants, so I did.

Things have gotten better and I've made progress, but still I feel stuck, and very lonely.

I live with my boyfriend but his work shifts are quite complicated and he's usually not around. My mom lives in another city so I can't see her very often. I spend most of my days alone at home. If it's a workday, I don't mind as much because I have something to keep my mind busy. But after my day is over or on weekends I just feel like shit all of the time. 

Socially, I feel like I still don't know how to interact with people. I'm 27 and there are basic social situations that I can't handle. I've been so depressed and insecure for so long that I constantly feel I'm carrying that negativity with me, so I try to not talk about myself, and I'm always doubting myself whenever I try to say anything, even if it's small talk. Usually if I'm in a group I end up not speaking at all.  From outside it might just seem like I'm shy or uninterested in the conversation. In reality, I'm just trying not to panic. I feel like I can't make any friends.

On some days I don't eat because I don't have the energy to cook for myself. Last week I spent two whole days without lunch or dinner, because I honestly wasn't feeling hungry. I either can't sleep at night or can't wake up after 10 hrs of sleep. I feel alone and I can't get any motivation to do anything else like studying. 

My boyfriend doesn't know of this because when he's here, we are always together and I have a bit more motivation to do everyday stuff, and I don't want to burden him on the only 2 days he can be at home.

I feel like I can't live alone or be by myself. I try to suck it up because I know people have their own stuff to deal with plus, I don't want to be that person that is always complaining but the truth is I don't know how to feel better, make any friends or get along with my ""responsible adult life"".

I recognize I've made a huge improvement from where I started but I still feel like I have nothing to offer about myself.

I've changed therapists several times, recently starting a cognitive approach but I feel I'm stuck again."
411,I have a sense of pressure to choose/invest into a career.,"I (14M) feel more and more pressure builds on me as I think about what career I should invest in. In general when I think of someone famous or someone who has really done or is doing a amazing feat usually it’s because they did that specific thing in their childhood, for example Mozart has been a great musician from his young age, Nadia Comăneci who scored a perfect ten in gymnastics, etc. 

Most of my friends/family say I'm good at a lot. A friend says I can make a 3D model in blender well, another says I can draw nicely, another talks about how I have a good sense of humour and jokes, and so on. At some point I'm gonna have to pick one of these and my general idea is that the earlier I do something I excel at, the better it is, and nothing clicked for me yet. 

For about 2 years this has lingered in my head and I don't know how to cope with it, just leaving me with a bad feeling of ""not being good enough"" or ""I'll never be something in the world"". 

I have talked about it with my parents but no solution has been figured out. I thought this subreddit might help and here I am, at almost 2 AM, asking for help."
412,Paranoid about dying before accomplishing dreams,"There are a bunch of things I want to do and I keep feeling like I have to do it right now before I die in a freak accident or something.  But because of covid I feel like I have to wait and it’s eating me up inside.  Like a lot.

It’s making simple decisions impossible because I don’t know if I should account for what my goals are or ignore them while I wait for covid to pass.   It’s also making me afraid I’ll regret it if I don’t act on my goals now regardless of covid and just wait, because what if I wait too long and then something else happens and I blew my only chance? I can’t focus or completely relax or, like I said, make decisions.  I’m just frozen in place ruminating all the time.

How do I deal with this? I can’t take it anymore."
413,My ex coworker committed suicide and I've not stopped thinking about it,"I've never really used Reddit for posts but I thought it would be helpful to maybe write a post of what's been on my mind. 

Yesterday I heard some news that my ex coworker committed suicide during the Christmas period of 2020. He was in his late 30's. He had children and he was the nicest person I've worked with. He would always stick up for anyone in the workplace and helped anyone at any moment. You would never of thought he was struggling.

I started my work on August 2019, he left for another job on December 2019 but eventually came back then left again. I kept in touch with him. It wasn't as if he was a close friend but when I heard the news it hit everyone in the workplace. It's not been off my mind. After everything he's had going on, I hope that he's in a better place and has found peace.

I've struggled with mental health for years, I've always had bad anxiety issues, I've not got a bad life. But it just shows that you never know what's going on in people's heads.

The night before I heard the news about my ex coworker. I was chatting to a friend and she told me her cousin committed suicide recently.

Mental health is a serious issue and it's getting worse. I hope the best for everyone that struggles with mental health. If you ever get thoughts about harming yourself or committing suicide, please get help or talk to someone. You matter. The world can be a cruel place and sometimes people think its the easiest way out. But the world has a lot to offer for you and it can be beautiful as well, life is worth living. The world can come across dark but there's always a light."
414,"I am in a constant cycle of feeling productive, procrastinating and feeling guilty","My hobby is screenplay writing. It’s always the same way... I get the spark to read, study and work on my many scheduled projects (I have like 8 since 2019). After that my focus time becomes lower and lower and then I am straight up doing nothing, or worse, start another project all of a sudden. Then I kind of feel guilty and quit. I’ve tried everything — phone reminders, daily lists, the pomodoro technique, macha tea, coffee, energetics, nothing does it for me. Help? I feel like it’s destroying me from the inside... but I really love this hobby and I am passionate about it, it wasn’t always like that."
415,Tell me a reason not to kill myself,"Iam just in the worst phase. I see my best friends getting depressed, iam also depressed what's good in life anyways. Nietzsche was right :God is dead and we killed him"
416,Please read for someone else's sake,"A few hours ago, this girl who I hadn't spoke to in ages started talking in dms. She had seen me recently and I used to know her very well. However, she seemed to be in a bad place. Going through tough times with her friends, school and a break up plus not enjoying her hobbies and quitting them. She says that she has got anxious quite a bit and I was just looking for some advice.

417,Mental health intake appointment coming up but I don’t know how to organize my thoughts. Finally getting treatment but nervous.,"Hi I have always had some kind of mental illness for as long as I can remember but now that I’m a mother and wife and it is interfering with how I perceive myself and others, I have decided to reach out. I kept calling until I got a response. The first step is done and now I’m preparing to talk to someone to determine what, if any services I need. During the intake appointment they ask more thorough questions, I guess according to what I was told. But now I have nerves that maybe I don’t have a mental health issue and maybe I’m making excuses and maybe they will brush me off. I also suck at organizing my thoughts. Every day conversations are like a tree trunk with a million branches but the branches belong to different species of tree. So I can’t even organize thoughts in normal conversations. I often get misunderstood online and have to edit and re edit what I’m saying in forums to get the picture in my mind down clearly. Now I have to talk to a professional about my mental health and I’m nervous I’m not going to know how to do this. 
I could write it down on paper or on my phone but the paper would definitely be lost before the interview. That’s part of my mental health issue, my memory is shot, I misplace everything. Example If I set my phone down and leave the room, that’s it. My brain forgot. I use find my device apps way too much. I call it probably 15 times a day. Another issue besides disorganised thoughts and misplaced things and shot memory is my overreaction to things. I overreact to misplaced items. I cry actual tears because I can’t recall where I set things and feel worthless and dumb.  I can’t drive because of my anxiety and inability to focus on all the things your brain has to do in order to safely drive. So I’m dependent on mass transit and other people. I’m a mom and can’t take my kids places without my husband having time off work to do the driving or unless I want to take them by bus everywhere. Not bad but still I can’t imagine how freeing it would be to just take a drive when I need or want. I don’t envision myself as lazy but my house constantly falls apart even with frequent cleanings. I think of myself as a person who wants to do better but I can’t figure it out. I always wish I had what other moms and dads have where they just know what to do. I’ve dumped $100s of dollars into motivational diaries and planners. Thinking if I see it written out I have to do it. That works for 3-4 weeks and I feel empowered but then something happens and my brain shuts down again. I can’t focus, can’t figure it out. Feel anxious and then tired, like the wind was knocked out of me. I figure napping will give me a second wind so I nap it off but it doesn’t work. I’m still in a funk. I don’t know if it’s depression but I know I’m better than this but I’m trapped in my mind. I know I can do colleges level work but I’ve dropped several times from anxiety and feeling like I couldn’t get through another class for whatever dumb reason I don’t even know . I want to be better. I want to feel like a normal adult. I want to stop crying or panicking over the stupid stuff. I want to stop screaming into a pillow and considering myself worthless and dumb every time a little setback happens. I know other adults don’t rage quit their day if they don’t remember where the car keys are or if they clumsily spill the milk or forget an appointment. But I do and I’m sick of me. But I’m nervous that it’s all going to amount to me being beyond help or being just an unmotivated dolt. This post is probably disorganised. Sorry it’s so long. If you have gotten this far, thanks. Ask for clarification if needed. I won’t be offended. I know I’m not always clear."
418,How can I tell if I (f/23) have high-functioning anxiety or not?,"I've always been an ""A-type"" person even as a child. Lately, adulting (along with starting Grad school) has seriously opened my eyes to the state of my mental health and has also challenged my ability to control my stress/anxiety levels.

I have always had the tendency to overthink (almost everything), assume people are judging me, feel an urge to plan ahead (if I don't I will feel stressed), need to have control over situations, generally do not like change of any sort, and on some nights have trouble falling asleep. Lately (especially since my grad school started), I've noticed my heart racing more (especially while lying down at night), chest tightness, and headaches. I can't tell if this is GAD, high functioning anxiety, or me just not doing enough to calm my mind (yoga, get outside, eat super healthy, etc). 

For those of you who do have high functioning anxiety-what is your day-to-day like? How did you find out you had high-functioning anxiety? What did you struggle with the most?"
419,How does one find out what’s wrong with them?,I know there is a problem with my mental health. The issues is idk what it could be or what to do.
420,Ever turn off those thoughts and emotions? That still helps the most. I still recommend. If only I could do that again.,It got a lot harder to do. Bravo to those of you who can turn off your emotions and thoughts 100%
421,"How to ""do"" therapy?","I know I need therapy. I'm currently trying to get a first appointment, a pain in the ass due to local healthcare but it is what it is. My main problem is, I don't know how to get anything out of therapy. Based on attempts in the past, I just clam up, unable to speak openly about my actual problems. I'm unable to admit to feeling negative emotions, or being a bad person, to doing anything actually wrong, and I don't know how to open up.

For reference, I've been tentatively diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder, as well as being autistic and transgender. I've also struggled with eating disorders, substance abuse and suicidal ideation, without ever admitting this to anyone. One factor is that I know friends who have been materially punished for admitting things I'm struggling with - fellow trans people being restricted from medical transition due to being ""non-functional"" in general society due to being mentally ill, mandatory rehab for even trying recreational drugs once, etc. 

I don't know how to reconcile the part of me desperately needing professional help, and the part needing to hide so many critical aspects of the causes of my problems. I'm sure there's a lot I could safely open up about, and get help dealing with, but I just have no idea how to even begin that process. I'm noticing even in this post I'm making excuses for how I keep things to myself, using a broken health care system to cover up for my issues that would not land me in trouble, I don't even realise I'm lying until later, and by then I'm too scared to correct myself. I just need a kick in the ass to get better at being in therapy!"
422,Feeling hopeless,"Why do I feel this way? I can’t be myself around others, I’m riddled with social anxiety and self-esteem issues, I feel like a burden to everyone and lose respect for myself for not doing anything about the situation. I quit school a few days ago and am now trying to part ways with an angel of a girl who has BPD who I liked for the longest time. Perhaps this is my karma in some sense. I’m hopeless for the future and don’t know what to do next. Anyone out there with advice on my situation?"

Please delete if not allowed.

I have a therapist I trust. I stopped taking my medications because they provided little benefit for me. I've gained lots of weight from a combination of factors, including medications (specifically anti-depressants and stimulant).

I am currently with my parents. I told my mom I wanted to move out of their apartment and guess what? My mom threatened to call the police on me and admit me to a psychiatric ward. I have no choice but to stay with them until I graduate and move out for good.

My depression has been spiraling for the past couple of days due to various factors. One of them is waiting for the inevitable rejections from graduate school programs. Another is my current family situation. Thirdly, I continue to live with my emotionally abusive parents. Fourth, I have no one in real life to talk to about this except for people on the Internet. Fifth, every time I try to open up, I either get ignored, gaslighted by other people, or yelled at for being ungrateful.

Sorry for the long vent."
424,TW relapse,"I relapsed in self harm. I cut maybe 6 times and then went into a panic attack when I realized what I’d done. It’s been about two hours. I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to, it was a slip, I don’t even use marker on my hands anymore, I don’t like to do that to my skin. I don’t want to self harm. I don’t know what happened. I’m scared."

426,Mental health issues during PMS only,"I’m in the US. I’m 38 and have had three c-sections. We have two healthy boys and my last pregnancy ended with an ectopic pregnancy, resulting basically in a c- section. This was precisely a year ago so our year started terrible and got worse with the pandemic of course. My husband got laid off mid year last year because the work he does dried up in our area. Financially we have been just ok. It could be worse but it’s the insurance I worry about. We started our own company and are with a local union and still have insurance but if he doesn’t find enough work, we have to shell out for it. I never really suffered from PMS before but now I do after losing a baby we wanted. I’m basically mentally upside down every two weeks since I have PMS now and then during my period. I don’t take birth control because it messes me up. I don’t eat right and need to lose about 50 lbs. I can’t really get out to work out because our boys are so young and need attention for 14hrs a day. My husband helps a ton but I would feel so guilty leaving them 4x a week to go to the gym. I have no space to work out at home and don’t what to do. I read online that taking calcium and B vitamins could help. I’m planning on trying to lose weight with diet. I want to exercise but I’m so tied down. I know people would suggest yoga but that’s not my cup of tea. I have thought about doing other sorts of stretches though. I’m fine when it’s not period time but during that time of the month a dark cloud hangs over my head. Anyone else have worse periods after having kids?"
427,"""My"" voice in my head is not really mine","I don't know if its the right sub for this but i can't wait any longer
I have two voices in my head, both are mine, well were is the better word
The first is the normal voice you hear in your head and i have full Control over it 
The second one is much worse 
It appears randomly, mostly when i think about something and it quicky follows up with something (don't really have a word for it, let's just say it's really good at it) It wasn't a problem until recently, it was actually usefull and nice some time ago, like a friend in my head you know? 
But then it changed to more ""drastic"", the best example would be the weird change from ""you will live through it, like always"" to saying that sucide is the way 
It's really harsh and sarcastic and it sometimes doesnt  shut up (i could make it shut up some time ago) 
I'm just tired of the constant fight in my head, between ME and MYSELF 
I can't do it much longer and the worst think, after all this time when it helped me, I AM starting to think that it's right yet again. I wont last much longer but i don't know what to do I don't think i want to die yet, but its starting to look better than this 
What should I do? If i follow the voice will it shut up already? If it somehow helps i'm 16, male."
428,I finally showered and got dressed today and now I feel I am done,"The last couple of weeks/months I have really been struggling to do anything just out of pure laziness. I have barely any memory or anything to show for the past 5 weeks of my life. And today I got up early-ish had breakfast went for a walk showered got dressed into day clothed, put on 2 loads of washing brought my dog to the pet shop to get her something nice and then came home and mad dinner for my family. I’ve now gone into my room and attempted to tidy it but I just couldn’t bring myself to and now I am on my phone in the middle of my bed with stuff everywhere thinking about every mistake I’ve ever made and how easy it would be to walk out of my house in the freezing cold in the middle of the night and just walk until I don’t know where I am. I just genuinely feel so lost and empty but also fulfilled? Because I washed myself I just feel I have accomplished everything I need to do I’m my life and the thing is I was in the best mood all day until I entered my bedroom. I started talking to a couple of friends I had lost contact with and now I feel I’m unable to continue conversating with anyone. People kept telling me it’s going to get better and it did but it lasted 12 hours and it’s gone again I just don’t know what to do someone please help"
429,I think my brother is depressed,"But he's putting off getting help, and I'm not sure how to convince him to do so. Has anyone successfully encouraged/convinced a loved one to pursue professional mental help?

I'll start by saying I'm not trying to diagnose him, but he's used the words himself over the past few months.

Long story short this last year has ruined a lot of his plans and has got him feeling a bit despondent about life. 

He's 28, single, a virgin, never dated, working in a job he hates, has put on a few pounds during lockdown, can't work out, and we're all stuck in the house with our parents. These are all things he's said he's unhappy about and is struggling to change on his own.

He keeps complaining about his situation, which I totally get isn't fun, but also keeps making excuses about why he's not getting help. Now he did go to therapy for a short while a couple of years ago (which he liked) but stopped when he lost his job. Now he's in a new role, earning way more than before but still won't go back. There's always an excuse. 

Before he had this job, it was because he didn't have the money.

Now he's got the money, he can't go because therapy over the phone wouldn't work.

He says he'd rather do something different like acupuncture, but wouldn't be able to start until covid restrictions ease up.

And I have a hunch once they do ease up, he'll have another excuse to further delay him getting help.

He acknowledges he has an issue, almost brags about using alcohol and fast food to numb things and shoots down every suggestion I give.

I'm not sure what to do, or if there is anything I can do, to get him to get help.

Tldr: my brother calls himself depressed, is struggling to get to where he wants to be in life but won't seek professional help"
430,Need Your help rediters,"So it might be a bit long storry but i'll try to keep it short. I'd like to keep it as anonnymus as possible for the respect of said person.

I have a friend i have meet about 7 months ago, i have learned a great deal about that persons life and i have to say i am crushed with all the bad things that can happen to one person. I can easly say that this person is so inteligent and smart, witty and cute, capable of love, but that person, by now stopped believing in love, or good people, said person sometimes feels like theres is nothing good left and it would be better if, said person wouldn't be around anymore.Said person is doing so great nad i love to see said person smile, as it's trully electric. All i need You to do is to help me show said person by commenting down below, this communitys love, that there are still good people in the world, non judgmental and uplifting. For as long as i will be allowed in said person life, i'd like to make sure that i will make a difference. Thank You in advance and spread the love!"
431,My list of trauma(tw: lots of physical abuse),"I decided to compile a list of physical trauma, because i have had a lot and i don't remember it all always. I have severe OCD and anxiety that is tied to some aspects of the trauma itself. I hope to better understand how my OCD emerged.

Ages 4-7 

Viktor and Sasha used to play ball with me on the grass near our building, i would always get the set up to be the goalee. They used to use kicks rather than punches to hurt me. Weird. I lived next door to Viktor and his parents were nice, but he wasn't.

At my grandma's house there were kids, kids that were warped, i just wanted to play whatever with whomever, but they would beat me, repeatedly for fun, they used to force me to eat grass as for to not get beaten. Also they forced me a couple of times into the sewage system. It had some nasty shit inside.

First grade
The twins im my class broke my two frontal permanent teeth. In half. The pain was unbearable, worst pain of my life. Open nerves on both teeth. Somehow we salvaged the nerves. This traumatised me a lot. There was also this fat teacher that would always yell at me and i was scared. She got laid off next year.

The kids at the playground were more brutal than ever, one kid used to beat me every day, so one day i said, im gonna pay just don't beat me. My mother found out, she confronted him, and the beatings continued( confronted as, my helicopter mother came and talked to this kid, which was 2 years older than me), idk if his parents even cared that he beat the shit out of me.

Grade 2-5
General peer abuse, nothing special. I felt lonely because i was outcasted so i started playing with the bugs on the trees. 

Grade 5-9
Shitshow
On one of our school trips, a couple of the older guys decided to use my sheets to wank, the hotel didn't have a replacement and i ended up sleeping two nights on connected chairs. My teachers gave 0 fucks. I also had to face the fact that 30 of my peers loved to twist my nipples, to the point where after 3 days, i had dark blue tits, I went and got a medical appraisal and a letter from my family medicine doctor about the damage. My principal let them go free of charge, not even a suspension. I did get my stuff regularly thrown into bins or toilets because why not. Teachers also hated me, like my biology teacher didn't let me compete in biology because i didn't write in her class, and while i didn't do shitt in her class, that was purely because she was just reading off of the book lol. She even did a lot of mistakes that i pointed out, and for that i visited the principals office like 200 times a year. I literally know her routine, her favourite breakfast and brand of cigarettes. 

Outside of school i had a robbery happen, two guys with knifes demanded all of my belongings, that was my first valium.

Highschool- Only teachers bullied me, especially English. She really had a thing for males, like we were hated because of our gender? I really mean it, she made us do extra work because of it. In my last year, she confiscated my phone, and while it's against school rules, there is no rule allowing her to keep my phone for the night. Mind you i know the statute of my school. This woman started yelling and accusing me of stuff i didn't do because i took my phone. I slammed the door and i was really dumb because i showed a giant fat middle finger to the door. This was later used to try to kick me out of school. And while this wasn't abuse, they had the rights, the time it came for the principal to hear us out, they had me confronted, laughing in my face that i will get expelled, its almost like they wanted that. But it never happened because i know the rules and it was my first reported offense. ( this same teacher spread rumors about me in the first year of highschool, that i was a junkie) 

Huh ill add if i remember more, see ya."

433,I feel like the sum of my mental health issues and experiences have distorted my sense of reality,"I have bipolar disorder and anxiety. My mental stability seems to have worsened over the years &amp; I feel like my issues have caused me to become very in tune to my mental state - almost out of necessity. However, I think I’m often over analytical to the point of having existential and identity crises. Sometimes I don’t know who I am. Sometimes it feels like life isn’t real. Sometimes I get stuck in thought loops. Sometimes I get stuck on philosophical ideas. I hate being stuck in my head and often look forward to having another episode of euphoria since it’s my only escape (I’ve learned that drugs and alcohol aren’t for me.)
It’s getting harder to just exist &amp; at sometimes I feel so overwhelmed that I feel suicidal."
434,🖤^.^🖤,"heyy just wondering if anyone has any recovery stories they would be willing to share in detail about what steps you took, how long it took and your mental state at the time and etc. basically to help others take from your experience and help gain a new perspective on there own situation if possible, greatly appreciated🖤"
435,seems like a ridiculous question but honestly would love to have an answer LMAO,"would it be at all possible to be diagnosed with all of the following mental illnesses at the same time?

436,My mom can be awful and doesn't know it,"My mom is not always unreasonable but if someone brings up something that she does or says that could be considered offensive in any way she will assume that you're saying it jn a negative way. If you were to say ""have a good day"" she may say ""oh you did you think I was having a bad day or something"" It's very hard to have ""real talk"" with her bc she just gets mad and shuts me out over most of what I say and when I explaito her what she is like, she doesn't believe me. I feel like i'm always walking on thin ice when I speak to her, I have to choose my words carefully as to not offend her. Most of my family is like this aswell. I feel like it may be low self-esteem but I really don't know. I don't know how to handle her. I sometimes try to just avoid speaking to her."
437,Taking 72 hours off from work. (You know the business),"Hey guys. This might be a long post so I’m sorry in advance. 

I’m in a really weird spot right now. Im caught between the good and bad. I hit 4 years clean from self harm on New Years, but I celebrated alone. 

I’ve self isolated a lot recently because of a fall out from a friend. She ended up just saying she didn’t like being my friend and I was “too much.” Out of fear of being “too much” to anyone else I’ve just stopped reaching out. The night this happened I reached out to a newer friend that I’m extremely thankful for, but he was busy (which is TOTALLY fine, no hard feelings there) so I just never brought it up again. Since then I’ve just felt like nothing but a bother. It’s really easy to self isolate when people aren’t really that fond of you to begin with yanno. I can’t help but think everyone hates me. This person that said she didn’t like being my friend literally has invited me to family functions and the like for a while now. So now I’m questioning everything. 

Anyway. I have some family issues going on as well and I just honestly am tired. For a couple weeks my mindset has been “I’m not okay right now and that’s okay, I will be at some point.” But I’m tired of fighting with myself. I’m actively fighting against ideation everyday right now, every hour. While I’m like yeah I’ll be fine, I’m tired of the fight. I want to be somewhere where I physically can’t do anything to myself so it takes away the option. That being said, I need some advice. 

I want to check myself in. I have been admitted (more than once) before and aware of the process, but I’m an adult now. I have work and a disabled dad to take care of. I need advice on how to go about it. While I feel like it’s a little drastic because I feel like if I just had someone in my corner that cared to talk to id be okay, but I don’t have anyone. I’ve always been really to myself and honestly I do believe if I did “disappear” I wouldn’t have a friend that would be upset by it more than a day yanno. Admitting myself is a promise of no way to hurt myself and supervision and someone that at the very least is paid to “care.” 

Anyway. Any advice on how to get my ducks in a row to check myself in would be greatly appreciated. 💞

Sidenote: I do not have insurance anymore so doing outpatient isn’t an option (I live in America.)"

441,"I feel like when I talk, even with family, people either think I’m stupid or I’m not good at adding anything to the conversation or what I say is pointless."," I know my family loves me, they’re all amazing but I just always feel like everyone holds much better conversations than I do. Then I start to feel like somethings wrong with me or if I’m literally just stupid. I’m not competitive and wanting to be the best at conversations but it’s just like, no one cares.  

Like they just look at me and don’t know what to say (or at least that’s how I perceive it.)  I can’t tell if it’s in my head or if I’m really just stupid. I end up beating myself up in my head saying “you’re embarrassing/that was stupid/wow you’re a horrible conversationalist”.   

I’m not depressed about who I am or anything, it’s literally only when it comes to conversations. I feel like everyone talks to each other and when I try to add something they just look at me and nod, and then they continue with their flowing conversations.   

It’s so bad that it’s made me wonder if I have a form of mental disability and I never registered that this whole time? I have OCD/Anxiety but nothing else that I know of.  I’ve even bought books on how to have better conversations and have even looked into finding classes/seminars about conversations. I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of posting this, maybe I’m venting or seeing if anyone has advice. Thank you for reading and sorry for the long rant."

448,Just in need of some support a lot going on,So this is my first attempt at this and felt like maybe if I posted on a like minded subreddit I could maybe get support. So for the past I want to say 4 years now have been going through a lot. My mom has lived with me now for about 4 years she has barely any income and can’t really qualify for a place for herself. I have adhd bipolar anxiety and depression and go through a lot myself on a regular basis. My mom has her own mental health issues as well in which she thinks my family is out to get her when we are not. For the past 4 years i have been bearing with stuff with my mom a lot to long to post on here but long story short me my fiancé and my daughter can barely Handle her anymore. My mom combats us all the time and has pushed my at 25 years old on several occasions to have anxiety attacks so bad that I almost have a stress heart attack. I have gray hairs already growing. I’ve been trapped in a situation because of bad past mistakes that my credit is terrible and and can’t seem to get my own place without friends staying with us. The past 4 years I have had friends leave my life either because they emotionally abused me on top of what I deal with on a regular basis or because they weren’t real so that Weights on my mental health as well. Long story short I want to get my own place and leave my mom because of the bear it has had own my family and me myself but I always feel guilty about doing what is needed for me and my family because my mom raised me by myself. Would it be the right decision for me to move own my own or not? I really can’t come to the answer and with everything going on in the world right now and my own mental health I need to break free. I have lived on my own for this very same reason before with my family my fiancé and my daughter but brought my mom back because of that guilt so it started al the cycle over again. I have dreams I want to pursue but don’t feel like I can move forward with all that’s going on. I’m truly honest about this any advice or support or anything could help me cause I just feel lost right now. If anyone read this who thing thank you and if you would like to support me as well thank you so much. Just had nowhere else I thought I could turn.

I want to preface this by saying that I am not going to kill myself today and I don’t even know if I will have the strength to, eventually.

I like sticking to a meal schedule because I know that my body is ok with that at the moment. 
I just can’t stop regretting it. My ed is going crazy and thinking about what I could of eaten if I didn’t eat that.  I just feel bad because I’m trying to listen to my body and I ate something it didn’t want/need.

I promised her that I would never abandon her, and I meant it, I always keep a promise. However, recently, things have been confusing for me.

Her and I talk every single day, for a lot of the day. She claimed that she wants to talk everyday, and that was the best part of the day, and I love her immensely. However, recently, she just became extremely cold to me.

To give some context, about 3 or 4 days ago, we were talking as if normal, and she was having a friend over, I wasn't there because we are long distance. We talked over snap until almost 2 am before I went to bed, and she said that she wanted me to stay up and talk to her all night, I followed that up with that I was really happy she was having a good night with her friend and that I can try a little longer but I am really tired. She then said that it was okay and that was fine. 

She was drunk during this time, but even before hand she always said talking to me was the best part of her day. I don't drink, I don't do drugs, never have tried it before and don't plan on it. She drinks two wine bottles a day, to make it worse, her family owns a winery. 

The following day, I got almost no messages and received a message good morning message like we usually do (at around 1ish) and 8 hours later a message responding to me. That was the first time she's ever done this, and I was talking about how I was happy with her. That was it.

The next day, my old messages were there, unread, I sent a goodmorning message and one photo of some school pass thing that I thought my picture looked weird. I texted her after because I lost data and asked if she was up to facetime tonight. She said no, she said no the day before that as well. 

I asked her why she was distant yesterday, and I wanted to make sure everything was alright with her.  She said just ""Yeah"" followed up with ""sometimes I don't want to talk to you every second of the day"". I followed up that it was okay, and asked if it was okay if I sent messages, she said ""it's your life man, I don't really care what you do"". I've never heard her say something like that, or at least don't remember it.
I told her that she is apart of my life too, she said ""omg pls, I cannot today"", I said ""Okay, that's fine, you deserve some space"", then she said thanks. She then opened my messages and didn't respond, they were the snapchats, she only responded to those texts, with very minimal 

I wrote an apology saying that I didn't mean to smother her, and I understand how it can be too much, and that I hope she was alright, that was 6 hours after that initial text bit. The next day she opens it and just says ""its cool"", I then say she deserves to be able to relax and breathe, that I love and care for her very much. She said ""okay cool"". I then say that I'll talk later to her, and that I hope everything that has happened comes to pass (I was unaware of what really was happening) and I also said that things do her better, I had hope in it. 

That was opened about 7 hours ago. To make things a little more clear, we kinda broke up and not at the same time. Her friend spoke for her, different day, and she said the next day that she still wants to talk to me and still is in love with me, that she still wanted to do this but take it back before the girlfriend/boyfriend stage. We then had a good night, and talked for 3 hours straight, that was 5 days ago, the ""break up"" about a week or 8 days. We also talked on the 13th for about an hour to fix something and she was super sweet then too, that was the day she was with her friend, it then all went downhill from that day forward to today.

She has never acted so cold or rude to me. We've been talking since late Sept maybe August. She has a list of mental issues, but I always told her that I would never abandon her, ever, she worried that she would be destroyed if it happened. It went from 15 paragraph sent to each other per day, to me sending about half a paragraph and her 4 words the last couple days

I don't know what I should do, she has bipolar, bpd, did, and schizoaffective. I still hold true I would never abandon her. But this makes me so confused, idk if she wants to leave me or something. I just don't understand and it made me feel tremendous amounts of anxiety because of it, idk if it even is bpd but she said she has it, she said she had all of those, been diagnosed for it too. She is a influencer on Instagram, small but has 34k followers and she seems fine on it, same bubbly attitude as before but I think she is less active than before (once again not too bubbly to me now all of a sudden).

What should I do? I feel like I'm stepping on thin ice, once again idk if it is an episode but it could be, I have no clue what's on her mind, should I just leave her that space, like I think I should for a bit or should I do more?"
455,does anyone else feel like this?,"tw for mentions of suicidal thoughts &amp; abuse. this has been something that i've really noticed in myself lately. i've always been kind of annoyed easily by v small things, but i've noticed that i get aggravated when people ask me if i'm okay/ask if there's anything they can do for me/ask how i'm doing, whether it's out of the blue or prompted by something that's happened. the people i'm close to know that i have mental health issues (anxiety and depression are what i've been diagnosed with, but i'm fairly positive i have something else going on, too) and i have one particular friend who occasionally checks in on me. i've noticed it's especially when i don't necessarily \~type bright and chipper-ish over text (she was my roommate, but recently graduated and moved out of town, so we talk over discord primarily), she'll ask me how i'm doing. my cousin recently committed suicide and of course i wasn't entirely okay, but i've experienced a LOT of sudden death so when she asked if there was anything she could do for me, i just... ignored her. as soon as she sent that message, i didn't want to talk to her anymore. it took me a few days to feel up to responding to her. 

i can't decide why it annoys me so much. logically i know that she (and other people who ask me similar questions) are just looking out for me and want to make sure i'm okay. but i'm also, like - i've been through a lot of things. i've been through severe emotional abuse, suicidal thoughts, a lot of death, i have two chronic illnesses, and i grew up in a cult. and while i still have a lot of things to work through, i've worked through a lot of that on my own and i'm okay. i guess it makes me feel like my friends think i'm fragile when they ask me these things? like i can't deal with them on my own? and i know that isn't necessarily fair, but it just makes me so mad. 

i've heard things like this can be a symptom of C-PTSD, but i just don't know. i've never talked to anyone else who reacts this way to people just... checking in on them. i really don't know what to do about it. it just happened again with the aforementioned friend, and i'm so annoyed but i feel so guilty about it because i know she just wants to make sure i'm okay."
456,Would like someone to talk to.,I seen a video of a very tragic moment of me earlier tonight and I just feel horrible. Really bad ptsd and no one to really talk to about it. I just feel horrible all around. Ashamed and it'll haunt me for the rest of my life too I feel like a failure.
457,getting more and more violent/angry impulses,"Im a 20 year old male, my health is in shatters but otherwise i would consider my life decent,

I have autism, adhd and something called chronic fatigue syndrome but thats not the point. I have been a pessimistic  person for as long as i remember but these last idk 2-5 years my mental health has become worse and worse and i have now started getting constant anger impulses which turns into violent intrusive thoughts. These can come from nothing or the smallest things, like someone blocking a small part of the isle in a store or someone being to slow going through a door and i cant help getting a bit worried for both myself and others"
458,I regret waiting this long before asking for help,I never really thought to actually look at the symptoms of anxiety until yesterday when it just all fell into place. I just thought this was how everyone felt and that I was just being a brat for my bad coping skills. Now I'm 3 years into college and I've wasted so much time and failed grades when I could have been bold enough to have pushed harder for my then-counselor to understand during my first year. :( I don't want to self-diagnose but I just wanted to vent somewhere and maybe be able to put this thought behind me.
459,Constant Memory Loss,"I'm a 17 year old guy who's constantly experiencing memory loss. I usually don't have any problems remember what I did that day, aside from what I ate and unfortunately, if I'd taken my second dose of medication. On a daily basis it's typically manageable; I set goals for myself, have alarms for taking medication, and keep track of when I last shampoed my hair on a calendar. 
It gets tricky when it comes to something I did or said a couple days ago. Usually it's completely a blur. Hell, I can only remember that I played breath of the wild on my boyfriend's switch yesterday. Other than that, it's usually a blur. Sometimes people tell me things I've said/ did a couple days ago and I have absolutely no recollection of them. 
I don't have any memory loss in the family as far as I know and think I'm the only one. I do however, have PTSD and I've heard that trauma can sometimes lead to memory loss. I dont know if it's usually this bad though. 
 I can't even remember shows I've seen. It might seem nice to rewatch your favorite shows over and over again for what seems like the first time, but it's really frustrating over time.
I can only remember major life events and a few random details. I guess I'm just on here to see if there's anyone out there who experiences the same issue or has any advice on how to cope."
460,"I talked to my parents today about a suicide attempt 2 days ago, and it didn’t go well","You can read the first post on my account.

In the couple hours since, both my parents have acted incredibly abusively towards me.

461,Thinking about sex during sleep,"Hi,
I am having a habit of thinking about sex during sleep.
I imagine about an actress or some imaginary character (and sometimes role play) and this helps me fall asleep. 
Will this cause any harm to my mental health (or) my real life sex? Should I stop this and try to think something positive during my sleep. Please share your suggestions."
462,genuinely cannot take it,"i am sorry if this is not interesting enough for you, if it is not deserving of your upvote.

i struggle every single day, and suffer many dark realizations- yet the one that hits me the hardest is the one i've known all along; that NONE of this will EVER get better; that earth is hell; and there is only one way out.

i have never been hospitalized. i came close, when i was younger. my mother scolded me. she went on and on about how they do things to you forcefully ... as if she doesn't do the same. 

maybe this is easier for others. that does not mean that it is easier for me. i have tried many solutions; many administered by my dumbass father who will call me lazy for being depressed, and say that i 'just need exercise'.

please, please. let me out. this is a nightmare i never asked for."
463,I really need help,"I want to kill myself so bad, there's barley any happiness in my life and most days I find it so hard to get out of bed. im in high school but please don't dismiss my feelings just because im in ""that"" demographic. I've seen therapists and spoken to counsellors and all of them are saying the right things to me but im just so far removed from anything I see no point in doing anything. im a burden to the people around me because of my feelings and I know they would be better off with either a healthier version of me or no me at all and since I can't get healthier... Im not going to kill myself right now nor do I condone it so don't delete this please moderators. I just really need some love and I can't seem to get any

sorry for posting this type of this here im just so out of energy for anything its just hard to care for anything. sorry if there's any grammatical mistakes in this, I wrote this off the top of my head and didn't go back and check for mistakes.

466,I'm failing and alone,I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression also I'm on medication and have a therapist I'm in highschool now failing every class it feels hopeless and when I did try I had thoughts racing in my head constantly in and out trying to avoid work as much as possible and have zero motivation to do so my parents even offered to pay me to do it and I still don't to the point I'm gonna fail regardless of what I do this is the best I've been since going to the hospital for a evaluation and it doesn't help at the fact my poor body image of myself is almost getting me to starve myself lastly the only thing that's keeping me from sleeping all day is to play video games (thanks for reading and I'm sorry for everything being all over the place if you have any advice please feel free to share I need it bad)
467,Does anyone know why I feel this way?,"So I've always dealt with my anxiety by doing things that filled me with happiness, stuff that can distract me, but ive noitced in the past 9 months, its been extremely hard to distract myself. My anxiety has worsen drastically, I can still find stuff that keeps my mind off of my anxiety but the millisecond I pause or stop the task, my anxiety rushes in like a storm. Is this normal? (I havent been diagnosed by a professional but I can tell from how I feel and think that I have some sort of anxiety.)"
468,In a really bad mood and can’t get out of it.,"I get in these moods specifically when I’m disappointed in myself or feel worthless. It’s this frustration and anger hiding under my seemingly normal expression. I’m aware of it and don’t want to feel like this but it doesn’t go away. I try to take my mind off it by reading, music, exercise, etc. Nothing works and I remain frustrated. 

How do you get out of a bad mood? Is it even possible? Or do you just have to wait it out?"
469,Not sure where to go from here,"Not sure where to start either. My girlfriend of over a year is convinced that I am against her. She has severe depression. When things are going wrong she wants to die. When things are going okay she finds the negative in it. I obviously don't want her to hurt herself or anything, she's tried literally every trick in the book to try to help herself. Nothing helps. I've looked into a lot of things too. Changed behavior, done countless things for her, listened to her when she has a bad day, but everything I say is wrong. I dont helo she says. I make everything worse and everything's my fault... everyday she says she wants to die, and everyday I don't know what to do or say..."
470,Does anyone else miss the simplicity of life before smartphones and 24/7 internet access,"I am a 21 year old guy born in 1999 and I grew up in the 2000s. Even though by time I was a teenager smartphones had taken over our lives, I still remember the simpler times of the 2000s. In the 2000s nobody had smartphones, just normal cell phones and the internet was a luxury thing to have, not just something most people have like nowadays. I feel like nowadays I find it very hard to get anything done and enjoy things because my smartphone and the internet has consumed my life. I admit that I spend too much time browsing reddit and Youtube instead of pursuing my hobbies and interests but I just can't bring myself to do anything else. likewise, 24/7 internet access is very helpful, but it also removes a lot of mystery of some things and it and it also overwhelms me with information. I miss the simplicity of life before the 24/7 internet and smartphones. I think that in those times it was easier to focus on hobbies and meeting friends and actually going outside instead of being addicted to scrolling reddit endlessly. Does anyone else feel this way?"
471,How to cope with death?,"My brother has cancer (fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma)
Treatment stopped working and it came to the point where quality comes before quantity. I haven't seen him since his first surgery two years ago, and it was a shock seeing him so thin and weak. He''s delirious, sleeping a lot, not eating or drinking.
I wonder how he truly feels and what he's thinking. 
Life clearly isn't fair. I think of all he's going to miss in life, and all he hasn't experienced. I feel sadness, but also a lot of anger. I'm trying to keep my emotions in until the time comes. 
Am I supposed to just accept the inevitable and be okay with this? I think of the families who have lost their loved ones in car accidents and other similar sudden accidents to try to feel better about what I'm going through. I know I can't change or prevent what's happening to him, but I guess I wonder how do I accept this? I don't know how I will move on"
472,"Wondering If I have a problem I need to be worried about, please help", I have always been a pretty paranoid person but it seems to have gotten really bad in the past few years. Now I constantly check each corner of a room or drawer I was just in and count to 7 because I am convinced I accidentally left drugs  or something bad in there I don't want someone else to find. (I do not use any drugs which is why this is strange) I also cannot leave without doing it correctly or my head will start hurting really bad. This happens to other things like checking my pockets and wallet to make sure I didn't loose anything when I take something out of my pockets and this has become a constant strain on my everyday life. Every time I close a social media app I check to make sure I didn't post anything bad I was doing even though I wasn't doing anything bad.  I also am terrible at maintaining relationships since I have a hard time trusting people and myself and think they don't actually care about me and have a malicious intent. Among other things like this I am constantly worried about nothing and It sucks.  I just want to know If I actually have a problem or I'm just making a big deal out of nothing. I just want to know for myself since I haven't told anyone about this and most likely wont.
473,Rant about my fucking looks,"Idk tbh. I don’t even look like a person. I’m not just saying that. Even people considered too ugly in my high school, THEYRE FUCKING GORGEOUS. My face doesn’t look like a person. It looks like a troll. Like legitimately a troll. This isn’t just me who thinks this. Almost everyone does. Idk how to explain. I don’t understand why my genetics did this. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore. I just cried in the fucking bathtub and all I can do is get fucking drunk. I dotn know how to make myself look better. I’ve done makeup and I still look like a troll. I do everything right. I still look like a trol. Fuck fuck this fuck this stupid thing. FUCK MY GENETICS. I’m 15 I look like a fucking troll. Life is stupidly unfair. Why couldn’t I just look like a person. Id be happy. That’s all I want. I can’t even tell what I look like sometimes. I dotn care about my weight, my ass, my stomach, my boobs, JUST MY FACE. If that fucking SHITTY FACE looked ok average or even what’s considered ugly in society. I WOULD LOVE THAT. I’m jealous of all the girls that look like girls. I have this shittt face. I’d have to show my picture for y’all to understand how bad I look. Literally all I want to do is get drunk. I’m only a low a student and my gpa going down I GOT A FUCKING 32 ON MY FORST PRECAL QUIZ BC I DIDNT DO THE NOTES. IM UNMOTIVATED. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM INTERESTED IN. i feel so disconnected bc I can’t imagine how someone can be as disgusting looking as me. I can’t even take a pic of myself without deleting it right away. I just want to get drunk. That’s it. The only thing that gives me joy. And my bottles running out and I don’t want to get more but I do fucking want to. I know I should stop but idc anymore. Who cares I get addicted, cool, at least I won’t be thinking about my stupid DISGUSTING GENETICS. Gd nt. Hope y’all have fun looking like people"
474,Any other business owners out there ?,"Hey guys I have a bit of a conundrum here

So for a quick backstory my dad passed away a few years ago and I kind of ignored my feelings at the time and now my mental health has been very self-destructive over the last year year and a half to the point now I pretty much had a mental breakdown couple weeks ago. I've gotten to help I need to get and I'm starting the uphill climb.

Unfortunately I happen to run my own business too so it has caused me to underperform on projects and even one I wasn't able to complete. I want/need to say sorry to everybody that I've affected but I'm not sure how. I don't want to end up getting reputation as a bad contractor but I feel like I might have already done that. 

I want to write everybody an email and apologize and see if I can make things right, but I'm worried that maybe they'll think that I was just being lazy and didn't want to finish. When really it was hard for me to even get out of bed and at that time I didn't really care what would happen to me or my business. 

I'm not a bad person but I feel like a shitty person/contractor right now.  I know I need to start somewhere it's just figuring out where to start that I'm having trouble with. 

Any help is much appreciated.

Cheers"
475,Can you cure abandonment issues?,"Somewhere in my city, my dad is out there. He knows I’m here too. Every time I go to the store, it’s in the back of my mind. Anytime I see a tall bald guy, my heart sinks. 

I’m a 31 year old woman. He left when I was 16. I shouldn’t be thinking about this on a daily occurrence... still. What do I do? When does this get easier? The loss of my parent is so deeply hurtful. Some days I’m mad, others just sad. There’s no way to contact him, yet he could pop out any minute. Mutual acquaintances always bring him up... how they saw him here or there. It’s taunting. 

I have thought about moving, but this is my husbands home too. Plus I love where I live, I don’t want to run. 

What do I do?"

478,"Really drained, feeling sick and disassociating","This is a throwaway and I’m on mobile. Just venting here.. please don’t repost this anywhere. 
I’m feeling really tired lately. I’ve been sick with something specific and additionally have been feeling so under the weather health wise. I’m exhausted mentally and physically and feel sick all of the time, like overheating and nauseous and not being able to eat a lot. I have bad headaches and feel like I have knots in my stomach. 
I have a doctor appointment next week but they’re not going to be able to fix anything. Today I was with a small group of people (I was tested for covid and am not sick with that btw) including my significant others family and I wasn’t really paying attention to what was going on and was out of it and they were asking why I was “such a dud” and I just said I’m really tired and they responded with “well you’re under 30, you’re not allowed to be tired” 
I know it was a joke but I am so fucking tired and irritable it stressed me out and made me feel even worse because I wasn’t having fun like they were. 
Thanks for listening whoever chooses to."

480,What is wrong with me,"I feel like I am losing my mind, I get intrusive thoughts that will not go away, I stare at the ceiling for hours every night trying to go to bed. It gets to the point where I want my brain to slow down so bad I start to hit my head into things or punch myself in the head.  I get awful mood swings where I get extremely angry and self abusive then I hide under my bed and cry because I know hurting myself does nothing and I'm just tweaking out."
481,I feel like i am going to do horrible things,"Hi, i made an alt account for this because i don’t want people who I know to know about this. I think im a psychopath. Ive never been officially tested but i have noticed i have shallow emotions and i have rape and murder fantasies. I genuinely think when i get older i might become a serial killer because i have this inner need to, thoughts?"
482,I feel like there is more than personality in my brain and i can hear them talking,"I really don't know how to word this. I have been dealing with a mental situation for a while now and i just wanted to know if what I'm going through is normal. If it is i really need some advice, trying to figure out how to quit this behavior. 

I am very ashamed to write this. I have worked hard on my own to take care of this without having to tell anyone because this is quite embarrassing for me. Besides, this is probably going to get lost among the thousands of posts posted in this sub, so I just guess I wanted to vent. I don't know how long this post could get but I want to start at the beggining. I would highly appreciate it if whoever is reading this took their time to read.

I'm young. I'm below the age of 18 and for around 3 years, i have had the bad habit of masturbation. I've always known it's wrong, and sometimes I watched pornography as would any teen that is used to masturbating. I wanted to quit this, for lack of a better word, addiction before I get older and it gets harder to quit, and before it ruins my life. So I did whatever I could, i joined r/nofap and I'm proud to say that I'm doing quite good in that area. 
But this wrong behavior is not the root of my problems. I've always believed that my masturbation habits brought on a new bad habit i have a very hard time resisting, which is fantasising. 

Fantasising is probably a normal thing when it comes to porn addiction and related problems, but I personally do not think that my fantasising is normal. This is where it gets really embarrassing for me, knowing that Im probably greatly exaggerating this and I'm completely fine, but I'm still going to write it.

I have a problem with creating scenarios in my head that will obviously never happen and then having them interfere with my day to day life, like intrusive thoughts. It's like having imaginary friends but, different.

I have this voice inside my head that no matter how hard I try just won't go away. It's always telling me to do stupid stuff like slipping back into bad habits. Thankfully I'm not depressed or suicidal but just to pit things into perspective, if I was i probably would be dead by now because of this voice. It's something I've had for a long time. I've even given him a name. I guess it's really not much of a voice at this point. It's a complete personality, a character. Like having this very detailed ""evil"" version of myself talk to me.

There's also another one. A voice that is good to me, he also has a name and a personality and i can't control it. I guess the exact definition of it would be an imaginary friend. 

Now I know this all sounds very weird and I'm sure you're thinking I'm either looking for attention or exaggerating it's trying to be deep and quirky and shit. Well I'm not. This is giving me a very hard time focusing on the present moment and living my life. I would usually start fantasizing about meeting a girl every time i saw a celebrity i liked in tv or something. It got to the point where I created yet another personality with a name and a character that looked like a certain celebrity i guess I really liked. i got really into it and it would almost always end up becoming a sexual fantasy. Every time i think of the things that go through my mind, i feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. 

I need someone to tell me this is normal. I've had people i really trust tell me i might have DID, schizophrenia, etc, but I'm sure i don't have any of these. Mainly because DID would mean i dissociate and my actual personality i show to my family every day would change, and schizophrenic people can't recognize between what's real and what's not, mean while all I struggle with is mental and to my knowledge not real at all. 

In December 31 was my last relapse regarding masturbation and fantasising, and since January 1 up until this day i have been trying hard to not fantasize again. Although I seem to be escaping my fapping addiction, its sometimes very hard to not go back to having imaginary conversations and arguments and fake love with the people in my head.

I've given this enough time and I've given myself enough opportunity to quit on my own, but this is proving to be very hard and i don't think anyone i know or anyone I've ever heard from have the same experience. i have been very reluctant of making this post but at this point I don't know what to do so might as well seek some advise, but the act of writing this post is literally hard for me right now and I'm even questioning wether i should even posted because I just feel so ashamed of myself.

I would really appreciate it if any one could give me some advice about this. If you think I'm faking this or exaggerating please just move on and don't leave a negative comment, i really need some support right now."
483,Should i forgive my friend who abandoned for others?,"I have serious abandonment issues. People leave/replace me when they see something better.(Its about friendship). When they need me I am always there and when I need them they are not there. People always leave when they get what they want. I accepted the fact that people will leave after they get their work done. So I stopped getting attached to anyone who comes to me for help and I don't even expect him/her to do the same and I stopped trusting anyone knowing that they will leave oneday. Even there are some best friends who showed me they will not leave whatever may be the condition, that I am important in their life. 

In my college I have one friend, whom I thought is different from rest people and can be trusted, but few weeks back he did the same thing and now I am doubting my sense of judgement. Remember we are friends for more than 12 months. I told that there is something bothering me and you have to figure out on your own, but he never did. I stopped replying to his messages. Now he's trying get back and I deflected him and idk know if I should forgive him or not? I have other college friends too which I have trusted and they never broke it. He did the same thing again again but I forgave him earlier without any apology considering about our hectic life but this time I will not forgive him without any apology from him or should I?"
484,im tired of this pandemic,"im tired of being stuck at home. yeah i work so that means i socialize. no, that’s completely wrong. i have social anxiety and i don’t know who i am. i want to be this outgoing, charismatic, attractive guy to everyone but i’m too shy, anxious to present that and be judged for it. this all roots from confidence of course but i’m too insecure. working out was such a big help. so was school because i feel like we’re not strictly limited to talking about a specific thing compared to work. at work you can talk about work especially when you work for a big company. but school, i was able to be me, be funny, shy at first but throughout time, i was getting confident. it all broke down when covid began. i know a lot of people are on the same boat as me. i just want to do things that’ll boost my self confidence, esteem. etc. working out was such an amazing thing to happen, then covid happened and ruined it all for me. i’m going to begin journaling to let go of my thoughts and feelings starting tomorrow and i hope it helps me somewhat. any advice? i try to work out at home but the lack of equipment and space. i do as much as i possibly can... i know all of these ideas are all over the place don’t butcher me for it!"
485,My anxiety its getting worse and starting to involve my food habits,"Im over weight. Not thaaat much, probably 10kg over a good weight. But I've been trying to loose weight since forever. And i simply cant do it. I try to diet and excercise, but i always end up eating something i shouldn't. Like sweets or junk food. My parents tell me about it all the time. If they see me eating something i shouldn't eat, they will mention it for the rest of the week on and on, and if at the end i dont loose weight, they'll always be like ""well you ate chocolate that time, what were you expecting?""
Both of them are trying to loose weight too, and both eat bad stuff, but if they give something to me that i shouldn't eat, they. will. remember. it. And tell me how bad ive eaten, making comments like ""are you going to work out? You ate cookies yesterday"" or something like it. Its gotten to a point where i just dont tell them that i eat other stuff. Its awful, i want to eat, and i do, sometimes way too much, and never tell them. Then i immediately cry about it, and that cookie or candy or anything that i ate 10 days ago will keep me awake every night, its making me feel more anxious every time. I feel like crying because i know i did wrong and i really want to loose weight but i keep doing this stuff and it feels bad. When i was younger i spent a time where every time i smelled or simply thought about food, ANY food, i would feel the urge to throw up. So badly i starved myself with nothing but salt crackers and water because i couldn't stand to eat something else. That lasted about a week and a half, then it went away slowly. I don't want to get to that point again but even though i know its not good, i somehow wish i had it again so i can finally loose weight. Its contradictory and it makes me anxious."
486,Happy birthday!,"I hate my birthday so much. I don’t even know why but i just hate it. I hate having people say happy birthday to me, i hate having to respond to every message, i hate having attention to me, i hate the nonexistent pressure that i out on myself i just hate it all

I know i should be grateful to have people who care enough to send me these messages but i would rather be left alone. There’s just something about it that fills me with dread. 

Not only that but it just reminds me how i grew up. I just feel like younger me would be so disappointed and it just hurts to think that this is how growing up unraveled to be. I hate my birthday"
487,I feel nothing. Maybe just confusion and frustration.,"Hello. For the past 2 years, I wanted to believe I'm okay. I stopped taking my antipsychotics as the doctor said and I thought that that's it. But turns out wanting to feel okay does not make you okay. I do not know how to explain my feeling but I feel superficial and empty. I am very numb and I can barely experience emotions. I have no drive to do anything. I feel like part of me is lost or dead. All I can feel is frustration at how this affected me and made me not unlock my full potential and confusion cause I don't understand it. I sometimes get overwhelmed by this feeling of nothing. I don't wanna remain like this. I don't feel sad or happy and that means it might me depression but it makes no sense to me. I felt like this in the past years but now it's too much I cannot keep ignoring it."

489,my family is broken... (long emotional post),"posted this on a few other subreddits but i thought here would be a good place too... thank you for reading . 


in my house i feel like i’m invisible. if i talk most times i’m ignored, talked over, laughed at or made to feel stupid. 

backstory: i grew up with my single mother &amp; i have two sets of couples who i consider my parents as well because they raised me when my mother couldn’t do it own her own. I now live with my birth mother &amp; one of the couples that i consider my parents &amp; their two sons that i treat like my blood brothers. ( i hope this makes sense so far ) 

why i can’t do it anymore ? in simple words... my house is so toxic &amp; i feel like i’m losing myself with only God my birth mother and one special friend keeping me together. My family CLAIMS to be christian with slight differences in some beliefs but i feel like those differences should have nothing to do with how we treat each other as family. 

My other mother hasn’t treated me like a daughter in years &amp; i feel myself getting jealous because she will say certain things that show that she doesn’t think of me like her daughter. For example, my brothers &amp; asked her one by one if she loved us. my oldest brother went first, he got a “yes i do” then my younger brother went she said “of course i do. the answer i got? she paused for just enough time for me to know the answer for myself and then she said “why are you asking me that?” it took everything inside of me not to break down but i guess i got my answer right? She will also also direct any negativity she can towards me because she knows i will take it &amp; not say anything to her back. 

next is my poppa (father)... he’s so emotionally &amp; verbally abusive to everyone in the house, especially his wife. He gaslights, he manipulates, if someone doesn’t agree with him better believe you’re gonna be called some sort of name. i’m tired of it , even when we talk about the bible it’s like he’s trying to say we are stupid &amp; that he knows more than us so we should only listen to what he has to says. we never admits he’s wrong or apologizes he just pushes the blame on someone or something else. it’s hurtful &amp; everyone knows it but him . 

my brothers? they’re not the worst. they’re closer with each other in most stuff, which i understand. ( honestly i find myself understand why all of them treat me the way they do. i mean i’m not special to them, they probably thing they don’t need me so i understand. they’re the family and i’m an addition, right? ) they usually make me feel stupid because they’re both book smarter than me . i’m the more independent one from us 3 &amp; i have more common sense but i guess that came because of the lifestyle . i see both of them becoming like poppa because they both are picking up his habits even though they say they aren’t but they don’t take anything i say serious because they’re smarter than me. 

my own mother? she’s great honestly , the only reason i haven’t lost my mind &amp; became depressed ( besides God of course ) she helps me a lot &amp; has seen me cry every way too often. She sees what goes on in the house &amp; she tries to avoid it with working &amp; staying busy. 

&amp; then there’s me ! who stays in her room &amp; holds everything inside until i can’t anymore then i break down to my friend or mother but i’m tired &amp; don’t want to be a burden to them so i smile &amp; pretend i’m strong. don’t get me wrong i’m not perfect, sometime i break &amp; yell back or say something mean back but i’m trying to change for the better thru God no matter how hard my environment is. i’m just saying I want to move forward &amp; i feel like i need to disconnect from the negative but i just... can’t. 

&amp; at the end of it all, my family is broken. we hate spending time together, doing stuff together is a drag for them. Even the energy in family devotions (where we are supposed to be worshipping God) are considered an annoying time. i try to go to family activities with happiness because i love quality time as a person but i constantly feel my joy being pulled away as soon as they look at me &amp; aren’t pleased to even be there. it’s been years &amp; as i’m growing i see myself growing passed this &amp; wanting to get away more &amp; more. we’ve had so many “family meeting” where we discuss things to try to be a “better christian home” but it’s like only my birth mother &amp; i are making an effort. Talking turns to screaming &amp; arguing &amp; i just can’t keep opening my heart to a hope that i feel is long gone."

496,Old Soul? Freak?,"I used to pride myself in my social adaptability. I took pride in the fact I was ""mature for my age."" I felt I was special because I had so many talents and special interests. I felt interesting because of my abnormal upbringing. I felt wise because I grew up quickly.

 But now I find I am loathing all the aspects that I used to pride myself in. I feel like an outcast in no matter what situation I am in. I am ""too old"" to hang with the 24 year olds (24f). I get along great with above 30 age group and even better with the 40 year olds and so on. But they see me as a young 24f and probably think who is this twenty something? 

I have so many interests that I deem essential. Like raising my own food, sustainability, and self reliance. I am constantly trying to improve myself thru deep and critical introspection. I value practicality over looks. I believe in grit and old school values. I feel like I foil the millennial. And I am sorry I know this is a massive generalization but I feel like pop culture is very victimized, no one takes responsibility for their own shit. I always feel like I have to keep my shit on lock down. Which is hard because I am atypical in the mental health department.

I’ve been worried about this for months but I thought I was overreacting. This is really sending me into a spiral.  I tried texting my friends but I don’t want to bother them with something this dumb and the helpline i texted just so someone could listen to me and help me not feel so alone basically just sent really automated replies.

501,A message to parents who don't fit in society,"I will start off by saying fuck all of you for having children.

I hate parents with a passion that have had issues with fitting in with society. I don't hate them as people but the fact that they created something that will have to go through the exact same thing because of the way they raised them. Thankfully for my mom (for not allowing ""weirdo"" things) I didn't get completely screwed. But I almost ended up in high school with a rollie backpack, an otterbox clipped to cargo shorts, and a don't care about conforming to society mindset. Unfortunately, some kids at my high school never became aware of what their image is and they had full trust in their parents decisions which overpowered what bullies had to say to them. I used to hate bullies but they're a major thing that made me aware of things my parent (thankfully only one of them) did not. I was also lucky that I became aware that my parent was into stereotypical weird things and tried to mold me into the exact same person. I always love and will love my father but the residual anxiety and pain I still have is unforgivable. I wish I was put in a sport at a young age like my mother was attempting to do but she listened to my father and it never happened since he didn't like jocks when he was a teen. On top of that my father never talked to me about girls and seemed to be jealous when my brother had a girlfriend. It was almost as if he was angry and didn't want to hear about her. I know he loves both of us but it's extremely selfish of him to try to raise us like this. And I understand that conforming to society isn't always the best and right thing to do but it is VERY necessary for the connections you need in life. I was raised with the mindset that family is the only things that matter and friends should only be acquaintances. This mindset occasionaly resurfaces and makes me feel like I'm doing something out of the ordinary when I put myself out there to people which makes me so anxious and depressed. I am at least so thankful I am aware where these feelings are coming from and I am so thankful for my mother who always taught me the norms of society. I at least ended up functional in society (with a lot of anxiety), but I don't catch any negative attention like I would of if my mother wasn't in the picture. Anyways, if you are a parent who doesn't fit in, fuck you. Seriously, fuck you. Your kid will want to off himself when you kick the bucket because you were probably their only friend. If you are one of those parents right now, please please please don't buy your kid stuff you like. Buy your kid things that will help him connect. I'm not talking about designer clothes or anything just buy them usual normal teen or kid things (like a normal backpack not a rollie one). And for those people who don't fit in and aren't parents yet, but are thinking about it, for the love of God, do not have a child. It is endless pain for them and prepare to have a spot in your house for them for the eternity of your lifespan. In other words stick to PetCo if you're lonely and don't make another person go through your pain. Thank you."

503,How do you ask someone if they are your perpetrator?," Hello Everyone!

I joined reddit specifically for this question so I'm hoping you guys could maybe help me with this.

So, this is a long story so please bare with me while I try to explain it so that it makes sense.

For most of my life I have struggled with Severe Depression and Anxiety with Panic Disorder, and the past two years I have been working with an amazing therapist in trying to understand why I have these disorders and regulate my emotions so that they don't rule my life like they have been. While I have been doing therapy we have been talking about my childhood and where my depression and anxiety stem from, and in this process we have discovered that my anxiety stems from my need to control everything around me. We were discussing what could have possibly happened in my past that would have caused this need for control and I could never think of anything, but I had struggled with anxiety throughout my entire life, not just my adolescent and adult years. After much digging and some uncomfortable conversations about some deviant sexual behavior when I was much younger, we have slowly been able to come to the conclusion that I was sexually abused around the age of 1 1/2 to 2 years old. I had a very awkward conversation with my sister but she told me about how she was sexually abused around this same time (she was about 6) by a friend of my brother's (who was 10). Her story and the timeline add up to him very likely being my perpetrator, but I don't want to invent something that isn't there, but I also need to know if this is something that happened to me, because I have felt for a long time that something like this had happened but I couldn't figure out what it could have been until now.

My question for you all is, from a mental health perspective, how would you approach this now grown adult man about something he may have done to me when he was only 10 years old? I don't want to accuse him of something he didn't do, and I wouldn't even be asking if I didn't feel very strongly that it was him. I just want him to know that I am not upset and I don't hate him (his family and mine are still close) but that I just want to understand, and move on from this issue that has been bothering me for years.

How would you ask him if he did abuse me in a way that isn't accusatory or hurtful, but rather conveys that I just want to understand what happened to me?"
504,"Help me, I'm starting to lose it - how do I leave my abusive mother?"," Hey guys.  I'll make this short as possible since I'm sick of the whole story and basically I just want some reassurance and advice on how to do the right thing.

I am 22 years old and my mother is 60 years old. I grew up in a poor and abusive household because of the mental issues and the alcoholism my mother struggles with. My father is the best person ever, but he was struggling with my mother which resulted in frequent fights at home, slammed doors and everybody threatening each other to leave/ move out/die, etc.

Mom has also had a rough childhood and she brought it home with us. Every night she got drunk and when dad went to sleep to escape, she couldn't stop coming to my room to threaten me with death, scream at me or cry at my door when I locked it before it got broken. That's where my fear came from - I never got enough sleep from the drama and I've got a fear that she'll ''come to my room again tonight''.

ANYWAY,  I moved out as quickly as possible at the age of 17, went to university and managed on my own, worked full time and I did great until in 2019  my father passed away and left mom alone. As you got from the story mom is not doing very well mentally and I was so scared of losing her as well. In the past, she has threatened us with suicide and left the house late at night to ''go somewhere to die'' (this resulted in involving the police to find her, we have tried to get her to a psychologist but she doesn't want to). When dad passed away she was in another city, all alone, with no job, in debt, and in a horrible depression.  That's when I  think I made a mistake - I helped her move to my city, I rented a  bigger flat, found her a job, and really tried to cure her alcoholism. I  also tried to talk to her, give her love, find her friends in the new town, give her support, and even buy her stuff. I thought this would help us both.

It didn't.

It's now a year later and last night she had another breakdown for no apparent reason - I got my salary yesterday and paid the bills for this month and when I went home I only gave her half the money she needed for  ''this month'' (she was unemployed and I give her money now),  reassuring her I'll give her more tomorrow and that bills turned out more than I thought, so I only have the money in my card. She started screaming about ''wanting her money for the month NOW'' (maybe she had an idea what to do with the money, IDK). My boyfriend was with me at home at this time and he saw how she got angry, she threw the money I  gave to her on the floor multiple times, screamed at us both, told my boyfriend he is the problem because he comes often lately and ''eats our food'' (she's scared I might leave her and go live with him or something and she hates him because of that). I saw she was drunk and tried to tell her to go to her room so we can talk tomorrow, but she didn't stop coming to the room, about ten times in a row, just like in my childhood. This happens often even now, for different reasons, so the issue is definitely not money or my boyfriend or anything. Anyway, my boyfriend was supportive of me and told me that this is insane and that I  should move out and let her live her life. I told you this story so you can imagine the situation.

Unfortunately,  after the virus outbreak and paying bills, I don't have much money to move out. Please, guys, give me advice on how to move on, for example,  if I move out, should I just leave her some money and disappear from her life? How to deal with the guilt after that, she might seriously die shortly after, or at least that's what she says. Also, how to deal with all the trauma, because I really feel traumatized, scared, and trapped. I  am struggling with PTSD after all this \*\*\*\* and losing my dad, I also lost my brother 5 years ago and I'm afraid I'm starting to become weak emotionally, it's all taking a toll on me now. The biggest question -  Should I wait for 2 or 3 months more to raise the money for our  'separation', or should I get a loan and move out sooner? Thank you so much for reading."

508,Everything turned into a chore,"Coming from emotionally abusive family I managed to start self harming developed and suicidal tendencies when I was 13. Since then there was a lot of struggle on the road leading to CPTSD (according to my therapist, I don’t believe there’s a reason for CPTSD, I’d say it’s just common depression and GAD), but for more than a year now I have “perfect life”. Loving bf, wonderful place to live, amazing job and manager, good friends, good looks... life of my dreams
But my mental health have even worsen. I’m going now through the third suicidal episode and it takes a lot to... get through every day. I started therapy a year ago, which didn’t help, more then half a year ago I went back to meds, in November I had to take sick leave for three weeks.
I’m trying everything my therapist suggests - daily meditation, exercising, routines, journaling, healthy diet, positive affirmations... And yes there is a progress on some days I’m able to pull myself out of the black hole, but... it’s not like the black hole is turning smaller.
And the worst part, it feels like walking on eggshells. Every step has to be calculated so I don’t trigger a breakdown. I HAVE to meditate. I have to exercise. I must carefully choose what I’m doing with my free time - good bye gaming all day on weekends, because it makes me prone to depersonalisation. This movie would trigger me, sooo let’s stick with Disney. Sleeping in? Nope, my brain would blame me for being a lazy idiot.
I’m tired. And I don’t know what to do. How can living make sense if everything is... a must? How can I... get out of this."

510,A friend of mine isn’t doing well and I don’t know what to do,"

My friend is going through a rough time right now. She’s an artist living alone in her apartment in Paris. All her Paris friends recently moved to other cities and because of that she doesn’t interact with a lot of people these days. She hasn’t had a job in a while and she feels really lost lately.

She FaceTimed me late last night with tears in her eyes saying that she has a hard time living with herself lately, she feels like her apartment is swallowing her whole and she feels really lonely and shitty, that she felt as if nobody really cared for her. She felt like she was a failure in every aspect of her life.

All I could think of telling her is to remember that this feeling is temporary, that things are really shitty and out of control right now and she shouldn’t question herself because of that. I told her that things were going to be okay and that despite what she tells herself there are people that care for her and love her. 

The thing is, I don’t know if that made her feel better. She kept looking away and telling me “yeah I guess”. 

I don’t what to do. If you’ve ever been in that situation, what did you need to hear at that time ?"
511,deep depression,"WARNING TALK ABOUT SELF HARM/SEXUAL ASSAULT 

&amp;#x200B;

life's harsh, it throws anything at you no matter what. the last 2 years have been the hardest years I've ever had. i have been jobless for 6 months, i need a job to support myself and my dog. my partner moved out because of my toxic family. i couldn't move because i don't have a licence and i would be to far away and just be stuck. my parents divorced in their 26 years anniversary. i lost my dog who was my mental health animal, i also lost my other pet ( guinea pig) he was the best thing in my life. i have a horrible relationship with my mother now because she met a guy and moved 2 hours away from everything and everyone 2 weeks after meeting him.  my sister is manipulative, mentally abusive. she has always been abusive growing up, hit my family including myself. i have to pay bills and school fees with the money i get from CL and it never leaves me any money left over.  

I've fallen into a deep depression and can't find a way out. i had to leave school because of severe bullying and found out all my ""friends"" became best friends with my bully and they blocked me on everything so i have no friends. i only have my partner and now hes moved house i am defenceless and a easy target to my sister. my father is jobless due to a horse accident so he is also on CL and can barley pay the bills. In October it will be 3 years since i was raped, this guy and i had known each other for ages and we were very close. i had no idea he would do what he did to me, he took me years out of my life. night terrors distrust of men. to this day i still cannot look a man, guy in the eyes. i didn't leave my room for days, i couldn't sleep. i told no one until i snapped at a counselling meeting. i went to the police but he got a lawyer involved and i didn't have money for one so i lost the case. he denied everything. i felt numb, i cried for days...why me. When i had to tell my mother after the meeting she didn't believe me neither did my father. my sister mocked me and made fun of me as if she thought it was funny. i felt defeated. 

I met my partner through an ex, we didn't speak much for the first week but then we spoke everyday and face-timed every day and even throughout the night.  one night we both stayed at my ex's house but my partner had over heard a conversation between my ex n his mother about them needing to tell me something.i broke up with that ex because he went cold and wanted nothing but sex. my partner and i went to the beach with a couple of friends the night of the break up, and a friend of mine and the ex's came. that night i felt so close to A.P (my partner) he cared about me and hugged me and just made me giggle. months go by and all my partners friends (including ex) turned their backs on him that is when we found out he had cheated on me with that friend of my and my ex...from then on i never trusted relationships. but then A.P asked me out a few months later and here we are 2 years later stronger then ever. 

everything I'm doing to help myself isn't working. i'm on depression and anxiety medication but they don't work. i have development attachment issues to my partner as he is the only person who's stuck by me for the last 2 years. i was 82kl 2 years ago i'm now 115kl. i hate what i look like and everything about myself. i have lost everything that meant more than the world to me. i have tried diets and exercising but as soon as i feel happy my whole world crumbles back down. my dad is my best-friend but his mental health taking over and he is slipping from my grip. he gets professional help but he just doesn't seem like its doing anything. I am almost 2 years clean of self harm but my dark thoughts have returned but i made a promise to never break it, i  wont break it but my thoughts want nothing more then pain.

i hope someone reads this and can give me advice that may help. i am not looking for attention i just want to rant without being told i'm wrong or getting told it's not allowed.

513,Feeling Really Nervous About a Couple of Things,"***Trigger Warning: Anxiety, Potential Suicidal Thoughts, Partial Abuse*** 

&amp;#x200B;

So back in November, I went to the hospital because I had trouble breathing some time, and so I went, and after some X-rays and exams, it turned out to be chest wall pain due to some inflammation. After hearing that diagnosis, I felt more relieved and went on with resting myself. However, days later, I got a phone call from the hospital and they told me that after close inspection, they spotted an opaque spot in my lungs that was 20x25mm, but they said that it doesn't look dangerous or alarming, but still good to get it checked out by my doctor just in case. Ever since then, although the person over the phone told me that it's okay, I can't help but panic, I worry that it's something else, like lung cancer. Now, every time that I feel some pain or can't breathe as well, I keep thinking that it's something life-threatening and I end up having a big panic attack, not being able to sleep or do anything anymore without crying or worrying. I went to the hospital a month later because I got so panicky and was not able to breathe, and it was still chest wall pain. Since I have no smoking history or family illnesses, they still ran all the exams and I was told that I was healthy for my age and not at risk. Again, they told me about the  opaque spot, and it's still the same size and everything, which is good. Two weeks later, I went to the doctor for more X-rays to start looking into it and I talked to the person that did the X-ray for me, and they told me that they can't even see it since it's so small, but they understand why I'm worried, since I'm young, but they told me that it doesn't look like anything alarming, so I shouldn't worry as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after, I ended up getting COVID-19, and while I was isolated in my room, I honestly felt like I was going to die. I cried every night at every pain and thing I felt, I was afraid and I didn't want to die young, I want to accomplish something in my life and live old, and that stuck to me. After trying to think of positive thoughts, I began to recover quicker and I'm feeling much better now. Since I took such deep breaths during those troubling times, it ended up becoming yet another repetitive behavior that I have to do often to not panic (I have been diagnosed with OCD and ADHD some time ago), which is tough because every time that I do it, and even if I feel some pain (which is very minimal, but not big pain), I still panic and cry. It got to a point where I thought to myself: why am I feeling this? Do I deserve this? If I die young, will my life be meaningless? If I get too close with family and friends, how will my death impact them? I don't want them to suffer. Why am I even alive right now? 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I have decided to go back to therapy because I learned that there is so much that I need help in still. I just don't want anything bad to happen to me or anyone in my life, I want things to stay good and to never change to something bad. This could be because of a really toxic friendship that I had for years, I've been told that it was psychological abuse, but I don't want to call it that because I would feel bad for the person that was really toxic to me, and I still can't talk to anyone by face of the stuff that I had to do and endure, never. After they graduated and left, I felt free and everything in my life began to have color, meaning, and every thing got so much better. After so long, I don't want these great things to end so soon, so I always fear for everything that is alarming, I don't want to die so soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a little better after typing this, as the time that I'm writing this, although I've convinced myself that it's nothing bad, I still worry at times. Although I don't want things to become bad, I learned that I am getting leased and have to move out soon. To add on, I came out to my conservative family, and they still don't accept it and are disgusted by it, calling me confused. Sometimes I forget that I'm human, that I should live life and to do what I love, but I feel alone and really isolated, I need physical interaction to know that I'm human and not alone. All these things that have been happening lately have had a huge toll on my mental health as I'm trying to stay positive on life, trying to convince myself that it's nothing alarming (even though all the doctors have told me that it's not alarming), and trying to continue to life without panicking every couple of minutes, it's honestly tiring. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if anyone will read this due to how long it is, but I would really like some words of appreciation, advice, or anything really that you can offer. Maybe someone went through a similar experience as me and has something to share to help. Please, I just want to get reassurance that everything's going to be fine, because I worry too much and can't stop it, despite how hard I try myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

514,Things are getting overwhelming. The people am venting to told me I need to man up. I feel ashamed of myself.,I feel bad about myself and keep criticizing myself.
515,Every day feels the same. I don't know what to do anymore.,"Every day just feels the same. I get up at 9 do some work for university after that I lay around not being productive. Maybe I get to do some music or take a walk. At the end of the day I always shower just to do something. Just to make me feel like I achieved something. Then I just go to bed waiting to fall asleep just to do all of that again.

There is nothing to look forward to. No music festival, no visit to the cinema, no eating in a restaurant. It's just the same shit every day.

 I get up and to the same shit. I got a job that starts in February so by then I can get up and do the same shit every day at work just so I can get some money so that I can maybe afford a vacation and not do the same shit every day for a week. Just for once in a whole year. Or I'll do the same shit every day just to afford some unnecessary materialistic thingie that will make me happy for at max one hour.

If this is what life is then what the fuck are we doing here. Life could be so beautiful and I decide to fucking do the same thing every day. I'm just 19 I've got a whole load of life in front of me but if everything is just and endless cycle till you die that would be horrifying. But it almost feels like this is actually the case. 

Does someone have some advice for me I could really use some. Been crying for half an hour today and that was probably the only thing that distinguished today from yesterday."
516,I have extremely low self-esteem and I don't see it improving anytime soon. I feel like I have wasted my life. Need advice. Guidance. Anything.,"I (20M) have extremely low self-esteem. I have extreme inferiority complex and self loathing. My mind keeps overthinking and is always overwhelmed. I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford therapy. Please help.

Background:- I am college student from India. My family is extremely extremely poor. To the point that, we can't afford food and basic necessity. I have extremely low BMI(due to low calorie diet) and feel bad about my body as well. I can't afford good clothes and don't really have a robust social life, since I can't really go out. I do have a small group of friends, who are extremely nice. I don't see my family's financial situation improving anytime soon. My family itself is not the best influence as well. I have a narcissistic father and a very conservative family. It's a dysfunctionional family. I have seen extreme poverty for a long time now. I managed to get decent grades and average marks with bare minimum resources(candle light and a phone). 

Four months ago, my gf broke up with me. She basically said that I had no self-confidence and she feel out of love. I don't really blame her. She said I am the nicest guy she has dated, but she finds me boring and can't seem to feel attracted towards me. Here is how I messed up:- 

-I kept asking for reassurances, only to not accept them. (typical low self-esteem behavior)

-I became codependent on her.

- I became a doormat, even who she didn't what me to be one.

- I always self deprecated myself.

- Tried to prove my masculinity. And always tried to be perfect for her. (she told me she liked me with my flaws)

- I felt extremely inferior to her in every aspects of life.

- I felt inferior to her exes and developed insecurity.

- I got jealous.

- I put her on a pedestal.

- I always thought that she didn't deserved me.

I lost the love of ex because I didn't love myself enough. I am overwhelmed with regret.

My already low self-esteem is at an all time low, because I just found out that she has started seeing someone else.

What I feel bad is that I can't go about changing myself or my self-esteem issues rn.

1. I can't hit the gym.
2. I can't afford good cloths.
3. I can't socialise outside my group of friends.
4. Obviously can't afford therapy.

I don't see things changing this year. I have 8 months left with graduation. And will only be able to find a job in 2022. I am stuck at home studying and reading books, while my friends are going out, socializing, having sex, have girlfriends, eating awesome food, dressing up, working out, etc. I, on the other hand, have never ordered or had a pizza. :))

I don't know if I'll be able to get out of this situation. I think I am depressed. I AM JUST STUCK. I have no meaning in life. Every day is basically the same. My youth is gone. Any sort of guidance, motivation or advice will help. 

PS- I can't get part time jobs, partly due to covid and also because I have alot of exams this year."
517,Problem of my good friend,"Hey, I really need your advice because my good friend has a problem and it is affecting her mental health. It's been continuing for few months. I tried to give her advice and shes been trying to do something but it doesn't seem to work. Because of lockdown she studies at home and now she is in 11 grade. Those last grades are very important because you are preparing and studying for the exams. Studying is harder these days and her parents don't understand it even though it was easier for them. They are pushing her to get better grades and she feels presure. If she doesn't keep with her parents expectations they take away her phone (she bought it using her own money) and her computer. It seems like never ending cycle. Because parents pressure her to study, she feels stress and it makes it harder to study and that affects her grades. She tried to talk with them, she even did a presentation for her mom why she needs help, she talked with her school psychologist and nothing really worked. Also, she showed the exercises that she need to do for school and how hard they are. Maybe someone has any advice what to do?"
518,I don’t think i could handle losing either of my parents,"I haven’t been able to sleep properly for the last few months because the same thought, the same scenario always comes back up, “what would you do if you lost your dad or mother?” I know this seems like im some weak loser that has no dependence, who knows maybe i am but i can’t comprehend it, I’ll cry silently for an hour or two then just pass out, my dad is 55 he isn’t very healthy and doesn’t seem to enjoy his life, my mums a lot better eating wise but she seems sick and stressed and anxious and sad all the time and i don’t know how to help although i would love nothing more, my dads house has always been a safe place, he has probably only yelled at me a few times in my life (my fault)  and is always there and is always understanding, i couldn’t possibly ask anything more from him, but every time i tell myself to talk to him about his lifestyle and i don’t end up doing it and its driving me insane"
519,Just lying down in bed for hours and doing nothing.,"I have had these days recently where I would just lie down in my bed and just look at the ceiling for hours and not want to do anything at all. Then again I want to be productive but when I try to be productive I just lay in my bed and do nothing. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I have had a lot of “good “ things happen to me yet I feel so empty and feel like doing nothing at all. I keep getting thoughts of the past and what I could have done to make things for the better. This issue has been occurring on a daily basis and need some advice on how to overcome this laziness and emptiness"
520,Here to listen to everyone!,"I have dealt with many problems myself and with many other peoples throughout the years, I have literally seen it all and been through it all myself, I’ve smashed depression and other shit all on my own and I am very optimistic about my future.

I will never forget the suffering I have been through though and how fucking rough it is. I never really had anyone to trust and accept my thoughts or anyone that I could truly trust that I could tell everything to and trust them with everything I was thinking and feeling. 

I am here for every single one of you, to listen, understand, sympathise, empathise and explore this with you in a non-judgemental environment. I have done some fucking crazy shit my self so believe me there is no judging. Please don’t be shy to tell me what’s going on. 

You can of course private message me if you don’t want to talk publicly. Please don’t ever think that you are “bothering me” by messaging me, I want you to bother me! So just fucking do it. 

Much love to all of you.

521,I tried to end it last night,"I got scared and I told my mum and my best friend, my best friend started crying asking me how I could do it to him and my mum ran away. I’m still here this morning, after making myself sick in the shower and falling in and out of consciousness after taking a lot of pills. I don’t know what to do, everyone says they care but when it comes to it all it seems it that they care about how it affects them. I feel so lost. I feel so alone. I feel guilty for what I’m causing the people I love to feel, but am I selfish to just want someone to focus on what this is doing to me? Am I in the wrong to want that? I just feel so numb."
522,Advice on how to relax,"Hello people of Reddit,

I am struggling to find healthy ways to relax without feeling guilty. 

(Disclaimer: English is not my first language and this is my first post, please excuse any mistakes)

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a very long time but have always managed to push myself beyond my limits. By living this way I completed my studies, graduated with two law degrees and even worked out regularly to achieve my fitness goals. 

At the same time, however, I isolated myself socially and lost my ability to identify and deal with my emotions as they arise. I am working on this and it has gotten much better but I am still struggling. 

Yesterday I was in bed because of a migraine. I realised that whenever I relax or have a “lazy” day, it feels like the world is going to end. I feel like when I am not my best self 24/7 someone is going to be disappointed with me or I am going to lose everything I’ve worked for the past couple of years. I am aware that those are irrational thoughts. But they’re very hard to shake.

Does anyone have tips on how to deal with this? 

Thank you!"
523,Take a break from the news and social media; doomscrolling through negative stories impacts your mental health,"One of my less mindful habits is that I’m sometimes a bit of a news junkie - I’d happily sit in front of the news channel or scrolling through twitter when a big story is happening. This can be bad for our wellbeing though, particularly as the algorithm that controls our news feed is designed to provoke a reaction from us. Emotions like fear and anger are a lot more likely to grab people’s attention than happiness, so the content that we get fed through tends to water the seeds of anxiety and resentment.   

We can notice how much time we’re depending on the news and social media and limit ourselves, setting a regular alarm on our phone (the Plum Village app is good for this). When it goes off, if you’re watching the news or on social media, just stop, breath, notice your thoughts, notice what you’re feeling. With more awareness, you can make informed decisions about the media you consume and decide for yourself when to stop. 

But the evidence shows that with the news and social media, less is more. You can get a summary of whats going on once or twice a day - with the time you save you can call up a friend, go for a walk, enjoy nature. Its critical to be aware of what you consume, not just through your mouth but through your eyes and ears as well. The seeds we water create the garden we live in.

524,I overthink things and this one thing is making me hate myself,"So I am currently 14 and in the last 5 months I’ve been overthinking everything and being paranoid because I see people have nice lives on TV shows where everything is perfect and I want that so I overthink everything and panic that I’ll never have that life and I’m a horrible person who will end up in jail or I will end up alone!

And 2 months ago my brain bought one specific thing up and I now hate myself because of it. So when I was around 12 we started doing sex education in school (talking about this makes me feel really uncomfortable) and our teacher told us what masturbating was. So naturally I just didn’t think about it for a couple of months until one day I tried it and started doing it more frequently. I then realised that people did it whilst looking at stuff they like and find attractive so I started experimenting with that.

Eventually I found that for some dumb reason I was attracted to leotards and gymnastics (IDK why and I’m not anymore) so then bring a dumb kid I watched gymnastics videos whilst I was... you know... 

So back to the present and my brain decided to bring this memory up again (I have since stopped it because I realised it was weird) and I was thinking about it until a horrible realisation set in that some of the people doing the gymnastics could have been younger than I was. Back then I wasn’t really attracted to the people it was just the gymnastics and leotards that I thought were nice. I also didn’t realise that it was wrong and that you should only do it to certain things. 

Since then every day I am very ashamed of myself for being so dumb then and doing that and that I’m a horrible person and I’ll never have a nice life and I’ll never be able to be a good person and that i am going to go to jail and I’m evil...

Is what I did horrible or am I overthinking it and should I get help!! I have started hating myself for ever doing something like that and have started distancing myself from my family and being incredibly sad all the time

I’m nervous to post this in case what I did is as bad as I tell myself it is and it’s just going to make it worse but I’ve been told that getting a second opinion can really help

Ps: This is really wierd but I feel like I should point out that now I am only attracted to people my age and older

Please help me.."
525,i can't stop overthinking.,"To be honest, I'm doing a lot better than I used to around 3 months ago. I don't binge drink every day anymore (I actually barely drink now) and have successfully quit smoking cigs for 2 months. I also started working out and have been eating healthier. 
However I still feel like a complete failure. 

I keep comparing myself to friends my age and how far behind i am compared to them. I don't have a job, I want to socialize more and do things i like (e.g skating) yet I have no one to hang out with. also i can't drive :( 

I keep myself up at night thinking about how i'd fail at my job if I ever get one, bc I'm so socially awkward and a fraud, that I'm not good at anything whatsoever. I hate the way I dress and how I portray myself, yet I don't know how to improve. 

idk, I guess i just needed an outlet. It's been mentally exhausting these past few days."
526,"Boyfriend checked into an inpatient treatment center for trauma, how can I best support him through this?","I’m not sure if this is the correct community to ask this question in, but I’m not sure where else to go. 

My boyfriend was sexually assaulted by a stranger about a month ago and it’s been obviously real hard for him. He’s been talking to his therapist, and to me he seemed like he was dealing with it. I didn’t hear from him for two days which is odd for us. Yesterday I got a text message from his mom telling me that he asked her to reach out to me to let me know that he is okay, and that he is at an impatient treatment center to deal with his traumas. I haven’t spoken to him, but they said he might call me in a few days. It really hurts me that he didn’t tell me about this, but I understand why he did it and that he didn’t intentionally hurt me. 
 
I’m so used to being there to support him and tell him everything is going to be okay, so it’s really unsettling for me to not even be able to speak to him, which in the long run is probably good for my mental health too. My question is though, how can I be supportive of him? If I’m able to send him mail, should I? Or should I just leave him alone. I don’t really know what he wants right now either; maybe he doesn’t want me to be involved in any of this at all and that’s why he didn’t tell me."
527,Smartphone Addiction,"I cannot get off my phone. My average screen time ON MY PHONE ALONE is 10+ hours per day and I really need help. I feel naked/uneasy without my phone and I can’t discipline myself to put it away. The pandemic really worsened the problem as I can’t go and see friends to distract myself. It has come to the point where it’s preventing me from actually doing my uni courses.
Has anyone been through something similar? I need tips and tricks mann :’("
528,I need advice for my mother abroad.,"My mother and I don’t really have a close relationship. We didn’t grow up together and just recently through my biological grandmother on my father’s side heard from her. Long story short, she’s suffered for decades with things such as anxiety and schizophrenia. She’s at Cuba, and due to a lack of medicine called Fluephenazine for treatment they’re going to place her into the hospital. 

I can’t get that medicine in the U.S. without a prescription. And reaching out to friends I’m Cuba has been tough since it doesn’t seem to be available in pharmacies. I was wondering if there’s an over the counter medicine that may at least alleviate somewhat and delay the need for hospitalization until that medicine is available in her country? Thank you."
529,Need help while looking for a therapist,"I have trauma responses to learning math, which has held me back from being comfortable or compitent in this area of education (I go into more detail about this on r/learnmath).  In the near future I plan to seek professional help dealing with past trauma, but you all know how hard it can be to find any kind of help from someone in the mental health industy.  While I sit on wait lists and wait to *maybe* be called back from a therapist who actually takes insurance, I need help delaing with my trauma responses.  I desperately want to start learning math, but normally cannot get through even a little bit of learning without crying, nearly blacking out, and generally having my day ruined.  What can I do to battle my trauma responses?"
530,Don’t know who I am,"I question myself on who I am everyday, I don’t even know who I am as a person and feel like I have lost myself. I don’t even know my own personality and find my moods change extremely quickly and I just adjust my personality to the ppl around me.

531,Chronicle of of a Misassembled man trying to get right with himself,"I look at myself like a jigsaw puzzle 

I feel like in my life thus far I have been mashing pieces together making them fit and work. This is y I have never been able to see a bigger picture or have faith in myself. I believe that all my problems are connected in this way. As a child my life wasn’t that difficult but at the time I’d swear I was abused. Constantly in the middle of a bad divorce, custody hearings, and completely different parenting styles. I was never paid much attention to because my sister was always very sickly growing up. She left my dads care when she was 14 and I was 11 and hasn’t spoken to him since. This not only made my sister the soul object of my mother’s time and attention but also made me my dads life line to his daughter. In other words it was never about me from this point on. I accepted this for the most part and took on a roll of being my sisters protector and guardian as well. I completely forgot or didn’t learn how to take care of myself at that point because I didn’t believe I was important enough to do so. For attention I lied constantly to teachers, family, and friends. Sacrificing any real connections to people in doing so. It didn’t help my mental well being or situation that at this point I had been taken advantage of sexually  by not one but 2 of my male friends and 2 different points in my life. The combination of these events brought me into a deep depression and made me manically paranoid. I wouldn’t leave the house without a weapon and even slept with a knife under my pillow for years. Still nobody paid attention. My mom was barely managing working 2 jobs and trying desperately to care for my sister and my father who has always tried his best and hardest to give me a good life and instill useful knowledge about this life into me was very cold and distant. I don’t blame him for this anymore I understand as an adult that he was just the product of his own upbringing witch was comparatively miles worse. But in the moment I was all alone in this world. My friends were always just skin deep and couldn’t understand the situation even if I had the ability to explain it to them. So I lied made excuses and trotted on cold in alone. The only thing I found in this time and tinder age that brought me any type of relief or release was breaking things, drinking, and smoking tobacco. I had two obsessions in life at this point knives and tobacco products. I would give my mother brief glimpses into my mental state and guilt her into buying these things for me I may have been 13 when I started smoking cigarettes. As I got better and better at lying and manipulation I died a bit more each time inside and my depression became worse and worse. All the while this was going on my mother and sister both vilified my father in my eyes. Convincing me that he was a narcissistic sociopath and he wasn’t to be trusted. He however never said a bad word about either of them and just wanted me to be a strong and accomplished man. If I had listen to him over them I might have just turned out normal. But I didn’t and stayed on a path of self doubt, loathing, paranoia, and addictive tendencies to cope with life. It wasn’t until high school that that I found someone who truly understood me and got me to open up and communicate what I was feeling my first true friend. His name was adam and his situation was miles worse than mine. I don’t know if that made me trust him, pPity him, or just gave me a since of control over my own situation. We did everything together and he even lived with me and my mother for years of his life including the better part of high school. He was the first person that I didn’t have to lie to to impress and I felt equal to. But we both had the same way of coping with this cold unfair life. We smoked cigarettes, drank, and started smoking weed. These tendencies put us around others with them and eventually turned into harder drugs. The worst of them for me was pain killers. I wish I never knew that warm safe euphoric feeling they gave me. I lied stole and manipulated people I cared about for them and couldn’t even control myself around them and can’t be around them to this day. I was at my lowest bouncing from sexual partner to sexual partner lying and manipulating them until the each realized how broken I was. When they did I’d simply disappear from there lives and feed my demons until I’d forget them and do it all again to another unfortunate girl. I’d play and pretend to be this perfect Individual I’d listen to them and be interested in there hobby’s and lives and even cook for them. This is one of my greatest regrets in life. That I have hurt so many because I couldn’t deal with not being that perfect individual that I portrayed. It only got worse when adam realize who I was inside and left my life for good after a big fight. It wasn’t but a couple months later that he died of a stroke after being up all night drinking and doing cocaine. I’ll never get the chance to apologize to him or tell him how much I appreciated him as a person. My destructive tendencies only grew like a fire in the woods in the middle of summer. I tried every drug I could get ahold of and fed my own selfish sexual desires to the point that simple intimacy with a normal person couldn’t  satisfy me. I watched porn that got more and more depraved as time when on. I threw myself in to one relationship after another because at this point I had to have someone believe in me and tell me that I wasn’t s worthless piece of shit to have any type of self esteem.  They all ended tragically and in large part because I couldn’t be satisfied sexually. This hurt me just as much as it hurt there self esteem. I have truly loved many of these individuals and fought for them tooth and nail but have never been able to bring myself to be completely open and honest with them. Lying at this point had become second nature and easier that being honest and Vulnerable. What hurts the most is that I do honestly try so hard to be worthy of love and be worth my partner but these tendencies have become compulsions that I have little to no control over. The only thing in my life these days that gives me any satisfaction or pride is my work. Although dirty and hard being able to do something to damn near perfection reliably every time is better than any drug I have found. The gratification in walking into a situation giving it every thing I have and by the time I leave it’s in perfect working order gives me pride in myself for the first time in my life. To be someone’s knife in shining armor is what I truly crave. Today I have been out of work for about 5 mounts sober from drugs for almost one month and  sober from alcohol for 3 days. I have committed myself to working threw these issues and one day being healthy and happy with myself as a person. This is y I am writing my story down so I can process it for the first time in my life and try to learn from my mistakes. For the first time I am not blaming my shortcomings on anyone but myself. I need to accept them and work on them every day until I can be the man who I want to be for someone else and who I need to be for myself."
532,An unreasonable anger. What. The. Frick.,"For some reason, I had days where I start feeling weird. At first I thought it was my apartment being haunted affected me... might be part of it. But this occurs on and off for a while. It might be because I haven't taking my meds for a couple of days and the system is resetting to how I am before the meds: a withdrawal is a better term.

So whenever this occurs, I don't have any negative emotions. But I get this hyperactive feeling within that I imagine angery scenarios, blowing up on those I have an indirect problem? Longterm problems with family members that never been brought up to light or addressed is part of it. I imagine I'm having a yelling match with them, making my point across on why they're such a disappointment in my eyes.


Has anyone experienced this? I'm interested if there's a name for it.

Please share if you have something similar, thank you for reading."

537,Trouble finding a counsellor can someone guide me please? Live in the U.K. London,"So I’m a 20M and I attend uni and I would see my school counsellor due to feeling lonely and I have become nauseous from the loneliness but when I talk to people I also get nervous as well. 

So my counsellor told me I might have anxiety and the nausea and loneliness could be a symptom but the problem is I’m having a hard time finding a counsellor because I have lost my job and I don’t have a source of income (I am looking for work but juggling uni n work is tough for me) also I live in the U.K. London but my Parents are involved with my GP so I’m worried that they will find out I’m seeing a counsellor if I go through with the NHS 

So I’m asking should I be looking for a counsellor for anxiety or loneliness, and how can I get a counsellor without me going through with the NHS and one that costs less than usual I know I’m asking for a lot but maybe someone has some ideas perhaps"
538,I don’t get why people still care.,"I can’t get my fucking act together. I’m always tired and I can never get myself to be productive enough to stay on top of my homework. I’m very close to failing high school because of this.

But for whatever reason, everyone around me still tries to push me. Parents, friends, teachers, etc. It’s not that I don’t appreciate it, but I just don’t get it. I’m pretty much a lost cause. I’ve been nothing but a let down for the past 4 years. I’m just wasting their time and effort, but they continue to push me anyway.

I don’t understand why they haven’t given up yet. It doesn’t make sense, and it hurts like a bitch when people try to justify it with something along the lines of, “because we care”. Like, please stop caring then. I’m far from deserving of your time and energy. Stop caring, so I don’t have to disappoint you anymore.

Also, apologies if this is a difficult read. Not the best at stringing my emotions into coherent words."
539,"Do you ever feel sick when you think about something you did or that happened while you were not doing well, mentally? I don't mean like a trigger, just a feeling of ""I don't like this anymore/can't deal with this?""","For example - I can't listen to the song ""Happier"" by Bastille and Marshmello because it played on the radio every day when I was driving home from my Partial Hospitalization Program. The song makes me so nauseous and I will throw up if I hear it too much, or even if I think about it.

Similarly, I played the Deltarune demo when I was in a really bad place, and I get the same sort of nauseous feeling when I think about it, and that has transferred to Undertale a bit which really sucks because I LOVED Undertale.

It almost feels like my past is taking things away from me."
540,Unbalanced lifestyle,"I feel like my lifestyle is unbalanced in general. One of the main problems is the way I eat. When I eat a lot I can't stop eating which isn't super addicting or anything. But when I try to eat less I end up forgetting to eat. And I struggle to eat once I try. Even though it may be my favourite food I just don't feel like enjoying it. But once I force myself the food I can't stop. So it repeats itself.

The same thing goes with sleeping. I rarely find myself going to bed unless I force myself to do so.

I actually don't crave anything at all. I just lay in bed and do random things online when I don't have school or something like that. I have a goal which I am excited about and all otherwise

It sounds silly but I really struggle with this. It feels like there should be something that tells my brain what I need but it doesn't."
541,How to get rid of toxic emotions?,"There was a friend in my life who hurt me so much. Since then, I'm getting this toxic emotions. I become jealous because of stupid things like her social media popularity, her being part of groups etc. I trully hate it. I trully hate it that I still care so much about this ""ex-friend"". I stalk her social media just to find something that I can gossip about with other people. Gossip itself is a very toxic trait that I want to loose."
542,does anyone else get this?,"⚠️⚠️⚠️TW: mentions of ptsd, r@pe and dissociation⚠️⚠️⚠️




before i mention anything, i am not a victim of any of these things and i am not diagnosed with anything.

i have somewhat of an issue. i have “PTSD” of events that haven’t happened to me. i’ve has them since i was little and it feels so realistic that i start going through similar symptoms of ptsd without even realising it until recently when i saw a pafd of tiktok (obviously, i did more research with articles and first person experiences) and it’s kinda freaking me out.

for example, i hate being touched (especially waist and legs), constant nightmares, vivid thoughts and even stuff like hallucinations. this sounds absolutely stupid but does anyone know why i’m doing this to myself? it sounds ridiculous to go to therapy for fake trauma but it has been a big part of my life forever.

anyways, that’s my rant. thanks x"
543,Supporting my daughter,"My daughter is 22 and has struggled with mental health for the past ten years. She has taught me a lot about how best to support her but it still something that I find challenging. In the past two years she has figured out medication that really helps her. She has graduated from college, got a full time job that she likes, and is living in her own apartment with a roommate. Awesome!

I am trying to stay out of her business and have her run her life. She is surely capable. The problem I struggle with is when I see her not doing the stuff she needs to in order to function. She does not consistently take her medication and that sends her into a dark hole. This means that she will spend 1-2 days in bed and cannot function. If she continues to do this she will put her job at risk. College was accommodating with her  but I am sure that work will not be as accommodating. 

When she stays on her meds she not only functions well but also can feel emotions. Happy, sad, everything in between. When she is off her meds. She feel numb. Nothing. I want to shake her and yell ""just take your damn drugs!!"" but I know that is not exactly the right thing to do...

So today, I am frustrated with her. And angry too if I am really honest with myself. She has shown tremendous strength and fortitude to get here. A college degree and a great full time job. She is financially 100% independent. Woot! Just take your damn drugs...

I know the right call is to love her and support her and tell her I think she is awesome (and I do really think that). But today it is tough. I just want to shake her. She has this ability to self sabotage and I can see it happening. Argh!

Anyway, please let me know if you have any thoughtful guidance. I could sure use it."

547,How do I tell my lecturer that I'm all over the place with anxiety?,"So on Thursday I came on here and I said my lecturer didn't give me feedback on one of my assignments and it completely sent me on a whirl mentally because it seemed like she just didn't bother to mark it because of how bad I had done. And I was feeling sick and dizzy and wasn't sleeping, and I still haven't felt the same.
I decided to try and reach out to her so she could give me my feedback, but she didn't even reply.
Then she sent an email about 20 minutes ago saying we have a zoom meeting in the morning and told everyone to read over their feedback before they join.

Baring in mind I don't have feedback, I'm again feeling awful and sick and dizzy.
And I'm pretty sure when I join the meeting, she's going to hold me back at the end and tell me I've done everyone wrong.
And I honestly can't go through with this sort of mental state over this college assignment, so how do I tell her about how anxious I've been recently and how uncomfortable I am."

I have not been doing well in studies (That could be the reason why I'm guilty). My father always says to work hard but I feel like I have fallen into a hole where I can't get up anyway. I always feel sad and gloomy and tired all the time. Don't tell me I'm depressed, I'm not. I'm happy at time, I laugh, I smile but this is tiring, I dunno why I'm saying this, I feel like I need help. Am I venting? I dunno, maybe. I'm a piece of garbage. I get random suicidal thoughts at times like now. I just want to jump out of that balcony and just end everything. Is this mood swings cuz you know am I an edgy teen who's just complaining about the smallest things?"
550,I want to STOP feeling alone....,"I just want to stop being in bed feeling this missing part of myself thats not there. I want to make it a mission to get deeper connections this year. I want to go out and be the guy who organises things. Even if I dont get this I atleast want to try. I'm so tried of feeling alone. 

I want more from life and just to achieve more. I know I'm a good person and I'm working on myself. I want to be happy and get more confident within myself. 

Its a motive...

Any tips of making new friends would be great as an m24 ...basically an adult."
551,Experiencing a new kind of suicidal ideation and I’m not sure how to manage them,"I’m approaching 30, autistic, bipolar, lots of other stupid mental shit. Been struggling with on and off suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Haven’t really been serious about it since my last failed attempt at 22. 
Before it was very intense. Like overwhelming despair and sadness was the underlying emotion behind my suicidal thoughts. They were about escaping and had an urgency about them. Like a high energy desperation.
I’ve recently had them popping up again but it’s entirely diff. It’s more of an exhaustive response to being unable to progress my life, having to deal with nonstop roadblocks, some of which are typically so ridiculously easy to overcome for most people that it’s hard to take myself or anything in my life seriously anymore.
So instead of a frantic shaky crying spell that used to happen when these thoughts come up,

I’m just laying there on my side thinking about how it would be nice to just not exist anymore...to just to close my eyes and lay there until I decompose

Thing is my life isn’t even all that bad. I’m just tired of living it.

So effing tired"
552,Reclaiming my life,"So, I'm 19F and have in the last few months had a very bad period of mental health. I suffer with depression and have for many years but due to COVID and a myriad of other situations, it has got significantly worse.

In September my boyfriend of a year broke up with me out of the blue. He made it extremely messy, had lied and gaslighted me during this time and done the same to our friends. I met him at college (UK - so not university) and he had no real friends at the time so he became a part of my friendship group as we had lunch together every day. This group was made up of about 10 people, some of whom were in relationships so bringing in someone else because I was in a relationship with them wasn't an issue. He integrated into the group perfectly fine, although, it was still clear that they were all more my friends than his - mostly because I was in the same class as half of them and had known them a year previously. During lockdown, we did quizzes every week and we set up a Minecraft server for all of us to play on so even though the interaction of lunch everyday was gone we still did a lot together. I had my moments in lockdown as I believe everyone did. My mum is a key worker so I was home alone most days so I often felt lonely when nobody was available to talk to me. 

As university approached, there was a quite obvious change in our relationship, we had the freedom to see each other again and at least once a month we stayed for around a week at each others houses.  The change being that we were now comfortable. Staying at his, I felt like I could go and do everything for myself such as make food, watch TV etc. without needing to ask and it was the same when he stayed at mine. I put this down to us settling a bit, a bit of normalcy before things would change again when we went to university. We also knew at this point that our universities were only a 10 minute train journey apart which was actually a shorter distance than what we had to travel to get to each other's homes (about a 30-40 minute car journey). We had talked about university and what that would mean for our relationship both prior to knowing where we would be and after. Both of us were happy, in fact, after watching 'fresh meat' (a tv show about university students) together, he had made a massive point of how happy and secure he felt to be going into a new environment in a relationship. Yet a week after this he suddenly stopped talking to me then broke up with me. I think that's what still hurts the most as I'll never know if he actually meant what he said at the time, regarding being happy to be with me, or if it was all a lie. He told our friends straight away saying it was mutual and I was fine - both of which were not true. Because of this none of my friends reached out to me as they thought, from what he had told them, that I was fine and wanted some space. This is where it gets messy. When I finally took it upon myself to reach out I found out what he had said and cleared up the situation. I didn't want to involve anyone else within it but he already had. The situation now turned into our friends choosing who to side with and a few of them knowing my mental state and the truth of the situation sided with me. My ex knew that his place within the group was slipping away and that it was his own doing (because of how he handled it not because he had ended our relationship). This led to more lies and an increase in aggression from him. I decided to take a step away from everything, I had just started university and needed to focus on that. When I returned and spoke to the friend that was closest to the both of us he told me that my ex hadn't been doing anything with them such as the quizzes, playing games and talking in general. I think he just felt like he didn't have the right to be in the group despite the many times I had told him that I didn't have any issue with him staying and that if my presence made him uncomfortable that I was actually happy to go. His birthday rolled around and I had previous to our break up already got him a present - a customised football shirt with his name on. I couldn't return it and it had cost me around £80. I didn't have his exact university address so I asked the friend closest to us to find it for me, making sure that when he asked that he stated it was a present from everyone not just from me. I knew that if he knew it was from me he wouldn't wear it out of spite and I was not going to waste £80 on something that would never be worn. I got the address, sent him the shirt. I also was going to get a cake to send him but with lockdown once more, everything was shut. I took it upon myself to make one and messaged one of his flatmates to see if I could get him to take it off me so my ex would never know I had done anything - I just wanted him to have a nice birthday. He found out and kicked off - his flatmate had told him prior to me leaving to deliver it what I was doing. He was aggressive towards me again so I just left it and disappeared. I left social media with no word to anyone and blocked all contacts (but only calls they could still text) on my phone bar my mother and a few friends.   

That was mid-November and now two months later I've not had any message of concern from anyone. I wrote a post on Tumblr explaining that I was not ok and that I was going - for good (when I wrote it I was feeling very suicidal and since reading it back the end of the post does indicate that very clearly). I left the link to this post on my Instagram, which we had our group chat on, and deleted all my posts so the only thing on my profile was the link. I did the same thing on all my social media, anyone could look me up and see my post straight away. Yet, nothing. I still have heard nothing. I guess I did it because I was fed up of being constantly used by others or being lied to or not supported. I just wanted to reclaim back some control and see if anyone actually cared. 

I talked to two friends recently and explained this to them. One of them I went to school with and have known for around 10 years and the other I've known for about 3 years and we met online due to a mutual interest (and have subsequently met to see that interest). I asked for their opinion on the matter and whether or not I should go back to that group of friends or move on. The friend I've known for longer said that it seemed to her like I wanted to disappear and it was an insane idea to try and remove my existence from the internet and that it would hurt future prospects for me (although all my social media isn't under my actual name/email/phone number). The other friend supported me saying I should just move on and do what I want to do and if that involved me using social media under another name so I could stay in contact with distant family then that would be fine. (For context: I have family who live in rural France and Scotland, phone connections there are poor so social media/the internet is the main form of communication I have with them).

Am I insane wanting to rebrand myself entirely? I'd obviously still keep the connection with the few friends I've kept in the loop and my family but I just want to move on and start afresh. I don't feel the need to go as far as changing my name or anything legal. I just want more opinions on if how I'm feeling is ok and if I'm taking this too far?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Had a messy break-up. Was already suffering with depression prior and it's gotten worse. I disappeared off all social media and blocked calls (but not texts) from everyone but family and a few friends. I left a message online explaining me going which sounded suicidal. I've had no messages of concern since. I don't know whether to go back to the friends who don't know and seemingly don't care about me. I asked two of my friends who know I'm fine and one supported me moving on and if need be using a fake name on social media to keep in contact with some of my family. The other friend said that what I had done is insane and will hurt me in the future. I want to have some control over my life and I don't know whether having no presence online is the way to go about it.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone wants more context then I'm happy to explain, I just really want some help with this.

Thank you very much."
553,Irish Schizophrenic Web Guy Video...,"[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPKTmfwOhxSdPbxI-q3uRPA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPKTmfwOhxSdPbxI-q3uRPA)

My experience with schizophrenia in Ireland. The illness. The side effects. The homelessness. And eventually the gradual recovery.  

A first-hand account of living with schizophrenia and mental illness.   I'm a 42-year-old, Irish, web guy who was diagnosed a little over a decade ago.

 I spent a long time on disability, dealing with my illness and for the most part. Sleeping 16 hours a day.  Finally, I was made homeless and I was provided with accommodation in a shelter by an Irish charity called the Saint Vincent De Paul.  

Then 2 things happened. I listened to my doctor's advice and switched medication. And I was assigned a social worker because of my housing situation.  

Gradually I began to recover. First I started working out. Then I changed my diet from takeaways to healthy food. I gave up smoking, drinking and other intoxicants.   

I started another web business while in the homeless shelter. Gradually, I began to recover.   Today, I still live with the illness. But I cope pretty well, under the circumstances.   

I hope my journey helps others out there who are experiencing mental health and other difficulties.  I'll try to make this a regular post. 

So make sure to subscribe below the video on YouTube if you're interested  . Also, if you have any questions. Ask below and I'll answer as soon as I have the time.  

Thanks for reading/watching.

554,Diagnosed with ADHD at 23 - where do I go from here?,"hi, im a 23 year old irish girl who was diagnosed with adhd just before my final year of uni.

As a teen I suffered from severe depression, was bullied (I was laughed at for my looks and a closeted lesbian), had an extremely abusive family and also struggled with concentration and social situations.

After all of the pain and struggle I realised a lot of my issues aren't my fault and a part of my personality, but that I have adhd and some things I can't control. I found solace in that but I am now in therapy trying to deal with my traumas and scary past. 

Sometimes it gets a bit much for me and I find it so hard to focus and now I am even reconsidering the career I was going to choose (I wanted go to graduate school for law) but now I feel like that might not be the best decision.

Any advice for me from anyone with a late diagnosis, abusive past and who is trying to do their best in a challenging time? I feel really overwhelmed!!"
555,Denouncement,I would just like to publicly state that absolutely denounce that movement. The trumpcult. I apologize for my utterly disgusting behavior and hateful rhetoric. I would just like to ask that you plz spare my kids.
556,Lacking emotional maturity in my 20s - what do I do?,"I've recently noticed I'm SO behind most people my age in terms of maturity and It's destroying my life.

I have a hard time processing adult things and big responsibilities scare me. I have terrible impulse control, I get annoyed at tiny things, I can be self-centered and frequently lie when I feel vulnerable. I keep screwing up and I feel so anxious around people in fear of doing the wrong thing.

I think it stems from my childhood. My parents were very emotionally absent and they never had any time for me. I remember going to my mother for support when I had a problem and she'd always say she's ""too tired"" from work. Meanwhile, my father was also hopeless and I'd be met with the classic ""ask your mother"" response. I was rejected at all angles and I still feel like that helpless child on the inside.

Therapy isn't possible in my current financial situation and having lost my closest friends now due to being an irresponsible asshole, there's no one I can turn to. I'm really scared and in a dark place. I was even close to ringing a suicide hotline the other day, and I was never at that stage before.

If anyone has any advice with growing in maturity or fighting impulses, I'd be hugely grateful. Thanks for reading."
557,What wrong with my lack of ability to socialize?,"I never made any friends or had any social skills in my life. I am already 40, and my family doesn't have a history of living beyond 60.  It is just hard to accept that I missed out so much on life, and it is so hard to make friends since everyone my age is working and has a family to worry about. I am single. I don't know what went wrong with me. My parents never abused me, and I did go to school. I simply just never connected with my classmates in school."
558,How do I stop thinking that I have to prove something to my childhood bullies?,"How to stop thinking that you have to prove yourself to your bullies?

I’ve come a very long way in my self improvement journey but there is one hiccup I cannot seem to get over. In my childhood, I was severely bullied in middle school. I felt very small, wrong, powerless and threatened. After finishing high school in our small town, I moved to a metropolitan city many regard as having “made it”, attended a prestigious university, made new friends, was on national television and showed everything off on my social media. At first it worked, I felt better and my old horrible classmates stalked my every move. I felt a lot of satisfaction from that because it felt like productive revenge. After lockdown I had to return to my town to live with my parents and finish my 3rd year online and decided to delete all my social media because I was tired of proving to others that I wasn’t a loser - but still being in my hometown I have this irrational fear of running into my bullies again, them still viewing me as a loser and me feeling as small and helpless as back then. It’s like all my rationality shuts off in this flight or fight response. I don’t want to feel this way. 

Any advice? ❤️"
559,Help me to understand my abusive wife? :(,"* Apologies, English is not my first language. I hope this post is intelligible enough for you to understand to help point me in the right direction so I can understand what's happening to my wife?
* I've suspected for a long time, she has mental disorder. I've known her for ten years now, four of which we were married. I wonder how much of our fights is due to personality or cultural differences, or she's simply ill or a psychopath? Many times she sees Black, I see White. 
* She is by nature, very charming, likeable, cheerful and kind to people. The life of the party wherever she goes, while I'm the more introverted type. She's smart in influencing people, she is good at what she does with her work, although very messy with organisation. She doesn't learn from books, but rather learn from the streets and the constant thinking she has for every minute details. At times, I feel that she is wasting her energy to think so much without stopping. 
* The thing that disturbs me is, after our fight, while I usually cannot sleep, sometimes till the wee hours of the morning, she could simply switch off from our fight, take phone calls from friend, and have a good laugh during her calls. It's almost as if nothing happened! WTF? 
* She is constantly paranoid about me cheating on her which I don't! The accusations were so bad before our marriage, but got much lesser since we got married. We both work from home, and literally see each other every day.  Just a few days earlier, she showed a video taken during our family holiday (where we had my mom, brother, my wife, my kid and the nanny living in multi bedroom apartment). That video she took from the nanny's FB page taken during our holiday in 2019 (two years ago). A video that shows a short clip taken with low light, and a foot walking, showing nothing but the whole apartment itself - with some whispering at the end which she accused it was my voice. Initially, I had no idea about that video, where she took it from, and what those whispers were. She texted me accusing me that I did something with the nanny. I mean, come on, where was she at the time? We were all in the same apartment! A normal person verdict on this situation will be: She has her own reality of things that others don't see! Fast forward a few days later, she came to her senses, and she is back to me video-calling me every day telling me how much she missed and loved me. We're currently separated, due to a Christmas holiday for which she went without me.
* She would pick up old incidents in the past (sometimes years back) and mentioned it during a fight. Similar to that nanny video incident, it's almost like she has a different reality. Paranoia at its worst. Years ago, a guy who I didn't recognise called, which was someone we knew during our party life years ago. I hung up because it was odd for him to call, and that I didn't recognise him. I thought it was probably some lamer from night life. And today, she is telling me I am bisexual or gay mentioning this call from years ago to support her claim! This was triggered because earlier today, I sent her a pdf novel which I downloaded, in good faith to give her because she likes to read novel. Remember this is fresh from the nanny video incident just days earlier which has passed to a few days of loving video calls. I only know the writer is popular, I just went to a search engine, and downloaded two novels for her without reading it. She claimed it's gay content! So we are having this fight now.
* A few days earlier - we decided that we will call each other Mama and Papa, as opposed to our names, hoping it sounded more loving and that it will help us with our communication. It did work for a few days, where we both sounded a lot gentler to each other. We video called each other a few times daily - promising ourselves that we will fix our relationship better. We both felt in love again after years of fighting. Then this shit happens again.
* She keeps changing her mind. One day it's A for her, the next day is B.
* She is very critical of every situation. She doesn't believe everything at face value. She's always reading between the lines in every situation. She'll probe more for information to get the whole story about a situation rather than accepting on what is being said/told to her. It's like one fine day, she thought of something, and won't stop at digging through to form her conclusion. As you can see, she went as far as digging our nanny's FB post in 2019. It's a very thin line between critical and paranoia? Because talking to me will usually come in the form of accusing without base or the slightest proof!
* She is very explosive, and during our severe fights, she would throw stuffs to my face especially when I don't stop yelling at her.
* Before marriage, she would hurt herself, cut her wrists, during our fights, if I didn't give in to her. I thought this was due to drugs which we both consumed from time to time during our younger days where we used to party a bit. We stopped doing drugs since we got married. I am seeing similarities to the past. That if she doesn't get what she wants, everything will fall apart. Although she doesn't cut her wrist anymore - that pattern is there. She will go all out and fuck me, accuse me and go explosive.
* Yet, when she's well and ""normal"", she would tell me how much she loves me. FML.
* I haven't been producing stable income these 3 years since i lost my previous business. So she's been the breadwinner. She hasn't ditched me because of that. Yet, she complained so much about me on our differences. It's like she hates me, but she won't leave me! Yet, this could also mean, that she loves me so much that she doesn't want to leave me? Or is it pity like she would say, during our fights. That she pities me. Oh yes, we say the nastiest things to each other during our fight.
* If she's so angry most of the time and says the nastiest thing to me, why would she not just ditch me?
* It's almost like this marriage is just a game to her. As long as she has our son with her, she has nothing to lose. She had packed her luggage before maybe like 5-6 times during our 4 years of marriage, with a total separation between us nearly 1.5 years where she would leave me alone in my house. She would either rent an apartment within city, or to move to her mother and family, four hours away by flight. Sometimes she is gone for 3 weeks, 2 months, or the longest was 6 months where have said many times that we would divorce each other. Both her families and my families know we fight a lot. It's nearly always so bad that everyone has to hear the shouts, and the packed luggage. 
* Then her mom would usually be the peacemaker, asking me to pick her daughter up and bring her back to my house. 
* This time, she went back for Christmas to see her mom, taking along my son, without me. She asked me to go along. I refused because I feel pressured with the expenses as I don't want to impose on anybody to cover my bills. Its' been a month now - and this is why I'm writing here.  Just a few days ago, she video called me daily missing me - and suddenly today, we have another nonsensical fight again. Another delay, another fight, another few days wasted!
* It's almost like she's finding excuses to pick a fight. Yet, why does she always come back when the dust has settled!?
* She's highly unstable! Opinions can change in a matter of days. She seemed to forget conclusions of our earlier decisions before. We have hundreds of decisions to make during the course of our life. It seemed that she has trouble remembering what we both agreed. It's like she is twisting fact that happened in the past, to justify whatever arguments that she has during a fight.
* Are these symptoms of a mental disorder? Please help ..."
560,Forcing myself,"
 There's so many things that I don't want to do,band that I have no energy to do. It's really tiring and making me feel really unsettling when I do them but I still do them anyways. I keep on forcing myself to join outings with my friends even though I just want to be by myself and I force myself to volunteer at a certain club even though I feel so panicky over the little plans and details. I really don't want to do any of these but I feel so worthless, so unworthy of saying no. I feel like it's pathetic and selfish of me to cancel just because I don't have the strength or heart to do the things I would do anymore. Strangely enough, I'm okay if other people do the same as what I want to do.

  I just want to lie in bed, be alone the whole day and just block everything out. But I have my own commitments forcing myself to do things that makes me feel very uncomfortable everytime I do. Even typing this alone makes me feel so pathetic. I'm not good at expressing my feelings and I barely express the things I feel to my friends or family out of fear that I'm bothering them or that they share the same view as me when it comes to my own feelings; pathetic and trivial.

  I keep on pretending everything is okay and I'm okay wih the things that I'm doing when I'm not. I want this feeling to stop and I want me to stop whatever I'm doing right now but I'm a coward. I want to search for medical help but I don't want to. I'm scared that I'm right and they'll just dismiss my troubles and feelings as a trivial matter. I don't know where I should go or what I should do anymore. I don't want to be a hassle to my family or others at the club. Plus, I'm going to a new school on April and I'm scared that I'll miss out on school and the club activities if I have to go somewhere or go for appointments. I don't know. I really don't know. I want to force myself to do the things I don't want to do so nobody will be bothered or affected by me but at the same time, I want to just do what I want to do. I feel very selfish and pathetic if I just drop the act and everything one day because it'll be out of nowhere. I don't want to distrupt the manpower, the help and timing just because of me. I don't want to miss out on all the other things if there is awaiting for me in the future."
561,I want to improve my mental health,"I'm a 21 year old girl from south asia , currently staying with my parents . From long time my mental health has not been good . It's okish and somehow I have forced through life . 
But now I have decided to change it . So I need some advice and suggestion about how to take care of my mental health . I have low self-esteem and possibly attachment issue . I'm quite pessimistic too ."
562,Going through it,"So October last year I ended up in hospital after a attempt on my life, wasn’t really taken seriously and was discharged the next day with no further support, I was already seeing a psychologist privately and under my GP for medication so I assume this is why. No follow up from GP, my psychologist did take it seriously but since then seems to have given up on me after months of struggling to keep up with appointments and ‘homework’, missing appointments because my memory is terrible and being incredibly busy with work etc. 
So I’ve been coping in my own and feeling like I’m managing, then when chatting with my sister she brought up how one of her university friends attempted and ended up in hosp, then was admitted, released then readmitted then sectioned. 
Hearing about this has really triggered a lot of feelings for me, sadness for my sisters friend obviously, jealously that she seems to have been taken a lot more seriously than I have been, angry at myself, that feeling that I’m not ‘ill enough’ to deserve help etc and dealing with lots of complicated feelings around SH/suicidal ideation 
On the one hand I feel like I should try and get my support back in place but the other I feel undeserving and annoyed that no one seems to take me seriously, I also went of antidepressants about 7-8 weeks ago and now I’m not sure if I am doing as well as I thought I was. 
Anyway not sure if this is just venting or if there is any advice anyone can offer, I just felt like I needed to get things off my chest"
563,Issue with my mum,"I need help.

I feel like my mum is manipulative and toxic for me but she has mental health issues and I don’t know what to do? She also really negatively effects my mental health.

Basically in 2017 my mother went to prison for roughly 4 months and then as soon as she got out she became extremely depressed and was put on antidepressants by our doctor, a couple of months in she blamed her depression on me and basically made me feel like everything was my fault. 

Fast forward a couple of years my mother says that she wants to commit suicide, obviously I’m worried about her but I really struggle to communicate my emotions so I end up just being like “oh okay.”

She then repeatedly says that she is going to kill her self whenever I do something she doesn’t like, one time she wrote a suicide note and made me read it in front of her to see my reaction however I didn’t really have one.

Then I find out that my mother had took my bank card and stole over £300 from me (I still haven’t got it back) 

I started to begin to realise last year that my mum going to prison when I was younger really actually kind of traumatised me in a way, I can no longer really feel/communicate my emotions and I really struggle to think about that time.

I’m not sure if I should feel bad for thinking that she’s toxic for me and I’m actually really worried how she will react when I move out."
564,I’m trying to figure out whether or not I’m actually a bad person or not,"I’ve been to several therapists and basically all of them have said that nothing is wrong with me.

In fact, most people get along with me fine except for people who are... notoriously difficult from my understanding?

But see, that’s where I’m confused.

Of course if I were truly difficult I would think of them in that way and make those generalizations due to blindsightedness from my ego.

People find me polite and easygoing most of the time I interact with them in real life but sometimes I get these very... weird, specifically ominous inbox messages on various social media sites like “fuckyoufuckyoufuckyou” or “I hope you die” and this one girl I didn’t even know sent me this weird inspirational quote thing about how “men are trash” and proceeded to call me an idiot after I asked what the point of it was.

I mean I’d expect this if I had like a bunch of controversial political views and made a shit ton of posts about it or something, but I normally just post... pictures? Like casual pictures of completely unrelated shit to literally anything relevant. I don’t even message people at all unless they message me first because I don’t want to feel like a weirdo or a creepy stranger.

There’s only two people I don’t get along with in real life: my mom (a stereotypical red flag for a guy), and a former friend (it’s one-sided though because she’s okay with me, but she creepily infantilized me when I knew her and it made me really uncomfortable).

I don’t get along with my mom... when I’m actually honest with her at least, and she doesn’t really get along with anyone and is super rude to my grandparents and will act shitty and sarcastic and be like “oh how *invigorating*” when my grandma just tries to tell her how her day went.

Sometimes I call my mom out on her bullshit but she’s very good at deflecting and it’s confusing as fuck and I lose track of what the hell we’re even talking about but still feel like a shitty person afterwards.

Honestly at this point, I just want someone to throw a glass of water in my face and hand me a bullet-point list of everything that I do wrong so that I can look at it and actually maybe figure out how to become a better human potentially instead of people just incoherently yelling nonsense at me and expecting me to know what the fuck they mean?

My mom at one point asked me “Why is it my job to explain why you’re wrong?” after calling me wrong about something.

Am I really an ignorant, infuriating idiot? 

What is wrong with me and why do I so often unintentionally induce others to a state of rage?

I meet two kinds of people and I hate it. I meet people who literally find me to be the most reasonable person on the planet, and then people who actually could be attempting to point out my flaws but do so with arguments that have gaping holes that I can’t help but point out for the sake of actually fucking learning from my mistakes, but then they just storm off usually?

I can’t live like this! I can’t just alternate between being blindly glorified and then have the only people who hate me not make any sense! 

I just need someone calm and reasonable to look me in the face and clearly explain why I am so fucking jarring to be around or witness and how the hell I can fix it... but there is literally no one on this earth who is like that!

All I’ve got in terms of personal feedback are “you are 100% perfect don’t change at all” and “die” ...neither are helpful!

God I wish my interactions with people would just stop being so fucking... surreal. Nothing is making sense and therapy is not helpful in the slightest because my therapist only says good fucking things about me and my personality.

What the hell is wrong with my life and/or me?"
565,I've been thinking that I'm gonna die soon,I have this feeling that I'm gonna die soon. I'm scared because I'm only 14 I don't wanna die. I've been having self esteem issues and some anger issues. I hate how I look. I think it might be because I'm kind of mentally unstable. I've been crying 4 days straight at the evenings. I usually only get sad at the evenings. I dreamed that I will die on April 18th. Please tell me what to do. Quarantine doesn't help either because my whole town is in a lock down.
566,Impact of You (97),"We are **ALL** special and unique in our own ways. We forget that sometimes by focusing our energy on other people, on what they can do thats ""extraordinary"" to us that we forget what **WE** can do things thats extraordinary for us.

We all have unique talents, special qualities that comes to us easy that someone else would have to work towards doing naturally. Yes, it will still take work to improve, focus on and better ourself but **EACH** and everyone of us have something, or many things inside of us that are **MEANT** for us to focus on, that makes us feel unconditionally at Peace and Whole when focusing on. For me, its painting, writing, being in nature, speaking with people but as I said there are many things that we all are unconditionally authentic at and when we begin to be self aware of what those are, more come into our life with ease.

It takes practice, it takes time focusing on our passions, crafts, hobbies etc., that then will allow the Universe to guide us to what is meant for us, but remember it is **ALL** meant for us, it is **ALL** apart of our own individual journey and path of life. Something that you do naturally, play a instrument, learn a language, write, paint etc., can only be done in **YOUR** style and by **YOU** that couldn't be replicated if tried. 

Remember, **YOU** are special. **YOU** are authentic; what **YOU** bring to the world is needed from **YOU**, so please let the world see your talents. **WE TRULY NEED IT.** Together, Separately.

**Today:** Be Present in the moment. Enjoy the time you have been given. Its Sunday. You can either go slow or work hard, its up **YOU** and both are valid. Be Gentle.

**I love you.**

567,My mom has got me really messed up right now. Telling me things I remember very vividly aren't real; they never happened.,"I got into a heated argument with my mom last night. Where I was casually bringing up her low points and the things she did wrong when she was raising me. I told her that I forgive her for that stuff and understand. To which she told me she doesn't care if me, my brother or my sister forgive her. 

Anyway, some years back her and my sister had a falling out. From there my mom denied a lot of what happened on my sisters side of things. My sister even went as far as to defend me. Saying mom was wrong for treating me so horribly. Which my mom said she was never that bad to me that my sister was being dramatic. 

My sister also brought up a very specific incident that at the time I remembered quite easily because it had only been 2-3 years prior. An incident where my sister wanted to invite her best friend, who was pretty much family, to our house on Christmas day to spend time with her, because she didn't really have a family to actually spend a good, real Christmas with. My mom got upset at this, started yelling, screaming and ultimately it culminated into her grabbing 4 bottles out of the kitchen cabinet, sobbing, going to her room and locking the door. Which she claimed never happened. But my sister and I both remember that. 

My mom at one point, was being super mean to me around Christmas. Yelling at me, telling me I wasn't going fast enough at cleaning my room on Christmas Eve despite the fact that it was 11 am. Eventually she backed me into a corner yelling at me beside my bed/bedside table. Little did she know I had been hurting myself a good bit at the time. I told her all I wanted to do was just die. Without missing a beat, ""Go ahead, do it."" So I turned around quickly, picked up my razor and sliced my left arm. It bled a good bit and was decently deep. But all she had to say was ""[Husband], call the cops. Get him out of here. I'm tired of him."" 

She told my sister during that argument that never happened. Which was funny because two years later around Christmas she was fine talking about it and apologizing for doing it to me. She apologized for how she treated my sister far better than me and my brother. I accepted her apology and was glad to finally see her care for once. 

Well, this facade has since been unmasked. She would tell me that she didn't treat my sister better, that she treated us all equally. She would then tell me that her telling me to do it never happened. And last night, when discussing this stuff. She told me she had never gotten into my face for no reason and hit me. I brought up an incident from like 5-6 years ago where she had started yelling at me as soon as I got home, pushing me until I tripped and fell onto my bed with her on top of me slapping me repeatedly. 

That memeory was what stopped everything. After having spent 15 minutes defending my dad (mom said she hated my dad for making her take care of the kids by herself but he worked an afternoon shift all 5 weekdays to provide for us while my mom sat around watching TV and telling my sister to cook or help me with school work but then use me as an excuse to not get a job) and despite defending him. Despite having his back. He fucking turned on me immediately and started siding with her. She started crocodile tears and they started getting in my face, yelling at me, threatening to kick me out. All because I was calmly trying to figure out my reality. 

I'm still left wondering. Are those memories fake? Did my brain make them up? Or are they real and she's gaslighting me? Having me question God and my own existence. If those events are real and she's lying to make herself feel better, I will never, ever talk to her again. And I will be waiting for the day she rots. As far as my memory goes she's always been super horrible to me. My dad has too only because he does what she says because he's spineless. Which I have always thought was funny because he apparently wanted me. Yeah, thanks dick. I got born into a world I would have rather not been born into because you thought you wanted a kid but couldn't handle actually having one."
568,Completely shutting down with anxiety from society &amp;current events,"This is mostly a vent, but I could also use support. 


I feel like I've had a decent grip on my mental state over the past couple years, but despite that and despite my medication, I can feel myself slipping. I live in the US and I just can't handle this shit any more. Lately I've had a constant lump in my throat and pit in my stomach from anxiety, and when I'm not panicking I'm disassociating. Everything keeps getting crazier and crazier. Things just keep escalating...when will it stop!? Where is all of this leading to? How have people become so hateful and unreasonable? How much of this can I take before I completely snap and want out? Everything that's happening is a stress ON TOP of managing the anxiety and depression that's already there.


Between the pandemic and the political tension I don't understand how we are supposed to hang on and stay sane. I'm dreading that something terrible will happen in the upcoming days, but too many people seem to be cheering on the possibility of a civil war. Do they not understand the full implication of what civil war would mean? I feel like we're done as a country no matter what. I keep telling myself that I'm exaggerating all the potentials but so far everything has played out exactly like I worried it would six months ago. 


Not to mention a mutating deadly virus looming in the background.  The vaccines aren't being distributed efficiently enough, and regardless, so many people have been twisted by conspiracies and disinformation that they'll refuse it and covid will continue to be a problem anyway.


Facts don't exist in this country anymore. Everyone just believes whatever they want. I feel like somehow, at some point,  I've slipped into some weird, dystopian parallel universe. We all go about our business, occasionally making comments of ""yeah, things are really crazy,"" but we're numb to JUST how insane it all is. We all know something is deeply, deeply wrong but we don't know how it happened, how to repair it, or even what exactly it is so we just ignore it.


I'm so scared for the future, and I'm so tired of being scared. And I'm tired of pretending not to be scared. Not sure how to cope moving forward. I just need a hug and for someone to tell me that everything is going to be okay. Even though it probably won't be."
569,this might sound stupid but can triggers be occasional?,"my abuser and i shared a lot of the same interests and talked about them a lot. half of the time i feel okay thinking about that stuff or have completely reclaimed it for myself. other times i feel like i'll get a panic attack thinking about it because it reminds me so heavily of him.. like for instance. he really liked phineas and ferb. sometimes i can talk about the show as a meme with my friends, have fun or whatever. but other times i see this stupid kids show and start feeling like i'm gonna freak out. i'm just wondering, can triggers be occasional?"
570,Help with SO,"Well, here goes... it’s my first time going through something like this so I feel like someone here could give me a couple pointers or advice. My SO had a situation where she wanted to be admitted we did that, now she’s on meds but she’s having a hard time being social again and is just very short with me sometimes. I know the meds take a while to stabilize and it’s not her usual normal behavior. Patience is key but I’m at a place where I’ve never been at and I’m a little sad and confused. Hope y’all have a great rest of the day also a pleasant week."
571,I've been living with mental disorders since I was 15 but I'm running out of ability to cope,"I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD back in 2013, and did some solid work with a therapist and managed to bring myself basically back on track and headed towards a good life.

Then I got divorced, ran out of money for my private college, and my symptoms worsened so much that I find myself unable to shower most days or even look for a job let alone work one. Even trying to do schoolwork so I can stave off student loan payments makes my brain scream. I feel like I just stumble through every day and wake up the next one and do the same thing over and over and I can't keep it up. I have two girlfriends and we all love each other deeply but they also have their own issues and I don't know where to turn. I have a therapist I see every week but I don't know. I just don't fucking know what I'm doing or what I'm supposed to do or how I'm supposed to make myself feel human enough to survive on my own or even with the people I love

How the fuck do people work every day? I literally can't imagine it without wanting to die. I've tried part time jobs and they grind my soul down. I don't know how to survive."
572,I'm sad that my friend is gone,"For a few years, I was friends with this girl online. She always told me she cared about me and I cared about her a lot as well. There were times when she got me through a lot, and I often felt like she was all that I had. We talked every day, any day that I didn't hear from her was unusual. 

However, she's always been very bad with texting back. I tried to accept it, but over time it got worse and it started bothering me. We had conversations about it and she would apologize for it, but she kept doing it and literally nothing would change. It wasn't just not texting back though, she'd also log out in the middle of conversations without saying a word, like literally while I was explaining something or telling her a story. I felt like I was being ignored, like she didn't want to talk to me. I can deal with someone not texting back once in a while, I think I have a pretty high threshold where that's concerned, but with her it was literally every time we talked and it was impossible to have a real conversation because she'd just take several hours to get back to me between each individual line of text and disappear at random times. I never understood why she couldn't just tell me she was busy. Even ""hey I'm busy"" would have instantly made everything better. But she never did that. She would also complain about when her other friends would ignore her for like an hour, but she would ignore me for way longer than that. 

I sent her a message explaining that I was upset over this. I didn't understand why it was an issue when her friends would ignore her, but she could ignore me all the time. I tried to refrain from cursing and sounding angry or accusatory, I just stated some facts and told her that I wasn't happy with what she was doing. I told her that I didn't know how I could rationally stay friends with someone who was going to ignore me for several hours/days on a regular, routine basis. 

She never responded to my message. It's been two weeks and I haven't heard anything from her. I'm very upset that she's gone and that I probably won't get to talk to her again. I feel so lonely, like I just have no one to talk to. I just have this constant wave of sadness hovering over me and I have a pit in my stomach whenever I think about her. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't have sent that message at all and just learned to tolerate it. I would have been happier. 

What should I do?"
573,I’m glad I went to a psych ward for help but I hate what made me make that decision,"I (26F) have anxiety, severe depression, ptsd, adhd, and some kind of mood disorder that we can’t ever correctly diagnose 🙃 

I went to one of my state’s only psych wards back in January 2018. It’s very well known for not being the best place to go for mental health, but as I said, it’s one of the only ones. I personally wanted to just check into the local hospital’s psych unit but I was persuaded into the place I went to because it was an “official” ward (Total bullshit, I know but my brain was not recognizing things for what they were at the time). So I went. And my experience was a good one (I’m still friends with the roommate I had there to this day). I got help I really needed and put back on a good path and have been pretty okay for the most part. I can honestly say that despite its reputation I’m glad I went to the psych ward. 

Except... while I made the decision on my own to go, I had also basically been tricked to do so... by my ex. 

I was 23 at the time living with my bf(now my ex) and our two roommates. My mental health began to spiral and I was talking about and attempting to take my own life multiple times a week for about a month. 

My ex decided to break up with me, and I quote, “because I can’t take your depression and suicide attempts”. While I understand that that can be a lot to take, it’s important to know that my ex was unmedicated but also had severe mental health issues that I helped him cope with no matter what. 

I broke down and told him I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to get help but I was scared to and didn’t want to be alone. He took my hands and promised me that we would check in together, so then I wouldn’t be alone. I accepted this, and suggested the local hospital 10 minutes away because I had heard excellent things about their psych unit. 

He told me that unit was absolute ass and that he would prefer we went to a “real” psych ward. I wanted to get help so as scared as I was, I ultimately agreed, and we were off in his car, driving nearly 3 hours in horrid New England winter weather. 

We pulled up to the entrance of the building, and we went in together, hand in hand. To this day I feel so stupid for what happened next. 

I went up to the reception counter to check in. My ex was by my side, for what I thought was to wait his turn. After I signed the initial paperwork and before I followed an orderly to another room, my ex hugged me. He said, “Bye.” And turned around and left. Like left the building, got in his car and left me there. Alone. Scared. Confused. Stunned. 

This place doesn’t like to release you once you’ve signed papers until they deem you fit to be released so I would have ended up staying there anyways. But if I had the choice to leave, I was now left there without a ride home in a strange town 3 hours away from anyone I knew. I was abandoned at a psychiatric hospital. 

But even so, I wanted the help. And I was already there, so I continued. 

I was there for a week before I was deemed fit for release and my Grandma came and picked me up and brought me home to her house. 

I later found out that my ex told the patrons of the bar we worked at that I was in the “Looney Bin” and toward the end of 2019 (a fucking whole ass year later) he started telling people that I held a gun to his head (I can’t even be in the same room as a gun because I mentally shut down from severe anxiety around them, how the fuck am I even going to pick one up?!)

I got the rumors debunked fairly quickly and I’m no longer dealing with my ex. We have like three mutual friends (who never knew my story) who have been very respectful of me not wanting to be near him and we’re open to hearing my side of things. 

I only just told my own fiancé about this aspect of my stay in the ward yesterday. My Grandma doesn’t even know, and I always tell her everything. I told one of the three mutual friends I mentioned before (my fiancé’s best friend who apparently doesn’t even speak to my ex anymore anyway) because he’s basically my future brother in law and I love and trust him with this info because he takes mental health matters VERY seriously. 

Again, I am so so SO glad I made the decision to check into that psych ward 3 years ago. It was ultimately the best thing I EVER have done for myself. But I absolutely HATE that I was tricked/manipulated into actually physically GOING there only to be abandoned during my darkest hour.

574,I might have revealed to much to my younger sister,"So I'm 19 now and I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and self harm for a few years now and recently I went to a psychiatrist for the first time because I'm of age now and I do not have to tell my parents about it.
I started taking some antidepressants and today I got a bit drunk and I told my younger sister (she's 9) that I might be sick because I feel bad. I told her I'm better now because I go to an actual doctor and I take meds and I actually want to get better. I tried to explain that I'm just very tired all the time and don't feel like doing anything. I didn't say anything about self harm or anything more serious but I still feel like I've said too much. Also, my parents don't know anything. I haven't told them how I've felt recently and they have no idea I went to a psychiatrist or that I take drugs.
Now that I'm less drunk I sense I've made a mistake by telling a kid that I am ill. I feel like that might have been too much for her and I feel horribly about it. I wish I hadn't said anything and I regret it a lot. I told her mainly because I didn't want her to feel like it was her fault when I didn't want to watch a movie with her or something and I also told her that I didn't want to disappoint her to which she replied that I could never disappoint her because I'm her role model. I feel completely sick about it and I'm scared it's going to have a bad impact on her. I probably shouldnt have told her but I already did and I cannot reverse that. I'm looking for some advice on how I can try to make her feel better about it because I do not want my little sister to feel sad or anything."

583,any advice on finally helping my mental health struggles?,"So, I've struggled with depression for years now. It started with some HEFTY trauma going all the way back to when I was in middle school revolving my immediate family (parents and my grandma, who have all passed away now). I'm now 24 years old and over the past 3 years since moving away from my home town my mental health has improved quite a bit (though its never been top notch) but I was finally able to have a job, have relationships and have a pretty good social life. Though, I always still struggled with low energy. Anyways, cut to today. I am in university for my first year and I have a job that is pretty decent. Then the lockdown happens and I'm stuck in my room a lot of the time. I'm living with a roommate that I don't know all that well so that's kind of awkward also. And my mental health is at an all time low. I got through my first semester pretty well somehow, but over Christmas break I started to not be able to get out of bed. I have a hard time even finding energy to shower or make myself food. I haven't been this bad since I moved out to my new city over 3 years ago. I had my first week back in the new semester this week and I only listened to 1 lecture out of my 4 classes. It's bad. And my work is on shut down as it's non essential so I won't be headed back there for a while but honestly I don't have the energy to go into work now anyways. I feel super low, and I keep re-living the feelings of the pain and trauma I experienced. It's shattering. 

Anyways, I guess I'm reaching out because this is a very lonely time for me. And I honestly wanted the extra time the lockdown provides to give me time to address some of these issues that I've never fully been able to solve. And I want to know if anyone has any suggestions or experience they can share of things that actually helped them to manage their mental health? 

I have a therapist I talk to through my university but I haven't spoken to them in over a month since they also took a Christmas break. I'll be talking to them next week. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you."
584,Zyprexa Withdrawal?,"So I was in the hospital just over a year ago and was prescribed 2.5mgs of Zyprexa for my anxiety and depression. I was allowed to take another 2.5 as needed for panic attacks or severe depression days. Ive made it a habit of taking the full 5mgs everyday for the last several months, but unfortunetly it has just stopped working. My psychiatrist doesnt seem to have a lot of experience with this medication and he told me I could just stop taking it. I did that and the first 3 days were great as I actually felt much calmer and less zombie-like. Now Im super nauseous and I cant stay asleep at night. Has anyone else had this problem with Zyprexa withdrawal?"
585,[24M] Stuck with university and don't know if I want to keep going," 

Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the right place to post this and I apology in advance if it isn't.

My academic life was never too good to begin with, but I feel that since covid broke out things have really started to fall apart. I attend a cultural heritage course in the university near my home town in southern Italy, the first three years were not too bad, I guess, I managed to pull off 4 out of 7 exams each year. Three-year courses in Italy are averagely made of 21 exams in total, with the credits per exam ranging from 6 to 12, the average being 9. A 9-credit exam, at least in my university, consists in 3.000+ pages of mandatory reads and several hours of classes, and then a 20-40 minutes oral interview with the professor. If you fail an exam, you have to wait for the next session (almost 3 months) to try it again. Most of the professors are very strict and easy to upset, they can make you fail an exam because of that one single silly question you didn't particularly look up. It has not happened to me in person, but it's not rare to see students cry or having an emotional breakdown during examination sessions because a teacher has started yelling or calling them names for them not knowing how to answer a question. A lot of them tried turning to authorities for verbal abuse but the police doesn't really care about this kind of matters because of our fuck\*d-up ""me ne frego"" mentality.

Not to mention that the taxes are pretty high, and they didn't get a lowering or a delay even though we're in a global pandemic and we're attending classes from home. Since the pandemic outbreak I only passed 2 exams, my mood has become very unstable because of all the factors mentioned above, plus the fact that I can't see my friends, I can't go to the gym, I can't go to the mountainside and I can't have any hobbies outside of watching TV or playing videogames. The pressing from my parents has always been there, but lately has become unbearable. They have doubled their work schedules to overcome the financial crisis and they're always stressed out, even though I'm helping them at work. All they tell me in our free time is that I'm not studying enough, that it's my fault if I don't pass the exams and I shouldn't blame the teachers or the global situation, that I only care about spending time with my girlfriend (yes, the law permits us to have a one-time visit to a close one each day, that's why I usually stay at her place when I'm off from work).

Tomorrow morning I have an exam, and the thought just won't stop obsessing me. I only managed to study 2 hours in the past week, because just the idea of sitting on a chair and reading up a cr\*p-load of papers over and over and then failing because of a single stupid question just makes me sick (I already failed this one exam in November). I seriously just want to quit and I don't remember why I wanted to pursue this path in the first place. When I finished high school I wanted to become a psychologist, but my parents persuaded me in choosing biology instead because they own an analysis lab. I absolutely hated it and quit after a few months, the next year I ended up signing for cultural heritage because it was the closest course to my high school background (I went to an artistic high school) and it sounded quite comforting to me, having previous knowledge of almost any subject. Going deeper in university I matured the idea of attending a counseling course after my graduation, pursuing a profession which is close to my original dream job, but it only looks like a distant hope at the moment and I feel like I have to move mountains to eventually (possibly) get there. The thought of spending at least 3 years more studying, living with my parents, without any personal income except the money they give me for my work at the lab scares the sh\*t out of me. Not to mention that my mood swings have started to negatively impact my relationship lately.

My alternative to the academic/counseling career would be writing. I love reading books, watching TV shows, playing games with deep narrative, and I always feel like I have a volcano of ideas in my mind but I can't put them to paper because I have no free time. Do any of you feel the same? Do you think that university here is legitimately very hard or is it just me being lazy? What do you think I should do? I know the choice is ultimately up to me but I really would like some feedback from strangers that are emotively detached from the sitaution to help me see things more clearly. Thanks for the read."
586,Various things to delete later probably,"My family infuriates me. I hate when they pick on me most of the time it's just annoying and upsets me. I'm a sensitive little bitch about what people say. My uncle likes to poke fun at me for my piercings. It's not even slightly funny and when I become visibly upset and start to try to ignore him he continues to mess with me. I wish I knew how to politely tell people to leave me the fuck alone. The computer that I share with my dad in the living room. Right in the middle. Also this is gross but I can hear the bathroom from my room and I always hear him making weird noises I hate it I wish I could tune it out. And my grandma is basically rotting on the couch out there being a noisy drunk asshole. Always insists on talking to me and when I show I'm interested she continues on and on and on. Everyone else though WHO'S ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO FUCKING LIVE HERE is fine! My life was fine until my parents started letting family move in and out as they please basically. My parents excuse for my grandma living here is 'shes too old and weak' bla bla bla just send her to a fucking nursing home she can pay for it just fine. his is BULLSHIT. Maybe I'm just too worked up over this I'm not sure. My feelings don't even slightly matter in this situation.
.
Every day I am on the verge of a breakdown. I distract myself with things to keep thoughts out. When I'm not distracted, I think, when I think, I try to cry but I'm unable to. I've tried and I don't know if it's my fear of getting heard or what. What I do is I hold my eyes open till they burn to make them water, it doesn't feel like crying though.
.
I'll admit I'm very clingy when it comes to certain friendships. I can however confirm 2 of the 3 people I talk to definitely care for me at least a little. One I consider a best friend to be honest with you. I *hate* not getting responses I know that's probably stupid but I get a tiny boost of and happy chemicals everytime I hear that discord notif or my phone vibrate. Of course there's fear too but the tiny spark of happy is lovely. Even if someone doesn't reply with words a reaction on discord is definitely enough. Just to know it's been seen. To know I'm not being invited because I annoyed them too much. To know I didn't ruin everything. To know they're not going to leave me to rot. That best friend is somebody I know will stay I don't know why I'm so confident in this but I just know they will. Dear two people I know who have my reddit who probably will never actually read this sorry for being so annoying.

This was long. Im gonna get scared for no reason and probably delete this later but it's really nice to write out how I'm feeling, even though my feelings are stupid.Sorry for grammer and punctuation errors and stuff I suppose"
587,I just finished a task that took me 6 hours,I started it at 3 and now i finished it at 9.The task would have normally took about 2 hours  but recently i have just gotten so damn exhausted from daily life so it took me 6 fucking hours and now i feel even more exhausted and now i feel depressed

590,I just someone to listen,"I’m just lost and confused and I don’t even know where to start. I think my bf has been gaslighting me since our relationship began five years ago. I even watched the short film gaslight and our relationship is just like that, but he has way more rage. I already have problems with reality because I have schizo-affective disorder and my family gaslights me too. It’s like they can sense my emotions and feed off of them, and know just what to say to justify their behavior and deny my emotions. It’s horrible. I hate it. I wish he would just leave me alone, but he won’t. I’ve tried to break up with him multiple times and every time he claims that it’s because I’m not right mentally. All other times, he never even acknowledges my mental problems when I tell him about my symptoms and says things like, “I think you’re just a girl.” But when I want to break up with him, it’s because I’m out of my mind and he alerts my family. He’s so manipulative and I’ve also caught him telling lies before, important ones. Just the other day, he told me he never saw his parents fight once. One of his ex-girlfriends said his father had a raging temper and would yell at his mom all the time, to the point where it made her really uncomfortable. I can’t take it any more. He literally just called me. I do t have any friends, even though I did before our relationship and even though I know he’s awful, I’m still afraid of being alone. I need to do a mental dump about him here. Thanks for reading, please reply. I’m feeling really alone. Now because I didn’t take his call, he’s harassing me with texts."
591,Question to prevent misportrayal,"I am considering writing a story involving subjects such as morality and the like through powers that come forth from people's actions.

One of the characters that would show up often is an emotional manipulator with a power called ""gaslight"". This power allows him to create illusions that can either make fake surroundings appear real or real surroundings seem nonexistent.

I am fortunate enough to have never experienced gaslighting myself, so I want to reach out to a community with people who have so I can get this portrayal right.

Considering this power stemmed from gaslighting others, would this be considered a good portrayal of gaslighting? If not, what should I change to make it one?"

594,FANTASY OR REALITY? (I prefer fantasy),"&amp;#x200B;

Did you wanna know what I realized the few days ago? I just realize that my life is based on the fantasies that i make in my mind, and even knowing that these fantasies are not real, I just feel like they really are, like if that scene that I make in my mind, trully happens, and it's weird because I actually don't know how to feel about that,  for one way i feel that these fantasies and scenes are one of the reasons because i wake up every day, because they make me feel things that  I doesn't feel in my ordinary life, and if I imagine that it's real i can disconnect to my life, but at the same time I just can't stop thinking that if I do that means that i don't really like my life,  and at the same time I can't help feeling sad and worried because I feel that one of the reasons that gives meaning to my life, today, is a lie, like an illusion. And instead of trying to change it, I just see it from far and do nothing about, and I feel like I am trapped in my ordinary routine and life, and thats why I think that I try to escape with that fantasies.

596,Just Took A Walk,"For the first time in forever, I walked the four-ish blocks up to the local convenience store and back. I have walked back from that store (that is where the bus stops) but I haven't walked essentially 8 blocks in a long long time--since I was going up onto the railroad tracks sometimes walking up to several miles a day back and forth. I am exhausted but feeling very...energized too? I had some raviolis when I got home and now I am sitting here contemplating taking a shower and watching some more HOUSE, M.D. on my favorite movie site. My mental health hasn't been very good lately, but right now, I am content and almost happy. I am worried about our eldest daughter, who has driven to Colorado for some film shoot. I don't know, I just...feel better when she is within 300 miles of home. :( Colorado is much much more than that. :( Can you guys just send some good thoughts our way for her safety? She isn't alone, which is better...but I still worry. That is what a Mama does. Thanks all."
597,What should I do if I know I need get therapy but can’t bring myself to go?,"My family is in a very hard spot financially, and I also have 8 siblings and 3 step siblings, so I don’t like leaving my house that much (I often watch or help take care of the kids, and I clean up after them every single day). The only time I leave my house is when I visit my friend, but I only ever like going out around 7 or 8 when my siblings are laying down or at least more calm, and then I come back as early as I can in the morning (usually around 8-11, sometimes a little later but I always get anxious when that happens haha). I know I have problems that run deeper than just anxiety and they effect literally every aspect of my life. But it would take so much of me to ask my mom if I can go to therapy, set up an appointment, and actually go to the appointment and commit ... Typing it out makes it look really nonthreatening but it’s so incredibly hard and scary for me to do things like that, it drains every ounce of energy I have. Mental illness runs in my family really bad, my mom has dependent personality disorder as well as severe anxiety and depression (all diagnosed). I’m 18 and can’t bring myself to get a job, get my license, socialize that much, I have zero motivation, I smoke weed (TOO much, although I’ve gotten better with it and I smoke way less than I have in the past). I feel like every time I ask for help either nothing works or it gets worse, and I also don’t really know who to turn to anyway because no one I know has the same issues as me, or doesn’t know how to help :( I’m really lost on what to do with myself or how to start getting better and any words of advice would be really appreciated"
598,Books about mental health,"Hey all,

I’m trying to stock my shelves with books about personal experiences with mental health, psych wards, and psychology. Any suggestions?"
599,"Desperately need some sort of help and I am too scared to ask for it because every time I have asked for help I end up feeling patronised, misunderstood and ever worse.","Depressed, anxious, obsessive, bpd, suicidal etc. etc.

All blood tests are normal.

Five walks per week. Three gym sessions per week (deadlifts, bench presses etc.). Occasionally I'll play social football. Excellent diet of good fats/carbs, protein, no alcohol etc.

Normal sleep.

Utterly dejected and incomprehensibly depressed/anxious/obsessive/intense feelings. I can't share this with my family as it makes them upset and they don't understand me.

I've seen 15 therapists (including an anxiety and dbt group) and 4 psychiatrists. Been to hospital a few times too. I've tried ssri, snri, tca, maoi, stabilizer, anti-psychs, benzos (for anxiety). Also have tried a wide range of supplements/other agents (turmeric, magnesium, lithium, nac, vitamin d, vitamin b12 etc.). Ketamine is not offered and there is a TMS clinic though it's too far away.

The last contact I had with a general practitioner didn't go well as they (two of them) didn't understand me and didn't seem to believe I had issues. I also sense they may have been fed up with me. Told me to see another psychiatrist. Thus I saw a psych and they tried another maoi (moclobemide) and it didn't work.

I need help, I am really bad. Yet I can't face going into the surgery again and telling them my problems because in the past it has gone badly 9 times out 10 and made me feel worse.

Don't know what to do mate. Even typing this feels pointless. The anhedonia is often intense. Self harmed again last night though it doesn't help. Almost too depressed to even do that. Can't cry no tears. 

Thanks if you read this."
600,Trouble recognizing sarcasm?,"Okay so I’m not sure if this is the right place to bring this up, but I am curious. In the past, I was fairly good at recognizing when someone was being sarcastic but over the years I feel like I’m less sure. Especially now. I don’t know if it’s because the people I hear speaking aren’t close friends so I’m not as familiar with the tone of voice, but that doesn’t really make sense. There is a streamer on youtube who I watch almost every weekend now and he will contradict himself sometimes and it confuses me...until I realize he’s laughing because he was being sarcastic (or people in the chat acknowledge it). In text, it’s impossible for me to know when someone is being sarcastic or not. I take it all literally, because of course I would, I can’t see them. This isn’t really an ISSUE issue but it’s something I’ve noticed and I’m wondering if it coincides with anything, mentally. In fact, I’ve been noticing various things about myself that I’ve never payed attention to before, and it’s only because I’ve realized/heard that it’s not “normal.” But anyway. Just sharing some thoughts."
601,Fake friends,"Something happend recently to me what resulted in me losing all my “friends”. There was something which I can’t talk about publicly, what forced me to rat my friends out. We were a group of 3 friends with other friends in our school we were going to, but now they’re talking bad about me to my other friends. My grades are also dropping very low and I have second to none motivation to go to school anymore. I feel like shit and I just want to stay in bed all day. I have nobody to talk to without me feeling like I am bothering them"
602,A writer describes starting meds and calling the doctor...," ""Switching psychiatric medications is like jumping from the rooftop of one ten-story building to another. There is a massive potential drop between the two, and if you fuck up, if you misjudge something, or even if you are just plain unlucky, you are in for a near-fatal if not fatal descent.  
But you can’t just choose not to do it. The first building is on fire; your current drug is failing. If you stay there, the situation will only degrade further; you are going to fall apart into suicidality and erratic impulsiveness; anxiety, depression, apathy, and paranoia will suffocate and kill you.

You have to jump if you want any chance of surviving.

So you plan it as best you can, as clearly as you’re able to think with your present stability and structure dissolving into an inferno beneath your feet. You research. You step to the edge and look down and feel your head swim with panic. I don’t want to go back to that, I can’t go back to that, your mind screams.

Part of you remembers life before medication, but the memories are sterilized and compressed and filed neatly away; harmless and neutered. But at the time, it happened in violent and vibrant color and stereo.

You were suicidal. You were struggling to get through minutes, hours, days; you were drugging yourself with larger and larger quantities of diphenhydramine and painkillers so you were either asleep or too drowsy to fully feel reality, because you knew if you did feel it, you’d destroy it.

You knew this was it: You were either getting on drugs to survive, or killing yourself; either way, your natural life was now over.

You called the doctor’s office and you fucked up and you said the “s” word, and the receptionist immediately transferred you to a crisis therapist who asked you how you felt. You hung up and threw the phone across the room because you weren’t going to talk to anybody about how you felt, that was a waste of time, which was a quickly-evaporating resource for you in this state. You needed drugs. You didn’t know how to talk to anybody about how you felt anyway, you hadn’t properly done it in years. Feelings translated into destructiveness, not words. You let an hour pass, sitting on the floor and thumping the back of your skull against the hollow wood paneling of your bedroom wall, the repetition not even able to soothe you. But you do it anyway, just in case it starts helping, just because you feel like this is what you’re supposed to be doing. You ruminate and immediately realize your mistake in using “suicidal” during the phone call. It makes you angry; you’ve never done this before, you don’t know what you’re doing, and your ineptitude just makes you want to die all the more. You call again, making sure it’s a different receptionist, and you’re very selective with your words. You get an appointment for a few hours from now, and you attend, and the curtain is drawn, ending this act of your life.

The curtain reopens and everything is white and clean, including you. You’re a rebooted human being now. The inside of your head is gutted and bleached, save for a sole speaker playing elevator music. Life becomes very simple after this. You fill it up with “normal” things, which frequently feels like a novelty to you, and you wash your dishes and read your mail and try not to laugh at random; normality is at times a very ticklish fit on you.

I got a year out of it. A good year. All the people I’ve met, all the things I’ve seen and experienced and accomplished, all the ground I’ve regained. It’s a year I wouldn’t have had otherwise.

Now it’s time to jump. I have so much to lose if this goes poorly.""

603,Everything is white noise,"I’m feeling a kind of panic attack that I’ve never felt before. I’m used to the ‘turning a small task or social obligation into something insurmountable’ panic. I’m used to the ‘people are happy, you’re out having fun, there’s no reason for this’ panic.

This is something else.

In my mind I picture lines/frequencies pulsating against a white emptiness hitting like a heartbeat branching out and growing larger the more intense the ‘fit’ becomes.

Every attempt to scramble for something familiar to do that might help ground me the episode became worse. “I should just relax. But then what? What’s after relaxing? What happens after this movie is over? What happens after you’re done working out? What happens after your friend gives support and tells you everything is going to be okay?

My emotions of how I felt in the moment of this panic and the potential positive emotions I would feel after started to blur. Became inconsequential. Pacing the house, locking the doors 3 times so that I don’t die, I traced every wall and corner of my house. This fucking hamster wheel. Suddenly time started to blur, as I stood there brushing my teeth thinking about every life scenario today, tomorrow, years from now, everything, always leading my mind to a “what’s next?”

Looking into the bathroom mirror this all culminated into full blown dissociation. Sights, touch, sound, all crunched, condensed and compressed into white noise. Existence. Not dark, not nothingness. Homogeneous.

Then my automatic toothbrush turned off."
604,Sick leave for mental health?,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the correct sub.
Anyway, I started working in October as a first job after graduation.
I have been having a terrible time since fall 2019 and I feel it's getting worse and worse, particularly now that I moved to another country (I'm not from the country I work at now) where I dont know literally anyone and I can't do pretty much anything.
What I'm going through is mostly unrelated to work. It recently really peaked, up to self-hurt and almost suicide, and it's obviously also starting to affect work.
I find very difficult to focus and be motivated, my mind flies away super easily (also considering we are completely wfh) and I'm often tired.

I don't know what to do about this. On one side I feel like it's not fair to work like this, I'm not producing as much as the others, and it's only a matter of time that my supervisors will notice it and I'm really worried what they might think, and I feel bad for letting them down.

On the other hand, work was one of my only distractions from everything else I was going through and I really don't want to mess this up.
But now it's becoming less of a distraction and more of a weight.

I'm not sure if here (Belgium) you can take sick days for psychological reasons? Or I should come up with some unpaid leave? Or should I discuss it with hr (I'd obviously very much rather leave the specifics)?"
605,Is it normal for psychiatrists to not tell you your diagnosis after a psychiatric assessment?,"I've been struggling for years with very high sensitivity and coincidentally very up and down moods. I've dealt with dissociation, trauma, self harm, identity issues, suicidal ideation, an eating disorder, using alcohol as a coping mechanism, issues with keeping good relationships, and so much more that I don't need to explain in detail. 

Anyway I went to a doctor with a friend and was referred for psychiatric assessment, but at the end of the assessment the psychiatrist just referred me to a DBT program and made another appointment with me to prescribe me antidepressants.

A part of me was kind of expecting to find out what has been going on but she didn't mention any diagnosis so I feel a little in the dark but I was just wondering if this is a common thing that happens after an assessment?"
606,I'm attempting to spread awareness for mens health in the military I have a pod cast where we discuss what's happening.,[https://www.facebook.com/groups/3896437597085634](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3896437597085634)
607,I lost my best friend and have been having some bad thoughts,"(I tried to post in r/advice and was pointed here. I don’t usually do this sort of thing so I’m not sure how to go about it.)
So I’m using a throwaway for this.

Basically I had a friend on Twitter and we would roleplay together. We were always super close and I felt very comfortable with them...

Back in October they left the RP community. I... already wasn’t doing well. I was going through a depressive episode which usually lasts only a few weeks. I said things I never meant to. Things that were rude and I regret but they’re already gone. Because I roleplay I have multiple accounts, but they blocked me on all of them.

They hate me. Wholeheartedly they hate me— they subtweet me every once in a while.

My episode has lasted about 4 months now. I don’t know what to do- I’m suicidal at this point and I feel like if I don’t talk to them I’ll end up ending my life.

I can’t stand knowing they hate me. I have no way to contact them- so my approach has really just been to suffer in silence.

What do I do? I’m in so much pain and I’m not sure if I can stand all of this much longer."
608,300 days into the pandemic and I hit the wall.,"My background in work is that of engineering in the British Armed Forces. I've been in for 10 years now, so you could say my tolerance for bullsh*t and inconvenience is pretty high. Getting shat on with rubbish jobs, last minute detachments, being spoken down to by high and mighty officers, I've seen it all many times and have been on the recieving end too.

Today, the events of the last year hit me like a freight train. I was just getting some bits from the budget discount store that's like BAM but not quite (the pay isn't the best, don't judge) and after looking down a long, empty isle in the shop, I just wanted to sit on the floor and scream, cry or both.

For the last 3 weeks I've had no enjoyment from my hobbies. I haven't painted any of my over priced miniatures, sketched anything of worth, done any exercise, or gotten any sort of enjoyment buzz from gaming or TV. Its like the world is passing me by, like I'm looking out the window of a moving train and it's all just whizzing by.

I'm tired, all of the time. I get a solid 7-8 hours every night but my mind and body feel like I've just had a power-nap. Work is pushing us hard to meet the requirements we need to even before Covid was a thing. My attention span is that of a goldfish and I find myself gravitating towards the fridge / junk food way more than normal.

Our gym is still open, so I've booked myself in for tomorrow. I will try my best to go and make it a meaningful session. I might even try and draw something tomorrow as it's not as big a job to set up as Warhammer painting is.

If you're reading this and feel the same, try and do something meaningful. I thought I'd be immune to all of this, but clearly I was wrong. If you want to swap any stores, have a chat, or talk hobbies, I'll be in the comments below."
609,How can I know if my therapist is good for me?,"Hi.

Long story as short as possible: 

\*I've been neglecting my mental health for years due to trying to survive and get through stuff, to sum it up: I deal with depression for a few years now, it's hard and getting harder everyday.

\*I'm also dealing with OCD and other mental disorders that just makes me a mess of a person, but I'm high-functioning, going to work and paying rent but I'm always ''a second before collapsing''.

\*Anyways, I'm on pills for a few years now, none of them helped and I switched and changed doses a lot.

\*The only medical care I got is meeting a psychiatrist (public health services, I'm not an american) maybe once a month or two, and she was the one prescribing all the meds I've been taking and switching.

\*I decided recently to go to therapy because I can't take it anymore, and altho I never went to therapy because money is tight and I tried focusing on work - I'm on a ''corona unpaid leave'' now, so I decided that fuck it, I'll look for a therapist.

\*through the public service website (so the price will be affordable), I found a list of social workers in my area that specialize in psychotherapy, and I went to the one that was available and close to my area.

My question is about figuring her out, and here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

I can't decide if she's good for me or now. How can I know this?

When I talk to her it doesn't go ''like I wanted'' or ''like I needed'', she makes me speak out most of the time, just to talk about my problems and It's too hard sometimes to get shit into words.

I feel like a good therapist will know what questions to ask to lead me and encounter my problems together, not just sit there and wait for me to say what I manage to say.

Or is it? I have no idea whats ''proper'' and what's ''not proper'' treatment, how can I know this?

Maybe I just imagine some therapy routine that doesn't happen? is that therapy? just sitting and making me talk on different stuff?

When she replies to things I say I feel like we're not on the same page, she is way too ''shallow'' in understanding me - and maybe I shouldn't blame her, but she's just making me try my hardest to speak and what happens is that every meeting I choose a topic that bugs me and I spend 45 minutes explaining her what is it with no real conclusions.

does that sound ordinary?

Because I feel like someone questioning me about myself will work better.

I feel like I need help with messing in my own mind.

Should I go to another therapist like that from the list? I started looking on this list because it's all the ''state-funded'' therapists and money is tight as I said, so no ''professional psychologists'' there. just psychotherapy specialized social workers. 

What do you think?"
610,"My GF [32F] was medicated for depression, and i'm worried about her current state and if it is because of the drugs she is taking","First of all this is a cross post with r/askDocs , but i though that here i may get some experiences as well, so do not take this as a medical advice request, but i do believe that some people here may have experience with these drugs before and can help ease my worries and perhaps give some advice for what thing to be on the lookout for.  


As the title says, i'm currently working from home while i take care of my girlfriend \[32F\], she is:  


\- 32 years old  
\- female  
\- no smoking, alcohol or drugs use  
\- just slightly overweight  
\- we are outside of the US, in Chile  


And to give some context about her situation:  


1) She was feeling heart palpitation, sweatiness, insomnia and difficulty concentrating or thinking straight while at work and a was checked by Psychiatrist A.   


2) Psychiatrist A diagnosed her with panic attacks and got her on a prescription with a very small dosage of Clonazepam (0,25 mg) and a week off work.  


3) In this week she feels kind of better but still have some issues sleeping and is always thinking about work  


4) Week off finishes, she was feeling better but the day before and the day she got back to work the same thing happened.  


5) That very same day she goes to a different practitioner, let's say Phychiatrist B, and receives a very different diagnosis, with not only panic attacks but severe depression, so she started taking a larger dosis of clonazepam (1mg through the day), mixed with aripiprazole (2,5 mg) to keep the negative thoughts out, and escitalopram (5mg a day) as an antidepressant.  


6) This is the third day of the treatment, the dosage has been the same but her state varies greatly,  


\- first day: she was drowsy and distracted but overall felt better, sleep almost 8 hours.  


\- second day: she was somewhat more active, she tried to read some books or play some videogames but could not concentrate and had troubles focusing her eyesight. slept roughtly 8 hours and had some naps through the day  


\- today: she seems completely out, she describes it as having troubles keeping her eyes open and has been sleeping on bed all day.  


Bottom line i'm kind of worried how different her reaction has been to the same dosage of these drugs, can you help me unrstand if this is expected?. I'm just worried that she may be having some bad reactions to the drugs she is taking, and i've been reading the pamphlets that comes with each drugs and they do say that drowsiness is a side effect, but today she has been completely out, i mean we can have a conversation, you can ask her something and she will answer, slowly but eloquently, otherwise i would have taken her to an emergency room right away.  


And i have tried talking with her doctor, it's been complicated getting a hold of them over the weekend"

616,A group for us to make friends,"Hi there! 

I was thinking of creating a Whatsapp group for people with different backgrounds, from different countries. I thought since this pandemic is making us all lonely, maybe making some friends would be good idea. Would anyone want to join?"
617,How do you trust yourself with a mental illness?,"This is something I've been particularly struggling with over the past couple years. There's just so much that happened in the past where I have struggled with self-control and impulsive / compulsive behavior. And based on those experiences I've found it increasingly difficult to believe that I wasn't just going to eventually fuck myself over one way or another. I think the worst one was me dropping out of undergrad. Like the fact that I spontaneously decided to drop out despite spending years to earn that degree and scoring As on literally everything except my bachelor thesis that I probably would've gotten an A on too if I had ever turned it in, is just absolutely insane. I've done stupid shit but that one just absolutely crushed any trust I had in myself because it was just that obviously irrational. 

Idk I just feel almost paralyzed because I feel like I can't even trust myself enough to allow myself to try doing anything. Like I don't want to end up wasting everyone's time and resources (again). Even in regards to therapy - why start it if I'm obviously just going to drop out at some point? 

I mean there are many people with mental illnesses that are associated with all kinds of issues with controlling your behavior and they're able to manage their shit. So I guess there must be a way to get over this whole ordeal. It's just like how tf do do one thing over and over again and then believe that you won't do it again *this* time???"
618,Can’t stop worrying about a friend I have suddenly lost contact with,"Can’t stop worrying about my friend who I suddenly lost contact with

So I have a friend that is sort of very depressed. She is trans which would play a big factor in that, with non supportive parents and all that. Anyway I kept really stressing about that so I decided to talk to her a lot because I knew she needed a lot of emotional support. She seemed to be getting better and stopped mentioning suicide, which she used to do a lot. My stress level drastically decreased because she even started trying to find help online, so that was cool. 

Anyway she has been at a new boarding school for about a week, and even though it probably sucks she was very optimistic about going, even though she said she wasn’t. She said that all she needed to hear was what good they would have and then she would feel better about going, and she also made a joke about what she thinks her roommate will be like, and she said she hopes she finds it entertaining because her favorite game wasn’t fun to her anymore after playing it for years and years. So I’m optimistic for her and I am hoping that she is doing okay.

So I reach out to her and my messages aren’t delivering. It’s been two days and they still haven’t delivered so she probably blocked me for whatever reason, I don’t know. She did ask me my sexual orientation and I told her I was straight, them she said hmmm. That was my second to last conversation with her. She also says “ew” every time I mention a cis girl that goes to my school. I don’t know if she blocked me because she hates straight cis people? That would kinda suck because being bigoted is never okay. It’s weird because like two years ago she was going on about her heterophobic and sexist against men mother, but now it kind of seems like she’s flipped. She knows I’m socially left leaning and that’s why she is okay with me trying to help her, so that’s why this is really odd.  I think that may be why she might have blocked me, but I still don’t know. 

So now that I have no contact with her, I am constantly worried about this all male boarding school taking a tole on her mental health, and making it a lot worse. I don’t know if I will ever stop being stressed. I need advice. 

Thanks!"
619,Things becoming loud for no reason?,Sometimes I just there watching a video minding my business and out of the blue the sound just seems to be louder and kind of distorted but I only for like a few seconds.. can anyone relate?
620,i think a lot of things are wrong with me,"i think there’s a lot of things wrong with my head. i don’t know what it could be. i’ve been on a rough trail and i can’t get myself right. i’m 20 years old and i got deep into drugs starting as young as 14. 13 years old i started smoking weed. when i was 14 i wanted to try other drugs. i bought mushrooms and they didn’t work. soon after that i went through the medicine cabinet and took every pill bottle and every cough syrup out and asked my brother what different things do. that night i ended up taking a mixture of 8-12 muscle relaxers and slept about 14 hours. i was knocked out. 

soon after that i was smoking weed everyday. i never really been big on alcohol, nor do i think at this time i’d even tried drinking. i had two good friends around the time i was 15. then by the time i was 17 i found some other friends that i wanted those same friends to hang out with me, with them. they weren’t down and i went by myself. 

that was the day i fucked up. i said fuck my good friends and went with the toxic. i began using different drugs everyday. i don’t even think i was depressed. i remember myself a very happy person. i wasn’t outgoing or anything. i’ve always been pretty shy tbh. when i jumped in this crowd though, my shyness disappeared a lot. 

through time i became dependent on molly everyday to keep me up and happy. i was only 17 and the first time i snorted it, i was on a bender. the first time i did it i did it for 3 days straight and fell asleep a day, woke up and went out for more. this happened for about two months till coke came around. some days i’d be up for 5 days. 

i was never really a big fan of coke i always felt like it was a waste of money. my friends loved the shit though. we’d be up all night doing blow anywhere we could. hell i even made good friends with the dealer and he had me making baggies up for him.

later on i was taking acid everyday and that’s probably one of my least worries. but if definitely take it everyday even though i wasn’t gettin a trip i was just getting very minor visuals and was able to stay up.

then i had my love for xanax. i fell for xanax twice. in january of 2018, i was taking them everyday and my brother was actually tempted to call 911 on me and get me sent to an inpatient hospital. i talked him out of it but he was pretty devastated that i chose drugs. i ended up cutting that habit off but any time i cut a habit off i still was doing drugs, just not that drug in particular. 

so 4-5 months down the line, i’m 18 and i began dating my girlfriend in january of 2018. in may, we had a big fight and broke up for a few months. i went through hell. i was constantly trying to overdose because i felt like if anything was to take me, drugs should. i honestly feel like i could be dead and this is considered my after life. idk that’s besides the point. i started using xanax again the day we broke up and i didn’t stop. there wasn’t a day i didn’t use xanax. i mixed them with other drugs. i’d mix them with alcohol, coke, heroin, meth, crack, lean, other pills, molly, acid, shrooms, salvia, anything u could think of i’ve probably done (besides a handful of psychedelics). 

i was depressed i believe. i don’t like to talk about my feelings. i like to put a happy face on and let everyone else believe i’m perfectly fine. i don’t think my friends knew. i know that they’d tell me i need to get off those fuckin pills all the time. i wouldn’t listen. i’d hang around random people just to either steal from them or use them. i’d come home and stumble through the door. everyone just kind of suspected i was just partying. it was deeper than that. i was dying on the inside.

fast forward to august 2018. i’m hanging around one of those random crowds. i use to sell weed, so we had just came back from grabbing my product. i bought 7 xanax that day and an ounce of weed (yes i was only picking up ounces to sell dont laugh) i was already off of 5 xanax bars and popped another. we get back to home town and we’re dropping everyone off. we get pulled over and that was when everything got fucked up.

i went to jail for a few days. they let me out on an OR and i went to one court date and then ditched court and instantly found my love for drugs again. i was back with my girlfriend during this time. about two months down the line the police come to my house and arrest me on a bench warrant. i had to sit in work release for a couple months then they let me out after i finished my drug counseling. i was on probation from april 2019 till april 2020. i wasn’t doing drugs. i got into drinking a little heavy but i stopped myself.

when april 2020 hit i was smoking weed again, and occasionally taking an adderall from time to time. me and my girlfriend were still together. we’d been together for 2 years at the time. when i sobered up during probation i fixed myself a lot. even to this day people say i’ve changed a lot. i’m not the same old me. 

now let’s fast forward to recently. recently me and my girlfriend have been having many problems. we broke up yesterday and tuesday is suppose to be our 3 year anniversary. for the past 2-3 weeks i’ve been bawling my eyes out 3-7 times a week because she keeps saying i won’t give her space. it’s hard. it’s hard when u drop all ur old friends and ur addicted to this one girl. it’s hard to just give someone their space when we’ve spent 3 years together. it’s hard to let go. we’re still talking right now but we’re both single. i don’t want to see her with another man. i want her to come back with me. she was my support system through all of this. she helped me so much with bettering myself. i usually never cry either and lately it’s been almost everyday.

i don’t wanna lose her for good... if i do i’m scared i’ll end up back with these drugs. i’m scared for my outcome. i’m scared for my future. 



tl;dr: my life has been full of drugs. i’ve sobered up and minimized it to just weed. i’m going through hell again and scared i’ll get caught up in my old lifestyle again"

625,"I finally have the energy for myself, ive made it.","For 6 months last year I had one of the worst depression and anxiety episode of my life. It took a heavy blow on my mental and physical health. I lost a lot of weight from over exercising and eating a meal a day. It was the first time I experienced anxiety attacks. It was quite traumatizing, and they came often. It has taken a long time for me to heal.

Now that a long time has passed and I’m back on my feet. I feel like I have a grip on my life. I now can have thoughts on ambition rather then how I wish I die soon. I have thoughts about goals and who I want to be. I feel so grateful to even have such thoughts. It was something I took for granted and I’m glad to have it back. I feel so accomplished. I’m so glad I never went though with it. 

I never would wish my traumatic experience on anyone. It felt like I went through hell and back (I’m being quite melodramatic) but the experience taught me a lot of things, for that Im thankful for it. 

It deepened my love for those who helped and stuck by me. I was such a dick but they did everything they could. This experience taught me self compassion and that life is gonna suck but I can choose my suffering. I’m so thankful rn I’m crying tears of joy for such a small think as thoughts."

I am from a very small island and I highly doubt there is someone with the capability to handle my mom she's really good at persuading. Bottom line I'm tired I'm 20 years old and only last year I started to see the real truth. She is making everyone depressed my dad who was such a cheerful man has now depression and even tried to kill himself three years ago, I am lost and kinda depressed my brother is also very insecure. It's just she is toxic, but we all love her and know she has a disease and that is not normal for someone to be like this. But SHE NEEDS THERAPY idk how to convince her even with a doctor saying she needs to go with urgency to the mental health care (covid hit so she didn't go) she says I am good now BC she had then some days where she is normal. It's just so much to handle...for ppl that have BPD tell me...can you accept your mental problem and try to fix it? Can you be independent ppl or you need someone next to you doing everything with you?

631,Organizing a group for people in the earlier stages of a career in therapy,"Hi everyone! First post on this thread/mobile. 

I’m a mental health provider from the USA, and here (as with many other places), it’s very difficult to have a career in applied mental health and therapy without a graduate degree. I feel like even though I’ve managed to find mentors and friends who are a few years ahead in my career path, I have almost no connections with peers in the field.   

I would love to be able to speak with people looking to be therapists who are out of school, have 1-5 years of experience in related aspects, but who are still meeting professional barriers and refining specialties.   

So, who would be open to creating this group? Is there a subreddit or a forum that already exists for this that I wouldn’t be aware of? It’s also worth saying out loud that this could absolutely be an international group. Despite the US context I know it from, I’m interested in all perspectives. 

Thanks!!"
632,Running away.,"(My life has always been to please people and to be someone's favorite person.

I'm tired. I don't want to talk about trauma or seeking help. There isn't a place in this world that I want to be in. I lost everything that matters the most to myself: any passion, love or interest for anything.
I can't think rationally anymore. If I do, I overanalyze and bring out the negativity in everything. If I find a therapist they will hospitalize me. I know it. I don't need professional help if people will be ashamed of me.
I've gotten in trouble with these people in my past. I can't relive it.

It's funny because running away will be just as embarrassing. It was never about me, but other people. If I died they will talk. They don't even care about me.)

I'm sorry to vent.

To jump to the point, I'm thinking of running away from myself. I'll leave my stuff incase I think of coming back. But I might leave for a month or so in another city and hide somewhere I can relax. It'll be freezing cold but all the better to feel numb. I plan to leave the car when I'm halfway. I'm just worried if I abruptly leave everyone would freak out, despite the fact they ignore my struggles. They're not entilted to care but it's just odd how it works. 

I've no clue how to tell work or keep hold of my school after I return, if I do. I want to give up on everything but these stupid ties are holding me back. Don't get me started on police. 

There are bills. I have debt. My job. My family. My stupid, foolish mother who is too protective of me but wants me dead. 

Let me go, please."
633,Too much for me?,"I recently started ging to college, i really liked it, i still do, but I've noticed that it's getting too much for me. Every project is a Competition, i feel like I can never relax, I'm so afraid not to be good enough, i try to push myself harder and harder, and I feel so close to breaking down. I wrestle with myself to get out of bed everyday. Waking up, I feel overwhelmed I want to go straight back to sleep but I can't. Everyday I want to cry and at the same time I feel too ashamed to really talk to anyone I know. I Stay up way too long,  but I dont want the next day to come.. And being very tired kinda Blocks all the worries. 

I noticed, that it's getting harder for me to enjoy things on General. I dont know what makes me happy sometime I try to think about it and nothing comes to my Mind. 

I feel very ridiculous writing this. Maybe i'm lying to myself, maybe it's not that Bad? I guess it's normal to feel overwhelmed and i'm just being dramatic. I still function, I still do things. It's just really really Hard. 


This Text is a mess, i am really tired. Sorry."
634,Fuck everything,I don’t even know what the fuck to write I’m fucking fed up of doing the same fucking shit ever day. Then I feel like shit cause I know there’s people that have it worse... I know I’m fucked up but every time I tell myself that I keep fucking saying I’m not and I’m just saying that then that fucks more things up. Fuck everything

637,16 years old.,"Here i sit at 16. I have a normal loving family with a good enough network of friends. 
My country has been in off and on lockdowns for a year now. In the first one, I turned to drinking on most nights to stay unbored, and played video games. I thought lockdown would be fun for a while. No school, video games all day, you get the gyst. It wasn't. Like I said I spent a lot of nights just drinking, unaware of the true nature of alcohol. Summer came around and the country opened for a while. I saw my friends a lot and had some good days. I'm usually the one who supports my friends. My close friends all come from divorced households, with parents who don't care, so I often would hear them out and care for their mental health, putting it before mine and ignoring my problems. 
September rolled around and school was back. Everything was okay and I started to get into some fitness and exercise. The country went right back into lockdown in December. Its been a month without my friends again, and I've lost my motivation to workout, my exams are all cancelled, which I have worked for all year, and after my first experience of lockdown, I don't see light at the end of the tunnel. A girl I was speaking to and liked for months liked me back and it was going well, now she just stopped speaking to me out of the blue. I built everything back up and now it has just crumbled at my feet. I'm like a zombie. Stay up till 5 am, wake up late and play games all day, something I only do so I can escape, and its something I'm losing interest in as the days go by. I know my problems may seem trivial to some of this sub. I have never been on any sub like this, and I've never discussed my mental health with anybody in my life, so this is a reach for me."
638,I'm done with my mom,"I'm done with her. I get yelled at when I snap back, even if she snap first. I have multiple fight with her,and I learned she doesnt learn from what I said. I'm doing everything while she sit and sleeps. Qnd she get mad when I start getting stressed. I'm her daughter, she should understand.  Yet she doesnt.  
I found her smoking multiple times, and now everytime I smell cigarettes I check on her. It been a few years since she stop,but I still so it.
I lost all my friends, and I still got new ones. I rely on mom so much it unhealthy.  And I'm scared of losing her, yet i fight with her. 
And my brain forgets what I said and felt so I cant tell or write down my feelings ."
639,"Today, I seriously considered taking my own life.","I feel like I’m at a point where I can’t get better. I’ve reached a point where being dead would be so much easier than trying to get better. 

I really don’t want to keep trying."
640,I don't give a fuck anymore.,"I don't give a fuck anymore. I'm so exhausted of trying. Not that I want to commit suicide at the moment. I'm just so tired of trying to get my GED. I'm still living with my parents and they make my life a nightmare. I've been studying for over a year and I try so hard to understand so I can pass but it's just so impossible for me. I literally can't. I'm fucking done with everything. I just want to drop out of it and get a job. Why is how good and worthy you are based on fucking marks on paper or a high school diploma, or a GED. I seriously don't care anymore. I have tried so hard. I just don't really see a way out. I'm sick of my parents and their shit. I'm sick of feeling sad and tired all the time. I don't have friends, I never feel any real happiness and I don't think I will if I continue this GED shit. I just wanna quit and get a job. But they tell me I'm going to be homeless and like my biological mom. I'm not sure if that's even true. I'm depressed and suicidal every day and I've told my parents that, they simply don't care. I really see no way out of this situation. If I don't get my GED at least, I'm supposedly going to be considered a failure by everyone I know. And if I do, I'll just keep trying and failing. I only have one more year left. What the fuck do I do?"
641,Lately I’ve been feeling really off.,"I’ve been snapping at people left and right for reasons I can’t understand. It’s like all of a sudden I see red and just do the most embarrassing shit for no real reason. I’m 19, almost 20, and I’ve never felt this way before. This has been happening for the last month. Why the hell am I feeling this way?"
642,Covid Isolation has made me realize I'm not immortal,"28/M

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know when exactly it started, but it's been on my mind so much lately, it's pretty much taken over my thoughts completely. I can't stop thinking about death, particularly my own. I'll see anybody on TV who is dying or in the hospital and I tear up immediately and thoughts rush to my head like ""Why?"" and ""What the fuck is the point if we just get ripped away!?"". I don't consider myself suicidal, but I've never had thoughts like these before. Hell, I can't even remember the last time I cried over anything. I have cried myself to sleep the 2 nights this week overthinking death. I guess I was so busy with life I didn't even stop to think about it ending. I tried reading some things to calm me down and watched a few documentaries on OBE/mediation to try to self-heal, but I can't shake the dooming thoughts."
643,What should I do after I fucked up really really badly?,"I (20F) come from a conservative Christian household and they likewise shame sex before marriage. Well I had a lot of sex a few months ago and it slipped out to my parents. My dad was very upset. He made me move home, he made me share my phone location with him, and he took my phone at night and read my texts. After a couple months I started to gain his trust back. 

Well today I completely fucked up. I made a stupid, idiotic decision. My sister asked me to watch her dogs at their house. So I did but I took that as an opportunity to have sex with guys without anyone watching. I had sex with two guys today. I knew full-well there were cameras, ones that record. While my sister was out of town she noticed that I covered the cameras. She called me to ask why and she called my dad and told him too. I told her I had a guy come over. She said she was fine with that but thought it was super suspicious that I was covering the camera. So I came home and now my dad knows and he’s all upset and he asked me all these questions. I told him some lies about the guy I was with. And also my sister might check the audio recorded from the cameras inside and hear what I was obviously doing. 

My life is over. I know I’m a dumb-fuck and I made multiple very bad choices. 

What the hell do I do now"
644,Mental health podcast,"Hi! I am a licensed mental health therapist and am starting a podcast with my colleagues. We are working to stop the stigma surrounding mental health through having discussions, encouraging conversation, giving mental health tips, and holding interviews with others in the community. We also want listener involvement as much as possible! Our goal is to share about relevant topics in a relatable way, from professionals. We are building our Instagram following before our first episode drops Feb 1st. Please give us a follow! @mentalhealthinyou"
645,My therapist and I discussed if i consider myself valuable and boy did that conversation not end well,"My therapist asked me if I think I’m valuable and my quick answer to that was no, I’m not. I feel unaccomplished, I feel like I’m very selfish (in the sense I don’t have the mind space to listen to people and be of use) and it’s making me very uncomfortable. That if I were to die today, it would be so disappointing for me that I spent 25 years of my life not getting anything done. I’m just in a difficult space mentally and idk what to do. Sometimes I don’t want to live, but I know life is bigger than my struggles and even that slight conflict fucks with me so much. I hate it."
646,"My best friends almost always tells me her problems and I don't, and Idk how to start to doing it","I think my friend and I are pretty close. I mean, before the pandemic hang out basically always at HS,  and I think during quarantine we've talked almost everything.

The thing is that she tells (I think) almost always when something happens to her, or at least is more open about that than me. I think I more the quiet type in that aspect, even when it comes to little things like anecdotes. She had admitted liking being the centre of attention but she's also pretty caring so I think our dynamic has been working till now.

She has told me some rough stuff and well, I'm pretty sensitive to others feelings and situations so I think I can feel her pain and end up feeling awful. Because of her being the one who talks more about her issues I tend to downplay mines, and now I feel unable to express my feelings or thoughts.

There've been plenty of times when I wanted to tell her about my stuff but I'm too coward and always afraid of being a burden so I feel like I've been a pretender most of the time. When I tell her about something I immediately regret it or downplay the situation. 

I've been thinking about taking my own life (I almost have an attempt yesterday) but I know she also has an historial with the same thing so I haven't told her. 

Honestly idk what to do nor how to address how I feel."
647,Reason to live,"Lately I have had a tough time figuring out to do. I have some great parents, while they are divorced, they do their best to make sure I have everything I have ever dreamed of. I have a great gaming setup at my moms and my dads house and have fun sometimes playing with my friends or by myself. But there are some problems, I feel like my friends don’t even like me, they only want to use me for my house so they can have a place to hangout and have fun. While I’m by myself doing nothing. I’m almost 16 and have never been in a relationship while I feel like all my ‘friends’ have. When I’m alone all I do is listen to music and sit alone. My mom and dad sometimes try to do things with me but I never feel up to the task, I know they love me but I just never feel like doing anything anymore unless it’s hanging out with my friends but, everytime I hangout with my friends I have the same feeling that they aren’t really wanting to hangout with me, they just want to come to my house so they have somewhere to chill out and talk. Again, all I ever want to do is sit and listen to music unless I get on Xbox or pc to play some random game for 30 minutes to an hour. I’m a sophomore in high school and if anyone has some advice to start to enjoy life again I would like to hear it."
648,Thoughts on how mental illness is depicted in the media?,"I have a very important school project which I have no motivation to start doing whatsoever. 

We were supposed pick a topic that personally resonates with us. I chose how ""mental illness representation in the media"" focusing on how it's portrayed can have an immense effect on the viewers. Especially regarding false information and stereotypes/generalisations. 

Its both things I have interest in, mental health and film. However, it's the holidays right now, I'm supposed to go back to school soon and haven't even started the project. I still have enough time but going back to school means more work in other subjects as well.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, asking about your opinions on how mental health issues are represented in the media (mostly film/social medias) could help me get started. I do need to create a questionnaire and collect a lot of responses so I may post here again for that.

Anyway, I hope I can get started soon. If you have any resources that may help, feel free to send them to me. Articles, podcasts, YouTube videos, Reddit posts, anything. Thanks in advance :)

TL;DR: I have an important school project and can't get started. What are your thoughts on how Mental Illness is represented in the media? How much of an effect do you think it has on the audience (teenagers, especially)?

You can go off Question, I really just needed an insight on this. I know- I probably should be specific about the question itself to get relevant answers but oh well. I am really bad at coming up with questions so if you have anything you're curious about, please ask. :)"
649,"My mom told me to ""get a real problem"".","I started to try to talk to my mom on why I'm so mopey and as soon as I try to talk, she tells me to ""get a real problem"".

650,Feeling better from depression. Is it too sudden? It triggered health anxiety.,"I’ve been in a pretty serious depressive episode for about 3-4 weeks. I don’t deal with depression a lot. It usually comes from exhaustion after days of panic attacks when I’m exhausted. I’m primarily diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. 

Over the past week I’ve been doing what my psychologist asked to get better. I got exhausted with it yesterday. I felt a little better, on average. I went from horrible every day to bad days with good evenings alternating with very bad days with so-so evening. Since yesterday was worse than the day before, I got frustrated and thought it wasn’t working. 

I woke up today and still felt depressed. But I gradually got better throughout the day. I got up and around, made myself do some things I like, did some light exercise, like I’ve been doing for the past week or so. I started to get work done without having to break and crawl into bed. I even found myself enjoying doing something silly, and enjoying the way an old song made me feel. And enjoying the nostalgic feeling the song gave me scared me. 

I would stop short of saying I feel 100% like myself, because I don’t. But when I scan myself, I really don’t feel any of the depressive symptoms anymore. And that scares me. What if I healed too suddenly? What if I’ve got a mood disorder and have to start treatment and meds etc. all over? I had a massive panic attack and interpreted the resulting irritability, stammered speech, etc., as potential manic symptoms.

Please don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying this is some horrible condition that people cannot get past. But I am 33 years old and have been in treatment for something for six years, and I am just devastated at the thought of starting something over. I also primarily have health anxiety/hypochondriasis so I tend to medicalize every fear."
651,SOS I don't know what to do,"TLDR: I don't have access to mental health services or medications that I need, and I really just want to give up. 

I am a healthcare professional. I have two children. Up until today, I had a very supportive partner. I have multiple mental health disorders that have been diagnosed including bipolar type 1, panic disorder, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD. I have been going to therapy for years and was functioning well with the right medications. 

About six months ago, the nursing home I worked for had to cut my hours due to COVID. I lost my health insurance. I eventually lost that job. I could no longer afford therapy or medications. The main medication I need costs over $1400 a month. I started sprialling out of control. Every day is hard. Sometimes I can't even dress myself, but my partner was always there to pick me up and motivate me.

I am solely financially responsible for our household, including my partner, two children, a mortgage, a lot of student loan debt, all of our monthly bills, groceries, everything... 

 I found a new job in my field after losing my last job. However, my current job doesn't provide health insurance or sick pay even though I am required to treat COVID+ patients. I work 60+ hours a week, but this is still the lowest paying job I have had since graduating. I have been experiencing burnout due to the excessive amount of work currently required of me. I have had little energy left to take care of myself, my children, or my home. 

I have been reaching out for help from my partner, my family, and the few friends that I have. I have been overwhelmed with work. I haven't been functioning well without my medications. These past few days in particular have been hard and I have been begging for help because I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts. 

My family is not supportive. My mom's exact words to my cry for help were, ""get over it."" Today, my partner broke up with me through text and brought his entire family to my home to clear out his belongings. 

I am at a loss. I feel like he was the only thing holding me and my family together, and now he is sidde ly gone. This was completely unexpected. We haven't had any recent fights. I guess he just couldn't cope with my poor mental health any longer. 

I have experienced years of trauma and abuse in my past. I have had to start over and put myself back together more times than I can count. 

I don't feel like I can do this again. There doesn't seem to be much of me left. I'm afraid I won't be able to care for my children or continue working at the rate I have been. I am tired. I want to give up. 

I have reached out to everyone I can think of but haven't received any help. 

I don't know what to do."
652,Anger fucked my life up,"I can't tell you how many relationships and potential relationships I destroyed because I got angry and blew up at the person. It's happened so many times. I'd feel so much regret after doing it, but I never learned from it and I would just do it again. I broke a lot of people's trust and I feel like if I just never got angry, I'd have way more friends and relationships today. 

I was just reflecting on this today. How I don't have anyone. I'm horribly lonely every day and I feel like ending my life sometimes. I just have no one to talk to and no one to support me. It's all my fault though, I did all of this to myself, and I guess these horrible feelings of loneliness and isolation are my payback. 

I feel so much regret for everything I did. I always think about how things could have been if I never got mad at people. Relationships and trust are both things that are so hard to attain and I took those things for granted. I never realized how important friends are and how crucial it is to nurture and maintain your relationships with people. Out of 7 billion people we only find a handful of those throughout our life who will like us and accept us, and I basically gave those people the finger and told them to fuck off. I really hate myself and I can't stop thinking about everything I did. I feel immense regret and just wish I had the chance to talk to one of those people again."
653,"I don’t know if this is the right sub to post this in, but can someone help me out?","Im in my teens rn, and I’ve been having an issue where whenever I hear a word or phrase I can’t explain to myself in my head, I have to search it up or I get really stressed for some reason. This is getting really annoying while watching movies, or TV shows because of me constantly stopping to search something up. I also get stressed over random things that I don’t understand, like if I see an abbreviation I don’t understand I have to search it up. Can anyone tell me if this is normal, and if there are some things I can do to get over this?"
654,Vent about like 3 different things 😅,"Rn I'm trying to make a list of everything I've been struggling with mentally. I don't really know why I wanted to do this, but it's making me panic a bit. 

I never really addressed everything head on, even thinking about everything is making my head spin and stomach turn. 

Why is this hard? Why can't I ever trust myself? Why is it ALWAYS an internal argument. I'm always contradicting myself, telling myself I'm lying, that I'm stupid for thinking that I felt that way. 

It's really annoying. 

Another thing that makes this hard is I can't tell if one of my problems went away or if I just learned to live with it. 

For example: I used to depersonalize alot, for like a week. But then I realized that I lost the ability to talk to my friends or socialize properly. By the time I was able to talk to my friends again, I realized that I hadn't noticed myself depersonalizing as much. 

So did I stop? Or was I to focused on my social skills? I really don't know. 

This vent went in like five different directions and I'm sorry I just have junk in my mind and need to get it out some how. 

Thank you if you have read this far, I appreciate you."
655,On the edge,"I am so lost. I have no support in my life. I’m 24 years old and both of my parents are dead. My brother lives about three hours away and we aren’t very close so I don’t really talk to him except the occasional happy birthday or merry Christmas. I lost my mom to pancreatic cancer a year ago and my dad died when I was 12. I’ve been waking  a mile and a half to work everyday for the past 6 months and riding 3 busses to get there. I live in Michigan so the cold is taking it’s toll on me being outside before the sun is even up. I was working two jobs for a couple months before our governer shut down in door dining leaving me out of one job. (I was a server at a restaurant). So I had tried to save money for a car but only managed about 1600$. I bought one to try and keep me out of the snow in winter but about two weeks later it broke down and the BCM went out. It’s cost me over 1200$ to get it fixed.. so I decided to scrap it for a mere $250... the most I could get out of it. 

I’ve been working this full time job for 6 months now and they aren’t hiring me in, preventing me from getting health insurance. I suspect that I have some form of mental illness stemming from the trauma I went through. (I’ve moved over 25 times and was the one who found my dads body at 12 years old). 

I’ve never had the money for a therapist and never have had health insurance or anything steady enough to even be able to visit the same doctor more than twice consecutively. I can’t seem to hold a job for too long ever because my living situation often seems to just crumble beneath me and I’m fucking sick of it. I’m so close to doing something I can’t fucking undo but I just don’t care anymore. I am on the edge. I have to be up in 5 hours but I’m just laying in bed here thinking about how fucking shit my life is. How I make just enough money to pay my rent and bills to have almost enough to put money away for another car. But my fucking government snatched my only hope away from me. I was finally getting ahead, there was hope. I was busting my ass working 60+ hours a week just to have it all crumble before me. 

I can’t seem to get ahead. Everytime I’m close I just get shoved back down. I’m not entirely sure I’ll ever get ahead. I’m sick of struggling and am fairly sure this shitty fucking existence isn’t worth keeping on"
656,Why aren't we allowed to recline our seats in the mental health minivan?,"I was too tired, and also too tired to argue and debate it with the driver so I'm arguing now for a good rationale. Please don't say, ""because they said so."" That's appropriate for a 6 year old but an adult deserves a full-on rationale and explanation, like ""because our insurance won't allow it. Call them to ask why at 1-888-###-####."" (Is that why? What other reasons could there be?)"
657,I feel like watching sitcoms as a kid influenced me way too much socially,"Having Asperger's, I was homeschooled until the 8th grade and didn't get a whole lot of quality social interaction.  I would go to an alternative co-op program where I could socialize and meet other kids, but as a generalization, my parents and the media I consumed had the largest influence on my personality.  One of my favourite things to watch was The Big Bang Theory, and if you've ever seen that, it's *not* a show that you should want to learn social behaviors from.  However, I absolutely *loved*  the show because it was easily digestible humour and the characters were role models to me because I was raised to look up to nerdy, successful academia types.  I took in the characters' phrases, mannerisms, and lack of sociability as being things people should strive for, since, after all, these characters are extremely smart and successful in their fields and thought those were traits I should go after.  Me being a particularly impressionable kid, I especially absorbed their behaviors.  

Looking back on my time in high school, I said some incredibly inappropriate things and probably seemed extremely strange to people as I would purposefully seem awkward and nerdy (even though I'm neither) and would say very rude, mean, and cliche/stereotypical things because that's what the show used as punchlines.  Of course, I said all that stuff with sarcasm and thinking that's simply how life is, but I'm sure almost nobody took it that way.

At this point in my life (I'm in college now), I think I've mostly learned and moved on from this stage in my life, but I'm afraid that I have speaking habits and mannerisms that are very sitcom-esque that I don't know if I can get rid of (i.e. comically switching from sad to happy as a joke, getting very angry mid-sentence, etc...).  I feel like it's affecting me socially and would like to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences?  What do you recommend?"
658,I need help!,"Hey guys, so this is the first time I use anything really to vent but I feel like I am having a mental breakdown and I can feel myself slipping into depression. I don't have the strength to leave my room and I feel like I'm constantly getting shit on (metaphorically) every way I turn. 

I have the option to go to school and have my mom pay for my tuition; however the only way she will pay it is if I talk to my father whom had threaten to kill me a year ago and is the reason I was homeless and starving for months.

I am working, but make very little money to where I can barely pay for rent and food so I basically have no life besides work. 

I met a girl this year who has stuck by me through all of this and has supported me and pushed me to do better; however it is starting to get rocky now that she is going to school out of state. Not to mention that my ex that had left me days before I proposed to her, contacted me asking to ""catch up.""

I have never felt this kind of mental illness or even came remotely close to anything like this in my life, but I just need people, someone, anyone to understand and tell me that I'm not crazy and that what I'm going through is a pretty fucked up situation."
659,What is the worst thing compassion fatigue can lead to?,question in title
660,How to become better at managing crying episodes / sad emotions?,"This is my first time in this sub, so hello to all for one! I'm hoping this is the right sub to post this stuff in. To start off, I am an emotional girl. I don't have the best past, but I overcame A LOT of terrible habits and behaviors that formed me into a much better person. I do suffer from some anxiety as well, and have been working on becoming less anxious. Sadly though a few insecurities that built up over the years have followed, no matter how well I'm doing in life, and I get so sad about anything that might trigger my insecurities. This has caused me to pretty much destroy a great relationship I was in. Given there were things I was valid in being upset about, there were many situations where I didn't cope with my emotions and would overreact into crying fits if I ever felt ""challenged"" or insecure about something. Naturally, I am a good person with goals, and a person who wants independence and happiness and to be less emotional. But it just feels like once I get emotional, and start crying, that it becomes out of control and I can't just calm myself down or shut up for a while. I'm never violent or an angry type, I just get so sad and cry, which of course becomes annoying to both myself and my partner. If this part of me wasn't so bad, I'd still be in a happy relationship. I'm genuinely worried that me getting so emotional over small things will always ruin any sort of relationship for me if I don't learn to cope. 

Recently it hasn't been too bad, but again, last night I had a moment where I let something ridiculous get me so sad when it shouldn't have. I end up saying things I don't mean and end up crying, and all crying does is trigger anxiety, which makes situations worse than they are. I'm wondering if anyone out there has a similar issue, and how they overcame this or how they cope with it to control their emotions better. I'm not all ashamed to be very emotional, I know it can just be natural, and I know this doesn't make someone ""crazy"". I just want to learn to deal with it better, to prevent fall out in the future, and to salvage a friendship with this person and any future people that I meet.

I really care about dealing with this part of myself, whether it's suggested that I speak with a therapist or if I should develop new hobbies. I just would like to hear input from anyone who might deal with this. I get so exhausted and I know it is exhausting to others when I get so emotional. This feels like the only obstacle left that I need to overcome in life, or else I will forever push people away and I will constantly be forcing myself into unneeded sadness."
661,Everyone is Dangerous,"I don’t know which flair I should put this one under because I’m not doing so well right now, but if anyone has any ideas on what this sounds like then I would appreciate it. 

Warning// this is kind of a vent? But it’s also like a question because I don’t understand if this might be a symptom of something. 

I fully believe the world is out to get my s/o and it terrifies me. We are ldr and they’ve gone through a lot of trauma and I can’t shake the feeling that every single person in the world is out to get them. I feel like the world is trying to hurt them and take them away from me. I always feel like they are either going to be killed or kidnapped and hurt in many ways. When we aren’t talking, I can’t help but thing about if they’re getting hurt at this exact moment and that I’m not there to help or that no one is around to help them and save them and keep them safe and take care of them. I want to kidnap them myself to keep them safe. It terrifies me that they might be getting hurt again, I don’t ever want them to be hurt again. I can’t loose them. I don’t know what I’d do if they got hurt again. I want to protect them and I feel like one day I might have to steal them away to make sure they never get hurt again because the world is dangerous and everyone wants to hurt them, so I can’t let the world do that. I feel like no one will ever take care of them like I will and that I can’t trust anyone to protect them but myself, which means that unless I’m there with them, I’m a useless s/o and I’m terrible because I can’t make sure they’re safe. 
I don’t know why I always feel this way"
662,Zoloft for anxiety,"Hello, I was put on Zoloft about 6 weeks ago. I feel a huge difference in my anxiety but still get anxious about going out (grocery store, dates, hanging out with friends). My doctor said to wait a few more weeks to see if I reach full effects of the medication. Any idea how long it’ll be before I reach full effects? Like personally for yourself"
663,"Hi, I'm(21F black american) new to this subreddit.","I have anxiety in general. Since experiencing consistent bullying all throughout middle school, it has increased greatly since then. 

Recently, I'm starting to realize how serious mental awareness is. I am showing physical symptoms of anxiety now: clenching teeth while sleeping, panic attacks, tension headaches, muscle spasms, etc.

It's very easy to tell yourself you're not stressed until the physical signs appear. 

I'm currently looking for self-care ideas to help manage my anxiety.



Can any of you guys relate?"
664,i need money for food and medication,"i recently got really ill and couldn't commence work because of it, it was a new job and I had no back up

i intend to treat this as a loan - unfortunately my family disowned me due to my choice in partner, I've been cut off from my family, so here i am, I'm not even sure if this is allowed.

665,How do y'all deal with mental fog?,"I've been having mental fog so often for a while now and it's just completely kicking my ass and making me feel worthless and stupid because I just can't... Think properly. It's affecting my attendance, grades, social life, and just overall mental health, it feels like it's gotten at that point where I'm finally like ""fuck this I am putting a stop to this *now.* So any advice and tips are greatly appreciated, you're a real G if you read this and take the time to respond"
666,Anyone help,"Im very confused about a lot right now, especially my mind, from youth I’ve got into long lasting moods of ups and downs, though I hide it well, I have crazy thoughts, paranoia that scares myself sometimes but I tell myself it’s not true, just things are tough. 

I’ve wanted to see a psychiatrist but it’s hard with covid and lockdowns, I’m struggling with money, school, may be kicked out of school as well, life been kicking my ass right now, if anyone out there wants to talk or something that would be cool."
667,Is this normal?,"When I was younger I would always get paranoid in the shower and constantly peek out the shower curtains to make sure nothing was there. I know that’s probably normal for a little kid but I’m a teen now and from time to time I still do it. I recently had an episode and I would look out the curtains every thirty seconds or so, I was in there for less than 30 mins but it felt like over an hour. I also had tic like reactions during and after the event. Is this normal? Should I be concerned?"
668,[Academic] Therapeutic Relationship with Mental Health and Wellbeing Apps Study,"Have you used a mental health or wellbeing app? We are conducting interviews to learn more about the experiences and therapeutic relationships users have with mental health and wellbeing apps. The study results will help us to better understand the role of therapeutic alliance in the digital context. Therapeutic alliance, which refers to a client-therapist relationship, is a fundamental concept in face-to-face therapy that links with better outcomes. However, there has been very little research done on how a therapeutic alliance might figure in mental health and wellbeing apps that do not involve human therapists. Given the increasing use of such apps, research into this notion of a digital therapeutic alliance is essential.

The interview will be conducted via Zoom and will be 40-60 minutes long. You will receive an AUD $30 gift card upon completion. You must be 18 years or older to participate.

If interested in participating, please fill in your details below and submit this form. We will get back to you regarding booking an interview time slot and provide you with more details about the study.

669,Help with a parent,Have any of you guys ever had to deal with a parent constantly dragging you down or like making fun of you in front of friends. Either if they just don’t think they’re doing it or if they’re doing it to get under your skin or to get you to do something? Cause my dad does it to me all the time for things that I tell him I’m not ready for. It like annoys me and it always makes me feel terrible.
670,Is this a normal part of recovery,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety as well as suicidal thoughts for the past year and in September I was put on meds to help. It has worked ok and I’m definitely getting better but recently I feel so guilty like the weight of what I almost had done finally hit me? I would have put my parents through so much pain and grief, why did I think that was ok. I guess I’m wondering if other people have felt this way before or if anyone has any suggestions on how I could get over this? Anything’s appreciated, thank you :)"
671,I need some advice,"I think I need some help. Ever since this pandemic kicked off, I’ve had a harder time dealing with things. I had my first panic attack around March. Sometimes I just get in this thought loop that feels like that I can’t get out of. When the panic attack kicks in it feels like I’m about to have a heart attack and die. That’s the physical part. Then there’s the mental part where it feels like I’m questioning everything and nothing makes sense. When it first happened I just ran outside for fresh air and walked around frantically. What helps me is walking and breathing and usually it passes. I don’t know, I just want to talk to someone who’s been through this and get some thoughts on this. P.S please don’t get mad if I don’t reply, Im about to sleep and I’ll be at work soon, I’ll try to get back to you as soon as I can."
672,My ex-friend’s younger brother keeps posting on social media about wanting to mill himself,"My ex-friend’s younger brother keeps posting on his Snapchat about wanting to kill himself

Over a year ago, I cut out one of my oldest friends. This was due to many reasons, some of which being us growing distant, him being disrespectful to his family and myself, failing all his classes in his college due to being lazy, and his unwillingness to change. I have spoken to him once since when I ran into him at his job at Walmart. 

About a week ago, his younger brother, J, added me on Snapchat. I didn’t think much of it and added him back. Ever since, he has posted numerous times about him being done with life, wanting to kill himself, and about how much he hates his life. When he posted something today, I reached out and asked if he was okay. He was he was fine and then I told him if he was ok he wouldn’t post those kind of things on his Snapchat, to which he ignored me. 

His Snapchat score is 147, which I believe means he just made his account. I have my ex-friend’s phone number, but he never responds to texts or calls, even when I did talk to him. I have his mother on Facebook and her phone number, but I haven’t talked to her in almost two years. I don’t want anything to happen to J, but I don’t know how to present this issue to their family. What should I do?"
673,Wait longer for mental health help or pay and do online (even though I feel like the quality behind it is unstable),"I believe I have depression/ anxiety. 

Have already seen therapists and online therapy for months.

Should I wait to use my university options, though I have to wait a week and they are usually booked up.

Or try online therapy again.

I have school/work, it might lead me to quit my job (already want to, it involves being a leader for people) and get by school."
674,One choice can change your life(Long read),"So this has currently been going on for a little while now.. a while back in first semester I had the great idea for an online course I’d never be taking again, I was nowhere near interested in, so I decided to hire somebody for the final exam, and in exchange I was working everyday as a personal hockey trainer to pay for school. This all went dandy and well, passed the course, life was alright. 

Few weeks later, I receive an email, explaining how I was caught cheating and they would tell my university unless I pay an absurd amount. 

since this, I have been terrified out of my skin, trying to sort it out, I have no money after I just payed for my last school bill and now because of covid that specific work shut down so I recently got a new job working in a warehouse. While trying to afford rent and food for myself, I don’t know what to do. I’ve worked my whole life to get here as well as a sports scholarship, and I’m too afraid to let my family down, as well as the sacrifices they’ve made to help me. My brother is on his way to being a doctor, and I’ve always been in his shadow, and this was my only shot.

I don’t know what to do, i’m afraid if these people don’t allow me to find some viable option that won’t have me go hungry or lose my apartment, I won’t have anywhere to live or go because of the travel restrictions and limited money. 

I’ve already had a history with depression, and bd, but Since this, it’s opened up a whole new spectrum of mental health issues and brought up things I’ve never had. From anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks, being paranoid, thinking people are following me or out to get me, feeling hopeless and alone and Its tough to explain the situation to anybody, wasn’t even going to post this. I don’t know what to do, it’s really been a kick to the balls, I feel trapped, and don’t have any friends to try get help. 

If anyone has any ideas or thoughts please message me, as well if anyone else is struggling or needs a friend, I’ll be here for you as well"
675,Need help on friend/relationship issue,"I have been with this girl for 4 years and because she said she didn't love me as much she broke up but we still talk and I think we still love each other and don't want to lose each other. I wanted to get back with her for the first month but she kept telling me that she does not want to and does not think of having a relationship at that time. At times, I felt like my feelings were being played. However, one time she saw me talking with a girl and I think she got jealous and started wanting to get back with me. At this point, I was very confused and I didn't know what to do. I started to be confused if I want to get back to her because I felt like my feelings were getting played. Other than that, she was very jealous and controlling too so I was not ready to get back into a relationship because I am scared I would lose my friends too if I am going to get back with her. Because I still love her and I want to be with her but I am scared that I will be subject to being very controlled or having to deal with very jealous issues too I was confused if I want to get back into a relationship with her so I think I was creating a pulling and pushing method that I do realize was unhealthy for her too.

I think because of her very unstable mental state that she was very broken, she had a non-serious fwb with someone after that period of time for a few months. During those times, we still talk and we still love each other and she kept telling me that she was not doing anything with that person at all (which she lied about it because she didn't want to hurt my feelings). She would still get jealous of me when I am hanging with my friends and get very controlling which is the main reason why I was not ready to get back into a relatinship with her yet.

During those times, she would go to one of my best friends (Let's call him H) for comfort and H would be there for her because she was very broken from our relationship.

After around months, when the non-serious fwb had left the country, I started talking to her more and we get closer. At one instance, H would confront me about the times when they would hangout a lot because H was scared that I would be jealous or anything like that, but I told H that I trust him and I know he would not do anything to me that would hurt me. Because H still knows I still love her H said he knew the boundaries and would keep his distance. During these times, she would still remember the times from the past and get jealous and wanted me to not hangout with my friends that she was very jealous of. She knew that she has a very bad insecurity and we would take a few weeks break to keep our distance and see if we would heal and grow from it from our insecurities. H would be there for us and we would talk to H about our problems and H would help us out.

One time after all these, H started acting really weird when H was talking to me. I can sense a bad vibe and he does not make eye contact with me or he did not want to talk to me. At this time, I suspect he probably has feelings for her. He really did have feelings for her and confessed to her without confronting me about it first. I felt really broken and disrespected. However, she told H that H should tell me about it and H did not want to approach me about it at first but eventually he approached me about it. H told me H was feeling very guilty about it and that he has been very selfish and think too much of only himself. At this point, I thought feelings can't be changed but what matter most is the action. I told H that as long as he does not act on it he does not have to feel guilty about it. After that, I heard from her that H told her that H did not want to hear my name at all because H was very jealous of me that I am her ex and I have a lot of emotional connection with her before. H even told her that I did not make it to the cut to be his best friend and he would willingly give up my friendship with him for her. I felt really broken when I heard that. She told me that I deserve better friends than H and I don't deserve friends like that. He would go and tell my other friends that he felt very guilty about catching feelings for her but he still went and guilt her. He would ask her why doesn't she love him as they were so close to each other and said things like nobody would ever love him. Because she told me she does not have feelings for H at all and told other friends about it too so I thought it probably was just one-sided. However, she would text H saying that she misses H or flirt with H and her reasoning would be she wanted to extend her friendship with him. At one point where they cuddled with each other and I was very broken and I wanted to cut off connection with her and H. However, things happen and we decided to just make it a month break and she stated that she would gradually stop talking to H to stop leading him on.

After a month break, we decided to meet again but she got really jealous when she found out that I was talking to a girl, which i am just going on an online competition with virtually and I am not even meeting with in person or anything we would just discuss about work related stuff and she would say that she doesn't think she is ready to meet me yet. She would tell me she has stopped talking to H but she still met up with him anyway. They blocked each other and unblock each other and then blocked each other and unblock each other. It just seems like they couldn't move on themselves too.

I really don't know how to deal with these kind of situation. I felt really betrayed and disrespected and lied to. Even my previous relationship I was cheated on too, so I felt my trust issues has become very low. Do you have any advice on how I should go about this situation? I really don't want to my personality change to a more negative self. I think deep inside me I hope that they don't talk now because she would tell me that she has stopped talking to H and she blocked him and would never talk to him again for him to move on but then still talked to him anyway so I am really confused. I think I was also really mad at H for doing this to me for willing to give up his friendship and say that I don't matter at all.

I have been trying to improve myself, through financially, mentally, and emotionally. I have been reading books that help with my mindset so that I can see the future more optimistically. I have also been trying to not grow my hatred towards them and I don't want my desire to affect other people's happiness.

Do you have any advice on what I should do? Or maybe how do I let go of having betrayal thoughts? I start to feel like I can't trust anymore.

TLDR: I felt betrayed and I need some help to improve my mindset"
676,I’m just looking for some guidance really. I’m not sure what the condition I believe I’m suffering from is called but can’t see a doctor due to lockdown.,"Hello readers.

So this will likely be quite a long post but I need to give quite a bit of backstory and context. The goal of this post would be for someone to educate me about what to ask to see my doctor concerning.

I’m 25, freshly divorced from the woman I fell I love with as a child, we dated from age 13 and married at 18. She wasn’t able to remain faithful and went off to have a child with another man. The catalyst for this betrayal was the death of my brother (at least that’s how I feel) three years ago.

My brother was in a fatal road incident (if you live in the UK - it was in many of the newspapers at the time.) and my parents and I travelled 200+ miles to spend his final week with him. We made the decision as a family, after being informed “less than 10%” of him would come back if he woke up and chances are he’d commit suicide within 5 years, to let him pass on. Within a year my wife, the woman I love(d) with all my heart an soul threw me out - she never gave me a reason. Things go even worse and I ended up going to court concerning the matter. I was acquitted (luckily) but following this and feeling like I literally had NOTHING left - I killed myself.

I died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and the paramedics bought me back. I 
was discharged and went about my life.

But something is different in my brain. My personality has shifted a huge degree, I’m more outgoing and more thrill seeking (whereas before I wanted a quiet life) I’m not complaining about that aspect - that’s amazing!
But there’s negatives too. I keep getting the feeling I’m dead or in a coma and this “reality” is the last few microseconds of consciousness playing out in my brain. I can see signs of it, hear things that tip me off, I experience things and they sometimes just don’t feel... right?

I get days and weeks where apathy is all I feel. I struggle to go to my local town centre because I run the risk of seeing my ex wife which caused me pretty severe panic attacks (6/10). I don’t find enjoyment in some things I used to, and with other things the enjoyment feels hollow. I’ve always had insomnia but there days are ridiculous! I’m very often awake for about 44 hours before I feel tired. (Please note I’m yet to Google any of these as I don’t want confirmation bias)

I just don’t know how to approach fighting this? I want to see my GP but I don’t know what to ask them to look for! When I saw them after my brother died they really fobbed me off because I couldn’t describe what I wanted help with.
I’m not looking for a diagnosis or an official medical opinion I just wonder if someone might be able to point me in the right direction?

Thank you kindly in advance."
677,when im in a relationship im not happy and when im out of one and single im not happy.,Anyone else feel like this?
678,Hanging by a thread,"I(28, M) have this feeling that nobody likes me so I have avoided contacting my closest friends. None of them contacted me. I feel like I have been imposing myself on them. My relationship with my parents hasn't been good for a decade. They've been trying to reach me but I don't think I'll ever be able to be with them. 

I have a group of friends in the town I live. We have nothing in common. Our only common interest is drinking and smoking up. We meet everyday and drink. I can't share my interests or the trouble I go through with them.

On the rarest ocassion I come up with something that is worth sharing, I have noone to talk to. I feel lonely and empty. 

I'm going through the toughest phase of my life. I have been in only one relationship my entire life. It's been over a year since I broke up with my ex. It would be nice to have someone to talk to. 

To fill the void, the last relationship left, I hit on any girl friend who would talk to me. I know I'm not ready for a relationship now but I feel lonely. My life revolved around my ex, now she's gone I feel like a spaceman floating in a void. 

I quit my job a while ago. I wasn't able to focus. My nest egg just ran out today. I can't bring myself to start applying for jobs again. Every night before I fall asleep, I'll promise myself that I'm going to start applying the next day but I don't. I stay in bed all day. 

I can't afford therapy and meds now. I am schizophrenic.

Now that I don't have anything, I feel like relieving myself of everything. I know it would cause pain to the few people in my life but I will cease to exist. I won't feel the pain."
679,how is my mental state?,"i am 17. i see all my “friends” as acquaintances, because i not able to form a connection with any of them, despite them thinking we are friends. perhaps i have simply not found someone who is compatible w/ me yet? i also fake my personality around people and can mold myself into whatever i know they would like. it is exhausting having to act for hours on end. 

as my true self, i rarely outwardly show my emotions, and my emotions feel muted. i find myself faking emotions because i know how i am supposed to react to situations. i know how to make people think they are close to me, when in reality they barely know anything about me. i give them superficial aspects about myself because i dont want them knowing the deeper things. i also want to be able to leave friendships at any point so i dont want them to get too attached to me. 

i hate the idea of relationships. i might be afraid of commitment? i think another part of it is that i feel that i will just be acting in front of them too, so whats the point of even going through with one? ive also never been able to feel a romantic attraction to anybody, but i probably just havent found the right person yet. i get annoyed with emotional people and i have a difficult time feeling remorse when people tell me sad things about their lives. i have a problem with smiling or laughing during inappropriate times, such as when someone is yelling at me or sharing bad news. 

i think i have something wrong with my emotions? are most people seriously genuine, or are they faking it too, like me? i have opinions of people in my mind and may hate someone but i will act like i like them, but i think everybody does that. i do feel emotions though, dont get me wrong: i can cry and i can laugh, i can get angry and scared. people can hurt my feelings and people can make me laugh.

i dont know how to explain this part very well, but i see others as odd. i see them as separate from myself. i cant relate well with them and it makes me feel lonely. i am not depressed though, i just feel kind of empty a lot of the time. i know this whole thing is a jumbled mess of words, but if anyone could give me their opinion i would appreciate it."
680,Trauma aggravated by the pandemic,"I’ve struggled for years with trauma and got diagnosed with PTSD a couple years ago. One trauma event was centered around my dad and him living. Of course, he is okay, but he struggles from mental illness as well. I used to be scared of losing him, but now, I’m consumed by the fear everyday. It’s because of the pandemic. I was finally healing and recovering before the pandemic hit, but I had to move back home (college student) where it occurred. Plus, the added stress of him being susceptible to the virus. It has gotten to where the memory is triggered in my dreams and everyday, and I worry one day we won’t be safe enough that it’ll happen. I don’t know how to start living in the moment and understanding I can’t control it anymore. I’m trying, but I’m losing the battle of staying positive. I only see my parents (due to the virus), so if I lost him, I would be devastated."
681,i just asked for help,"I told my friend and my sister that I was self harming really bad. And after weeks of holding it in and feeling like I don’t deserve help, I went to my sister and told her I was struggling"
682,Something is wrong with me and I’m pretty sure it’s me,"So I’ve had a very bad previous year, with lots of serious mental and physical health problems. It’s getting to the point where it’s negatively affecting my work as well as my personal relationships. For the longest time I wasn’t sure what to do, because it all seemed like they were all things that had been outside of my control. Freak accidents like a wire popping when I grabbed it and electrocuting me, family dying, my rapist stalking me and sending me threats, all of these were things I never asked for and don’t really see much of how I could have prevented them, but at the same time things like this happened to me A LOT this past year. Just this week, I had to go to the ER for a kidney infection I suddenly got. I’m not sure if I could’ve prevented this because I’m not sure how I contracted it in the first place, but I was telling my mother about it and she said “don’t you think your work is getting irritated by all the bad things that are happening to you? It seems like every time I call you, something bad has just happened to you.” I didn’t know what to say, because all I could think is I never asked for any of this, I’ve never tried to invoke any of this, if I’d known how to prevent it I would have. My mind hasn’t really changed much on that, I still don’t know what I could’ve done about these things, but I am aware that I need to do something. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone, I don’t want people to be annoyed at me for all the bad things happening to me, I’m tired of bad things happening to me. I’m not trying to paint a poor me narrative, so if this comes across as such I am really and truly sorry. I’m just genuinely at a loss, I’m exhausted to the point where my existence feels cancerous and I want it to be different, desperately, but have no idea what I’m doing wrong. I only go out to work, I workout, I eat my veggies and fruits, I put most of my money to savings, I’d say I live a very bland, safe life. I promise, I try so hard not to be a burden."

684,Could traumatic nightmares cause intense scratching at night?,"So this was around 3 years ago, but during my worst years of highschool (and hopefully the worst part of my life) i suffered with social anxiety, asperges and got bullied at school and at home. (Home bullying was done by an abusive parent and the kids who lived in the houses around me)

Basically at this school even my friends turned against me because for some reason, being the newest kid, i was the biggest target yet. Kids not even from my grade would know my name and harass me for fun. 

As the second year rolled around i was having constant nightmares of school, often ones about me being in a ps2 style classroom with kids with distorted faces blocking me in and trying to kill me in some horrific way. But the theme was always been trapped with them somewhere and having no one to save me in those situations. Or betraying me last minute.

Especially during nights where i had nightmares i would wake up to having painful red marks all over my chest, neck and arms that i didn’t use to have prior. And i doubt my bed was infested with anything. 

Could my nightmares and stress cause the scratching? Or would it be something else?"
685,Loneliness or Solitude?,"So I am at the point right now where its hard to differentiate between the two. I enjoy my own company yes, but I have been in depression before, for around 2 years. I was able to overcome it and after that my perspective for everyone and everything has changed. And I am definitely better at life (including lifestyle, behaviour, etc.) now. 

But this past year has been weird and full of ups and downs. I was happy to start uni abroad, moved there in Feb'20 and was in the process of settling down when I had to return home due to the pandemic. A traumatic incident happened at the airport (someone passed away) and whenever someone asks me about my journey back home, I just can't seem to think straight since it brings back all the moments.
And then the fact, that I had to stay in self isolation for 3 weeks definitely made it worse.

I don't have friends in this city and I actually only have 2-3 good ones. But everyone got busy with their lives due to covid that all of us got drifted apart a little bit. 

I took a deferral when I came home because with timezone and everything it was getting hard and I just needed a break then. 
Now my uni starts in March, and the past year I have definitely been able to achieve some personal goals but career wise, I am lacking. I am enrolled for an exam, I was supposed to write it in Dec but it got cancelled and now it got postponed to May, but I'm just not able to study. 

I have enjoyed this alone time for a bit but sometimes, it gets hard. I am not able to focus on my studies. Tried a bunch of online courses, tried reading. I love reading but struggling with it too. I just don't want to go back in that tunnel again. Just can't. 

Depression made everything worse especially my health. Please someone just give me some suggestions on how to keep myself focused on my studies again. 
 
Will appreciate it. 💕"
686,What caused my sexual deviant thoughts?,"Here is a description of my behavior:
 
When I was young, I jacked off to the idea of people being stuck in the mud. I don't know why I developed those thoughts, but I got turned on by the bondage and struggling. 

When I was 17-18, I basically abused Reddit to further my deviant thoughts. I would save comments on Reddit about people's stories about being stuck in the mud or quicksand, including comments by people who were minors or comments made by adults describing their behavior as little kids. I refused to sexualize that behavior for obvious reasons, but I still saved those posts and comments and copied them to a Google Doc file where I changed the ages of the person in the story to adults. I also asked questions on subs like teenagers about being stuck in the mud stories to gather material, where I changed the ages in the doc. That is completely messed up, but I later deleted that Doc later on. I also made fake posts on subs like tifu about getting stuck in quicksand in order to fulfill my kink.

When I was 18 years old saw someone around their age range that was attractive in a picture of a blog post about getting stuck in quicksand and jacked off to thoughts of them. I then messaged the parent who made that blog post about random questions about the trip with the goal of finding out their exact age so I know I wasn't jacking off to something they shouldn't be as they since I didn't know the exact age. The question did not reveal my true behavior and was SFW material. 

I later turned my bondage kink into being handcuffed. I also one looked up someone's public criminal record and Instagram page to jack off to them being in bondage after reading about them on a news paper story after being arrested for breaking a curfew in regards to protests. I would also often ask questions on Reddit about whether or not it is possible to get arrested for underage drinking in college as a way to satisfy my kink and made fake posts on the tifu sub about getting arrested for fake ID or partying.

What caused my sexual deviant thoughts?"
687,Online therapy resources?,"Hello! My girlfriend has been really struggling with her mental health for a while now, but due to many circumstances, she is completely unable to see any therapists. On top of that, every one she has emailed says they aren't taking in any more clients.

She mostly struggles with depression. Her main problems are strong thought distortions, mostly relating to self-worth and relationships. She could also use some motivation.

I'm looking for some resources she could potentially use online. Maybe a video series or website, idk. 

Thanks for any advice!"
688,‼️⚠️TW ⚠️‼️ Depression/suicidal thoughts,"I need help. I’m 14 and have had suicidal thoughts for like 2 years now. I’ve never attempted I don’t self harm, I just think about it. I don’t know how to tell my family because I don’t trust them. I don’t have many friends and the friends I do have, I feel like they don’t like me anymore. I spend my day masking to cover up how I am feeling, I don’t want them to ask questions. But when I am alone I feel worthless and stupid, and I feel empty.. does anyone know how to handle this, if they’ve been in a similar situation."
689,i hate myself,"i just hate myself so so much. ive had a rough upbringing and some trauma in my formidable years but they seem so distant now, barely connected to the way i feel today. theres just this deep visceral hatred i have for myself and everything i do and it seems to come from nowhere. i dont have to compare myself to anyone to hate my appearance. i dont need to do something wrong to feel like a failure. these are just things that are ingrained into my psyche. it hurts to exist. im tired of feeling this way. i know im not the only one who experiences this but it feels like i am because this feeling is mine alone. i just want to stop hating myself please"
690,What’s wrong with me?,"Hey, I’ve been a fairly normal person my whole life although suffering from ADHD and high functioning autism, but as of late I’ve noticed my mental health has been getting increasingly worse, I’ve been having random mood swings, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and extremely violent thoughts, I’m worried about myself and my close ones, I’m afraid I’ll hurt them, please can someone tell me what’s wrong with me."
691,I wish I could hold down a job like a normal person,"My job history is a mess, because always after I've been at a job for a while, it gets so overwhelming and I end up quitting. It's a never ending cycle of not being able to get help because I can't afford it and not being able to afford it because I can't get help. I've worked since I was 18 (now 23) and I don't have a dime of savings, and things just keep getting worse. Obviously it doesn't help that I work for such a bad company right now, but I just wish that I didn't get burnt out on every job after a 6 months or a year.  I want to be able to work at a call center without having a panic attack every time a call comes in. I want to not hate people so much. I just want to be a normal person who works and can afford to live. But it feels like with such bad anxiety I'll never get that."
692,Why do I feel this way,"Lately I’ve been having extreme mood swings. I’ve noticed that I laugh at random things out of nowhere which makes others uncomfortable and myself too. Other times I don’t want to be around anyone and just ignore everything, like a deep hole of depression. I’ve also been having serious suicidal thoughts and issues. For the last  while I’ve had incidents of hitting myself, punching sharp fences and lately whipping myself hoping I bleed. What can I do. I don’t feel normal and it feels like everyday is a struggle to stat sane and relaxed."
693,I feel like I was mentally raped,"Throughout my life as a Jehovah’s Witnesses, or more specifically the child of a Jehovah’s Witnesses I’ve been told no about a lot of things. No blood transfusions, no holidays... whenever it went into sexuality, I felt something felt off about it... especially into later years when I saw this whole “religion” is a sham and I noticed I was gay.

But after I told my parents, all hell broke loose. My mom kept on treating me different and stuff and the started taking things away from me and treating me like a convict.

But that doesn’t hold a candle to what’s happened to me underneath the physical surface.

I want a relationship with another male, so bad.
And it used to be purely like that... just very gay and sweet... but now things hurt and feel sour...

Back when I was younger and began looking at porn (way too young, mind you) to satisfy my physical desire to be with a man... but then women started appearing in my porn searches on e621 (yes I’m a furry, shut up)... I tried to ignore them, but then I started interpreting them as messages from god to force my sexuality to change... bow every time I look at porn up to today, a woman may appear in my thoughts, raping me, or forcing there bodies all over me, or shoving their asses in my face to tempt me... then I started looking at hentai just to prove to myself that I’m not some “straight degenerate”. And there were 1 or 2 images (out of like 100) that gave me erections... My dick felt good, but emotionally, I felt disgusted... horrified... and I felt tears fell down my face.

Kinda like how rape victims get horny despite their bad situation, except more despair-inducing.

I almost killed myself that night, and sometimes I  did stab myself in the dick.

Soon I had images of dicks being mutilated and vaginas being praised in my head that made me have dark thoughts and murdering women in my life that were important to me.

Soon, it felt like my whole sexuality was being forcibly changed by god himself for is own homophobic and sexist agenda, and sometimes I wake up to erections... I’m scared and crave for a relationship with a man that I twinge, and tweak in desperation and smile as I reach out to images of my ideal man as they fade away. Replaced with women... and then I feel disgust and hatred.

My parents have ruined me as a person. 

And sometimes I feel like I turned straight, despite knowing otherwise."
694,I have a very strong urge to kill something,So I am currently in one of these states now I have a very strong urge to kill or hurt something or someone. I’ve had these stages for as long as I can remember and also had next to no empathy for anyone or anything. But recently the urges have grown stronger and more frequent. I see a therapist but she does nothing about this. Also I’ve had fantasies were I kill people and try and get away with it. Again my therapist didn’t do anything all sh told me was write these fantasies down in an imaginary journal to process at a later date. That doesn’t do anything. So y’a pretty sure there’s something very wrong with me but what am I gonna do?
695,Does anyone know the longest a mental health residential can keep an adolescent in Indiana?,I can’t find any info on this online. Or does anyone know the average stay in a mental health residential?
696,"Soo... I think I'm not okay. Or maybe I'm just making this up, but I'm very confused","Backstory: I'm 13yo and I've had phases where I've felt very sad and lonely, but they never lasted longer than 4 days. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom.

I've been feeling very worthless and lonely and that nobody really cares about me that much. It has been like this for a while now ( maybe 3 months or so). I feel like I can't show other people how I really feel and I'm just an avatar that is always happy and energetic.

The question I want to ask is if I'm just faking it for attention or if there is really something going on."
697,Advice?,"I’m worried about what I’m going to do with a friend of mine. They’re not doing okay mentally and I don’t know how to help them. I completely shut off when they open up too much and I know it’s selfish but I think I should cut them off.  Not because they feel bad, but because I’m stressing about them so much that I get really scared when they message me. I also think they’re going to cut me off, mostly because it’s awkward whenever we talk and I know I really upset them too. For fuck sake I even said “this is awkward, guess I’ll leave” last night to them. And they acted like it was fine. I’m being a horrible selfish person but I just physically and mentally can’t take all this stress. Funny thing is I only met them this October. I just want to get away from this situation so I can stop pitying myself. I really thought they were so fun to talk to and I really became dependent on them but I just don’t know. Thoughts?"
698,Is it that bad?,"Is it that bad that I enjoy self harm? I've been doing it since I was a kid, but never with the intention of really hurt myself. I was discussing it with my mom and she was shocked and asked me to see a doctor. But I never thought of that like something bad, it is just something that I enjoy."
699,Mindful Monday!,"Good morning friends!  


What are 2 things you plan to do this week to practice mindfulness?   


Mindfulness means to become the empowered viewer, rather than the helpless participant, in your life. To observe, without judgment, your thoughts and feelings. To be able to take a step back and enjoy an experience, without feeling the need to move to the next experience."
700,Am I going insane,I’ve been getting more anxiety and more depressed the longer quarantine has gone and I’ve spent more time on the internet. And I don’t want to admit but I’ve been seeing a lot of death and pain because idk. But now I don’t even flinch at the sight of gore and I’m often worried at night someone will break in and I’m on edge. I’ve also haven’t had a good dream in months they are all nightmares. I’ve started taking a liking to chickens more than people. I used to have a social life. But now I don’t talk to anyone I don want to be dramatic I’m just concerned but I can’t tell anyone I know irl.
701,How To Earn Money Whilst Being Useless?,"I don't know where to ask this. Nobody is giving me any answers. 

I'm afraid to ask people for money because I had to ask once before. I want the money to get a new PC that can help me with my hobbies and mental health. I'm autistic, I have social anxiety, cutiephilia, bipolar disorder, a weird disability where I can't handwrite or draw properly? I'm also very overweight and have asthma.

On top of that, all the hobbies I've attempted end up failing horribly, so I can't do commissions (not allowed to use links here, so I'm sorry if you find anything I've made). I suck at art. I suck at music. I suck at writing. I don't know what to do. I had considered a loan because, it is viable in my situation, but my bank's textphone number doesn't work. I also have speech issues which is why I can't necessarily call them and speak. I'm pretty much crippled from the head down.

I need help."
702,Does anyone have any experience with depression in the elderly?,"I work in an assisted living facility and just had a resident express to me that at this point she just want to die. She said she's burnt out and tired of dragging herself to meals and rushing to the bathroom so she does wet herself and become someone else's problem. She said she does care what happens to her, we can just throw outside.

 If it were someone one my age I would try to comfort them by saying things along the lines of ""you have so much to live for"", ""I know it sucks now but it wont be like this forever"", ""you have your whole life ahead of you"", etc. But unfortunately this isn't the case for these residents. More than likely they will be here for the rest of their lives. and ""here"" isn't that great. I have no clue how to comfort her or any of the other residents that express similar sentiments. They are already on anti-depressants that clearly aren't cutting it. And to be honest if I was in their shoes I would probably feel the same way. 

If anyone knows how to help or of a better suited subreddit for this question please let me know."
703,Today I took the first step into treating my mental health,"For the record I'm 13 turning 14 this year. For ages I haven't been able to share deep information with people let alone my friends and family. I have used hotlines before but nothing felt like it was connecting, we didn't naturally flow into another topic relating to why you called, you could say they were the first steps but they didn't help as much I hoped they did but I did call a second time to released my mind for a hour but it was the same. 

It wasn't on a level where I felt comfortable dropping deep information about the issues and goes on tangents that weren't necessary until I used web chat. This gave more of a connection to the other person and really got some of my big problems of my chest, the online councillor for some reason was alot more understanding other than just saying yep, then saying some sort of point. The chat was straight to the point, though I knew somethings were there he opened them up in a new way, he actually helped me. He gave reasonable points, it didn't feel bland.

I don't often tell people my problems, I only say them to people I don't know personally so they don't change what they think of me, just texting, getting advice, help me even to the point where I feel more comfortable telling my friends about what I have been going through, he opened up the world in a new way and he said everything too make a good conversation about problems. It really made me open up to ideas I thought I would never do. 

Thanks Victor."
704,Why do a lot of people treat me differently?,"I am a 17 year old high school student and I pretty much like the same shit as other teens. Anime, music, social media, you name it.The thing is that I don't feel like I am treated equally. The only people that treat me with love and respect are my friends and family, but outside of that group I feel like I am hated. I've always felt this way, even as a kid, but it wasn't until now that I have opened up about it. When I got to high school, it's become more obvious life has become more scary and unfair. I was beginning to think that people treat me differently because I'm on the spectrum and ""mentally ill."" My freshman and sophomore year were the worst years of my life, I didn't know who I was anymore. No one was there for me when I was suffering a lot, but my one and only friend at the time. I even broke down and cried a couple of times in class and no one cared.When sophomore year ended and summer came, I went out with my friend more. She introduced to me to the punk scene and took me to many shows. I've never felt more alive that summer, it made me change into someone I've always dreamed of becoming. That summer I also reunited with my friend from 6th grade. When junior year started, I was scared to what people from school were gonna think about the new me. Throughout I sort of developed this ego and I just didn't give a shit about what anybody else thought about me anymore. The same year, I've made new friends in school that were just like me and accepted me for who I am. Senior finally came around, and I still feel as though I am being treated as if I was a rabid dog. But I wanna know why differentiate between me and ""normal people."""
705,I feel sick with everything,"I (16) am not really sure if this should go on this sub so sorry if it shouldn't, but it's the only place I can think of to put it.

Uhm, so staring from a few days ago, I've had times where literally anything I look at, smell, touch or eat makes me feel sick and disgusting. It usually lasts for 10 minutes. But today it's been happening for over 30 minutes so far and it's even worse than normal and I can't take it anymore. I've tried to make myself vomit but I can't. I tried showering multiple times and cleaning myself everywhere and nothing is working. It's gotten so bad and I don't know what to do. I don't have any disorders like OCD or anything like that, or that would have been my first conclusion. I'm not really sure what to do now cause it keeps getting worse."
706,Help me please in the comments?,Hi I don’t think I’ve ever posted on here before but here we are. I want some advice on what to do. The current situation I’m in I’m a mess. Mental health services aren’t listening to me and I feel like the only way out is to end my life. Around 2 weeks ago I tried to end my life and was in ICU in a coma for 3/4 days and I want to try again. My original plan was to run from home and stay in a tent and do it there. I’ve been 136 2 days in a row and both times in the assessment people don’t care. I honestly can’t go on like this anymore and I need some help and advice on what my next steps should be. I bought the things I need to do it yesterday ready for today. Not posting this for attention just advice. Also sorry about how bad the spelling and punctuation is I can’t be bothered to add it I know that sounds stupid but it’s one more thing to think about.
707,Finding a good Therapist,"Hi! Ive got some sort of mental health issues that I don’t know whats up with me. It feels like apathy mixed with depression and I’m very easily irritated/ angered when I’m in this state. It’ll last for a few weeks at a time and when I’m with friends they’re a good distraction but obviously this is impacting my life and I want to find a therapist to help me figure out whats wrong exactly? 

If you have any tips for finding a GOOD therapist please recommend thanks"
708,Is there something wrong with me? Or is this more common than I think it is?,"I’ll just try to summarize everything and thanks for reading it.

Since I was little I’ve had very strong obsessions and a very bad ability to control my impulses. I would get random little obsessions for times. It was things like daydreaming, then setting small things on fire, things like that.

Ever since I hit puberty those obsessions became sexual and I just had bad sexual thoughts. I acted on it once and to this day I feel horrible about it and it makes me question who I am. After that during my adult years the thoughts were still there and gladly now I don’t act on them and things are a bit better. I had some issues with alcohol and cannabis consumption as well and gladly that is in the past too. I also visited a few prostitutes and it made me miserable.

I left all of that behind but my past behavior still haunts me to this day.

Thanks for reading"
709,"Bipolar question, do you notice any distinct physical changes before a cycle change , ie: metallic taste in mouth, changes in eye color, acne flairs, skin color, headaches or nausea?","Psychiatrists often overlook rapid physical changes and ignore them as warning signs before manic and depression cycles , if they paid attention they could address shifts in mood quicker"
710,Feeling like crap after date didn't feel the same,"For context: I am suffering from autism and have PTS regarding being bullied which gives me the fear of being alone/excluded not acctepted. And in my age group (in my 20s) a lot of people with autism struggle with relationships. So as you can see. I really hit the mental jackpot here. 

So I had a date last weekend which in my experience went really well. She had to go home after her parents called her about her grandpa who was dying.

So today she texted me that she didn't feel the same way. 

I honestly don't blame her on anything and am thankfull she texted me that she didn't feel anything instead of ghosting which some (too many) people do. 

But still. I kinda feel like this one just was the straw that broke the camels back. Adding to this I am at work for another 6 a 7 hours. So really letting it all out is not really an option. 

I just feel that I am kind of a lost cause in relationships. And blame myself for that. I don't know what I'm doing wrong and what I should change if anything at all. 

And those thoughts make me angry at myself because I should not have to change myself for anyone. Then again sometimes I feel like I will end up alone if I don't and am kinda freaking out about the whole thing. I am currently seeing proffesional help for it. But just the constant punches life trows at me get heavier to endure. And that thought makes me shiver to my core, as I'd hate to find out where that would end up.

And why the fuck should I care about finding someone... I shouldn't. I should be able to find happiness by myself. Yet I seem to not be able to. 

To kinda summerize it all. I lately feel like crap and people around me notice it too. I seem less myself lately and I feel angry at the world from time to time for just being such a fucking awful place, and sometimes even question why I even try to help the envoirment (I study biobased chem and tech because my passion is that kind of thing) because why the fuck should I save the earth. All it does is punch me after I try to stand up and just be myself. 

That's what bothers me the most. The shit I am going through is getting to my ideals/passions/life goals whatever you want to call them. It's scary to think what that may cause in the future. 

I know this post is less organized than whatever is not organized. But I just really need something that just goes my way for like one fucking time. Even if it's small. I just feel like I am not enough. Like I underachieve. I don't, says my uni and internship etc. But yeah, my thoughts don't stop thinking it."
711,TW// SELF HARM,"I've been relapsing since I couldn't meet my therapist for 3 days. I cut myself badly and was bleeding, I always had the thoughts of suicide/SH, I usually inform my sister before/after I do it..but for the first time, I got up after doing it and gave her all the stuff I used and told her to keep them away from me so I wouldn't harm myself anymore and started listening to my therapist more and decided to get admitted so I can get intensive sessions."
712,How can I help a friend with their mental health during lockdown?,"tldr; housemate not coping with lockdown and mental health, pushing me away when trying to help but it's beginning to affect my mental health. How do I approach it sensitively ? 

I'm in the UK so currently in national lockdown 3.0.

Ive been in lockdown pretty much since March due to where I live, but my friend is/was in an area with lesser restrictions.

Were now back living together for uni and she really is not handling this lockdown very well.

She is very irritable, very angry, very stressed and isn't her normal positive self. It doesn't help our neighbours are noisy 24/7 despite numerous noise complaints and asking them to be quieter.

We are also both healthcare workers.

I'm noticing signs in her which I have experienced with my history of mental health struggles and am trying to support her in talking about how she's feeling and seeking other outlets. She was very into her running until a few months back and I'm trying to encourage her to get back into it to help with her mental health.

She says she isn't struggling, which I respect but I'm worried that she is but just doesn't want to admit it. (she's not grew up in a house hold like I have where she has been able to talk about her mental health openly without feeling judged).

Although I know what works for me (after years of therapy, medication, trial and error with outlets) I'm finding it difficult to break through to her without her pushing me away or making her feel worse. 

I don't want to just leave her be as its beginning to affect my mental health which I know probably sounds selfish. 

How can I help her without making her feel suffocated??"
713,I don’t know what to do anymore,"My life has been hell up to this point, I was abused for four years, I’ve dealt with others suicide attempts, my friends are extremely rude but I keep coming back because I have nothing, My dad never tells me anything, I have social anxiety, I'm depressed, I’m gay so every single person I’ve met that I'm not good friends with has given me hell, I’m Mexican-Indian so racists often insult me with shit such as “wHy dId YoU PaY FoR ThE WaLl” bullshit, and I’m just fucking ugly. I've given up at this point, every time I try to do something I immediately lose motivation. I’ve nearly killed myself 5 times but I didn’t have the will to do it. It's just so tempting to make it all end and I don't know if I can go on. Even if the asshole who hurt me is gone the mental, physical, and emotional trauma stayed. I just don't know anymore."
714,I think im either psychotic or crazy or... something. something is wrong with me!,"I met a guy in August, I liked him, we started being a thing but it drive me mad. I wasn't aware of it until now, but I see how crazy it made me. I would constantly think about him, wanted to talk every day, all day... I was too much. and we were something for just like a month and the crazy inside of me expected us to behave like we were in a relationship so he broke up with me. we decided to stay friends but I think I didnt completely understand what that meant. instead of giving him space, I texted him a week after breaking it off. never begged or anything, hut I think what I did is actually worse. I won't go into too much detail but basically the gist of it is thatni tried to stay in contact with him for way too long. the longest id go without talking to him during our break up was for a week. then we'd talk, them again for a week and blah blah... it has been exactly two months since we ended it. and im only getting worse. my mental health is terrible. I literally stopped showering and washing my teeth (now I have holes in my teeth bc I generally have senstive teeth) and I wasnt even aware how much I was neglecting myself for the past 2 months, I literally don't remember what I did except dwell and cry all the time, trying to talk to him and getting depressed bc he would always take long long to reply (understandable)
he would always reply and even continue the convo sometimes, but it would still take him 5-10 hours and so on... I did a huge mistake tho...
I asked him to hang out just a day after we hung out with our mutual friends. he reached out to me after the hang out and it felt like he was calmer and wanted to be friendly finally, but after asked him out he turned cold and mean right away. I definitely ruined my chances of being friends with him. but I'm scared...
I dont know if my behaviour post break up is considered simply pathetic and desperate or his this borderline harassment? am I thinking too much? being paranoid? bc I truly never meant any harm, just wanted to stay friends but now I dont know what to do, feel.like I pushed him away forever. 

I ruined my grades bc of this. I had 3 weeks of winter break  and all I did was ovwrthink every little aspect of what our relationship used to be  my behaviour during and my behaviour aftet and so on so on...  I dont eat nor drink nearly enough and I can't focus on even watching a movie or a TV show...

am I crazy? definitely obsessed, but has it already gotten too far?"
715,I feel like my life is a series of failures.,"I suffer with PTSD and BPD. I honestly don't know how much longer I can switch moods and feel this exhausted from it.

I push people away when I'm in my down phase, annoy people in my up phase and people don't bother with me when I'm in my ""normal"" phase. When I slur my words people get frustrated with me, when I talk clearly but too fast people get frustrated with me, when I talk normally people think I'm miserable and get frustrated. 

I feel like a shitty daughter, a shitty mother, a shitty girlfriend, a shitty employee and a shitty human.

I'm so sick of being a burden in everyone's lives. 

I have a big support network, people love me and they say they understand. But they don't, they never will and some of them trigger a lot in me without realising. I stay quiet and people think I'm giving them silent treatment, I shout and scream and people think I need anger management, I talk normally and people either give me silent treatment or shout and scream at me. There is no middle ground. It hurts. 

I don't know if I can do this anymore, there's nothing here for me."
716,Struggling? Read this please ❤,"Heya! I'm Karma! I live in germany and I've been struggling with depression, bpd, adhd, trauma and anxiety! For everyone out there struggling as well, no matter what kind of mental illnesses, I just wanted to say:

717,Therapy,"Recently I've started taking antidepressants and feel much better. Pretty much all of my physical symptoms are gone (even ones I didn't even expect, like my vision appearing to improve).

However, I was wondering if I should start therapy as well. From what I've heard/read, it is widely believed that therapy in combination with medication is the best solution/has the highest success rates.

The problem is, however, finances. From what I''ve found about the pricing, it's around 60 ‎€/session (45min). The price seems a lot lower for residents (35 ‎€/session), so I'm considering that, but still, I'm afraid it would quickly exhaust my savings. I'm a student, so I only have a minimum wage part-time job, no scholarships.

I plan on discussing this with my psychologist, but I'd like hear other opinions as well. Is it worth it, if medication seems to be working fine?"
718,I fear my life will culminate in a massive failure,"I'm 21, and I'm writing this because these past months have been hell for me. I always had anxiety issues but they have worsened significantly. I have had suicidal thoughts constantly with an attempted self harm for the first time.

I am in a highly competitive college and half of my college duration have been spent with the recruitment calls have been initiated. I still have 2.5 years before I graduate but I already feel that I am behind everyone and nothing I can do would amount to anything. Ik this is a smaller concern in comparison with the problems everyone else might be facing because of the pandemic but with the pandemic my entire work schedule has gone haywire and I feel I wasted the last 3 months. I honestly feel it's easier/better to end my life. 

I'm also writing this because mental health is massively stigmatized culturally in my society (India) and I can't talk to anyone."

720,I am pathetic.,"I am a pathetic person. I have given up on almost anything I've ever tried when it gets too hard. Guitar lessons, college (twice), any type of hobby that I've shown any interest in, working out. The list goes on and on. Hell, most of the things I start to post on Reddit I end up deleting because I can't think of how I want to word/explain things and my brain gets too overwhelmed, so I just stop. I'm 40 pounds overweight and I know what I need to do to lose it, but I give up every time.

So now, I'm a 41 year old that has no talents, skills, or knowledge. I'm stuck in a retail job that I hate because I'm too scared to leave. I can't stick up for myself and let everyone walk all over me. I'm too scared to try anything or go anywhere. Meds and therapy have not helped and I feel like I'm getting worse every day.

The only thing I haven't given up on is life, and I sometimes wonder why I haven't because it's the hardest thing of all."
721,Why is it hard to accept healthy relationships because you have only grown up with toxic relationships?,"All my life, I never had a positive role model to look up to. I have never witnessed what a healthy supportive relationship looks like.

My parents fight every few months, threaten each other to get divorce, vent their frustrations and anger at each other and in the middle of it, both my sister and I have suffered. I dont know how she's doing but I am not ok.

Once I started dating at 18, I fall into a relationship with a man who was almost twice my age. He was manipulative and deceiving. On our first date, he grabbed me, kissed me and touched my breasts while lifting my skirt to look down. I was both frighted, nervous and excited. I thought that was love. 

Then I dated another guy who was just a complete looser who was still living off his parents, had no jobs or the willingness to get one. I stayed with him just because he showed me an ounce of kindness. But in the end, he did more bad things than he did good things. 

Then I dated a man who made threats and publicly humiliated me once I didn't stay with him and tolerated his toxic personalities.

I always dated men who were emotionally unavailable, toxic or egotistical because it was exciting to try my best to win their love. And in the end, I was the one who felt used, abused and hurt.


Now I am finally settled with a man who really lives me and cares about me. He is kind, loving and passionate. Every little thing he does just shows me how much he loves me. And yet I feel there is unbalance of love in our relationship. I dont show him the same love he always show me. He's the one making more efforts to be close and be passionate.

I think all my past relationships affected me to think the stability, the unconditional love and kindness is boring. Because there is no heartaches, my heart is not racing, I am having sleepless nights thinking if he truly love me or not.

I found love in this man, the love I was chasing for in toxic men, I found it in a kind hearted loving man.
I know I love him. All I want to do it to get over my past and return the same love he shows me every single day."
722,Just a few suggestions to improve your daily life,"Hello everyone, I felt optimistic today and I wanted to share with you guys some of the tips and tricks that I apply in my daily life to improve my energy, my connections, my motivation and my sense of purpose. I'll split those in several areas of interest so that you can check them out more easily, but remember, if you're suffering from a diagnosed mental illness you should definitely seek professional help, no matter how hard or pointless life seems, there's always light at the end of the tunnel and any pain you experience in life can make you stronger and better at helping people with your same issues.

Let's start with 1) Appearance and self-confidence:

\-**Stop comparing people to one another for beauty or attractiveness**. There isn't an universal scale for that, everything is purely subjective. A person that looks ugly or repelling to you might be sexy or desirable for another, or vice versa, that also applies to yourself. Stop saying ""this person is more beautiful than me"", or ""I am uglier than this person"", because that's totally irrealistic and feeds your insecurities, even when you think that you're more attractive than someone you're still encouraging that ""scale of 1-to-10"" mentality than in the end makes you obsess over your physical appearance. You may LIKE someone more than someone else, but again, it's only a matter of personal preference.

\-**Find your niche**. As you accept the fact that beauty is only a matter of taste, you will find out than in today's world modeling agencies look for a lot of different things: there are skinny models, curvy models, fitness models, models with physical disabilities, and so on. My advice is to look up profiles of people with your same body type, and see how confident they look wearing the clothes that they like, how happy they are with their bodies, how much appreciation and how many positive comments they get. This will surely help you to look more positively at your body day by day. In the end, you may still want to change your body, and that's perfectly fine, there are many dietologists, personal trainers and plastic surgeons out there that can help you on your journey, setting up realistic and healthy goals.

\-**Start exercising**. Not to be skinny, not to get the six-pack, but because it's fun, and it will definitely make you feel better and healthier after you do it. Go to the gym, practice a sport, or just find a workout tutorial on youtube, set your own pace and keep doing it sustainably. If you find some exercises too hard, just take a step back, take your time to improve your perfomance, and never feel pressed about doing something you're not comfortable with. Remember, you're doing this to be happier, not to become a professional fitness competitor/model.

2) Relationships and connections:

\-It may seem obvious, but, if you haven't already, **cut off toxic people from your life**. It doesn't matter if it's someone from your family, if it's a friend you've known for your whole lifetime or even your partner. If someone isn't there for you when you need them as you do for them, constantly remarks your insecurities in a ""playful way"" or remembers you how far you are behind them with your career or personal goals, you must cut them off. Spend your time with people that empowers you, not with people that drains your energy and makes you feel bad about yourself. A true friend will tell you the truth even if it hurts, but will never judge you for it, bash it in your face 24/7, or force you to confront things you're not ready to.

\-**Never settle for a partner you're not completely satisfied with**. Sometimes we end up staying with people because we're afraid of leaving them. We don't want them to feel bad and us to feel guilty, or maybe we think that they're the best that we deserve or ""can afford"" at the moment. A relationship like that will totally drain your energies and kill your mood over time. It may sound difficult, but you have to communicate your needs to your partner to have a healthy relationship, and if they don't want to invest any energy in adjusting themselves to your fundamental necessities, than they're not worth it either.

\-**Stop seeing sex as a taboo**. Most people need sex and love sex, sex is awesome and your sex life is one of the things that can have the biggest impact on your mood. You don't want to bring it up on your working place, but it's totally fine and healthy to discuss about sex with your friends and your partner, especially your partner. If you want to experiment something non-vanilla, you should totally ask them, wether they feel like that or not, it will strenghten your bond and make you feel more intimate with each other.

3) Hobbies and career:

\-**Step back from stressing and time-consuming hobbies**. Playing online multiplayer games with no ending and toxic communities, watching junk-TV or mindlessly scrolling through your social media, those are all activities that suck up your free time leaving no space for other activities that can make you grow as a person, and at the end of the day add no value to your life. Choose to read a book, watch a movie, meditate, or even play a single-player game with a deep and inspiring story instead. This will help you brighten up your mood, contribute with healthy stimulis to your daily conversations, and overall improve your general culture that may make you stand out in a particular job interview.

\-**Set up a monthly budget for your hobbies**. Let's say you start collecting miniatures and you're so excited about your new hobby that you want to start it off by spending bucket loads of money on it. That's the first step to losing interest in it, after you've got everything you wanted in little-to-no time your dopamine will quickly start to draw off, and you'll end up selling everything back for less and looking for the next thing to dump your money in. Or instead you could set up a monthly affordable budget that will keep your excitement going over the years, and invest that little extra money you save day by day in a lovely trip with your partner and/or friends.

\-Even if you're working to pay the bills, **make sure to keep chasing your dreams**. Many times in life we find ourselves working to exhaustion in a job that we only need to make a living out of it. That's perfectly fine, and it may actually help you find yourself passionate about things that you didn't think you would ever care about. But while you do that, make sure to take some time to nurture that inner child within you, to pursue that dream job you always wanted. That will help you perform better at work and fill you with a sense of determination and purpose that can bring you anywhere in life. Also, it's perfectly fine if you don't know what your  ""vocation"", or ""dream job"" is yet, each of us is different and we all find that at a different time in our lives. Just keep doing things you enjoy and it will eventually come to you.

And that's basically it for now. Let me know what you think and how you feel about it, if it helped brighten up your day a little in such a difficult time, it would mean so much to me. Take care of yourselves and enjoy life!"
723,I always act impulsive and I hate myself so much for it,"My shit personality keeps pushing everyone away because I feel like everyone is out to get me even though that's clearly not the case. On Christmas eve I told my best friend that I don't trust him, that I don't want his help and that I want him to leave me alone, also insulted him. Something I immediately regretted afterwards but I was too ashamed of myself to apologise. Yesterday I deleted a friend of mine from discord after he refused to tell me to kill myself, insulting him aswell. My behaviour makes 0 sense and I hate myself so much for it. I lost so many people in my life thanks to my personality and behaviour. I don't know how to fix it though. Everytime anyone tries to be supportive I turn into an ass.. I despise everything about me

Sorry but I really need to get this out, it's 1 pm for me right now and I haven't slept all night and day because all these thoughts are just driving me crazy :/"
724,I might have hallucinated last night. Should I be worried?,"Not sure if this is the right sub but last night when I was trying to sleep I kept “hallucinating” every time I closed my eyes. I’m not sure if hallucination is the right word cuz I didn’t actually see anything weird but whenever I closed my eyes I could feel the presence of other people. And I mean literally feel. I could feel them breathing on my face, trying to kiss me, licking my eyeballs(?), and other weird and uncomfortable things. It was Andy really scary since I know they’re not real but I’m wondering if I should be concerned, I’ve never experienced anything like this before and I have no previous history of mental health issues although I have been under a lot of stress lately."
725,Overwhelmed by my own achievements,"So, 2020 was very stormy year for me. I managed to strike a promotion at work. Got myself in the best shape of my life. Managed to help my family financially by selling a property for a price 10x higher than what is normal for the market right now. Got an amazing caring girlfriend and started working with a financial consultant that will help me invest and my money smart. On top of it all I received a contract offer by one of the biggest fashion agencies in my country. 
GREAT FOR YOU! You might say...yes. BUT... I'm starting to feel anxious about this. I started overthinking what if I get fired from my new job? What if I screw up and loose all my money? Suddenly I feel anxious about signing a contract in the show biz which I am very well familliar with that it is quite limitting. I started wanting out of the relationship realising that I just struggle to adapt to all the new things that happen right about now.
How can I overcome this and actually enjoy life? Because I'm starting to hate everything at the moment."
726,(18m) I'm finding it very hard to cope with my anxiety and intrusive thoughts and focus on myself because of my crush.,"Okay so I've had problems with anxiety and depression for a while but one of the things I am finding it really hard to cope with at the moment is having a crush and also having anxiety. I developed a crush on my friends (19f). I'd say we are quite close and good friends (she almost certainly doesn't like me back) but I am finding it very hard to have a normal friendship with her as having a crush on her is really making my anxiety spiral out of control. Whenever I get any sort of notification I immediately feel a rush of anxiety and dread in my stomach and have to immediately check if it is her. With most of my friends, I can see that they have sent me a message and feel fine ignoring it and replying when it is more convenient. I can't do that if she texts me. I have to immediately stop what I am doing and text her back. This can be a quite distressing feeling. I can't wait a few minutes as I will be some overcome with anxiety. 

When she does text me, I feel a huge sense of anxiety and dread and tend to during the conversation. She's never been unkind to me but I dread having a conversation with her and then ruminating on it after it ends and constantly wondering if I said something wrong even though I probably never do as she keeps texting me again. 

Even when I am on my own I find my mind constantly wandering off and thinking about her and somehow it always feels very urgent so I find it difficult to stop. She's usually one of the first things I end up thinking about when I wake up and it fills me with anxiety. I tend to think about her extremely often and sometimes it feels like it's all the time. Often I end up thinking about what it would be like to be in a relationship with her and sometimes I have sexual thoughts which can be very upsetting because it makes me feel like I am objectifying her and also the fact that it will never happen makes me upset. I'm trying to distract myself whenever these thoughts come up but I find it hard as they keep coming up. Even when I somehow manage not to think about her I still feel can't help but wonder what she would think of what I am doing. 

In moments of extreme anxiety I've thought about telling her how I feel and maybe trying to break it off but I never feel like I have the strength. 

I wish I could look at her the same way I view my other friends. I don't constantly think about them and feel fine taking some time for myself but I feel like she is always on my mind and I'm somehow irrationally scared of upsetting her and I don't know how to deal with these feelings and coping with them. I hate how attached I am to her and hate that my brain has done this to me. It feels like such a huge burden and I don't know how I am ever going to get over it. I feel like when I'm in my 20s and 30s I'll still be mourning the fact that I could never be with her. These feelings just make me feel like I will never be happy and content in my own self and I really don't want to be alive if this is what I'm constantly feeling all the time. Does anyone have any advice to help cope with these feelings and focus on myself again?"
727,Still suffering a year after a breakup,"I have been single for just over a year now and I still can’t get the thought of my ex out of my head or the feeling that something is missing. It’s like I’m obsessed, but why am I... We was so toxic, on and off for about 3 years. he never liked me going out with friends, he hated most of my friends. He would go days without speaking to me, constantly splitting up with me if he was in a mood and just generally treated me like shit. So why do I still think about him and miss what we had even though it wasn’t good? I suffer from anxiety and depression and I have tried to keep myself busy etc but I still feel the exact same. It’s like I wake up and relive it every day and feels like it’s getting harder not any easier. I’m just desperate to forget him and live a normal life"

729,I can't be alone with myself,"Hello, I hope to write in the right place I'm not sure how to use this, I saw that a lot of people here have found a solution to their problems so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm an extrovert, although I'm young I think I'm quite successful and yes I have a lot of self-confidence, besides I have OCD (i don't show that in public only when I'm alone), it's very hard for me to be alone and think about myself lately, the reason for that most people will probably think it's stupid but it's one girl. I was in a relationship for a couple of months, that girl talked every day about how she likes me but I personally didn't want to believe that because I didn't won't to be hurt (she didn't know that) everything was great and one day we just stopped talking and after a while we decided to break up because she come out of a long relationship and does not want to have the obligation to call someone every day, it hurt me a lot because I have never pressured her in any sense, I have not had such problems before, at the moment it is very difficult for me to focus, I keep thinking that I'm not good enough, my whole personality has changed, I respect her decision, but I still can't accept that someone made a fool of me and doesn't won't to admit that, because I think people's opinion can't change over night. I'm very kind person and I would help anyone but right now I don't know how to help myself. I hope I didn't offend anyone with this, this is honestly the first time I've opened up to someone, I've had a lot of problems with that in the past and I hope someone will be able to help me. I wish everyone all the best."
730,"This is a song I wrote called feelings, i wrote this during a real struggle in my life. hope you enjoy","Sad, lost, misunderstood, having to deal with everyone being rude.
Depressive thoughts, anxiety ridden fears, its so hard when you have a group of vicious peers.
The sun comes up its a brand new day, am I always going to have to feel this way.
I can't get up, the tears won't dry, ""you're so lazy yea thats what they cry""

They don't understand these feelings no
They don't understand these feelings no!
They don't understand these feelings no!!
Well fuck em anyway. 

Being so negative really takes its toll, pass the blunt tray I need to fucking roll. 
The journey I've taken has been some ride, but I also need some help on my side.
I can't deal with these emotions anymore, going crazy and slamming doors, these feelings have lasted far to long and that's why I've come to write this song. 

They don't understand these feelings no
They don't understand these feelings no!
They don't understand these feelings no!!
Well fuck em anyway. 

Taking a drag on my cigarette, feel trapped as fuck in this private let, its time to get my ass in gear, ""you can't do it mandy"" oh fuck we're back here 

They don't understand these feelings no
They don't understand these feelings no!

731,Thriving with pandemic restrictions,"Is it wrong or a sign of mental illness when I have been enjoying the restrictions of the pandemic? I don’t look forward to the end of it like all others I have listened to. 
I am actually kind of sad by thinking of everything is by the end of this year back to normal. 
I have deeply respect and feel sorry for those whose lives have been ruined by COVID or those who have lost loved ones to COVID. I don’t like the disease at all - I am just actually enjoying the restrictions. And want to stay isolated for ever. 
I work from home and live with spouse and two teenagers and have no desire of meeting with anybody."
732,I'm Confused,"TW// Mentions of Self Harm, S*icide, and S*icidal thoughts.

I used to be sure, so sure something was wrong, so sure because I felt sad, pissed at the smallest things like parents laughter intercepting me while I watched TV. I woke up every known again feeling like a different person, feeling the world in a different way. After a while I'd get used to the new, not necessarily good way, of seeing the world, the ""new"" me. Dissociaion plauged my existence, leading me to have mental breakdowns at the repetitive, scary experience. 

Therapy started, Covid19 prevented any in person sessions, whether it was this or not the therapist was  bad to say the least. Add Tafe into this mix, and everything broke down. I broke down. I quite Tafe. But it was too late I'd already sunk into the easy yet terrible cycle of dropping work. Procrastination became not doing assignments in the first place. Self harm, cutting; drawing blood. Thoughts of suicide, yet as blood flows I get used to the feeling of unreality. 

I started going to a new therapist, a private one, she gets the job done. That's when my confusion starts. I assume it's normal to be confused as the therapist picks my mind but everything seems backwards. My intentions aren't revealed as I partially lie my way through sessions. I dont know what my intentions are, overthinking prevents such clarity. One day I woke up, I didnt feel particularly good but I didnt feel bad, progress. Or was it? I couldn't tell anymore. Simple cutting turned into thrusting scissors in my arm. Control. Therapy techniques. ~Positive Thinking ~. Yet I can't shake the feeling that its what I want. I'm addicted to a pain that's been replaced by numbness. I dont know what to think. My actions havent changed, yet I feel eerily fine. Should I take it as a win? Of course I should, but questions don't leave so easily. 

Trauma from my sister attempting suicide, EMDR, just to discover PTSD or ASD wasn't the problem. So I'm left here, using pain and sadness like an art form.  I think of myself somewhat highly as my therapist enquires why hugs bore me. 

Was anything even wrong in the first place? I'm certainly here. 

I'm certainly Sane."
733,5 Amazing Things to Help With Depression That All Should Know,"Depression is: ""Lack of energy to do something"" / ""Feeling bad for not doing something"" / ""Not being able to take care of yourself"".

**Making things easier is not a reason to live.** When you repeat the same task enough times, you won't have to think about doing it anymore. Your body will just move on it's own. Doing that task will require less energy and you will be able to achieve more. You may even forget if you brushed your teeth or not.

**Doing things that excite you will give you energy and reason to do less exciting things.** It's easier to start doing things that excite you. If you don't find excitement in your life then maybe you have not tried enough new things? Maybe the things change over time? Maybe you can't find a way to try new things in your situation? That's what the Internet/people are for.

**You take care of yourself by taking care of your basic needs.** I feel like a lot of people don't know this from Maslow's hierarchy of needs. ""Food, water, warmth, rest, security, safety, intimate relationships, friends, prestige and feeling of accomplishment, achieving one's full potential, including creative activities."" They can manifest as cooking, work, relationships, excercise, hobbies or whatever but thats up to the individual to choose based on their options.

**You start things by thinking about the pros and cons of your actions.** Then take one step at a time. If you can get out of bed then you can work to make yourself stronger. If you forget these things then you have to remind yourself.

**People can help you find your options.** If you can't find a solution to your problems from these guidelines then talking to someone else can help you. You may need problem solving skills that require some type of medical degrees and a 300 IQ genius but two regular people can still be more helpful together than that guy.

Are there any depression experts here that agree/disagree with my thinking on how to cure depression?

735,I'm starting to get tired of my brother,"He has no idea what personal space is anymore, he doesn't use his bedroom for anything. He sleeps in the living room which normally wouldn't be a problem but he also uses it for his stuff, the couches and chairs are now tables for everything he owns. He even uses my room for his stuff. He took my guitar without my permission multiple times and yesterday when I took it back I found carvings in it.

Well my alternator died and had to buy a new one. And yesterday I hit ice and rolled my truck. my truck was my home and now I m screwed.

739,This is ruining my mental health,"It makes me really uncomfortable to talk about this but people say the best thing you can do about mental health is talk about it and ask about it so here I go...

So for as long  is I can remember I’ve been overthinking stuff (I’m 14m) and have I got minor anxiety, you know simple stuff like constantly checking the door is locked and constantly feeling for my phone in my pocket ETC: however recently it took a turn for the worse and my brain keeps taking these things that I have done in the past and twisting then and telling me I will never have a perfect life because I’ve done these things and no-one will ever love me because of these things and I’m living a lie.

Recently however one specific thing came up that has been tormenting me and making me depressed regularly and just wanting to sleep all the time so I don’t have to think about it and that was a thing that happened two years ago. 

So o first started masturbating when I was 11 and it was fine until I found out that people do it whilst looking at stuff that they like the look of so I started doing that and I eventually found that I liked gymnastics and leotards (idk why)
I have since stopped this and now only imagine stuff but recently the memories of it came back to me and I got a horrible realisation

I was thinking about it and i then realised that some of the people in the gymnastics videos and pictures and stuff were younger than me (I should note that when I did this i was only attracted the the gymnastics not the people doing them)

After realising this I feel sick about myself for ever doing something like that. When I was going it I don’t even know if I realised what I was doing and that it was wrong as my family NEVER talked about this stuff.

For the past month now all I can think about is how I did that and I’ll never have a clean conscience and I’m going to be alone forever and if I tell anyone I will go to jail.

It feels weird to have to state this but I am only attracted to people my age and older now and have been like that once again as far as I can remember

Do I deserve this punishment?
How can I stop this?
Are the thoughts right? Am I a horrible person?

Thank you for taking the time to read this and thanks for helping me in advance

740,How do you choose between mental health and money for finances?,"Both my partner and I struggle with mental health. Our job just makes it worse. Covid just makes it worse on top of that. Our job lets us take a two week unpaid leave if we get uncomfortable, and my partner got uncomfortable so wanted to take a leave. Said it would also probably help their mental health. This upset me, because I know we can't afford one of us to take that time off. What should someone do in this situation? The finances and work stresses me the heck out, but covid and work stresses my partner out."
741,How should I prepare for the argument?,"Recently my dad found out I had a bunch of missing assignments in one of my classes, I could tell how mad he was just through text. I mean I never really see people type fuck in a text before unless it's a joke. I barely ever hear him say it, that's usually my mom. I told him I would try, and he said I had to do it, not try. I couldn't do it. I had 3 weeks and I got like 3 assignments done out of the 41 (we get like 2-5 a day). Any time I went to do them I would open the computer, and then either close it, or just start at it for 30min. I didn't have the energy for it or any motivation. I mean why am I even doing it, just so I can live a worse, more stressful meaningless life. Ever time my parents confront me about missing assignments, it gets really bad. Last time I felt so drained and empty, and I felt like they hated me to the point where I just needed to get out of there for a little bit. I started to walk down the driveway, and my mom screamed at me to get back inside, then told me that it was just missing assignments and that I have no reason to walk off like that. The rest of the day I just layed down in my bed telling myself how much of a disappointment I was. Then at night, I always say goodnight and tell them I love them, no matter how mad I would be I always say it. I wasn't mad at them anyways, I was mad at myself. When I told my mom I love her so just sat there and asked if I actually did and nothing else. I was completely broken all that night. She didn't talk to me for a week too. It's my life anyway, like, just let me mess it up and move on, because life I guess.

That class I had a c+ in btw.

The class now, im going to have a D I'm sure, and it is already a C. And I got a 0 on the exam. And I told my dad I would do it. My mom doesn't know, because he found out before Christmas, and I didnt want to ruin my mom's mood. Now, I'm not only scared of what my mom will say, but my dad too, last time my dad listened to me after my mom went to her room. Now I have zero support. They don't know what this is like. They are going to say that I spent all the time I should've been doing the work playing games. Little do they know I've lost interest in my favorite hobbies and now spend my days sleeping and laying down scrolling through my phone, thinking about how bad the next day will be, just waking up to more life. Normally I try to fight back in these arguments, I don't think I could bring myself too this time. It's just pointless trying to explain everything. For once I tried, and just couldn't do it. Everything they say about me will be right. ""You're just fucking lazy"" they'll say, and ""just do the fucking work"". They expect me to be able to get all A's all the time, like there isn't a single class I can't do. I would get a B and they'll just tell me I'm not studying enough.

I'm afraid of how this argument will affect me and my relationships with my parents. And if they take my phone, I don't know what I'll do. Last time I had an argument, I was going insane, I was crying, laughing, and yelling all at the same time, i don't know what was happening to me, I just couldn't stop, I was just so mad at everything me, my lack of ability to do any stupid thing, and my parents for making assumptions.

If they take my phone, instead of spending all day on my phone, I will be spending all day laying down with me. When I am alone with nothing to do, my thoughts take over me. I rant for hours about random stuff I can think of, or I beat myself up over old stuff, or just for being me 

What do I do about this? My dad is the only person I feel comfortable talking to about my problems, I'm afraid of being alone. Is there someway of going about this that doesn't involve telling them about my (self-diagnosed) depression? I know I should tell them, but I can't, at least for now."
742,Finally a silver lining,"Hi everyone! 

My mental health over the past year has been steadily declining until I recently hit “the wall”. I felt so cloudy and dark and just overall terrible. Last week I tried to finally get medication to help with my depression and anxiety and was told I basically couldn’t because I didn’t have insurance. I also was feeling pretty down because, due to the pandemic, I haven’t seen my family in over a year. 

Later that same day my state insurance FINALLY pulled through so I can get some help and yesterday I got the go ahead from my family to go home and purchased tickets today. 

Before you come for me for traveling in a pandemic, please know all precautions and risks have been discussed and the best choices for everyone involved have been discussed and agreed upon. 

I finally can see the sun shining through my dark clouds and I feel relief on the horizon! I am just so happy and wanted to share with someone. 

TL;DR after months of worsening depression I can finally access medication and go see my family for the first time in over a year"
743,is there something wrong with me?,"i am 17. i see all my “friends” as acquaintances, because i not able to form a connection with any of them, despite them thinking we are friends. i also fake my personality around people and can mold myself into whatever i know they would like. it is exhausting having to act for hours on end.

as my true self, i rarely outwardly show my emotions, and my emotions feel muted. i find myself faking emotions because i know how i am supposed to react to situations. i know how to make people think they are close to me, when in reality they barely know anything about me. i give them superficial aspects about myself because i dont want them knowing the deeper things. i also want to be able to leave friendships at any point so i dont want them to get too attached to me. 

i hate the idea of relationships. i might be afraid of commitment? i think another part of it is that i feel that i will just be acting in front of them too, so whats the point of even going through with one? ive also never been able to feel a romantic attraction to anybody, but i probably just havent found the right person yet. i get annoyed with emotional people and i have a difficult time feeling remorse when people tell me sad things about their lives. i have a problem with smiling or laughing during inappropriate times, such as when someone is yelling at me or sharing bad news. 

i think i have something wrong with my emotions? are most people seriously genuine, or are they faking it too, like me? i have opinions of people in my mind and may hate someone but i will act like i like them, but i think everybody does that. i do feel emotions though, dont get me wrong: i can cry and i can laugh, i can get angry and scared. people can hurt my feelings and people can make me laugh.

i dont know how to explain this part very well, but i see others as odd. i see them as separate from myself. i cant relate well with them and it makes me feel lonely. i am not depressed though, i just feel kind of empty a lot of the time. i know this whole thing is a jumbled mess of words, but if anyone could give me their opinion i would appreciate it."

746,I don't want to blame my mental health...,"... but at the same time I don't think my struggles are all personal failings. It's hard to distinguish what's a personal falling, what's a symptom that I can push through, and what's a symptom I can't push through. I guess this applies to symptoms from mental health afflictions and physical health afflictions. It doesn't help that from a 3rd-person perspective, my symptoms present themselves as personal failings. I wish more people would understand that, personal failing or not, I'm not lazy, spoiled, lacking discipline, or even enjoying being incapacitated. I'm just trying my best, and my best is barely functioning."

748,Is journaling/taking pictures and notes for yourself just as bad as using social media?,"I hear people say social media is bad because you are often thinking about “I have to post this/write this/document this” instead of just experiencing your life.

I can’t really comprehend why this is so unhealthy but people say it is. 

Is journaling and taking pictures for yourself, the same thing as using social media? And if so, is it just as unhealthy.?"
749,Does anyone else have a serious dependency on music to get through the day?,"I really need to listen to music to get through the day. Whenever I'm through a rough day I'm up listing to sad playlist. When I'm happy/in a good mood I listen to uplifting songs which put me in a good mood. At times I connect the Bluetooth speaker and listen to music in the shower. Music is really like a drug. I'm addicted to it to such a point that I cannot function without it and it's the only thing that calms me down. Music is only thing you can rely on. Your friends and family may not take your mental health seriously but music will always be there for you. On your good days and on your bad days. At times even when I'm studying, I put on headphones and listen to Lofi beats which help me calm and concentrate on my studies. We may be of different race, religion and nationality but music is a universal language that unites us all. 😊

751,I wrote this poem to get stuff out of my head and I thought maybe someone could relate ? NSFW,"My cold metal saviour kisses my soft skin.  
Demons burn my arm as death begins . 

I inhale the smoke from the ashes of my childhood memories .
When I’m high on nostalgia, just let me be.

The crimson river flows, trickling down my arm. 
The drugs have kicked in now , all I feel is calm. 

Severing my purple veins with pieces of my broken heart.
My blood shot eyes close , Not long until I depart . 

I laugh as the life leaves my body , cradled by the reaper.
Pink Skin turns porcelain as I get weaker. 

Laying in the deafening silence , waiting for the sirens. 
Death caresses me and carries me into the horizon .

Don’t pull me out of this car wreck I’m bleeding so much . 
Please just remember my smile and my touch .

Angeles take me , I’m ready to go home.  
Just promise to hold my hand so I’m not alone . 

Dance with my ghost , lie a flower on my grave . 
I’m just one soul God couldn’t save .

755,"Is my anxiety seem abnormal? If so, should I seek assistance?","I've been wondering this for a while. Since childhood I have always had somewhat of a fear of approaching authority figures who I don't know well such as high school teachers and college professors out of fear of their wrath. I would often take bad grades in high school just because I didn't want to confront my teacher about them and outright gave up trying to get one of my honor cords for my graduation gown because the lady at the front desk looked and acted so cross with me. Today was particularly stressful example for me because I've been trying to manage my very first job and juggle classes/tech issues with completing work at the same time and nearly kissed my philosophy class goodbye by missing a quiz that was required to remain in attendance. I got a very irritated sounding email and it frightened me to my core (one of the statements ""What did you do last week for this class? Anything?"" Really stung.) and even made my hands shake despite the fact my teacher still let me stay in class and complete the work. I'm still a bit jittery and don't even wanna move from my seat to get breakfast. I should be glad I'm still in the class but I'm not, I'm too afraid I'll miss/fail something again and it'll be the final straw. 

Every time someone gets irritated with me (excluding my mother) and acts even slightly cross about an action I take or a request frightens me deeply that at points I've even wanted to cry and have cried before over situation that should at worst leave a normal person feeling mildly disappointed. I've even once teared up because a teacher encouraged me to seek help from him since I was having difficulty with their class (he wasn't even a mean teacher, he was actually quite fun I was just so ashamed). It drives me insane how anxious I get over even the tiniest little things, I can think rationally about the situation and deem it minor in my mind but no matter how hard I try I will often still feel anxious several minutes after the event has passed if there is a negative reaction despite a positive outcome. Even when I calm down I am often still terrified something I do will mess things up. I'm starting to think my anxiety (along with some issues with my physical behavior and my lacking attention span) is a bit more serious than I thought and not just an issue of needing to learn to grow up and deal with situations properly. I don't wanna waste my money though if it's just me being over analyzing of the situation. So what do y'all think? Should I consider getting a professional examination? I'm unsure."
756,"How do I plan for burnout, while also hiding the burnout from others?","I’ve been stressed lately due to overworking and other things. I think I’m at the point where I’m not gonna escape the eventual burnout. It’s just a matter of being prepared and wondering when its going to happen.

So how do I prepare myself? What loose ends do I need to tie before I don’t care for an unforeseeable amount of time? I’ve already prepared some stuff that will release online on a schedule (I make content online). And how do I do it without anyone in my family catching on that something is wrong (I know I shouldn’t hide it, but I’d rather not let them know)."
757,Perfection is killing me mentally,"I (F, 32) have really been struggling with this lately. I just need some place to Anonymously get it out because every day I feel like crying and my therapist helps for a time, but I often go back to my hole of self pity and loathing.

Growing up, I never felt wanted.

 My father left when I was 7... The details are hazy... My sister (45, from my father's first Marriage) said it was because my mother refused to work with him on co-parenting... My mother says he was too busy being an alcoholic to care about having kids. He died from cancer when I was 18. 
My mother is, what I believe is a textbook Narssisist. She left her first husband and three kids because she got bored and wanted more money. And throughout my childhood often picked and proaded at me for small things. I was a social kid, I wanted to be in everyone's business... So the way my mom shut me up, was to feed me.

 Eventually, food became my coping mechanism. I became obese for a child in America and doctors warned my mom to help me with my eating habits... The way she helped me was what hurts me today... ""You would be pretty if you could lose some weight"".... ""You have such a cute face, if only it wasn't so chubby""...  I often thought... People don't like me because I am fat... And because I am fat, I am an ugly person. 
I hid under baggy clothes. I hid behind books. I wanted to take dance classes and Karate, but my mom didn't want to waste the money because kids would ""just make fun of me""...  
My mom would often compare me to my sister's ""why can't you just be like that sister that does nothing all day""

My mother also made fun of certain things I did... I tried playing the clarinet... ""Ugh your practicing is making the dogs howl""... *The dogs only howled once, all other times I practiced in the closet and this still bothered her*
I never cleaned right. I was told ""I am never coming to your house when you grow up... It's going to be a pig sty"" ... 

I just tried being nice. I figured, if I can't friends with my looks, at least I can by being nice.

 I began questioning my sexuality in high school... My aunt, a staunch conservative and very concerned about my journey to hell, pressed my mom to send me to church to expell those demons from me... I began to struggle with depression and anger issues. I tried to kill myself, but rather than call medical professionals... She called the church pastor to pray over me...  


Now.. at 32.
I am married. 5 years now.
I am told I am pretty by my husband every day.
Logically. I believe it. 
I am finally at what most would consider a healthy weight for an adult female in her 30s.
Emotionally. I am still a wreck. 
I gain 5 pounds... It's the end of the world. I am constantly dieting and working out... If I get fat again I will be ugly and my husband will leave me. 

Logically... All people of all sizes are beautiful and wonderful human beings. 

But me... Not me. 

My house, despite me working from home and tidying up on my breaks and while I wait for programs to run, is a pig sty... I am constantly thinking ""what can be cleaned today? what am I not cleaning?""...  I feel like I am constantly cleaning and I sometimes feel like my husband doesn't care... But then I remember...
My husband has given up trying to help me because I just reclean. I feel bad because I should be able to let him do the laundry his way. 

He wants me to help him cook... But I am terrified he's going to criticize my cooking (he's a great chef, I burn toast)... 

I am at a loss on how to make this better for me. 

I have no desire to talk this over with my family or my mom. She just turns it into a pity party for herself... 

 My therapist has given me some things to occupy those thoughts that pop into my head. But I am not sure how to keep it up. 

I am always afraid to not be good enough. 

Because of this. I have decided never to have kids. Because I won't be a good mom to them. I could never be a good mom... 

I hate what the pains of my childhood has done to me... 

I don't know why I am posting here. I don't know what to gain from this. I just want to cry when I can't be perfect. 

I want it to stop."

What’s it called when you re-live past events, and think about what would have happened if you had said or done things differently.

Mine are worse in some areas, and hers are worse in different areas. They are both pretty similar though. But the thing that has been eating me alive is that I feel like she always has more things to talk about, or like she can one up me on any experience I have to talk about. We both have PTSD, but hers is much worse, and she has gone through some horrible things. I have had some horrible things happen to me too, but I feel like it’s not justified anymore. I feel like she sees me as infantile when I talk about it. Like I should be grateful and that I haven’t truly experienced that bad.

It’s not even just mental health issues though. Just in general experiences. I haven’t really dated anyone before, and she has dated a bunch of people. She has a bunch of drama in her life, and I don’t anymore. She has just done so much more than me, and more interesting too. Day by day, week by week, month by month.

i've always done quite good at school not bad not perfect, i always had just one friend which didn't do very good at school and was sometimes a giant \*ssh\*le. around 1-3 months ago the friendship just kinda ended because i became sick of it. so then i didn't have any friends on my whole school(around 2.5K people on the secondary school) i recently talked to. before that happened i already was very unpopular and thus being left out a lot. and that was sadly (and as far as you can notice in the covid time) still the case.

768,Scared to tell my parents I'm struggling,"Hey guys, I don't have anyone I can talk to about this irl so posting here, hope that's okay. 

I (22F) have been struggling with my mental health for a while, like since I was a kid. I realised pretty early on that my brain doesn't function like everyone around me. My earliest memory of this is when I was around 9 or 10, I was telling my brother and mom that I spend literally hours making up stories in my head instead of sleeping at night, they both didn't take me seriously and just laughed at me at the time and that just stuck with me I guess and after that I never tried telling anyone anything, I kept it all bottled up.

It wasn't that bad till I was around 19. I was at a pretty expensive college on scholarship (which was awarded on the basis of grades). My family is not very well off and my parents are often worried about money, so we would not have been able to afford the college without the scholarship. When my exams came, I messed them up because I could no longer get my brain to focus on literally anything. There was a six month gap between my exams and when I'd get to know if I lost the scholarship or not, and I was in hell those six months. I had my first bad depressive episode which lasted about 3 months. I was a shell of a person, barely eating or talking. I never fully recovered from that. 

I mean, I don't think I'm depressed, I don't relate to most of the symptom, but my I have a very hard time trying to make my brain do stuff. If I'm focused on something, I'll be FOCUSED. But the problem is I rarely focus on things that actually need to be done. For example, I'm applying to colleges for my master's right now and I missed the deadline to apply for my dream college. I paid the fee, gave the entrance exam, but didn't fill the form with my personal details (it's not like I forgot, I set multiple reminders a day on my phone for over a week and was constantly mentally shouting at myself to do it) but I just couldn't make myself physically do it so I'm basically no longer eligible for the course. Yup. Cried for 20 minutes straight then went right to not caring even a bit, which might actually be scarier than caring too much. And it's not just the big, scary things I put off, it's everything, I literally even put off things like putting my phone to charge until it's at 1% or even going to sleep until I reach the point where I almost pass out.

I realised I have pretty much always been like this, but it wasn't bad enough for me to notice, I always just thought I was lazy. Now that I have, I look back at my life and realise how many opportunities I've let go of because I just basically couldn't make my brain do it. I'm a smart kid, I always topped my classes in school and got good results on aptitude tests with bare minimum or no preperation, but I went to an average college and did the most basic, generic degree because I literally did not believe I had it in me to even try getting in the good ones, and it seemed to much effort to even try. I think about all this now and it makes me SO MAD thinking about what I could've done or achieved if I wasn't like this.

I want to seek help, but I don't know how. I'm not close enough to my dad to talk about it and my mom doesn't believe in mental health. I was so close to telling her last week, but we were talking about college and I said I was thinking of applying to a counselling psychology course and she said ""don't do it, you'll have to be around crazy people all the time"" and I literally almost started crying. I don't think she's actively trying to be mean, we just live in a country where mental health is pretty much a taboo and no one talks about it so that's just what she's learnt. But now I don't know how to talk to either of them about it, and since they're pretty protective of me (they always have to know where I am and with whom, and whenever I have any plans 99% of the time my dad drives me there) so I can't really go get help on my own.

This was just a little rant because I had no idea where else I could direct it and just typing this all out made me feel so much better. If anyone has read this till the end, thank you and I appreciate you 💛"

Now since then I'm working full time have two children 14 and 12, my eldest is on the spectrum and is functional but at diminished capacity(think acting almost like 10 - 12 year old) my other child is trying to function as best as they can. My wife has basically been bed ridden since September, children go to school and as I said I work full time.

My day starts at 3am when I get up make lunches sort laundry get my eldest pulls together. I leave at 5am, I call kids at 6 to make sure their up and going to school 99% of the time they go wife gets dizzy spells now when she stands upright for two long so she doesn't move around much and gets vertigo. I work a seriously physical job as well I'm home at 6pm kids are home I make dinner so the dishes clean all that jazz and finally crash out around 11. 

I'm starting to break down, I don't have the option of me time at all, I can't seem to slow down or stop. The hospital won't take hwy in for any serious testing because of whatever reason. And I'm trying to loose weight (gained alot of it when I tried an easier job) . I feel. Lost like depression but colder if that makes any sense, I'm always on edge and I don't want to talk to anyone I know because they really don't care, wife's family are either stuck up or to self involved to even check up on us. My anxiety riddled brain is barely functioning and I'm running on auto most of the time.I break down and cry when no one is around because I don't want the kids to see me like that. I stress about everything because I'm worried about literally everything

Thanks for letting me rant"
773,Interoceptive Exposure Therapy,"Interoceptive exposure therapy is a type of behavioural treatment that can help us overcome a range of mental health issues, including panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder.

During interoceptive exposure therapy, a person is subjected to the sensations that trigger their anxieties – but crucially, under controlled conditions. With the guidance and support of their therapist, the person will then be encouraged to focus on the sensation and assess it objectively.

The goal is to help people to learn that most basic physical sensations are manageable, while repeated exposure to the feeling helps to normalise it. Gradually, this combined approach allows new neurological pathways to be created so the brain no longer interprets the sensations as a threat.

I now feel shitty and I'm afraid to post in general on Facebook or to reach out to people I've been ignoring. I feel ashamed. I feel like my head is throbbing and my thoughts are starting to both accelerate.   


I'm not sure how to stop this and calm down given I did mess up, and might mess up again"
776,"I called the Suicide Hotline for the first time today, and the lady on the other end seemed to be in a hurry to finish the call.","I was having a rough time and suicidal thoughts were starting to creep in. I felt like there wasn't anyone I could talk to and the thoughts were starting to become more prevalent. I wasn't planning to act on them, but the thoughts were starting to become really invasive. I called the Hotline for the first time and the lady on the other end was very nice and genuinely seemed to care as I sobbed endlessly, but when she asked me I had an actual plan to kill myself and I said no, she seemed like she was in a hurry to move on to the next call. 

Nothing feels more invalidating then having someome try to hurry along the conversation after it seemed like they genuinely cared. I understand that I wasn't planning to act, but the thoughts were there and who knows what would've happened an hour later."
777,They say living is harder than dying. I'm willing to gamble that.,"Due to this whole pandemic, I'm out of a job and struggling financially. I don't see any point in living anymore. People say it'll get better and stay strong but I know for a fact it won't. I went through a suicidal phase and at one point I did try killing myself when I was home alone in a foreign country. I didn't go through it since I didn't want to put my mom and sister thought it. I just don't see any point I'm living anymore. Right now the situation is crazy all over and whatever dreams and aspirations I had, I can certainly kiss them goodbye. I would do drugs and alcohol to easey pain but I'm sober and don't go down that road. There's no point in continuously struggling and living in pain. At this point my lifey life seems like a never ending life race. Even if I end my life tonight, I know it's a cowardly thing to do and my family will go through a lot but I'd be out of my misery and it's certainly better than living in pain, adenial and disappointment. I know I won't amount to anything in life so it's better to quit right now rather a life full of suffering.

778,Should I tell my counselor that I used to have a lot of suicidal thoughts?,"There are a lot of reasons why I don’t think it would be a good idea. I don’t think I ever SERIOUSLY considered taking my life but it was something that I genuinely thought about every second of every day for a few months or years I honestly don’t know. I was at my lowest about two years ago, and I saw my counselor at this time, but I never told her about it. She’s also asked me once if I’ve ever considered because we were talking about someone I used to know who attempted. I lied to her face and I’m scared that she would be disappointed in herself for not knowing or for me not feeling comfortable with telling her. Because I really don’t want that, and I have no idea how she would react.

I also live in Sweden and it’s this whole system that I’m in and if she thinks that I might do something she’s obligated to act upon it and tell my parents, I also think that I wouldn’t be able to see her anymore in some cases because I would have to see a psychiatrist at this place called BUP. 

I also have sleeping pills at home, that has been prescribed to me and I’m scared that they would be taken away from me or that my parents would have to control them or something, and they cannot know about how my mental state used to be. 

I’m also thinking that I turn 18 in may and I don’t think she has to contact my parents then so maybe I’ll tell her then idk.

She’s also a counselor not a therapist, she’s more there for guidance and we usually discuss problems I have in life, I don’t think that this would be like part of her job.

Honestly I don’t think I will ever tell anyone about it, also because I wasn’t THAT serious it’s just that I know that I thought about it so much that I do think that it “counts” as being a bit suicidal. 

Is it important that I tell her about this or is it unnecessary?"

780,I feel trapped,"I got made redundant in August so I took the first job that was offered to me because I've got bills to pay. But it had 6am starts so I kept my eye out for other jobs, and I found one with my ideal hours. I started last week and it's really not what I expected and I'm even more unhappy than before. I started on antidepressants last week. I don't want to keep doing this job but I can't leave either. I feel so trapped by adult responsibilities. I don't know what to do."
781,"One of the worst things I have experienced is being bullied and harassed by someone else with mental illness, it’s far worse than if a normal person did it.","I’m very wary of specific types of people with mental illness now , I generally avoid all people but when I here certain diagnosis’s of other mentally ill people I steer clear immediately. That’s really sad and awful. I shouldn’t have to fear my own kind."
782,How can I appreciate what I have before it’s gone?,I’ve been thinking about this for a while.
783,Gaslighting,"How can I deal with a gaslighter? Me and my partner have been together for about 6 years now. We have had our issues over the years but have worked through them. Now we have a 15 month old son. Even though I love him more than life itself, lately I find myself feeling guilty, starting to realize the type of life he might have to live if his mother gets her way. 

When we found out we were pregnant, we both immediately started to seek professional help of all sorts to give ourselves and our future son the best possible chance. And for her entire pregnancy and the first six months of our sons life, things were actually pretty damn good. I had so much hope.

The past few months though have been a disaster and are only getting worse. She does such awful things to me and completely denies it. She somehow will spin everything and turn it right around and accuse me of doing it to her.

Everything is my fault. Or her sisters fault. Or her friends fault. Or her doctors fault. Every horrible thing she does to me that she will admit to doing, only happened because of something I did. If only I hadn’t done x them she wouldn’t have done y to me.

We began couples counseling this past weekend. Of course she everything she is telling this therapist is a complete lie. So I have no hope anymore. I feel I’ll only be throwing away the last little bit of money she has left our family.

In the past six months she has completely drained our savings account. Only about $12k. Of course she blames me for our money problems. I have been asking her for almost a year to please sit down and go over a budget with me. I ask her to go over bank statements with me. But she refuses and storms out. And now just this week, money is apparently no longer a problem for us and she won’t talk about it at all.

My only hope is that I can prove to this therapist I am telling her the truth and get her to understand how dire this situation is. Because of course everything I say in therapy she denies. And then spins it and tells the therapist I am the one doing these things.

I really don’t even want to save our relationship anymore. At this point I am only concerned about my son. I am not sure how much more of her mental abuse I can take. I have only been sticking around because this same mental abuse is starting to effect my son. When I am home from work (she is a stay at home mother) I feel like I am always needing to cower over my son to absorb as much of the blows as possible for him. 

If I leave for my own safety and sanity, I will have to leave him behind. Unless I can somehow get an emergency custody order but this will be hard to do. But if I just up and leave for my own well being, she will use this against me and claim abandonment. She will do everything in her power to make sure I don’t get to spend time with my son. Even though I still live them, she already uses my son to hurt me. If she is angry, all of a sudden 7 o clock, when I get home from work and I’m ready to finally play with my son, she is ready to put him down for his new bedtime. 

Or on the weekends, when normally she sleeps until 3pm, all of a sudden she is getting up early this past week or two to play with the baby. Even though for 15 months she has slept in late and gives me this time to play with the baby by myself. But a few weeks ago I told her that I am no longer comfortable being around her. So any free time I do have during the day on the weekends, she makes sure to insert herself into this time that typically has been for me and him only. Knowing that I am uncomfortable. So I have to choose between spending time with her or just removing myself from this horribly uncomfortable situation and giving up time with my son. 

I don’t know how to deal with someone like this. She has never been so detached from reality. 

I am so scared for my son.

All last week, because she has spent our savings, I took on a side job and work six 13 hour days and a few hours on Sunday. Every night I came home and my son was strapped in a chair in front of the tv while she is on the phone in the other room. I began taking pictures of all of his toys as I left the house in the morning. Dozens of toys in every toy box. I would then take pictures when I returned home. And all week, not one toy moved a single cm. 

This mental abuse has progressed with me. And I know it’s going to progress with my son. But I fear it is not enough to get an emergency custody order.

Any advice would be appreciated.


I am sick to my stomach worrying about what will become of my son and my relationship with him. I love him so much, and have tried so hard to do right by him. And so far I have done a good job and I believe I am a great father. And for the past year I have picked up so much of the slack that she has left for me to shoulder alone. I am so tired and desperate and running out of time and patience and hope."
784,"I really struggle with helping others when they feel low. I’m very empathetic so when I experience someone feeling sad, I also become sad, which makes it difficult to offer help, but internally I’m really wanting to help cheer them up. Why could this be?","Please feel free to share ideas on reason why I could be acting this way.

Besides being highly empathic, I’m also highly sensitive. I do also struggle with social anxiety, so maybe that could be a part of why I don’t ‘step in’ and help the person out with my words? 

If someone is crying, there’s no doubt I will start to cry with them. I will hug them to help make them not feel alone, but the hardest part is getting the words out, and the right words. I’m not much of a talker, especially when I’m anxious because it’s hard to think straight, so I guess that makes sense why I’m like hesitant when I feel I should be talking to the person to help them out.

I know talking isn’t always what the other person in distress wants, but I feel its what is expected. Maybe because in my own experiences people have always tried to talk me out of it or to distract me with words. But also I had this amazing friend who knew I wasn’t much of a talker, so when I would get upset, she would just sit with me in silence and rub my arm or leg, which was actually probably more helpful then what words could do. And this was around 5th grade so she was pretty mature for her age honestly. 


My main question is what could’ve caused me to be this way, and also if anyone has experienced &amp; overcame this &amp; how they did it.

All advice is very appreciated and welcomed. 
Thank you in advance."
785,This is probably the last time I ask. Don’t know why,"Lately I’ve been having extreme mood swings. I’ve noticed that I laugh at random things out of nowhere which makes others uncomfortable and myself too. Sometimes I would consider it hysterical laughter at something online I see or just out of nowhere. Other times I don’t want to be around anyone and just ignore everything, like a deep hole of depression. I’ve also been having serious suicidal thoughts and issues. For the last  while I’ve had incidents of hitting myself, punching sharp fences and lately whipping myself hoping I bleed. What can I do. I don’t feel normal and it feels like everyday is a struggle to stat sane and relaxed."

787,my internal monologue doesn’t refer to things i do as singular “I’m gonna do this” “that’s mine” and instead multiple “we’re gonna do this” “that’s ours”,"to preface, i don’t think it’s likely i have any conditions besides social anxiety which i doubt could cause this, but all my friends and family have said that this isn’t how they’re internal monologue talks, for example, when i’m at work and need to refill my water bottle my monologue will say something along the lines of “gotta refill our water bottle” not my, but our? what causes this and does anyone else experience this?"

I’m having anxiety/panic attacks at least once a week and this weekend I had a full blown mental breakdown where I couldn’t think straight and my mind just felt like it was misfiring all over the place and when my husband asked what I wanted for lunch I broke down sobbing because I couldn’t get my brain to stop long enough to focus on what he has just said to me. I felt trapped In my own head and couldn’t escape. 

I have gone undiagnosed and I treated my whole life and I think it’s about time I do something about it. My life isn’t overly stressful and I truly have nothing to be anxious about but i can’t control what is happening to me. What do I do? Where do I go from here?

Some days, I feel extremely ambitious but most days I feel exhausted and don't want to do anything, even the necessary things like taxes or school or work.

796,Do I get to complain?,"I was never physically abused Both my parents love me and take care of me and yet I feel so alone throughout my childhood my mom was unhappy constantly she has bi polar disorder, and my dad was never around and whenever I tried to talk to him he just got annoyed or would give me this ""Your such a weirdo face"" my brother is my half brother and his dad was mentally abusive telling him he wasn't worthwhile and encouraging him to drink ECT there was alot of manipulation so my brother became manipulative and he always caused my mom stress so I hated him. I always would mumble and could never tell stories as a kid (Later I found out I had brain cancer fully recovered) so at school I have few friends and my mom never let me go to friends house or anything else she was molested as a kid so she was over protected when we moved i went to a new school in fourth grade after a few months I kept getting left out or made fun of so I became a loner I would walk around the school yard by myself and would dred anytime we had to pick partners I am also gifted I got good grades even when never trying and slowly started seeing everyone as inferior I think as a way to explain no one liking me. From then until 9th grade I had no real friends even in 6th grade when I was diagnosed and had surgery when I came back no one even knew no one showed up when I was in the hospital I don't know why I think they would I wasn't close to anyone but still. I can't ever pity myself I always yell at myself for it becouse pepole have so much worse of problems which I think comes from me trying to tell my mom and her blowing me off or going into a lecture about how she had it worse and she did... But that should make my issues invalid right? I'm in shape going to some college getting great grades I have a job and a car never been in trouble I'm also good with people and alot funnier so I can make friends I've even been invited to partys I'm good looking it seems like I have everything I would need but still I can't make any real realtionships I always pull away my only two real friends are online which works becouse I can cut ties with them whenever so I can open up I'm not sure what I want from this maybe just to vent to know someone knows about it.

797,I finally did it!!,"I kicked out my toxic dead weight of a boyfriend. It wasn't all bad and I know I wasn't all good and positive. However we found ourselves homeless, between jobs, and eventually without a car. I tried to be patient. I tried to be understanding of the circumstances. Then I realized we only had food because of me. We had shelter because of my mom. He only had interviews because I set them up for him. He had a resume because I created one for him. All of his jobs since our relationship started was because I found it on craigslist for him, I reminded him x place is hiring,  I took him to the place and said FILL OUT THE APP, or I did it for him online. I have struggled my entire adult life. I know it's hard and it sucks and asking for help and doing things the harder way because its the only option,  sucks! But at what point do you finally realize you the only person holding you back? And as I sat up alone at 6 am while he slept I asked myself these same questions, about him not me. I already know my faults, right? Then it clicked. Taking care of him, worrying about what he is or isn't doing is exactly what is holding me back. All of the time I put in for his resume, I could have sent mine out to other places. And then there's the weed. I love it. He loves it. However, if you're in a state that it's illegal, then guess what?! its expensive as shit and a complete and utter risk. It can keep you from getting a job, a line he used often as to why he didn't apply here or there. I made myself physically sick realizing this alone in an occupied bed. So I got up out of bed finally determined to start my routine for a better me that I had been wanting to do for over 3 months. Short lived. I couldn't even role back and explain the argument. I wanted to do yoga in the bathroom because it was warm. He left his clothes in there, again. It was a week or more of clothes but I was tired of reminding him to put them in the basket. Now I needed the space. I moved them in the hallway out of my way so he could put them where they go. Apparently that upset him. The rest is a blur of him telling me I'm crazy, that I was arguing, and yelling. I may not have been as sweet as he wanted or that I usually am. But I knew I was in edge and kept my responses simple and short. I have my son this week and I KNOW I would not have yelled early in the morning over something so small.  I eventually locked myself in the bathroom to get some space away from him and attempt my routine. He called me a few names through the door and that was it for me. I asked him to leave. This time I mean it. This time I am only looking our for me. I deserve someone who treats me better. I'll refer back to the awareness that I am not perfect. I am a lot to handle some days. I cant handle my anger some days. I am probably all the negative things he has to say about me, the difference is I am willing to see it accept it and change it. I refuse to let someone else define me. I tell my story here because I don't care to tell my side to anyone who knows us. I just want to move on and be better. A better mom. A better employee. A better everything."

By fasting i do mean liquid fasting and I will intended to eat if my sugar drops/get sick. 

I've never been this weight in my life time, except when pregnant and it is really contributing to my depression. I've tried regular dieting and it doesn't work or triggers my old ed habits of controlling every morsel that goes into my mouth to the point going over 1000 cals a day is bad.

I am 19 years old, Female, lesbian, quite feminine, tomboyish, i’m lebanese, i study in France, i’ve been in therapy bonded strongly with a psychotherapist and a neuropsychologist, had a full psychiatric evaluation with one psychiatrist for 3h straight, and random other psychiatrist appointments from 20 to 50mins. I haven’t had a hypomanic episode but apparently you can be in the unspecified bipolar disorder subtype without having had a manic ir hypomanic episode, so only having early onset chronic depression that isn’t solved with SSRI’s or SNRI’s. I’m a pre-med student (according to the US system) and i want to become a psychiatrist. I love psychology, psychiatry, neurology, neuro/psychology/psychiatry, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry. I’m a highly intelligent and smart person, I developed the ability of analysis early, it is a curse and a blessing at the same time. I am very aware of things and have since an early age, i live in a toxic abusive (emotionally and behaviorally) family, my mother and brother have severe mental problems, my younger brother is a genius (literally) he started reading philosophy sociology and history at the age of 9 and has been accepted by the US with a full scholarship from lebanon, my father has OCD (different than mine tho), my mother is an incredible writer and painter, my whole family are either doctors dentists pharmacist engineers or business people. I am a highly emotional person and my severe OCD gives me constant intrusive thoughts and gifts me with over analysis of things and everything, i am obsessed with various things, ideas, people, scenarios, thoughts, feelings and my head is in a constant loophole. I am constantly suicidal, I haven’t been happy in a long time, even when my life seems to be so wonderful and pitch perfect, i am suicidal or depressed, i inhibit my feelings and emotions both conscientiously and unconsciously. When i fall in love, i obsess about said person and i give everything i have. I live with constant regrets and guilt over various reasons, important or unimportant things.

i feel like a disappointment, a burden to my parents. i feel like all my friends hate me because i complain about little shit tho my life is perfect.
yesterday, sunday, was perfect. i felt really good. today, i feel like going to kill myself. i didn't do anything today, i couldn't, or maybe saying i couldn't is just an excuse since i have no problems. after school i sat in bed and just layed there and i am still laying in bed. i woke up feeling good and now its all shit. i feel exhausted though i have no reason. i feel worthless, useless. all my friends have bigger problems and i have no idea how to help them. so i'm just sitting in bed and crying. i layed in bed and started crying for no reason at all.

i'm so tired of it all. of my mood swings when i'll feel so happy and excited and then i'll start feeling so sad and i'll cry. or maybe empty. i just want to feel empty right now. i'm so tired of feeling anything at all. i feel so guilty for feeling so sad.

a friend told me saturday that im annoying. we tell this to each other all the time, in a teasing way, but now when i remember  i feel hurt. it's not fair to my friend to feel like this since i also tell him this sometimes and he doesn't take it to heart. it's just not reasonable. 

i'm so tired of having my friends deal with me, my mood swings, iritability and anger issues. i'm just really tired and i want to go die but i'm too scared. i'd throw myself off a window right now if i could but im scared. what if i regret it last minute? what if anything happens to my friends and im not there to take care of them? what if they all just hate me and they're better off without me? what if my parents will be happier? 

i'm so tired of crying because of nothing. i just want it to stop"
808,[TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide] Venting about losing a loved one to mental health,"Hi, 

I am not sure what subreddit would be best for this type of post, I really hope this doesn't cause any harm but I dont know where else to post. If there is a better subreddit for this type of content I will remove it, but my head is in a complete whirl right now and I dont have anyone to talk to about this, so I need to vent somewhere and just get it out. 

This morning my wife woke me up saying please call me, so I called, and she said that her brother killed himself. She said she was the one who found him and he hung himself. She hung up shortly after that to be with her family while the ambulance came and her extended family came to the house. 

She called me a bit later and was clearly in shock, asking me if I was okay, apologizing, etc., and in the background I could hear her mother wailing and screaming. 

I feel weird for feeling such a deep emotion about it, because it wasn't my brother although him and I were fairly close and have known each other for a while, but I cant help but feel so broken. I cant get the thought of her finding him out of my head, and the whole thing seems so unreal. We just spoke the night before, and after hearing the news I just started scouring his social media and I found out he edited one of his instagram posts with a profound caption, probably minutes before he ended his life. 

I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts so I can just imagine the thoughts that went through his head, but I felt nowhere near the extremity of his depression. He was such a sweet and kind soul. I feel so empty, and I feel so heart broken that I can't be with her and her family as they grieve (Currently overseas) 

I have never dealt with the death of a family member or friend, and while I'm not at all foreign to the fact that people die, this is the first time it's been someone so close and I am just so new to this feeling. Ive never felt anything like it. It is surreal. 

I'm having such extreme anxiety about whats to come, the turmoil and dark days to follow his death. This will be so difficult for my wife to recover from, as well as her family, and I'm so broken over it. The pain they must be feeling is unreal. I feel helpless.

I hope he is at peace, he will be greatly, greatly missed."
809,I don't have interest in anything and sit around staring most of the day. Isn't that a bit weird? Can antidepressants help?,"I am pretty sure I am depressed and I am experiencing anhedonia.

I sit day in day out just mindlessly staring at some random things on my phone or try and chat a little on a discord group. I sleep well, eat well and work out. None of these tings seem to make a difference. Life is just bland.

Worst thing is I don't really want anything. Don't think I even want friends for example. I find most people boring and superficial. I'm boring myself so it's a bit hypocritical. 

So I don't know what I can do to feel better. Most people would seek social contact I guess, but that's hard when I don't have any interest in doing anything with people. 

I'm wondering if any of you have had help with something similar by taking anti-depressants? Can that turn on a spark in me?"
810,"Ok, I’m completely having panic attacks over The domestic terrorists!! I’m actually terrified","I don’t want to leave the house at all, this is triggering me like 9/11 did and I had ptsd from that for a decade...this is 1000 times worse"
811,got discharged :),"i was in hospital for 5 days, got discharged today. it wasn’t a psych ward, just a medical one but i got 3 psych assessments and i told all of them that i have multiple plans, and they sent me home today with a referral to mental health community thing that i’ve been to before that i told them didn’t work ✌🏼"
812,I need family advice : (,"**Trigger Warning: Slight mention of Suicide towards end**

Okay so my older brother (This isn’t his actual name) Steve has been doing drugs (weed) lately as well as been having on and off problems with his girlfriend whom he has a baby with. 

His girlfriend and him have a completely controlling relationship. Like the girl comes over and she is literally scared to look another male in the eye and etc because my brother overreacts. 

He curses at her and says awful things. (This right here is a red flag because it scares me because he was never like this before)

Okay so anyway. My other oldest brother, Jack who has a wife and 2 kids, was over one day. We were having a family gathering and my brother Steve and his girlfriend was there. My brother Steve, is imagining his girlfriend was making goo goo eyes at my other brother Jack. Ever since this he avoids Jack and has blocked him and keeps lying to him and to everyone else the reason why. 

My brother Jack was extremely hurt by this because he felt like they were close. 

Steve keeps lashing out at everyone for not replying to him quickly via text and etc claiming he doesn’t have time for games and etc. 

A recent event of this happening is when he had a book shipped to our house and I picked it up from outside. I didn’t let our parents know because I didn’t feel like they needed to know. BIG MISTAKE. 

He texts me asking if his book was there. I thought it was my girlfriend and thought I’d just respond to her later. Turns out it was him and as soon as I read it I texted him back. Not knowing he texted my mother also. 

He said he’d pick up tomorrow end of story. Well atleast I thought. Turns out he was being a complete dick to my mother about the same situation thinking my mother and dad was lying to him about the book being there when they honest to god didn’t know. 

He snapped at my mother claiming for her to let him know if he needs to stop talking to her too and my mother snapped back. 

(He thinks my mom is siding with his on and off again girlfriend about problems and thinks that’s why she was lying about the book’s whereabouts. But she just genuinely didn’t know about it)

I want to talk to him about everything that’s going on and ask what’s going on with him or do something because I feel like our family is being torn apart. I just want everything to go back to normal, but my brother keeps hallucinating about things that aren’t there and lashing out on everyone. What do I do? 

**Another reason why I’m scared to talk to him is because he tried to commit suicide years back and even told my mom about that recently (Couple weeks back) and stated he didn’t want to talk about it. So I’m scared this is leading to this because he’s cutting everyone off. Friends and family."
813,I don't know what to do with my life,"I (20f) still live with my mom and my stepdad and a brother and a sister and i am in a sort of pre education now because im not ready to begin a normal education right now. I have severe social anxiety and break down crying and have panic attacks when i go to job interviews and meetings with my teachers and stuff like that. 

My teachers are very helpful 
I have talked to a therapist but it didn't help at all 

I am starting in a therapy group soon but i don't know if it will help 

I tried talking to my doctor but she couldn't prescribe any medication because i am under 25 

my pre education thing is over this July and then i don't know what to do 

I can't start an education or get a job because i will break down crying or have a panic attack 

I have been crying and having panic attacks almost every day for the last week I feel like everyone im living with i getting tired of me crying all the time even tho i can't control it 

I really want do do something with my life but right now everything is so overwhelming 

Sorry for bad grammar English isn't my first language"
814,Sometimes I wish I was a boy.,"I’m so jealous of other girls because of how perfect they are. I’m terrible at being a “girl”. I can’t do makeup and whenever I try to dress up I look terrible. If I was a boy I wouldn’t be putting all this pressure on myself. I’m sick and tired of being jealous of other girls and trying to be like them is exhausting. Being myself is not optional cause I don’t know who the hell I am. Not to say that boys can’t enjoy “girly” things, or that all women are “girly” but I rather just be a boy than be a masculine woman. I only feel like this some days but lately it’s been getting worse, I think it might be my BPD but I’m not aloud to be professionally diagnosed with that yet but my psychiatrist told me I fit all the symptoms so I thought it was worth mentioning."
815,Can't shake this feeling of sad... I hate everything about myself,"I don't know if this is influenced by the current lockdown (UK) because I've always had phases of being overwhelmed with depression and sadness for really no reason at all. But this recent phase has been going on for a while now and it's really starting to bother me. 
I really don't have anything to be sad about, I just am. 
I hate myself, every time I look at myself I just hate it, I hate my skin, my weight, my face, especially my hair, I really can't pick out one thing I like about myself lately. 
My boyfriend tells me all the time that I'm beautiful and he finds me attractive, and I believe him just because of how he looks at me but everytime I pull my phone out to take a picture of us in a moment I want to keep, the minute I see my reflection in the camera I'm just disgusted. 

I'm just sad and I don't know what to do about it. It scares me being in these kinds of moods, I've dealt with self harming before and suicidal thoughts when I was younger and I've worked so hard to move past all of that and generally I have improved, my boyfriend is really my saviour. But when I have these depressive phases, I just can't see anything good. I can't think of my future, I can't think of anything I want to do or anything I enjoy. It scares me because I feel like there'll come a time where I can't deal with anything anymore and do something irreversible and damaging but at the same time, I just don't really want to live... I often get existential and panic about dying and leaving people behind, on the one hand I'm terrified of dying and hate the thought of not being here anymore and being with my family and boyfriend, but then there's a part of me that thinks if I'm able to control it, it'll be okay and I won't be scared of it (dying I mean). 

Urgh sorry for the ramble, I just feel so much and so little at the same time, I needed to get some of it off my chest."
816,Very low point,"Hi, I’m a black 20f junior in college. I’ve been upset for like the entire day since I’ve woken up. This happens to me way too often. 

As you can probably see from my post history over the past couple if months I’ve been incredibly distraught because I’m still a kiss less virgin. I’m also upset because of my lack of good relationships (with friends and family) and also because I just all around hate myself. I had day planned of exercising and doing some LSAT practice but I’m just not gonna do that because I’m so upset and unmotivated right now.

I hate it here. I just wanna be happy. And have friends and a boyfriend. And I wanna love myself. I hate my life so fucking much."

818,Life rant,"This is very long rant. I am sorry if this is the wrong place for all this, but it is the only place i could think of rn. Please dont mind any typos.

I(19M) have been pampered since the beginning. I think i have been spoiled from my childhood. I obviously couldn't see this in my childhood, but as i grew up i realised that other people my age are a lot different than me. I feel my parents have protected me more than what they should have. I have been conditioned to good experiences too much and not allowed to face challenges. I dont want to blame them completelty either, but i think they should have known better.

It was easy for me to bail out of any hurdle as my parents were very protective. What this has done is that i am unequiped to do almost anything on my own. I am over dependant on them. Other kids my age are studying abroad on their own, managing work, relationships, etc and still have time for themselves. While i struggle with the most basic tasks.

I am also a poor communicator. I guess this is probably because i never talk to anyone outside, my parents handle it all for me, even for small things like getting work done by repairmen, or contacting customer care service, home delivery guy, or calling the cab driver, talking to cashiers at malls, etc. Small things that for someone my age is not an issue at all give me anxiety. I would almost not say anything in my parents company to someone else even if it gets a bit awkward since my parents handle it everytime.

Since a couple of years i have started to feel all of this. I feel bad whenever something like this happens, when i am supposed to take charge or be a ""grown-up"". But still i am not able to do anything. I can see when that spoiled child behaviour is happening, but i am powerless against it, as i am against most things in my life. I even sometimes rely on my younger brother, who has more of an alpha personality. This makes me feel aweful.

I even tried to tell my parents that they need to give me more freedom and independance, but they dismissed it, that they are doing things right, and whenever they feel like, they let me take responsibilty. Even in day to day experiences i feel like they sort of control me, like i am their achievement. This is an exaggeration of what i feel like. I feel less than a person.

And it does not help that i too help in reinforcing that behaviour. I let myself get pampered. But every now and then i hesitate which probably makes me conflicted and i tend to become agitated and slightly angry. I understand whats wrong, but i cant do correct it.

While i am 19 years old, and in college, i feel i am very immature for my age and have a mind of a 11-12 year old. I have had no relationships ever, not that u have tried, because every girl seems to be on a whole different planet than me. Same goes for friendships. All friendships begin from a common point, like classmates in school, friends in neighbourhood, coaching/tuition friends, family friends, and now college friends. Whenever the common point ceases, so does the friendship. Today i have no contact with any of my ""friends"" except the handful those in college with me right now, which will also go away when college gets over. I feel i will never have any permanent friends for lifetime or even several years, this makes me feel that i will be alone forever as people will come and go.

I dont think i will be in a stable relationship, because it will be more like adopting a man child for her. I am very beta. I always tend to need a strong person to hold on to. I cannot really do anything on my own. I cant imagine any normal person living with me for over a month. Earlier i used to become anxious and panicky in tough situations, now i just give up and let it happen. Due to this mentality i have become fat(over 220 lbs), smelly and lazy. I have had suicidal thoughts, existential crisis, depression, all that you would expect a teenager to go through. They come and go, but make me more dull everytime. I dont feel as deeply as i used to for other people.

I am also distant from my friends and family. They think i am someone else. I feel bad for fooling them. I feel career pressure too. I dont think i will kill myself. It is too difficult for me. I have tried, but i think i gave up on that. Everytime i stop and retreat like i do at other things. Maybe it is good. But what ends up happening is i live a dull and passively painful life, think to kill myself, unable to do it, stop, get motivated for a day, and the cycle repeats. This has been going on for an year now.

Now i dont know what to write. I dont know what to expect from this post. This was initially a call for any guidance, but became more of a life rant now. I guess i couldnt say all this to anyone. A lot of this probably wont make sense as a lot of it is in my head. Please dont give any cliche advise, i am tired of listening to those. Thanks for even reading this. It would be nice if you commented something."
819,What am I supposed to tell my parents?,"My depression and anxiety have been pretty bad for a long while. I don’t do school or work or eat or anything really. My parents keep asking me why I don’t do my schoolwork and they tell me to just get over it and do it. But I like can’t, I don’t know what is wrong with me. I can’t focus I can’t do anything and I definitely don’t want to do it either. So what am I supposed to tell my parents? 

I got an email from my school telling them that I should go to in person school because I’m failing my classes. I can’t do that either. I’m fucked. I’m scared, they’re going to yell at me later, I know it. My mind feels kinda fragile recently so idk what I’ll do when they yell at me:/"
820,I really don’t like my life anymore,"I don’t like the way my life is right now and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know what I want to be doing. I’m sad every night for no reason and I just hate my life overall

I don’t want to go to school anymore and the thought of it really kills me 

Can anyone help :("
821,"As a child, I have had some weird, scary experiences that I have never found an explanation for.","So when I was 12 years old, I remember waking up one day, feeling like I suddenly had severe amnesia and had completely forgotten the past few weeks or even months. The last things that I could still remember felt like they had happened weeks, months, or even a year ago. Of course I was extremely confused and scared, and I refused to go to school because it felt like I couldn't remember anything that had happened during the last weeks or months.

Except that it wasn't true and that in reality, I had only forgotten the last few hours or, at maximum, the last day. However, it felt like the time between my last memories and me waking up was way longer than it actually was, I was absolutely convinced that I had a very big chunk of memories missing. The only reason that I know it wasn't true, was because I remember checking my smartphone and that I could remember all of the messages, notificaties, browser history etc that I had sent and received the days before the incident. Only they felt to me like I had sent them months ago instead of a few days ago.


I know that this confusion persisted at least a few days after the incident. I got admitted into a psychiatric where I quickly recovered and went back to my normal self, except that this false feeling that I had experienced amnesia never went away.

Afterwards there had been a few (2 to 3? Last one when I was 14-15) instances of me waking up confused and feeling like I had amnesia, but the feeling of confusion only lasted for a day and I knew that I didn't have real amnesia because of my first experience. It was still very scary though, but when it happened I pretended to just be ill that day to be able to recover from the weird feeling.

I have never had any history of delusions, hallucinations, schizophrenia, paranoia, substance abuse or actual amnesia. I do have a history of depression, anxiety (mainly social), eating disorders, and ADHD inattentive type (recently diagnosed). I wasn't taking any medication at the time of the incident.
 
My question is, has anyone here ever experienced the same or do you know what it could be and why it happened? Please also feel welcome to share your own experiences with similar incidents, even if not related to this, and if you have an explanation for what happened to you.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this."
822,I don’t know what to do,"A few years back I felt like something in me snapped. The events surrounding what happened aren’t serious, scarring, or otherwise damaging, but either way, something happened.  

I was ending my senior year of high school, getting yelled at by my parents for some stupid shit I had done (per usual) and as my mom raised her voice more and more, something in my brain just turned off. I retreated into my shell and everything she said after just went in one ear and out the other. Everything felt numb, it was like a scene from a movie where an explosion goes off and everyone just stands there stunned, but all in my head. I felt it all night and went to bed, hoping the feeling would subside. 

I awoke the next day feeling like a veteran who had seen it all (I have never faced violence or stress like you brave soldiers see in war so pardon my metaphor if it’s disrespectful). Again, I went to bed hoping the feeling would go away. 

Things continued like this for a while. Prom? Numb. Graduation? Numb. Going off to college? Numb. 

I remember waking up one morning a couple months into my first year of undergrad and I saw nothing. Nothing in my future, nothing in my past, nothing happening now. I felt like a shadow of my former self.  

I transferred home after one semester and took classes at a community college while routinely seeing a therapist. It helped me seem more normal. My grades were good, I had plenty of friends, got along with my family (for the first time ever) and everyone thought I was doing great. But I was still numb. 

Flash ahead two more years and here I am. Moved to florida (it’s beautiful). Plenty of friends, working, doing well in school, even have a girlfriend who deeply cares about me. But everything still feels numb. I don’t feel excited, happy, surprised, all I feel is dull and sad. 

I’ve contemplated suicide a few times but it always just feels like I’d be making things harder on those around me. I wish I could just give up, go to sleep and never come back, but that’s not how this world works. 

I don’t know what to do. Everything in my body and my brain hurt. I’m tired, sad, and without cause. I need help but I feel like such a lost cause. I don’t even know why I’m posting this here, I just hope someone can relate and know they’re not alone. Thanks guys"
823,I deleted my 78k Youtube channel due to abusive parents finding it out.,"I've been abused as a child and they were also very religious, trying to control everything from career to even forcing my ex to break up with me since they didn't like my ex. I left them suicide notes and attempted suicide twice.

I cut ties with them, legally changed my name, put restraining orders, and had an attorney send a letter to them. 

It's been over ten years since I left them, but they still try to track me down. Couple years ago, they lied to the police that I escaped from a mental institution and the local police let them intrude my home and gave all my info out. I even immigrated to a different country because the government workers kept giving my info out just because they are my ""Parents"". I never did anything to them, all I wanted was to get away from them.

Finally I was settled and slowly overcoming the traumas for over half of my life. But I guess they tracked me down for some reason again and found my new name in English spelling and thus found my Youtube channel as well. The channel was half vlog and half health topics of me talking about news and also mental wellbeing for my own good, in attempt to recover. I hit 78k subscribers in two years and really wanted to continue.

But as I noticed they subscribed to my channel and clearly can see they watched all my videos from observing Youtube studios analytics, I was just so anxious and ashamed for no fault of mine. I cannot even handle them watching me and just thinking about them traumatizes me. 

I didn't upload anything for months and just deleted the channel out of stress. Perhaps it's my own demise for using my name as the channel name, but I wanted to work and live as a public figure without needing to hide my identity. Now I've given up the only thing left my life has going for, yet I'm still haunted by their existence everyday lately.

I've been constantly trying to recover whenever they tried to get into my life again and again. Financially I'm ok, but ever since I have not had relationships, not go out at all, and no desire to start anything now. If I had gotten married, I would've had a kid in school by now. I always wanted a good family and better parents."
824,Am I wrong for being worried about my stability?,"Hello, everyone. I'm a 15yr old living with my parents and I've been dealing with a lot of mental health problems for a while. (PTSD, Disassociation, Depression, Anxiety, Psychosis, Ect.) And recently from around two months ago, my mental stability has worsened greatly.  I've already been to my closest mental hospital and stayed a week, but after I left I didn't feel much better for long. I've tried everything to get therapy but where I live makes that very difficult and my previous therapist messed up some of my files, so now it's even harder. 

My mother is trying her best to be supportive and she finally got me a therapy appointment for this Friday at noon, but as I'm writing this I'm halfway through calming down from a breakdown. Recently along with everything getting worse, I've been very impulsive and hostile, very disoriented and I'm constantly breaking down in tears for no reason or trying not scream. It's just getting very hard for me to control anything about myself lately and it's terrifying me. 

I just told my mom about how unstable I felt and that I was concerned about hurting someone or myself and that I really thought it would be better if I went back to the mental hospital either tonight or at least tomorrow. She told me she just wanted to have a nice dinner tonight and asked if I could try and wait till Friday.

I really wish I could say I can wait till Friday, because I'm just starting to make money off selling art and I'm writing a book and making music, and my parents are proud of that so I don't want to disappoint them like I usually do. But I genuinely don't think I'll be able to make it to Friday. What should I do?"
825,Trying not to feel ugly,"I’m very envious of my sisters features and feel very ugly and disgusting around her, but I’ve just gotten done giving myself positive affirmations...as soon as I see her again today, everything will likely come crashing down around me all over again, and I’ll see her amazing hair, gorgeous eyes, and amazingly sculpted face etc., and then I’ll look at myself and feel ridiculous for even trying. It sort of feels like I’m just lying to myself about feeling/being beautiful, because at the end of the day I’d still much rather look like her than myself. What do I do?"
826,"I feel as though despite communities and families becoming closer during the pandemic, I have been isolated even more...","I'm  just feeling lost. 

I know I can make better friends but the thought of getting to know new people is ridiculously tiring for me right now. 

Family turned on me  this year, my grandad died and this is not an exaggeration, not a single 'friend' has been in touch. 

Granted, I stuck up for my boyfriend a few years ago during a stupid fight and ever since, our old friend group has made our lives hell. No one speaks to me and honestly ai am becoming paranoid that they are sabotaging all of our friendships and acquaintances. 

I even had to leave my uni course this year because of a bully teacher. I am so done. 

I'm skipping meds and sleeping all day again. I would be so grateful to have someone to talk to honestly. 


(Just a heads up that if I don't reply straight away or for a while, I am sorry. I am just so so overwhelmed, it may take me some time. Thanks)"
827,Really struggling,"It’s so hard for me to stay positive at the moment as i’m sure most of us are struggling with. I feel like my confidence goes up and i feel positive about what i’m doing and then someone crashes it down again. Then i’m crying again with no confidence and really struggling to find myself again. 

Just one example. 
I have an 8 month dog and just recently went to a behaviourist for his pulling on the lead and his recall. The behaviourist even said i should be a dog walker because i’m really good with dogs and the training side of things, it was so positive. I even said about starting up a dog walking business with my partner and we were both very excited about it and wanted to start it up. 
Anyway, the training felt like it was working, i was really feeling positive with my street walks with my doggy and even in the field seemed to work. 
But today, it all came crashing down. 
Today, i went for my usual walk down our local field with my doggy and my partner and it wasn’t too bad but my dog was venturing too far but it’s all a slow process, anyway my dog went to another dog that was quite far, i don’t know what the problem was. They seemed to be having fun and playing but then she started saying “can you get your dog please” so i started walking up to them, then she said it again. The second time i said “i’m coming” and then she got hold of my dog and gave him back to me and then said “if you can’t control your dog then he needs to be on a lead until he’s learned recall” 
I guess i’m a real sensitive soul and someone who doesn’t use their voice, something i should be having therapy for but my partner stepped in. 
My partner argued with the women saying my dog is in training and the dog is going to fail and learn by his mistakes and stuff. She was totally argumentative about it and was saying it’s all my fault, her dog is the one in control etc. I just cried in the field, cried on the way home, cried at home on the sofa. 

Just feel so low. I feel like i’m a bad dog owner, i feel like all my confidence has been completely knocked. I feel like i shouldn’t pursue the dog walking business. Recently, i left my job because i was being bullied and sexually harassed so right now i really enjoy my dog walks because it’s the only normal thing in the world right now and i feel like i can’t even do that anymore without someone being shit with me."
828,2020 rant,"In 2020, i realized a lot of things.
Partly because im growing up. Partly because being shuttered up in your house all the time.. really makes you think. About everything. 


My goal in writing this is for anyone reading it to really think about 2020—  what it meant for you, your loved ones, and the world overall. I’m sure many of you already have, and I’m sure many of you think me even labeling this as “2020” is arbitrary because let’s face it— it’s always been shit. But I’m hoping it’ll get better.


Anyways, I’m gonna share a synopsis of 2020 from my perspective— and I encourage anyone reading to do the same from their perspective, in the replies (provided only that they feel comfortable doing so, of course). I would really like to read them. 


For starters, in 2020 i realized a lot about my mental health — all of which is long and complicated and none of it is something i much want to get into, because I’m a very private person (also, nobody cares).


My high-school friend moved in with me (we’re both 18, as of my writing this). My partner of over a year moved in with me (she’s 19). I could explain their situations in depth but I don’t want to put their shit on here without their permission, so let me sum it up in one sentence: quarantine made them realize they couldn’t stand to be at their houses any longer. 


My dad is supporting us — he’s a college professor. We live 5 people to a 3 bedroom house. Not too bad (I guess?). My friends do pay for their groceries. I don’t. My uncle — the 5th, who is mentally handicapped and subsequently yells at us from his room all day — gets social security checks for around $1000(?). We live in a borderline nothing town in North Carolina.


Courtesy of 2020, I am now on 2 medications. Strattera (however you spell it), a non-stimulant for my ADHD; and some very mild sleeping medication I can’t remember the name of (and dont feel like checking). 


Yada yada I’m sure some of your 2020 stories will be a lot more interesting than mine.


I also realized over 2020 that being alive .. hurts? (haha) So, now I smoke weed to counter this. Me and my friends also occasionally dip into psychedelics (only shrooms and acid). Honestly, all of these have helped me grow rather than affecting me negatively in any particular way. They help me think.


I didn’t used to think, but I guess it’s just because I used to be a kid. Nothing used to matter, but now it does. Why?


I think I can end this before it gets too unbearably long by simplifying our issues, just a little bit:
We are middle class. We’ve never been able to afford the necessary renovations for our house. I can’t keep it clean. It’s too much for my ADHD, at times. I constantly feel overwhelmed. I constantly feel wired.


We found out my cat has cancer this year. I realized I have an eating disorder (in recovery, woohoo) — among other issues. I’ve seriously considered therapy but it costs money. 


My partner just moved here and we can’t get her medications — she has bad anxiety, depression, etc. She needs to be seen by a therapist in order to get them even though she already has a fucking prescription that she got in California. Therapy’s booked and expensive and she can’t drive (I can, thankfully). We called a therapist and they immediately asked for our billing— I want to ask, is this just how it is in America, all the time? I want to scream. I want to help her, but I can’t even manage my own fucking issues. 


Anyways. We all have to go to the doctor, sometimes it feels like the house is making us sick. We don’t want to go, because of covid. Half of us don’t even have health insurance. 


My house does not feel safe. We cannot afford to make it feel safe. The murder rate (or general crime rate? can’t remember which) in my city has gone up by 35%.


And I haven’t even touched on what’s happening elsewhere in the world. 


How has quarantine been for y’all?"
829,I can barely self-care and I don't know what to do,"For reference I have been diagnosed with Asperger's, depression, generalized anxiety, and ADHD, if any of that means anything.

I (17nb) was unreceptive to instruction when I was younger, and I took for granted that I would receive assistance in learning for as long as I needed it. That's not the case, now.

I’m barely functioning with basic self-care responsibilities at the present moment; I seldom shower before noon, brush my teeth, comb my hair, or finish my schoolwork in a reasonable amount of time, even when I'm not distracted - much less do my own laundry, cook for myself, maintain a face routine, or any of the other... *stuff* other people know to do, or know *how* to do. I'm not particularly motivated, and even when I still get stuck when I either can't remember the process of how to do something, or my limbs won't cooperate with what my brain is telling them to do. I only know how to tie my shoes ONE way, and they usually come undone within an hour.

Up until now I've had the privilege of receiving the generous assistance of my single mum, who worked with people with autism for 20 years. She offered me the patience, kindness, and specific assistance nobody else was willing or able to. However, she has recently been diagnosed with a serious throat condition, and her doctor has told her she must completely stop speaking for the foreseeable future. This is on top of the fact she has severe spinal osteoarthritis, and has had numerous small strokes in the last few years and is on blood thinners. So she's not exactly in the best of health, and my anxiety and overall neediness haven't done much to change that. Her therapist has told her if I present too much of a burden on her, she should move out altogether.

I understand that I can no longer rely on her to always be there to help me in the same way she has in the past, but I CANNOT fully take care of myself yet. So, I have tried to branch out to ask for help from others. However, the age window where most people are willing to help you learn basic life skills seems to have come and gone, and because I'm 17, and because I’m “smart,” I'm not offered the same courtesy anymore. Most people I've talked to just expect me to just learn on the fly like they *somehow* can. They say something along the lines of "" well, I didn't have anyone to help me, and in the real world you don't have anyone to help you, so I'm sure you can figure out by yourself."" Which doesn’t exactly help when your hand-eye coordination is measurably lacking. 

But even when someone is available and willing to help me, I don't have the attention span to remember anything they said. I seriously have a problem with remembering what people tell me; I can't tell who said what or even what exactly was said, and I get in trouble frequently for putting words in people's mouths that they didn't say. I've made a thing of secretly recording people with my phone while they're talking to me about anything important, so that I can refer to it at any moment without having to ask them to reiterate for the 50th time. But people are getting mad at me for taping them without them knowing, and this combined with the fact that I obsessively archive everything I read, and reach the storage cap on my phone and Google Drive again and again within weeks of mass deletions, means that I am treading the thin line of having my access to the Internet both at school and at home revoked.

I have little to no executive functioning ability; I can barely maintain a coherent train of thought (it took me 4 hours to write all this), get distracted instantly, and am conspicuously failing to organize or time-manage, especially with school. 

I have talked to counselors and my therapist about all this, and there isn't much they can do to help me learn tactile life skills, especially during COVID. My school resource teacher has offered to help me make instant rice and instant chicken, which is a very low bar for learning how to cook. Being in grade 12, it's too late for me to switch to a Home Ec course. Whatever further resources there are at my very rural school won't be able to help me after I graduate this June, and I won't be able to go to university next year. My therapist suggested looking into ABA, which as I understand it does more harm than good, especially towards autistic people like myself. When I asked for alternative ideas, either he had none or I don't remember what he said.

So I don't know what to do. I'm barely able to take care of myself, I'm aging out of the available support systems I ignored until now, I don't have the awareness to know what to ask help for, or the social skills to know to ask for help in any way that will actually solicit help, and my Mum is becoming increasingly debilitated cannot help me the way she has in the past. Considering that she's 60, and that she's already been on disability leave for the last 20 years, her income may or may not be that stable for long; and I'm not exactly employable at the present moment. When I asked her for what connections she may have to other people with her skillset, but without her impairments, she berated me for ""looking for a new Mum now that the old one is broken and ready to be thrown away.""

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I have no tangible life skills whatsoever and I can barely take care of myself at 17 any more than I did at 7, and my Mum can't help me like she used to and my support network is drying up and I don't know what to do or who to ask for what and even if I get the help I need I won't remember it, and I'm starting to panic.

Can someone who might have overcome this kind of thing for themselves please tell me what to do? What to ask for? Who to ask? How to find them? How to independently remember anything I'm told, for that matter? Please?"
830,I constantly feel like I’m not good enough and it’s ruining my life,"I am never satisfied with ANYTHING I do. And now it’s really starting to impact my life because instead of working towards goals, I do nothing all day. I am never good enough, I never do enough things, there’s always someone better than me. And I can’t handle it at all. I thought taking a break from social media would help because I wouldn’t compare myself to others but it hasn’t at all. I’ll give a few examples: 

1. I love music. It’s a huge part of my life. However, I hate myself if I don’t listen to every single essential album over a lot of genres because I feel like I’m not “diverse” enough. So I’ll listen to ~50 albums a week just to feel like I’m good enough, and I’ll put off work just to sit around and listen to them. And when I finish that, I add more to my list to listen to, or I’ll feel like I have to memorize an artists entire discography. And when I do that I feel like I have to watch all the interviews and live shows and documentaries they have, even if I don’t want to/don’t have the time. I just feel like I’m not good enough.

2. I am constantly busy with school, I’m in  ton of clubs and hard classes. But I still feel like I’m never doing enough or good enough since there’s always people doing more things than me. It’s gotten to a point where I get 5 hours of sleep a  day, stay up until 4 am having anxiety attacks over school work, and still feel like I don’t do enough.

I don’t know what to do. Living like this is miserable and I can’t stop feeling like I’m inadequate"
831,Anybody else struggling to find motivation while living alone?,"I live alone and have a lot on my plate to do for work but I have zero motivation to do anything. I constantly think about having someone to hug and having company. I FaceTime friends and family but it just doesn’t seem like enough anymore. I’m intimate and nurturing and not being able to fulfill my needs is driving me insane. If it weren’t for COVID, I’d be able to travel to see my friends and family and date but it doesn’t feel like it’s gonna happen any time soon anymore. And so I feel like I only work for the sake of money I don’t feel the drive, how do I get it back when all these social factors are affecting it?"
832,Whats wrong with me. Mild hallucinations because of not sleeping for 1 day,"I used to smoke weed pretty heavely and after I stopped I felt pretty off (anxiety, little deperosnalization etc.) which I don't really care about that much and hasnt effected my life. I haven't slept good since I stopped smoking weed so I decided to go a day without sleep to get my sleep schedule right. Felt so fucking tired trought out the day and what really concern me is that I could see little visual hallucinations when I looked at the white snow. Like little random black visuals ( https://youtu.be/ZxQ0Q6uyHWY like those random black visuals in the video ) I knew right away that the hallucination wasnt real but still this concerns me. I've read that going 3 days without sleep may cause hallucinations, but I was only going  1 day. Any kind of explanation will be appriciated"
833,How to get over a bad day at work?,"Does anyone else experience those really, really, really bad days at work? I don’t have them often but had one today where someone screamed in my face about something that was unfortunate, but wasn’t my fault. 

It was the kind of thing that will bother me all week, until I (hopefully) forget about it and can move on. I’ll have a pit in my stomach until then, and will get upset at the slightest thought about the encounter.

Is time the only thing that heals this, or does anyone else have good techniques to move past bad days?"
834,"I am struggling right now, and i need to talk","Hi.. im an 18 year old girl and i am struggling right now. My parents are both dead from suicide and i currently live with my granparents. My friends stopped contacting me about a year ago when covid started, and since i have severe social anexity i am unable to call or text anyone (including my therapist). I also have bipolar disorder, so i have episodes where i black out and do self distructicive things like all sorts self harm, sometimes combined with drugs. Yesterday i had one of these episodes and i failed a suicide attempt. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for many years now. I am really scared of myself, and i feel bad for everything i do. I feel bad now because people are gonna waste their time reading this post.... I feel like i should apologize to everyone that have ever seen me or been i contact with me. I dont know how many days or weeks i have left now and i am so scared. So please. If you who are reading this have 5 minutes just to talk for a little bit, than feel free to do so. If you dont want to, thats fine to. PS: im sorry for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language"
835,My Girlfriend (17f) said i (19m) make her sad mostly but also happy.,"We have been together for 2 years known each other for 3. My Girlfriend says i make her sad but she dont know why she say i make her sad and all she think about is me but she say i make her happy too but mostly sad she got a really bad mental health and have hurt me and herself in the past and tried to commit suicide not long ago so maybe she feel she's bad for me and that way thinking about me makes her sad ? she have basically ghosted me at the moment and said she need a break she have made up ridiculous thoughts before about me not loving her and whatever so kinda scares me.

tldr: my girlfriend said i make her sad but dont know why and also said i make her happy"
836,Why must my family treat me differently?,"These past few years haven't been easy for me. Ever since I got into high school, life has been more of a struggle. It all started because of therapy, it really hasn't helped at all. The reason I'm in therapy is because of the lies my parents made up, one time they told the therapist that I punched my little brother and gave him a nose bleed, which never happened. At first, I thought therapy was helping me, but it the more I went the more I felt like a prisoner. I started going to therapy in my freshmen year and now I'm a senior stuck in this hell hole. Let me get straight to the point, my family treats me like I'm a lunatic or something. They have never believed me on anything or brothered to hear me out. Whenever I use to cut myself, they would get mad at me and say crap like ""what the hell is wrong with you?"" or ""your friends taught you this, didn't they."" The only people that truly understand me are my friends.Today something happened, I was planning to go to Guitar Center by myself, but my parents were against it because of the pandemic. I tried convincing them and even told them that I was gonna wear a mask and keep my distance from people. They then threatened to kick me out of the house if I took the bus to Guitar Center. Which I didn't get at all, that was the most neglectful bullshit I've ever heard in my life. I don't care that they didn't let me go, but it's the face that they would even do such a thing. I respect my family so most of the time I don't even bother arguing back.Then I asked me brother if he could take me and that I would even pay him, but he told me how annoying I was and how much of a burden I am to my parents. It's been like this for three years now and I don't know how much more I could take. I would stay at my sister's place for a bit, but I don't wanna to carry that burden to her. I even try to get a job so I can try to make money for myself, but they won't even help me with that. I even asked my parents if they could teach me how to drive, yet they would brush me off or forget. It's crazy how I'm almost 18 and I can't even do any of these things. I see other kids my age with cars and jobs, while I'm over here with nothing, I envy them. I try my best to be so productive, but I always fail at being somewhat useful. The only way I am any use to them is that my mom gets money every month because of my disorder, I don't get any of it. Other than that, I feel entirely useless to the family."
837,PTSD?,Is it possible to have ptsd and not flash backs?
838,How do I stop obsessive thoughts in OCD?,"I am a person interested in creativity and recently/aka for an entire month I've been having obsessive religious thoughts about whether or not the magic shown in fiction is bad/would be a sin in that universe, etc. As someone who writes music and designs clothes this also gets in the way of my creative process and makes me feel as though anything creative that has to do with magic is bad. It's so bad that it's all I think about from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. I also sleep as a coping mechanism when something gives me anxiety so I've started sleeping for around 16 hours a har. I'm wondering if anyone has had similar issues with OCD and if there is a way to overcome this?"
839,Why don’t I want to get better,No matter how far I spiral down I never have any want to get better. It makes me feel like my emotions are fake. I don’t know what’s wrong and this might make no sense but if anyone feels the same I would like to know

842,working out seems to trigger depressing thoughts for me,"I’m a scrawny teenager and I’m trying to work out more to hopefully fill out by the time I go to uni but every time I try there’s this voice in my head just telling me how weak I am, and how I’m not enough and how I should kms etc and it’s just making it really hard to be motivated god I hate it here"
843,I hate how my mood changes so quickly,I can go from being really motivated and happy to bring down and have all of my energy lost. It’s really effecting my work and school as I can’t keep up. Its making me overwhelmed and stressed and it feels like I can’t do anything about it. I’m an emotional wreck and I get upset over small things easily.
844,Please help me,I'm looking for a girl in this subreddit that I attempted suicide with. Her name is lily but I cant remember her username and I had her on another account but I cant remember my password and the email I entered was fake so I cant recover my password.

Grind, Hustle, put every living breath into what the **FUCK** you want to do, **FUCK** the noise. Remember, just because you are losing at half, doesn't mean you won't win by the end of the game.

847,Did growing up with no consequences caused me to become a violent adult?,"A couple of months ago, I ended up beating up my mother after getting into an argument. I don't know what caused me to do that. Prior to the incident, I always got in trouble in terms of being banned from different subreddits and felt I was treated unfairly. I thought I could use force against someone for committing a crime or not respecting my boundaries. My mom refused to respect my boundaries by talking after being told to stop, which lead me to beat her up as a punishment. I just don't know what happened. What led me to do that? Did the fact that I never grew up with consequences have to do with that?"
848,I don't think I'll be alive in a week,"I'm getting closer and closer to ending it, I'm not able to keep going anymore, I'm just so unhappy and I can't find anything positive and I'm really sorry I'm going to do this to my family."
849,"Back again, with more things I am too scared to ask friends to talk about...","I am lately very down. You can read in another post I have, the only other in fact, if you are curious. 

I have a boyfriend. He cannot relate to my issues nor understand my breakdowns/mood swings even when I explain afterwards as I calm down and apologize for myself.

He feels the need to be a caregiver to me, when I never asked for that and I tell him I don’t want that kind of nagging care (similar to typical parents who don’t understand or are not willing to think in the child’s shoes). 

“Give me your phone, don’t use it at night.”
Blasts alarms to wake me up when he deems healthy.
“You are always mad.”
“I am failing you and am worthless because I can’t help you.”

I try to talk it out when we are both calm, and I try to tell him I really don’t want help like that, I am 19 btw. 
I get very upset when my phone and stuff is taken, mostly because when my mom took them I wouldn’t see them until I found them in the house or weeks/months/years later literally, depending on how much I depend on the object to escape reality.

Gifts, as well, were taken from me.

And he is on his own very immature sometimes, and I have vented to our mutual friends about that topic... In which we all came to the conclusion he was the one needing to shape up on that front, not me. 

I could be here all day for examples, but lets just say as a female who has had abusive physical relations with stepfathers, emotionally abusive mother, and a father who passed recently, I am not taking bullshit. I may get angry, but I walk out of the room so I don’t say something to upset or hurt him more.

He has no filter and no shame sometimes, and when he is reminded that its kinda fucked, he only then realizes.

Please no one tell me to break up, I have thought of it but if I do, I loose my shelter, my mental, and one of the people who has genuinely tried to reach out and help me. I am not saying he is completely a horrible person, but I understand now he is not the best boyfriend material... He is still a good friend and supports me. He just sucks at other things more than others, and I feel horrible due to the fact that I can’t distance myself more due to covid and lack of any other home."
850,I feel like I am not a real human,"Recently I learned that normal people don't feel like they are empty, not real, emotionless. That they don't feel like they are devoid of everything that can characterize a person (I feel as I have no character, no opinions, no agenda, no future, no wants, no traits... the list goes on). Recently I've realized that I am an aromantic asexual but now I've started questioning that because, as I said, I thought the lack of really feeling the feelings was completely normal.

I do not view myself as a human. More like... a being. A pile of flesh without shape or colour. Organs not bound to anything, mind completely blank or behind fog. (Recently I started to suspect the mere fact that in English I prefer it/its pronouns, which are surrounded by the ""dehumanization discourse"").

My inhuman feelings are so intense that I feel like I can relate more to robots and aliens in media than humans. I feel out of place while in public, like I don't belong and everything I do is wrong and everyone watches and knows I am just a fake trying to blend in.

I feel as if my free will is basically non-existent and that there are beings that completely control fate, things that are happening and my thoughts. And even if I feel like that couldn't be real, I still internally believe it. (But that may be just a religion thing)

The thing about my emotions is... I can get sad or happy or angry. I really do. I think so. But when it's over, I still feel as if I have never experienced an emotion. I literally cannot recall what it feels like. The only emotion I can recall how it feels is anxiety because of the physical feeling of something eating my insides and I can't even imagine it, I just remember the description.

When people later tell me that I was, for example, angry, I cannot comprehend, imagine that. I am not able to view myself as one that has emotions. Most of my existence that I can remember is spent in a ""void state"" more than anything. Or that is just the fact that I cannot remember emotions speaking. (oh, the thing about remembering my existence is also funny because I feel like my memory of past events is like a slimy, grey mold in which only small details or images are non-decomposed)(I'm not even going to start talking about my perceiving of time and space, in my mind, my kitchen could be at the same time 5 meters long or 10 meters long, i don't feel or see the difference because I have no idea or sense how long is 5 or 10 meters)

I feel detached from what I text and say, as if it is someone else I am just pretending to be. The real me doesn't exist.

But... sometimes I can feel he is somewhere, hidden deep from sight. The person ""I"" am inside. But now, as I am writing this, the idea that I could be a real person, a someone instead of something, is laughable.

But I think I got a little carried off in this post.

This is where my question comes in. Do people really feel like they are humans? Do people really feel like they have control over their lives? Are people aware of emotions they have experienced in the past?  


I came back to this draft the day after. Or two. Or three. I think it's only one though. I don't remember, honestly. I was never the best with passage of time. Now I wouldn't be able to write that, yet I still relate to lots of things I wrote, now I feel like a completely other person then I was yesterday. But I know... the state I was yesterday will come back, it always comes back. And if I post it now I am ""better"", I will know what to think when I again go 100% while now I am at most at 45%, if not 30%. I am sorry for posting this monstrocity of a post."
851,i forget what it feels like to be happy,that's it. i'm either sad or mad all the time with no middle ground.  i feel bad for my parents for having to deal with me. i hate myself.
852,"My friends don't understand, and it's making me angry.","I was diagnosed with severe psychotic depression. Basically that means you have severe depression for years on end and occasion you basically become freaking schizophrenic for a few months and then go back to being severely depressed. As far as psychologists understand, given the patterns of my specific situation, the severe psychotic episodes are likely to be a recurring feature in my life in the future. 

And my friends won't accept this. I've tried to explain this to them, that the episodes are likely to happen again and for some fucking reason they won't accept it. The issue they have is that I'm very carefully planning my life around it, loose, flexible jobs, no serious relationships, etc etc. But they seem convinced that despite all research pointing otherwise, that I'll something make a complete recovery and never have to deal with this again. 

The last time this happened left me fucking traumatized. I still have nightmares all the time, I can't stop thinking about it and reliving it every day. It's ALWAYS on my mind, I never stop thinking about it and I still have regular (if mild) hallucinations to this day.  

But somehow they just WONT accept that this isn't over for me. I can't talk about my future with them because they won't accept that this is just how I am. It makes me seriously angry. It's like they're invalidating everything I went through. 


No idea what the point of this post was. Just a vent I support. Thanks for reading."
853,how high should my expectations for self-improvement be?,"i've been a shutin for 4.5 years because of social anxiety and self-hatred. I have recently started leaving the house and im trying to get my life together. I have started some projects like making youtube videos but I always seem to set my expectations either to high and fail because it is impossible or too low and fail because it is demotivating. what is wrong? why is it possible to have appropriate expectations? always too high or too low. I made a vlog outside at night where I ramble about this in more detail if you want to watch would be awesome

854,"I don't know if this is an okay post for this sub, but can anyone give me an insight into what supported housing for mental health is like? And if they think it could be the right move for me? (UK)","So, I have mental health issues (obviously) and I've been spiralling for the last year. I've finally realised that I can no longer cope and need professional help. I've also had to move in with my parents recently, and it's not exactly going well. We clash all the time, our lifestyles clash, and while they aren't horrible parents they certainly aren't the best either and their attitudes and behaviours towards me are making me much worse. I simply can't live here anymore. It's killing me. And I don't want to end up being one of those people who hates their parents and never talks to them. And I also don't want to end up running away or killing myself, because I'm getting closer and closer to those things.

A lot of bad things have happened to me recently in a very short space of time, and one of those things was losing my partner who was basically the only person I could talk to about things and be open about my issues. I've gone downhill a lot faster since losing that support and losing having someone who understood me. Due to all the bad things happening, losing my support, my pre-existing issues, and my parents I'm just not coping and I feel desperate just to escape, to get out. To not have to be alone dealing with all this.

The main reason I think I need to consider supported living is that I'm no longer looking after myself properly, or able to monitor myself. I've always been able to do the basics at the very least- eat, sleep, wash, basic cleaning, and knowing how good or bad I feel. But not anymore. I still wash (I've got OCD to thank for that one) but I barely eat due to just not being able to kind of... realise I need to? My sleeping pattern right now is 4am-12midday and I can't seem to fix it even though I want to, I don't clean because I can never think straight so I genuinely don't notice what needs doing even if it's right in front of me, and I no longer can monitor my mental health. I'm in whole new realms that I've not been in before and I feel that if I wasn't living with my parents I would genuinely struggle to live independently without inadvertently getting more and more unhealthy and at risk. I've also had issues before with weed and alcohol which are creeping back in, and I don't wanna go there again. I'm walking around in a haze all the time, my behaviour is totally erratic, and I just feel that I can't do it anymore. I can't look after myself without someone to consistently help me and be there when I need it, and I can't cope with my parents and they are making me worse. I am currently searching for a job so I can get better and also get an income, but it'll be months before I'd be able to move out and I just can't hang on that long like this.  


I feel supported housing would help me because there would be people there to help keep me looking after myself. They'd be able to help me to get to see a doctor and make sure I went, and be able to chaperone (I'm scared of seeing doctors and suffer from anxiety). They'd be able to talk to me about things when I just feel like shit. They'd be able to help me with managing my mental health around working and looking after myself. It just means I could get away from my toxic parents but not be at risk of being entirely independent and alone, because I'm already close to ending up in hospital due to my physical health.   


But when I told my mum, she told me they're horrible places, that I'd be surrounded by dangerous people and it would be really bad. And.. On the phone they asked if I had had any history with arson and said it was for insurance purposes, which isn't exactly encouraging. (It was the YMCA I called)  


Are those kinds of places really scary and full of dangerous people? Or are they actually helpful? Can anyone give me a personal experience on it? Would I be eligible for it? (Obviously I know no one can tell me if I am or not, it's up to the company) I'm in the UK."
855,"They're just thoughts, they can't hurt you.","Every time I start spiraling, this helps me put it into perspective.

It's just a thought. It's not the person I'm imagining, not the situation, not one of the many scenarios in my head -- they aren't real. No matter how realistic it seems to me, at the end of the day, it isn't real. I'm reacting to *thoughts.* They are just thoughts. They can't hurt me. They. Aren't. Tangible. They are only real in my head.

Even if you're mulling over a situation that happened, or how you should have responded to something, or how you just *know* someone will react, stop. 

It's just a thought. It's a figment of your imagination, you can't claim to understand another person to that degree -- and if it's for sure going to happen, if it's for sure going to be painful then understand you're now worrying about it twice. Or three or four or even ten times. 

You know that saying that really confident people say -- that they occupy the headspace of someone else? Don't give them that real-estate. Because it's true -- those are just interpretations of someone, they aren't even the real deal. Why would you let them hurt you even before they've done anything?

The situation might be the worst, and it's okay to prepare for that. But there is a difference between hype fixating and having a plan.

And this realization, no matter how obvious it may seem has really  helped me. Because I realize a thought in my brain isn't owed a reaction. Doesn't even really warrant one. I don't have to feel any type of way. I can acknowledge it as it is: a passing thought, and then move on.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I'll be here all night."
856,"I’m constantly tired and feel like maybe I’ve taken on too much, but mom says I’m not doing *that* much and that I have enough moments of rest","I haven’t worked for a couple years due to battling with severe depression and burnout. Last year was especially hard on my mental health and attempted suicide. Since October, I’ve been trying different activities to keep busy, try to be productive and improve my mental health as suggested by my psychiatrist. 

Lately I’ve been feeling tired, and disappointed at the fact that I don’t have either time or energy to practice what I’m learning, thus making me feel I’m wasting my time and money. However, according to my mom I’m not doing *that* much and I do have enough time to rest.

857,"I think I fear my thoughts. Specifically, of my mind","Hi, I'm new here on Reddit. This is basically my first post. 

I start by saying that I haven't been to a psychologist yet, but I considered to go to one. For now, since I can't afford it yet, I want to read your opinions and your advices. 

I am a 20 years old male, and I think i suffer from some anxety disorder, but I'm not sure if I do(need the official word from the psychologist, I suppose). I fear my thoughts, or to be precise, my mind. There are moments where I'm always wondering what others are thinking, if they are thinking of me, if they are thinking bad of me. There are moments where I'm wondering if I said something wrong or bad, following the need to select the correct words. I always have the feeling that people are judging me. I get anxious if someone ignores me, leaving me wondering on one of the things I wrote before. Also, I hate silence, it makes me uncomfortable. 

I fear my mind. I fear my thoughts because they are able to get free will, like they are alive and are able to control themselves. I suppose I have also to say that I tried various drugs, that may be responsible for this(don't be too judgemental, I'm not some kind of junkie). I tried LSD(1 time, about 4 years ago. It changed me in good and made me more open-minded), MDMA(1 time, 2 months ago. Made me more open-minded), cocaine(4 times, in a timespan of 3-5 months. Had quite a bad trip/time last time I used it(last Saturday; I was very anxious)), XANAX(5 times, in a timespan of 6 months. This always kill my thoughts), Marijuana(I smoke it since middle school, so I've been smoking it for 7-8 years. I don't smoke it daily, though, but like 3-4 times a week) and alcohol(I'm not an alcoholic, I consume it on big events, nightouts, parties, on weekeds, etc). I'm trying to stop smoking cigarettes, but I'm not an heavy user: there were months were I smoked 20+ cigarattes in a week, but now I drastically reduced that number to like 5 a week.

I want to read your opinions and advices, before i go to a psychologist. 

Thanks, and also sorry if I made grammar errors: I'm not an english native speaker."
858,How am I supposed to get over this,"This is going to take some backstory. I’m a teenager, and I have diagnosed BPD. Because of my disorder, I don’t believe I’m able to find a long term partner. That’s not the point. I’ve recently been messaging a girl on Instagram. She’s pretty attractive, and lives in nyc and I live in Chicago. We’ve only been talking and snapping back and forth for a couple days. I just blocked her because I can’t take the stress. I don’t understand it. I’ve felt incredibly lonely for months, why now when I find someone interested in me do I push them out of my life. The person I was with before this, (my first gf) broke up with me the second another guy showed her attention. Her excuse was that I’m too clingy (I had made it clear to her that I had separation anxiety). That screwed me up. I already had trust issues. I just blocked her without warning. I feel bad. I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure how I feel here. Can someone help? Is this normal?"
859,I'm getting mocked and yelled at by my parents(almost every conversation) because I have social anxiety,"I'm not going to retell the story because frankly I'm too tired but I feel like I'm going to snap if I don't say something, somewhere."
860,BETTER,"Lately, I've been feeling good, I haven't been feeling sad or depressed I haven't had thoughts of me hating myself or hating my body. I have been talking to people about the way I feel and I have showing more emotion than I am used to, I have been spending time with some friends but more time with myself and it made me realize that no one is going to have your back than yourself, today I spend the day with myself I went to my college campus and listened to some music and enjoyed the fresh air while I did some homework. I've told myself I have to get comfortable and happy with myself before I am able to do it with other people,  one thing that has helped me is naming my brain and when you feel sad, tell your brain it's going to be okay and give it a mental hug. it may sound ridiculous but give it a shot it may work for you, and if you are reading this I just want you to know that you are loved and things will get better even though you may feel like they aren't right now they will. so try to do something for yourself, take a walk, go outside sit in the sun and listen to music and do some homework. BE BETTER FOR YOURSELF!"
861,Suggestions for online therapy?,"Hey guys,

I haven’t had a constant, regular therapist my entire life despite seeing many of them for intermittent periods of time. I was never well enough to actually work on myself.

Now that I’m in recovery substance-wise and my medications are stable, I’m ready to start looking at moving forward in my life. 

I always see ads for things like Better Help, Talkspace, etc. I haven’t heard any first-hand reviews.

**I need to talk to someone who is qualified and, ideally, someone who specializes in complex trauma and/or ADD. Those are my two main issues.**

If anybody could give me reviews, warnings about certain sites, suggestions, etc- I would be so grateful!

Thank you! ❤️"
862,"i am experiencing extreme loneliness, exhaustion and sadness, i can't afford a therapist and i'm scared.","hey, this is my first post, i am on mobile and English is not my first language. please, bear with me.

i am a 16yo girl, and i am scared, lonely and tired.
i live in an isolated area, in a country where covid hit really hard. i am an only child and my parents need to work crazy hours to survive, so i'm alone 90% of the time. lately, i've been feeling really sad, and no matter how much i rest, my body always feels heavy, like it did when i used to work out 12 hours a week. i wasn't able to see my friends since october 31, 2020, and we barely talk to the phone. also, i go to one of the hardest schools my country has to offer. my teachers have the same empathy a stone could have. maybe stones are even more empathetic than that. they' ve been LOADING us with work, presentations, tests and whatnot. i get good grades, but i study 9 hours every single day (weekends included) to be able to do that, after 5 hours of school, which is 3 days online and 3 days at school, and this fucking terrifies me since I am at risk (me and my mother have weak lungs, at least that's what i've been told). the government keeps pushing us to go to schools and telling everyone that they are safe, when it's clear that they aren't.
y'all, this is taking a big toll on my mental healt. i've tried to deal with it myself, but i need a therapist. i know i need one, i've already been in therapy several times. but my parents cannot afford one. i'm sure that, if i asked, they would try to help me, they are really supportive. but i hear them talking about finances. they are barely making ends meet. i cannot bring myself to ask them such a thing. i don't know what to do. i am lonely and scared. any advice?"
863,How to break out of very long-term negative thought patterns/self-hate,"25F. I've experienced several large professional failures (to the point of needing a career change) that really devastated me. I'm trying to build a new life for myself but I've fallen into extremely negative/anxious thought patterns and was wondering if anyone had any tips for breaking out of very deeply-entrenched self-hatred and negativity. I know the standard stuff like working out and therapy, though I don't currently have the privacy for teletherapy during covid and feel uncomfortable doing text therapy as I don't want a written record.

For context, I've been dealing with mental health issues for a while, diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with panic issues (for the last 15 years), major depression (14 years), anorexia (10 years, remission), PTSD (9 years, remission), and several physical health issues as well. So it's not my first rodeo with mental health problems, but I never figured out how to fix my reflex towards sadness/fear. Not currently on medication but have been for a while.

Thanks all."
864,Crises,"I'm not sure why this happens to/with me, but I've had a lot of moments of crisis very recently, be it about my family, school, or work; but to my surprise, every time, without fail, I've been able to deal with all the problems without really reacting much to the situation.

However, I've started feeling the effects of going through everything later.. it's like if I have a crisis now, I'll be fine and will deal with it well, solve all the problems presented, but it would emotionally hit me like 5- 24 hours later, and then I feel like I'm having an anxiety attack, and I suddenly feel suicidal just to end it, but then everything is just clear, and I feel drained."

866,I don’t know what to do,"Hi, I’m an 18 year old female and im struggling. I wake up everyday with no goal in sight. Everyday is the same, and I much rather stay in my bed all day and play games on my laptop. 
I’m going into my 2nd semester of my first year of college and I still have no idea what I want to do. I have no motivation to want to leave the house or to talk to anyone. 
Im jobless and I have no friends. And I mean it, I really do not have any friends. Anyone I end up talking to online, I end up pushing away in the long run. Its like I want friends, but once I have them, I just don’t wanna be bothered, like I rather just be alone. 
Just a few hours ago, my father and I had an argument. I can now hear in on the other side of the house talking to my mother telling her he needs help getting me out of my room and that all I do is play videogames all day. When in reality, thats the only time I am happy and the only way I can find people similar to me to talk to.
I’m scared if they take away my time and access to what makes me happy that I won’t be happy anymore. 
I really don’t want to do anything other than play on my laptop if I really gotta say so... 

I need help. I need actual advice from someone that is going through or has gone through the same thing.
What they think will help me, I just know wont work..

Any realistic advice helps. Thanks."
867,USA: Is it normal to wait months before being able to see a psychiatrist or therapist?,"I’ve never sought professional help before and I’m struggling, a lot. Every day I face difficult mental health challenges and I’m at the point where I think I need medication to help balance what’s going on. 

I’ve tried hypnosis videos, mindfulness meditation, exercise, ASMR videos, listening to podcasts, etc. without any progress in my mental health. Symptoms just keep getting worse and I feel like I’m at an all-time low.

Well, I’m seeking professional help. I’ve reached out to my health insurance to see which psychiatrists are in my network and met many dead ends with clinics that are either pediatric only (I’m an adult) or the office has been permanently closed. I’m googling psychiatrists in my area and calling and sending emails to all these offices. 

I’ve reached out to over a dozen places. Only one responded. Their soonest availability isn’t until MAY, which is obviously 5 months away. 

I feel like I need help NOW and honestly can’t wait until May. I have an appointment with my PCP so hopefully they can help me by prescribing meds or something but it just sucks knowing that all the specialists are booked out so far. Is this normal? 

In the meantime I might just use one of those therapy apps but I seriously think I need therapy with medication and I’m pretty sure the psychologist on the app can’t prescribe meds."
868,Sister’s Struggles,"Sister’s Struggles

Alright Reddit fam, 

I have never done this before but I am reaching out for some advice/similar stories in regards to my older sister. 

My older sister has always had ADHD and common anxiety since her teens. Despite this, she had a very successful high school career and did well in college. She was a campus representative at a major university and graduated with honors in Marketing. After graduation (2008), she worked for 2 years in a major city and seemed to be on the right track although she had always desired to be a stay at home mother. This made sense, as she was dating a guy that would later become her husband. 

After my ex brother in law finished school, they moved back to our hometown and had a little girl (my niece). Shortly after her birth, they decided to look for a larger home. During this time, they moved in with my parents (2014). Since 2014, she has never moved out. About three years ago, their marriage crumbled and my sister suffered a period of verbal abuse from the guy. Two years ago, they began the divorce proceedings and it was finalized this past summer. 

Over the last three years, my sister has been on a steady spiral. She was literally addicted to her phone in the beginning but seemed normal otherwise. She began drinking and now drinks often in her childhood bedroom at my parents house. She has written checks in my name and refuses to get a job. She attended an inpatient rehab center two summers ago and claims it was a “great experience” but has not heeded any advice. She basically spends her days on social media and just sits in her bedroom. My mom does most of the motherly duties for my niece. Overall, my sister is not impossible to be around except for constant repeating. Over text, she is borderline demonic. She is so cruel and mean to my mom and oldest sister. 

The most worrisome part is her delusional view of the world. She is worried about appearance but has no income and lives with her parents. She constantly claims to talk to her old friends from college and high school, but it is all lies. She has delusions about starting a business on random family recipes and will claim to have developed “business plans” for them(they don’t exist). 

Finally, she does have a therapist and takes ADHD/ anxiety medication. In my opinion, her therapist is not helping. My parents are older and at a loss on what to do next as they love my niece. 

It’s really hard to explain her condition but I hope that was enough info. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
869,I almost pulled the trigger,"A year has passed of issues that I wish I could have avoided.

A year ago I was discharged from the Military and someone who I really loved- left me.

Since then Covid happened, it started as isolation in a RV with no job. Summer came and I was car camping in my Jeep I bought in May and started to work. I was struggling a lot but still managed to have $ coming in and enjoyed driving the Jeep.

It was then September. I accepted a job at a YMCA. Before then my Jeep broke down while offroading. I was stranded an hour north of where the Jeep was sitting since that's where S&amp;R took me. I slept in a pipe for one night- on the one year anniversary of the last time I saw my love who left me. I had to take out a personal loan in order to tow/fix the Jeep.

I started the YMCA job in late September. As things started to go, I got to know another Lady. A lady who I was fond of and began getting attractive to her. 

When things were looking up- I got drunk because I was having a extremely rough day. I was let go the next day because of it and saw the Lady one last time and it was the biggest bitch of a see you later I ever had.

I drove 16 hours to go back to where I'm originally from to get some things in order. However I couldn't stand being there and I couldn't stand being so far away from a Gal I was gettint to know well. I drove back 16 hours less than a week later.

When I got back, I was working at UPS for the season and was living with some people- while waiting to take a 3 hour trip to see her when time allowed.

That leads to right now. Struggling to find the next job. I have to leave in 2 weeks. Never met up with the lady. She left the job and I don't know where she went. Her communication has been bad. 

I've been sitting her for over a month wondering what I did wrong. While being very upset that a mistake cost me more time to be with her at the job I was let go from. The pain from the last few months paired with the trauma of the Military/first lady and everything since. My depresion/anxiety/emotional attacks have continued and are continuing to grow.

Today. I had my gun loaded and had my finger on the trigger. I somehow did not pull it.

Now I'm laying in bed pondering why I did not pull the trigger. Because now the pain from this last year is still lingering and I don't see any end in sight. I am hopeless and fear things won't get better so why the hell don't I just pull the trigger. Im not sure what I am asking of this group. I guess just say what y'all want to say.

TL;DR: This last year has been awful and I'm still in pain. Almost shot myself today. Still don't have hope."
870,(16F) Parents keep telling me to talk to family,"I asked my parents if I could get a therapist to which they said ""we'll see"" but it turned into a no because they don't want another person ""in our business."" They keep telling me that if I'm having trouble with my mental health then I should talk to them or other family members but they're not going to pay someone else for me to talk to them. 

I absolutely hate talking to my parents because they just don't seem to understand. Last night I had an anxiety attack and my dad kept asking what's wrong but I literally couldn't tell him because I didn't know myself, but he proceeds to say, ""Well if you say that to a therapist then they won't do anything for you."" He began to get frustrated because I couldn't respond to anything he was saying because I didn't know what to say so he says he's going to call 911 because he doesn't want me to hurt myself (which I wasn't I was literally just having an anxiety attack???). 

He also thinks that by me being a black woman and going to the therapist, he thinks that they'll put it on my record and it'll keep me from going to college, getting a job, or anything else in life. He thinks that if I say ""the wrong thing"" to the therapist then I'll get taken away and they might go to jail or something. My thing is they literally provide me with everything I need, it's just when it comes to my mental health they think everything is going to go south. My dad said that I should talk to them and if they decide that it's something they can't handle then they'll send me to a therapist (it's probably a lie).

My dad keeps asking if it's because I'm inside all the time and I'm like no and he asked me if I want to do anything. I just don't want to hang out with my parents because I'm literally around them 24/7. I haven't seen any of my friends since last March.

I literally don't know what to do at this point because I seriously feel like I have some kind of mood disorder or social anxiety disorder. I used to be an extrovert and very talkative but as I got older I've become an introvert and only talk to a few people that I trust and I rarely want to go outside unless it's with friends.

TLDR: My parents don't want me to go to a therapist because they believe it will come with severe consequences, so they want me to talk to family instead."

The recent episode of this, is that my kiddo asked if I was going to die or he was going to die because of Christmas. He keeps mentioning that this “mother god and father god” will kill if people don’t listen to them.  I know they say religion is a hot topic button for court and they don’t really like to get involved with it, but I feel this is really really unhealthy and it is really alarming that my little 4 year old is processing this and is frightened.

Are they really evil or is it just in my head?"
875,OUR FEELINGS ARE 100% VALID,"Our feelings are valid, but our feelings DO NOT define us. Whether we are happy, sad, excited, or depressed, those feelings don’t define our identity—those are just emotions that pass through us for a short amount of time. 

These emotions help shape our identity and do not identify who we are as people. We are not sadness, anxious, fearful, or depressed. We FEEL those emotions; whether it be for a short or long time. Knowing when to separate ourselves from those emotions take practice and mental strength. 

Let’s choose to be aware of our emotions rather than identifying ourselves as them. 

Let’s always choose to HAVE A STRONG DAY."

877,I called someone a racial slur in anger as a kid when I was in a depression induced rage,"I called someone who was bullying me the n word with a hard r. This was probably around 16 or 20 years ago when I was around 12. I have some hearing issues and didn't realize the difference between the 2 ways of saying it (a vs r). I don't say either anymore, and I also didn't know the history of the word. I wanted to fit in with some Mexican friends who were using it and the c slur word.

At the time of the incident I was been bullied extensively and was sucidial/depressed. I used to get depression rages where I would say the dumbest things imagianble and becone a completely different person. This doesn't excuse my actions

One day after I had been injured by another student (someone stabbed me. It wasn't that bad but I bleed a bit) this girl kept asking me why I got the guy who stabbed me suspended. This played on my thoughts of no one caring about me and I took out all of my anger on her. She started pushing me and I called her the n word a few times. I deeply regret it and feel like I am still less than human. I apologized multiple times over the years but I still hate myself for doing this to someone else. I am also concerned over doing anything a lot of things since this could come back to hurt me. I am scared of it being brought up on social media or something.

I am doing better now that I am medicated but I am still embarrassed by my behavior. It doesn't define who I am today but I truly hate my old behavior. I also want to try and be a better person but I have a hard time thinking about my past."
878,I [23F] feel like I'm drowning in an array of mental health issues that I do not understand.,"I've struggled with mental health for as long as I can remember however I don't think I've ever reached a low like I've been experiencing for the past two years. I'll mention that although I've been medicated for anxiety and depressive disorders in the past, I'm not currently taking any due to multiple overdose attempts. I've been to counsellors and therapists but I never feel like I'm able to be transparent about my feelings even if I'm really trying to be. It's been a challenge to express what I'm actually feeling inside even to the people ""close"" to me. To put it bluntly, I feel zoned out probably 75% of my day if not more. I'm in a constant state of worry or regret and I overthink so much about little details that everything around me becomes a blur. Sometimes I literally get tunnel vision especially when I'm overwhelmed. When people talk to me, I'm listening but I realize that I'm not actually taking in any information. I don't feel like I relate to anyone around me, I've let so many friendships/relationships fade because of this. I think about the people I love the most dying and how guilty I'm going to feel for spending all the time I had left with them paralyzed from depression. There is always this divide between me and reality that I can't quite describe. It's like I'm watching life from the outside and I can't quite breakthrough to be present or enjoy it.  Sometimes I try so hard to figure myself out that I don't feel ""real"". Lately I've been experiencing this feeling when I'm intimate with my boyfriend that I don't know how else to describe as ""floating"" out of my body and then I start to have a panic attack. I know all this information has no structure but there's no better way to describe it. I'm unable to *stay* happy because every time something lifts me up all I can focus on is how I will feel in it's absence. I feel exhausted all the time, all I want to do is sleep but I hate waking up just to do it all over again."

I’ve been on and off many types of medications over the years but not anymore. I know I have many more issues I haven’t had the chance to address/get checked up for so I’m not sure if it’s a crucial part to include in order to get the right kind of therapy.

I’ve been in therapy since 2015 until some parts of 2018. I switched between multiple free-provided youth therapists who didn’t provide exactly what I needed. I’m now an adult, so I can access sources that are much more specific. 

_________________________________________
I would like to work on the following:

- Mild shocks and panic attacks
- Nausea and emotional exhaustion
- Paranoia / Anxiety
- Obsessive compulsions to control objects or people
- Dissociative states / Isolation
- Frequent feelings of intense emotions, both good and bad. 
- Insecurity and Shame
- Frequent feelings of anger and wanting to lash out physically
- Trust issues
——————————

I hope this is enough to help figure out what I should look for when trying to care for myself and seek for help.

What I’ve been doing so far to keep myself grounded and emotionally stable hasn’t been enough. So, any small amount of information helps.
Thank you!"
881,Today I went to a WERQ class,"I joined a gym and today went to my first WERQ class, alone. My anxiety has taken a toll on me, almost to the point I’m too afraid to leave my house. I can stay home all day but unfortunately I can’t get away from my thoughts. I’m trying to get out of my comfort zone and I’ve always wanted to do a dance fitness class but haven’t been brave enough. Before leaving I expressed my fear of having a panic attack when I got there to my fiancé. I then started getting nervous about working out in a mask and I almost turned around on the way there. I got there early and when I was looking for the bathroom I did start walking into the men’s locker room but luckily I noticed before seeing anyone lol. Anyways, I was self conscious. I’m 26 years old, 210 lbs and only 5”3. We were surrounded by mirrors and I was so embarrassed that the others were judging my appearance. Once it started I was so focused on myself that I didn’t have much time to think about what the others are thinking. I was EXTREMELY off beat, I can’t dance and I’m sure I through all the other people off but I had a lot of fun. I even almost cried during it because I felt like it saved me."
882,How do I ask for therapy?,"I’m only 14 and I am known as the happy nice girl that goes to my school. I’ve felt different for a while and I don’t know if it’s depression, but something is definitely wrong. I have been showing symptoms that are found in multiple different mental illnesses. I don’t want to be the person that pretends to have Mental illnesses but I have that voice in the back of my head that says I’m faking it for attention.
How do I ask my parents for therapy without making them feel like it’s their fault or male them upset that I have trouble talking to them? Do I even need therapy or am I being over dramatic?"
883,Will someone please talk to me?,"It's 3am, I'm all alone and I'm thinking about suicide. I need someone to talk to."
884,How does suicide impact someone,"Even if my brain tells me she is sick of me being around and is only doing it because she is afraid of me going out and dying like she knows I want to.

&amp;#x200B;

She broke up with me, she moved on. She does not have to hang out with me still every day, does she? Does she do this because of guilt? Does she do this because she still deep down cares? Am I making her rot???? ? ?   


 I dont want to end her happy. Will my death impact her, tell me it will. talk me out ofit pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeei"
885,Happiness,"First of all, sorry for bad english
Im 20 and i came to realize that i never felt happiness in my life. In a certain way I guess I always knew it, but it never bothered me because I thought it was normal for everyone to feel like shit most of the time, but I suppose it's not. Even though I have no reason to feel shitty, I think my mind don't think I'm worthy of being happy, every time something good happens to me I manage to fuck it up in my mind.
I talked about it with my parents and I'm going to see a psychiatrist for the first time, I hope it gets better.
If you read it all and you feel sad too, just know you don't have to. Don't give up"
886,Want to share some extremely helpful resources,"Tools that have significantly helped me manage my anxiety!!

Over the past year I was struggling with my anxiety. I started listening to these podcasts, cleared out my instagram and followed these accounts, and meditating every day through apps. These have all been so beneficial to me I wanted to share and help anyone else struggling ❤️

Some self help podcasts that have been extremely  beneficial to me are: The one you feed podcast on spotify, go friend yourself podcast, The anxiety chicks podcast, small things often podcast, Hardcore Self Help podcast- the first one (my favorite) interviews drs, authors, professors etc having to do with bettering mental health. The others are by therapists so you learn a lot of techniques and information about mental health. I highly recommend all of these Ive been listening to one a day and it has significantly improved my anxiety.

I also follow accounts on instagram that are very beneficial for learning, community, and encouragement including: @theanxietyhealer @nedratawwab @drorbeaustin @honestlyholistic @thebehappyproject @anxiety_wellbeing @charlotte.nc.therapy @realdepressionproject @bootcampoflife @thirdeyethoughts @myselflovesupply @dlcanxiety @regen_health @the_depression_chronicles11 @healing_notes_ @what.is.mental.illness @to.a.happier.world @millenial.therapist @psych_today @global_mental_health_support @gmf.designs

I also highly recommend using the apps: Calm (extremely helpful- lessons &amp; meditations &amp; sleep stories) or sanvello (mood log, information, meditations)"
887,I hate sleeping cause it means I'll be alone with thaughts.,"Whenever it's time to go to sleep, I dread it and avoid going to bed as long as I can. So I usually stay up as long as I can, until I'm too tired and just collapse. The reason? Well first of all, as the title says, i don't want to be alone with myself. When there is nothing to distract me, i always think back to a certain thing and it scares me. All I can do is occupy my mind to avoid it, so when I'm finally laying in bed, i recite prayers ad infinitum and get up every five minutes to check all the corners in my room. Sometimes it takes hours until my body finally gives in and I fall asleep. 
Also, i feel so useless when sleeping. I mean, i don't really do much right now, with the whole pandemic and stuff it's hard to find a job and I'm afraid I'm not really university material. And when I wake up the next day, i feel worse than before. But that's not the end. I always set my alarm too keep me from spending more than 7 hours in bed. But everytime it wakes me up, i just fall asleep right after turning it off. I can't help it. 
So every day starts with another defeat. Another reminder of how pathetic i am. I mean, if i can't even manage such a visit thing like sleeping, how will I ever get my life in order?"
888,My dog just passed away and I don't know how to feel about it.,"My family dog named ""Joey"" passed away suddenly in his sleep a couple of hours ago. He was 13 years old. I (23M) don't really know how to handle loss like this. Lately I've been in a very depressed state, to the point where I don't really feel anymore. I think I feel like crying, but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't because I'm happy he has passed, as he was facing illness and wasn't the same for the past couple of weeks. I'm really confused as to how to feel about this. I thought this would hit me much harder than it has. I feel like I lack emotion."
889,"I can't do work, but don't want to do anything until work is finished, so I never do anything","I have assignments I'm behind on, and theres one in particular that's almost a month late, that I just can't do.

I open it up, look at it, possibly write one or two words, but then my brain just stops working. I can stare at it for hours and still not do anything. 

I have other things I want to do, like build models (I got some for Christmas), but I can't let myself do it until I do my work.

Idk what's wrong with me."

893,I finally did it! I finally am in control of my life,"I don’t know where to put this, I just want to. The past year has sucked. Anxiety and depression have become controllers in my life. I hated my major (physics), and kept doing it because my mom wanted me to (long story of a very toxic family). Today I went, and without thinking twice I changed my major. My mom doesn’t know. But I’m working towards what I WANT; to be a lawyer. I switched to an English major, Pre-Law minor. I’m terrified. I have so much work to do: catching up on work, I have to apply for loans and do some things so I’m financially independent 100% (so my mom can’t use that to guilt-trip me anymore), and simply the aspect of dealing with the very real possibility of getting disowned by my mom when I go home for the summer, and the very least her gaslighting and manipulation. But despite how scared I am, I feel totally in control of my life. I have never felt so confident, and just like I can do anything I want because this is MY LIFE, not hers. I’m so proud of myself, and have even been able to handle extreme anxiety today extremely well. I am just so proud of myself and feel so confident. I have never walked with my head held higher than I have today. I finally see a happier future for myself."
894,why do i get randomly irrationally angry??,"i get these really aggressive moments of irrational anger, for no reason. like i am just talking to someone or smth and i suddenly switch and get so mad i can’t even function. i feel so guilty but i cant stop even though i know im hurting them?? i don’t know why im like this and what i can do to fix it"

Every little thing reminds me of them. Every time I think about them I get this pain in my chest and I want to just sob.

I was playing my favorite game and I thought I saw them in my online cue. (Similar username)

I was in a voice chat with other friends so I didn’t cry right them, but the second they got off I burst into tears

I feel like this is actively killing me. What do I do?"

I’m not going to lie I am an overly emotional person, I do tend to react out of emotion, but that’s an issue that stems from looooongg ago. Without getting into detail how can I confirm that these people are trying to twist my perception of what really happened instead of what they want me to THINK what happened??"
899,delusions,"so I've never told another soul this before and I just wanted to get it off my chest. throughout my teens I had mild hallucinations and delusions. when I was 13-14 I'd stay up until 3am every night for an entire summer believing the world was going to end. and when I was around the same age, maybe 15 or 16 at the latest, I believed monsters were going to come kill and eat me. my room was in the basement, I would stay up under the covers believing so intently that it was about to happen that I could almost hear the sound of thudding footsteps beginning in the hall and running above me and fumbling down the stairs. at times I'd even have anxiety attacks over these things. 

and when I was around 17-18 I had mild auditory and visual hallucinations. it was things like, hearing screams that didn't happen. or hearing my name called. or just thinking I heard something. and it was things like seeing stuff in the corner of my eye. black and white shapes, shadows. just seeing flashes of stuff that wasn't there. 

all of these things happened at periods in my life when I was incredibly isolated and alone and had very unhealthy lifestyle habits. it doesn't really happen anymore, the last thing I can remember that could hardly count would be over the summer when I thought the veins in my wrists were glowing,
but to be fair I was in the middle of a panic attack, caused by delusions. I was 21, now 22. and the past couple months have been a struggle for me to keep my head above water. over the summer I was having delusions and anxiety attacks believing the world was ending. I thought it was gonna happen last summer. it didn't. I snapped out of it. then something triggered me late November and I thought it was going to happen on December 21st, that the Mayan calendar was right all along and it was just off a few years. didn't happen. 

and now I'm walking a very fine line of being okay, and falling off the deep end again. logically, I know this is all delusional and I know it's completely in my mind. and as much as I don't want to admit there's something wrong with me, I know I'm mentally ill and I can't control it. right now I'm mostly afraid of becoming triggered again and plunging into severe delusions and panic attacks. as long as nothing triggering happens, I think I'll be okay in a few weeks. obviously with Covid I'm very isolated and the past few months I haven't been healthy - bad diet, no exercise, no aspirations. for the last couple weeks I've gotten in a bad habit of sleeping most of the day and being awake at night, so I don't see the sun very much and every time I've fallen into this habit, I've spiraled and gone a little nuts. 

like, over the summer I was painting my room and I would be awake from sunset til dawn for a few days and that wreaked havoc on my mental health. it happened also in May/April, started having severe anxiety and dread constantly and I got better when I got out in the sun for a few days. so I know that I need to get sun and good nutrition and exercise again and I'm going to. I was in a bit of a depressive haze the past couple weeks but I can feel myself coming out of it so I'm gonna start being healthy again and I know that'll help. 

again, I know I'll be okay. but right now I'm teetering on the edge and I'm afraid that one little thing is going to happen that's gonna send me into a spiral. the Jan 6 terrorist attack and the 4 earthquakes in CA, Indonesia, and the Argentina past week almost did it. I feel absolutely sick rn bc of them thinking it's the end times bc of the earthquakes. and I KNOW it's delusional but I'm so anxious I feel like I could throw up. just needed to get this off my chest."
900,I get physically tired when I try to move away from negative thinking.,"So at work today I was trying my hardest to switch every negative thought to a good one, or even just sing a song in my head. But doing that made me sooo tired, any advice, or why this happens?"
901,awakenings,"hi!! i just wanted to vent that i made my bed today for the first time in 12 months!! it felt good to do so, and i’m going to do it everyday now afterwards. i used to do it every single morning pre pandemic before going to work. but considering i’ve been unemployed since this all started last March, it’s been unmade and my room had gotten increasingly dirty/messy. not anymore bitch! 

my New Years resolutions mainly include:
1. finding internal and external self-love
2. thinking more positively about myself 
3. getting more connected/paying attention to my surroundings and the earth around me 
4. stop letting yesterday define your thoughts, only thinking presently 
( multiple other but this is the jist ) 

it’s been hard, but if anyone else too is struggling with finding themselves and self love. one thing i’ve been doing every night is thanking a body part for what it’s done for me that day. along with not thinking about what you thought about yesterday and live more in the now. i read something that said to treat your body like you would your pet or something you care about, you wouldn’t ever want to self harm the thing you care about or give them foods that make them sick purposely or tell them negative things. so why do it to your own body? 
i’ve taken that along with me, and it’s made me feel more in control. it’s hard, but i know it’s improving myself starting somewhere. it’s been a while."
902,Is it normal to have an imaginary friend at age 17?,"I'm 17 years old. I have this character I draw sometimes... It's a dragon-like creature. He has a name and a personality I made up.

About 2 weeks ago, after a verbal fight with someone, he kinda started talking to me in my head when I was upset. I don't see him or anything. Just kinda mentally know it's him. He's really nice and he lets me vent about stuff when I'm frustrated . I told my online friends and they said it isn't normal.

It's kinda like he's almost another part of me. I zone out a bit when I talk to him in my head.

I've been diagnosed with depression for 6 years. Recently (well, 7 months ago) I had to move away from all my real-life friends. Since last march when school was shut down, I haven't talked to anyone my age. Since I moved, I've been in 100% virtual school and I hardly leave the house because my parent is paranoid about me getting them sick. I get very lonely sometimes and idk if my imaginary dragon buddy has something to do with that.

Just wondering if what I'm experiencing is normal for someone my age that's really lonely idk."
903,"About a week ago, I talked my best friend out of committing suicide and I still can't get it off my mind.","I feel absolutely terrible making this about myself, but I'll just use this post to vent. My best friend tried to take his own life last week and the only reason he didn't was because I randomly messaged him in the middle of the night to ask how he was. We're pretty open about our mental health to eachother and we've helped eachother with our mental health more times than I can count. He responded to me by saying he was doing something and to leave him alone, but for some reason I sensed something was wrong and I kept pushing, one thing let to another and now I'm crying my eyes out, texting him not to do it, while all he's saying is how much he's sorry and continuing to selfharm with the intention of killing himself. After the longest hour and a half of my life, he gave up and passed out. He went to the hospital the next day and talked to professionals and everything so he's fine for now. Yet I can't stop thinking about it. It's 6 am right now and I can't sleep, because I can't stop thinking about it. What if I didn't randomly message him, or what if I failed at talking him out of it? I can't get those thoughts out of my head, even dreaming about it when I do manage to sleep. I'm just really glad he's okay, because he's literally everything to me and I don't know what I would do if I lost him."
904,An old colleague has been posting inspirational stuff for his...inspiring business?,"He posts so many ""inspirational"" things... ""change your perspective!"" ""Do this thing!"" ""Think about THIS question!"" He turns the negative into a positive. It just irritates me.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what it is like to be neurotypical? Jeez. When I have something bad happen, my brain is fixated on it no matter what I do.  I KNOW that I am jealous of his mentality but seeing him just boast and boast and boast about his broken things creating a new 'possibility' in his life DRIVES ME NUTS. I feel personally attacked, even though I know it's not directed at me.

905,Question on Weighted Blankets for mental health,"So I have a good question. I have been doing research into trying to find homeopathic ways to help my mental health, and I know that can be both a good thing and a bad thing as some homeopathic treatments can be bad for certain ailments, but this is one I have been told helps.

I have a Spectrum Disorder, couple that with a likely mental health issue or two (apparently there is a bit of a history on my dad’s side. Interestingly, I didn’t learn about until I was 22) and a job kicking my ass, that I just need to find a way to self-care myself.

Anyhow, I have been looking into buying a weighted blanket and I have read it is good for a lot of things including mental health and ASD. Does this hold true for anyone in the group?"
906,What do i expect for first psychiatrist appointment?,"I was referred to a psychiatrist for medication by my therapist. My appointment is tomorrow. I’m wondering if they ask you questions like a questionnaire type thing read off of a paper? Or do you have to do a ton of explaining? My first therapy appointment was about 2 years ago, and I remember she asked me questions off of a sheet, like an evaluation. Will the psychiatrist do the same thing? A couple weeks after my first therapy, my therapist diagnosed me with depression. This was a long time ago. I think I need to be reevaluated, and I just wanna know if my psychiatrist will do this too, and I’m scared they will misdiagnose me and put me on medication that does not help."
907,I reached out to a Mental Health Therapist to ask about “ANXIETY.”,"Hey Reddit Fam!

I hope everyone is doing their best to keep mentally healthy and strong during this time. 

The term “anxiety” has been showing up more within the news and social media. I wanted to help you all by asking a Mental Health Therapist what exactly is anxiety and some ways to overcome it.

I was fortunate to have John Gaspar—a practicing Mental Health Therapist in Los Angeles—come and talk to me about himself, explain anxiety, and give some ways to overcome it.

908,How to deal with ppl who act like your mental health issues is no big deal?,"Hey I have this friend who often brushes off my anxiety issues as if its no big deal. She often says ""I have anxiety to everyone deals with it"" (she has has not been diagnosed she's speaking in a general way when say says this). I find this very hard to deal with because I actually have been diagnosed and have been try to talk to her about me having a difficult time. Whether its about school or work she brushes it of by saying she has anxiety about school and work too and that everyone goes through with it and when I told her that its diffrent because I've been diagnosed and its not a joke its serious too me but she always says ""ya but everyone has it some people are just not diagnosed."" Its hard for me to deal with this because I am trying to be serious about my issues but it seems like she's saying I have issues too your being dramatic

Has anyone faced anything similar and if so how do you deal with it? How do others deal with people generalizing mental health issues cause I've seen people normalize things like OCD and ADHD as well. Is it annoying or am I getting triggered over something that I can ignore? Any thoughts would be great!"
909,Current events and mental stability?,"I know I am not the only person here who has had a sharp decline in their mental health throughout the events of 2020 (Pandemic/Civil Unrest/Election). But right now, with a change of presidency looming, I don’t feel any better than I did a few months ago. 

I am not going to single out “sides” and turn this into a politically charged rant, but I do want to say that the current instability of American politics is really freaking me out. 
 
I’ve been looking into a lot of different media sources/social media posts on both sides of the spectrum and I can’t help but feel that there is a deep divide that cannot be fixed. 

I used to be able to talk about current events with family members with no issue, but now we have had to make a “no politics” rule due to some insane screaming matches.  Even at work, nobody dares bring up the state of the country. 

I know that everything will most likely end up fine, but I have a deep underlying anxiety that it’ll somehow get worse and lead to a major catastrophe.   

I haven’t been doing well for a while, but the fear of society breaking down makes it so much worse to the point where I am not even participating in life anymore!! 

For those with more life experience than me, how did you break out of this rut??"
910,I had my first therapy appointment,"Friday I had my first 50 minute session! I basically word vomited all over my therapist but I love her and she understood. I’m overcoming an abusive relationship &amp; major ptsd along with anxiety and depression (obviously) it was so relieving, although I felt exhausted after the session it feels like such a good start. I’m so excited for  the next few months. Just a humble brag, we are all on our own journey so don’t feel guilty if you haven’t got therapy or don’t feel comfortable enough to, we’re all doing the best we can. K love you bye"
911,Not sure what to do.,"For the longest time I been trying to get a job at a bank because I genuinely believed it will be the perfect job for me. Finally, by 23 I got it this passed year. It’s been nearly 6 months and I feel overwhelmed  and unmotivated. I struggle to wake up every morning and I’m been stressed. Sometimes I throw up in the morning only on days when I work. This is The most I have been stressed. I have this humongous weight on my shoulders on performance, customer satisfaction, and well my job duty. Sometimes I feel way out of my element, and there’s days where I wanna give up. I’m not driven by money, I’m driven by the satisfaction. I was a art student in HS, I drew and like creating things. I was raised in poverty, so art school was not an option. I’m currently enrolled in a university for my business degree in finance. My biggest fear in high school was choosing the wrong career path. I hope I didn’t.....I feel lost, confused and mostly unmotivated. I like the job, but I feel tired, so stressed and I believe I develop this weird anxiety. Not sure what to do."
912,I want to feel normal but I can’t,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was a child, leaving the house with “a bad feeling in my tummy” but couldn’t figure out what was causing it. My mom took me to an herbalist and brought home medicine that was so nauseating I can still taste it. I had my first panic attack at 17 and went to the doctor for the first time by myself. He asked if I had ever thought about suicide and i said I had thought about it but never would, so he called my parents. They responded by locking me in my room and complaining about the bill for “my little doctor visit”. At 22 my grandpa admitted to sexually abusing me as a child on his death bed, which explains a lot of memories I couldn’t flesh out completely. Memories of my cousins also taking advantage and I couldn’t figure out where it was all coming from. I hugged him and told him everything was OK. That I was ok. But I’m not. I can’t shower. I lay in bed until I feel guilty enough to get up. I only eat so I don’t feel sick. And I drink to take away the pain. I’m 30 now. And I still feel so much anger. I am so lucky because I have a good husband and a roof over my head but I can hardly bring myself to do normal everyday things. I’m scared I’m going to lose him and my life. I blame my past but I feel like it’s a cop out. I feel like I’m just lazy and ungrateful. I have made so many bad decisions in my life and I finally found someone who loves me. I’m so tired of repeating bad habits and using people I love to boost me up when I’m down and giving nothing in return because I don’t have the energy. I need this cycle to end because when it rains it pours and life is throwing so many financial hardships at me right now that I need to grow up and deal with it. I guess I’m wondering how you guys do what you do to keep going? How do I let go of the past and live for today?"

Any advice on how to deal with ADHD symptoms?"
915,Imposter,"I'm a professional and I struggle so hard with imposter syndrome. I get so tired of trying to know and remember it all. Sometimes it feels like I don't have space to myself. To be myself. 

My friends seem to all move on and collect all sorts of accomplishments and credentials. I'm so proud of them, and I noticed that I then feel guilty that I'm not doing more. I feel guilty I'm not moving mountains, or finding a way to balance work/life/social life/further education/etc etc...

Thought stopping helps, getting encouragement from my trusted people helps, and reading helps. But what else could I try to combat this stupid imposter syndrome? I'm tired of feeling like I'm still years behind in a process I'm not sure I can catch up to. My expectations and my ambition are not matching up."
916,Should I do my practicum?,"I have a history of anxiety and depression and the past few months have been challenging. I have not been sleeping well, I feel anxious and sad. I am also in the educational assistant program in Canada. I applied for a practicum for this semester a few months in advance. Now I am thinking of postponing it because I do not feel like I can handle what is expected of me with my declining mental health. On one hand I could take time that I would have used for this practicum to focus on my mental health. This includes talking to councillors and my doctor, exercising and trying eat healthy. On the other hand the practicum could encourage me to grow and maybe my anxiety will feel better if I just do the practicum?  I think I know what I want to do I just need some perspective."

I could be walking down the hallway and then I blink, and suddenly I'll be walking out the door. Earlier today I was at the marketing offices where I work and I was walking by my bosses office when I woke up awkwardly on the stairs, i nearly fell. It's like I'm having fucking mental lapses, it's really fucking scaring me and I'm thinking about seeing a psychologist for it."
919,Feeling extremely alone,Ever since covid started I haven’t been feeling like myself mentally. I had to move back in with my parents which isn’t the worst thing in the world but I just feel like I’m not being treated as an adult which has caused me to not really trust my parents enough to tel them how I feel. I feel my friendships slowly drifting away with everyone. I’ve just felt extremely lonely which has lead to me using marijuana to cope with my problems way too much. I feel like everyone is judging me all the time and I just don’t feel comfortable talking to the people I used to talk to about everything.
920,Feeling better and am here if needed,"I have been in a really bad mental state for the past 3 weeks, and I think that I am starting to feel better. I am very glad for the people I have been able to help, and that have helped me as well.

922,I (31F) am dating someone (29M) that has habits that turn me off and I don’t know how to handle it(TMI),"

I recently met a man that is very thoughtful and sweet but his habits are completely turning me off and I don’t know how to handle it. We’ve gone on handful of dates but it’s progressively getting worse.

He picks at his skin a lot. Mainly his facial skin but sometimes his scalp too. He then smells the flakes and sometimes eats them. He tries to hide it a little bit but I tend to see him doing it in plain sight. I’ve also caught him attempting to smell my underarms while cuddling. I always wear deodorant and have never had someone do this. 

I have no idea how to approach it. Should I bring it up and ask him to stop? Do I just stop seeing him and spare him the reason? I don’t understand it but it is a complete turn off and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I also don’t know why he is doing it or the root cause but know it makes me not want to kiss him. 

TL;DR- man I met recently has habits that are making me lose attraction for him"
923,Please help,I’m and 8th grader and it feels like my mom only cares about my grades and not my mental health. I don’t know what to do anymore and she always compares me to other students who are doing better than me and always downplays my feelings by saying everyone is going through it. If my grades are bad she threatens to take away my phone and playstation which are the only things that help me get rid of stress. I just need help on what to do and how to get her to understand that i need help and she’s just making it worse for me.
924,Parents are Unhealthy,"When I get caught on my phone late at night, my mom will LITERALLY do a victory dance and grab my phone. When I cant remember to take my meds, they say I am perpousfully forgetting them, and when I bring up a mental health concern, they say im fine. I have severe mood swings and can go from happy, to irritated, to energetic, to depressed in the course of 10 minutes, and when I bring this up, they say that Im fine. I also will be very angry over some things like having to take the trash out and will refuse to do it. I will scream and yell about it without even thinking. I will end up just crying myself to sleep in my room about 5 min later. I try to get them to let me talk to my docter 1 on 1 because I dont like them in the room. This has lead to all sorts of stuffing down emotions. Im not sure where to go at the moment, but what I guess I could start at is getting some 1 on 1 with my Doctor."
925,"Getting better, hope it stays this way","Hi, so i don’t know if this is the place to post this but the past week I’ve been feeling so much better. I’ve started to listen to music that makes me feel better and trying to spend less time on my phone by putting it another room or not carrying it with me everywhere.  I’ve started working out again every day except today bcos I’m having trouble to find the motivation but don’t worry! I’ll find it haha. Anyways I’ve also been waking up early in the morning and drinking coffee in the morning and water all day. I just feel so much better by telling myself everyday what stresses me out and what wont bug me. And I started reading again, right now I’m reading “the giver” and the “the alchemist”

For the past few months I’ve been feeling so sad, I stopped working out and sleeping in till the afternoon and spending so much time on social media mindlessly scrolling and stalking past friendships and my ex. And just not eating healthy by starving myself for a day and then eating a bunch of junk food the Next day. It was like that for a few months, and I was so stressed out about my work. I work in a grocery store, and it leaves me so exhausted and I don’t really get along with this coworker bcos of the way she is but I’m not gonna let her bother me. And just being so stressed with trying to apply to the university I want to apply too. 

I’m not professionally diagnosed with anything but I hope my mental health stays this way, I’ve just been feeling so hopeless the past few months. And I’m gonna work so hard to stay this way and know that it’ll be okay if I have a bad day, it doesn’t mean I have a bad life. I hope everything works out for me in the future, I know it will. ✨ it’s so cheesy to say but I’m gonna manifest it."
926,I'm struggling," summary of me.
I'm a college student 17 years old 
Lack of motivation(I don't know if that's the right word to use) it's no matter what I lack the motivation to do the slightest of things even such as brushing my teeth.

I keep falling behind in everything such as  assignments and work and that this point I'm barely getting my work done by grinding out whole assignments in one day out of fear of being kicked off my course. 

Lack of social drive and confidence-not to the point where I can't use shops but to the point where I refuse to call people or try to make friends and whenever I try to do so or think about I get an overwhelming crushing feeling of anxiety telling me to stop.

My fear of being kicked off my course came back after being gone for a few weeks and during those weeks I missed several assignments of which I didn't even start I'm sick of being called lazy. 

I'm sick of being like this, I'm sick of this burning pain inside me that Paralysises me everyday. 
However I get this sense I don't really know how to describe it, it's like a pushing force keeping me going telling me not to give up but it's constantly being weighed down by this crushing force. 
I believe this crushing force is fear.
fear of the future 
fear of living
 fear of dying
 fear of people such as judgement
 being hated eventhough I know I'm not hated and that no one is going to judge me 
fear of uncertainty 
fear of losing the few friends I have left 
fear of being alone for the rest of my life
Fear of never being able to get a job or live my life 
Fear of you get the point I can go on forever. 
I can't handle these feelings anymore I don't know how much else I can describe it.
 it's as if my soul is on fire and everything burns in this unbearable pain that shoots through my mind and body. 
It feels like one part of me is telling me to give up and give in while the other is fighting to keep me alive and going and not giving up. 

At this point I'm struggling to get by with the only thing keeping me alive is my bodies instinctive motives to eat, drink and sleep. 
Please help me.

927,Is it depression or laziness if I’m just tired of if all?,"
Three years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. I was out on bad meds, tried to kill myself, hospitalized, put on better meds, and sent to therapy.

The meds, Venlafaxine/Effexor if it matters, made feeling thing beside constant anger and despair possible. It made the pain much more bearable. The therapy didn’t help or hurt. 

I haven’t tried to kill myself again. I’ve reigned in my eating disorder on my own, and can function. I can do things, like pass classes for my Masters and shower and talk to people when I have to.

But I don’t want to. I don’t want to do anything. I want to stay curled in a ball and stare at the wall, everyday, until it’s time for me to get up and do the things I have to do. I don’t enjoy anything. But the soul crushing pain isn’t there either. I’m just tired. I’m constantly putting off work, but not enjoying the time I spend not working either. I know my anxiety is a thing, I’m afraid to start tasks or talk to people in professional settings, or fail, and I fantasize of hurting myself sometimes, like I used to. Just to feel like, I have a solution. I don’t know if I want the pain to justify feeling like this useless and lazy, or I feel like this because I actually have issues. 

But whatever it is, my issues don’t feel real enough, to me. I feel like I’m exaggerating it all in my head. Is there any way to differentiate this? Tough love is okay, if that’s what it seems like I need. I do try to do the whole journaling and getting outside thing. Thanks for reading."

This is my last hope to get in contact with her but I seriously doubt I can.
929,"I isolated myself from all my online friends, and it's been hard to adjust.","It's been a while since I made a post in general, but I figured it's worth mentioning. I feel like I should also mention,  I can't seek out professional help right now. I just turned 21 and so I lost my health insurance lol.

Last year, back in July, I finally broke up with my ex of four years. I still loved him but I needed to do it because he was a very toxic person. I loved being around him and I always had this drive to make him want to admire me the way I did him, but I never got the praise that I wanted. He would always try to outdo me in everything we did together, or he would throw a fit if he couldn't beat me. He would constantly let his anger get the best of him, especially while playing games together. He could never just accept things, and would always deflect blame to everyone else. When we fought he would weaponize personal things I would tell him in confidence, which led me to trust in him less. He would have no respect for the things I'd ask him to do, like how despite me not wanting a relationship with him he was very flirty with me after we broke up to try and make me fall for him again. Keep in mind that before he had never tried to make any advances on me while we were together so that just made me even more upset.

  
The only reason we kept in contact after the break up was because we shared a lot of the same friends online and without him nobody really starts the conversation. Aside from that, we also agreed to stay friends. Despite all our fights, we still enjoyed each other's company. But I noticed the shift in behavior, not just from him but from everybody. At the time, I was kind of his emotional punching bag and everyone else was becoming more hostile. I was tired of how things were, and I was going through some complicated emotions. I was doubting my decision and nearly got back with him, but I caught myself before I made that decision and left everybody. I told everybody that I needed to spend time by myself and as an added measure, I blocked my ex leaving behind a long message about how I'm not doing this out of malice. If I didn't then he would believe that I hate him or something and I would still want to be friends in the future but I need to get over him first. It's been a month and a few days since I started the self-isolation from all of them, and what happened after was really interesting...

Since then I've only talked to people from the group, including my ex, very rarely. At most, I talked to one person twice. I found out that after I left, the group collapsed. I don't know the specifics but it sounds like everyone got annoyed with each other in the weeks after my leave. There was an attempt to bring everybody back a few days ago, but I left again since I wasn't ready for any of that. I'd say I'm better off for it, but it feels like I made a bad decision.  


Lately I've been struggling with my self-image and my self-worth. This isolation made me feel on top of the world at first. I felt free. I felt independent. But what I didn't realize was how lonely I was going to feel. When I took action, I had a close friend from school help me build up the courage I needed to do it. We hung out all the time and he even got to know every one in the group. When I left the group, he was all I really had left. At the time, we would get together with other people from our class but I never really felt like I was on the same level as they were with each other. At first I had fun with them when we went out. But I realized that when my one friend wasn't there, I wouldn't really have much to say. I felt awkward. It was as if I were watching a TV show. Any time I would say something or make a dumb joke it would feel weird and out of place. I'd have everyone's attention for that small moment and it would break the conversation and feel unnatural. I still feel like they see me more as the person that tags alongside him and not as an actual friend, and individual friend they would want to be around. What really hit the nail for me was when I tried to plan a party for my birthday. I had a day picked out and they were all invited. I even made a group chat for it because they recommended I should. I tried to schedule around what would've been best for everyone but nobody really responded.  It was supposed to happen that Friday, and they all went bowling as a last minute thing. We all usually went out Fridays but I was trying to make my party the Friday thing for that week. I ended up pushing it back, and it was really more of my good friend and I just drinking that night and having fun.

Honestly, this has been one of my more trivial problems but it still bothers me. I've essentially been talking to and spending all my time with one person, and I worry that one day he'll be bored of me or that I'll annoy him. All the school friends I had before him are gone, and I'm bad at making new friends, I try but it's hard for me to hold conversations with people in that way.

As for online friends, I tried to find chats with people that share similar interests but I think I'm even worse there. Everyone there knows each other. They always greet each other and talk, and whenever I try to jump in or start a conversation I just get ignored. I didn't think I was this socially awkward because I always had a lot of friends, especially in high school. But I feel like I'm all alone, and a part of me still wants to go back to my ex. A part of me doesn't care that he hurts me or that he doesn't make me feel validated, I'm tired of this and I feel safer with him. At least I have enough restraint to know that's a terrible idea for now."
930,Please help I'm having a hard time turning 40,"I am lucky and grateful in a way as I have a roof over my head, some money in the bank, I don't owe anyone money, I have a job and a wife, a passion and two Pomeranians.  I used to suffer from anxiety and depression and had a nervous breakdown.  Though I am grateful for what I have I haven't achieved what I originally dreamed of, an acting career and children.  I had to let acting go as it wasn't paying the bills and we haven't had children because my wife has a physical limitation and lost her mum.

They’ve had to move it several times due to infections &amp; it’s now in the last viable spot. If it gets infected...idk exactly what the next steps are but I know it will be bleak. Apparently my parents have now noticed a bump next to the spot the tube is. Doctors are concerned so he’s going up to the hospital. I’m five hours from home, not that me being there would do much good. I’m scared. I haven’t told anyone about this cause I don’t want people to worry. Of course I always knew this was possible &amp; we’re a Christian family &amp; believe in God &amp; heaven, but it’s nonetheless scary. I really need someone to talk to if you have the time.

I know this could all be something else or even just in my head, because I tried to ask my mom and she said it’s super obvious when someone has it and I definitely don’t.

934,I have run out of options,"I dont know what to do anymore. I cant do this. My depression is overbearing. I can't get the real help i need because im in a situation where i can't do it myself. 

But its so bad. I can't do school anymore, I keep missing days and missing assignments. I can't focus on my passion and career anymore, I can't take care of myself. I cant talk to anyone about it or get help from anyone because my friends don't want to hear it anymore. Im alone and I cant do this anymore."
935,Help/advice? - Coping habits,"I find it hard to motivate myself.

What I used to do(When I was in high school) was to make up a random story in my head to keep myself motivated. 

Study for the next test? Make up a story where I'd study as hard as I can, make it up the class ranks, and stun others who think I have average grades. Then I'd try my best to act like the character in my head, (it works decently, the reward is just a fake scenario in my head for self-amusement). 

Projects? Think of an ideal project and add all the elements in it IRL. 

What I learn is boring and repetitive? - Purposely forget content to relearn them, or at least convince myself to. Or, convince myself that it's a puzzle to find out all the discrepancies between what I remember and what I don't.

I can't deal with my social anxiety? List down my ideal persona and convince myself to act the character out, as it doesn't matter if anyone is upset with me, as they are upset with this persona, not the real me. 

Well, I found it stupid and weird that my self-amusement occasionally slips out. When that happens, I get really embarrassed and confused as sometimes I'd accidentally mix the self-amusing scenarios with reality. In a way, that was terrifying to me. Sometimes, I'd remember facts or events wrongly and that worsens my insecurity.  Heck, my dreams are so vivid/hyperrealistic lately that I'm terrified of accidentally recognizing them as real.

So I stopped. But without the emotional distance, I succumb to my social anxiety more often and found it much harder to motivate myself.  My mind just feels too blank if I don't randomly make up scenarios in my head for self-amusement. 

Heck, I fall asleep by imagining stories in my head so often that I can't sleep without doing that. Honestly, this is the first time in my life that I have mentioned this, as I find this a very private secret. I don't know if this is normal, I'm afraid that it's not. It's just way too childish. help."

937,It feels like my mind is attacking me with horrific images. I don’t know how to stop them.,"[26/M/USA] - Content warning: imagery surrounding death, violence, and sexual abuse

I don’t really know what to say or how to say it. I’ve spent so much of my life in doctor’s offices, but no diagnosis has felt 100% right. I regularly take Luvox for OCD, Trazodone for insomnia, and Adderall XR for ADHD (inattentive type). I struggle with frequent anxiety and what I believe to be mild paranoia, but I’m not an expert on paranoia so take that with a grain of salt.

I know that OCD causes individuals to imagine disturbing and often tragic events involving loved ones, so I’ve been working on distracting myself and interrupting my escalating thought patterns before they can frighten me. I was diagnosed two years ago, and my efforts have definitely started paying off.

Lately, though, things have escalated sharply. My ability to push the intrusive thoughts away is getting worse, and the images have gotten VERY gruesome. Last night as I was talking to my wife, she laughed and I smiled because I thought she looked beautiful. Then before I could notice any kind of thought spiral pulling me down, I entered a kind of half-present state where my imagination was clouding my ability to see anything real. This happens to me a lot, and the first sign is usually that I can’t focus because my head is filled with a sort of “static cloud” of thoughts, none defined enough to be followed.

Anyway, I felt that I was slipping away so I looked up, and I found my eyes in line with the front door. My mind took over as I envisioned a man wearing a mask kick down our door, shoot me in the head, and leave wordlessly as my wife shrieked my name. I imagined myself slowly fading away and everything.

Next thing I knew, my wife was waving her hand in front of my face looking very worried. I snapped out of it and luckily she knew to immediately give me a hug, but I still felt freaked out.

Three days ago there was another instance when she and I were watching Top Model (please don’t judge), and I started feeling uncomfortable. She asked me what was wrong because apparently I was quiet during one of the modeling scenes which would usually make me laugh; and I don’t know why, but for some reason that question sent me spiraling. I don’t want to get too into the details, but I imagined myself getting kidnapped and having each of my limbs amputated while I was kept alive. Then it got worse in other ways, and I just kept responding “Um...” to my wife because I understood the question but could not for the life of me articulate my distress. I tried to change my train of thought, but the rest of my mind felt like a cloudy jumbled mess so there was nothing to stop it. I felt awful because I could tell she was worried about me. She pulled me into a hug, and I just started crying. (I don’t know what I’d do without her, honestly.)

I’m starting to worry because these spikes in intrusive thoughts come out of nowhere. I’ve had to keep it together in front of a few customers at work because while talking to them my mind would conjure up images of them attacking me, or sexually assaulting me, or basically doing anything bad without my consent. It’s hard focusing on customer service when you’re thinking of your younger sister being executed by firing squad.

I’m sorry if this sounds self-indulgent somehow. It just feels like I’m unraveling and I need to talk about this somewhere or else I’ll burst.

Does anyone have experience with this? What did you do? How can I stop that static fuzz feeling so that I can actually ask for help when I need it?

Sorry for the long post. It’s late, so I think I’ll check replies in the morning. Thanks for reading."

945,Intrusive thoughts and how to deal with them in intimate life,"[25 cis f] Hi everyone. I've suffered from sexual intrusive thoughts and images (those mainly) since pre-puberty and they usualy revolve around incest and fecal themes. I'd also suffered from homophobic intrusive thoughts, but that was in the times when the idea of homosexuality colided with my religious upbringing. After realizing that I might be actually sexually attracted and love anyone, it didn't bothered me anymore. Same with pedophilia themed thoughts, they do occur, but reading some stuff about pedophiles and how 95 % of them are absolutely harmless (children abusers usually don't carry this specific diagnosis - they are not pedophiles - but rather multiple of other disorders). The incest and fecal images are a different story, though. They occur mostly before and during sex (sex life with my partner is very rare mostly because of my problems) and I want to kill myself, I am unable to enjoy anything. And it's all multiplied by the fact that my family is batshit crazy (not physically abusive or something, but if you don't have anything better to do, you can check out my profile where I've written a post about my family structure and history) and I would not like them very much even without the incest thoughts. But with this...it is getting to me, you know? I'm feeling like being mildly distressed and slightly abused ALL THE TIME and it's slowly wearing me down. It never stops. Any hint of pleasure or happiness - here is an intrusive thought for you, baby! Shit and incest for the intimate occasion, pet killing or extreme self critique and hate for the others. I want it to end. Sorry about the rant, I have nobody to talk this to about :("

She was being a good friend like asked how I was doing and stuff, and because she was one of my close friends, I told her that my boyfriend who's tested positive for covid is living with me.

She started questioning me, told me many times to do PCR test (which I did on 3rd January after I found out my parents were positive. My boyfriend and I took this test together, mine is negative and my boyfriend is positive. Told my boss the next day about this and he told me to do self-quarantine for 10 days and get another covid test before going back to work. I've done antigen test on 8th January and the result is negative), told me to get a separated room with my boyfriend (which wasn't possible because my boyfriend got salary late so he didn't have much money to rent another room so I offered him to stay with me because we've been together since 27th December and I felt fine, even my two covid tests are negative—my friend didn't know about this condition), and told me to tell my boss the real condition (I told my coworkers that I lived in my parent's house but actually I live on my own place, and this been going on for YEARS, so telling my boss the real condition was complicated at that time).

I got the sense that she actually freaked out because I would be an asymptomatic person and spread the virus everywhere, but I tried my best to be nice and told her everything was fine because I know me (I'm a very clean person and have a healthy lifestyle. I don't get sick like flu since 2019 so I was confident with myself) but she kept telling me what to do and it made me felt like she tried to control me (she told me long time ago that she went to therapy and her therapist said she has tendency to over-controlling and she would get crazy if things doesn't go the way she want to). I mean, why were you ordered me to do this and that? I would done those already if the condition was that easy.

She told me to get PCR, I told her my financial situation is tight, she kept telling me to tell my boss, do self-isolation, and PCR test again. I felt we were looping and eventually I got annoyed and I told her to pay for my PCR test because it's pretty expensive and she wouldn't stop ordering me to get one. She got offended by that and started victim playing like ""I was being nice to you and this is what I get?!"" and she immediately blocked me after that.

I could feel my health is declining since that. First I couldn't sleep because of that (we were texting until 2 AM) and I didn't get enough sleep, now I need sleep longer than usual, sometimes I feel tired, don't have energy to prepare healthy meals, I could stay in bed doing nothing for hours, started to sneeze few times a day, now dry coughs every morning, my heartbeats are over 100 bpm few times, I got severe headache for 2 days straight, my muscles starts from shoulder and up are so tense. I'm feeling remorseful for more than a week now. I tried to move on, I talked to people about this problem, I wrote in my journal, done drawing, I've done meditation every night to helped me, and I realized no matter how much I want to move on, this feeling is still there, in my subconsciousness. Now I don't know what to do to cope with this feeling."
950,Feel like I've wasted my life,"I am 27m, through all my teenage years up till I was ike 25 the thought of socialising made me so uncomfortable I'd always find reasons not too, Ive lost basically all the friends I had growing up and feel like I wasted the part of my life when I was meant to be reckless and have fun and now I'm just getting older. I'm not sure how to deal with this thought, it's all I think about despite me being in a loving relationship with an amazing son. I hate myself for saying this but I am jealous of my partner for having all they experiences when she was younger. I'm not sure I can ever deal with the fact I wasted my life not getting help."
951,Is it a good idea to talk to a counselor at my university about my diagnosis? Would it help me in my studies?,"Hi!

I have been thinking about going to a counselor at my uni to see if I would get some kind of help because of my situation. I’m also conflicted about it because I worry about what kind of treatment I would get from my teachers and administration at the uni since my diagnosis in my medical records can look a bit unsettling for people that don’t know much about the topic. I don’t really know if it would be a good idea, but I could use some help to do better in my studies.

If you’d like to know why I’m not sure if I should do it, my diagnosis was Schizotypal PD with antisocial traits. I think that would look pretty strange for them. Specially the antisocial part has a really bad reputation and is very misunderstood. 

Thanks!"
952,I'm tired of keeping it all in my head and being dependent on others. What should I do?,"I'm having one of the worst depressive lows I've ever experienced. After an injury I was entry level separated from the military (sent home during boot camp), and have been staying with my partner while I wait to try again. Being with him has been great for my mental health, but today he left to go into the service himself, and I didn't expect to take it this badly. Part of it is that I'm going to miss him, of course, but it mostly feels like a crutch has been kicked out from under me, and I'm seeing how purposeless I am. He is my only emotional support (I have family that cares about me but it's not one that shares its feelings). We're not married and I don't want to be completely dependent on him, so I can't just go with him, but I have no idea what to do with myself. In truth I never expected to live long enough to have a job or anything when I was younger. Nothing serious like that has ever felt real, but now that I'm alone it does. I definitely feel like I need to go to therapy after years of bottled up trauma and whatever else is festering in my head, but I can't pay for it, and I may not be able to go into the military if I start going. Honestly, I don't know if I can even join with the state of my mental health. I'm basically stuck in that if I fix it, I might get kicked out, but I don't think I can go in like this. I could always get a regular job and everything, but I was kind of pushed into the military, and now I don't really know any other way to go. Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated. ❤️"
953,Don’t lose today,"Keep on fighting. Let’s do our best today, even if it means we’re so tired were about to faint from it. It’s alright. Let’s push ourselves to do better today. Today we want to be victorious, just today. Let’s work on that."
954,I am having suicidal thoughts again..!,"It's not that I want to die, it is just that I don't want to be such a low-life anymore."
955,Bi polar &amp; herpes,"I’ve struggled my whole life 20 with bi polar it makes it worse as I’m unemployed with no license (no money to go fund that) but I will go back to study again to get more chances with employment) last year I made the mistake sleeping with a sex worker I should of known better I didn’t think anything bad because I had a friend who was one for years never contracted anything incurable and she was always going on when she did it “I’m sick of people saying escorts are dirty I use condoms with all my clients I don’t have herpes ect “ *shows me her negative tests* I decided not to listen or think all escorts are dirty as some people
Stereotype them to be yep contracted herpes im a female so I couldn’t use a condom neither did the girl (I’m pansexual) didn’t know what dental dams were till end of last year since contracting herpes I feel like sucide is the answer I’m never genuinely happy with my life I felt like that prior to having hsv but now having hsv I feel a million times worse with my mental health I was doing good wasn’t self harming for years then relapse with the diagnosis &amp; since then I’ve been punching myself in the head that my head still hurts from the last 2 days bashing myself in the head yelling I hate my life and what not I feel like my rights were raped as they didn’t disclose they had hsv it’s not the end of the world but to me it is I never wanted hsv I always limited my partners and a couple of months ago I tried to commit suicide with gbh but it got back fired oh me the guy ripped me off with water another time it was a shit batch and vomited infront of a good looking guy I met from an hsv dating site I feel the urge of buying a rope from a warehouse and ending it all I have had a shit run in life and hsv is the worst of all things to me I’m almost a year having hsv in February and I think I will still feel like this until a cure comes but that won’t for another 10 years and I don’t wanna wait or dwell on it and stop wasting my productive days being miserable and googling sucide 

Just needed to rant"
956,I don't know what is wrong with me,I called a psychiatrist office and left a vm because I feel like I need medication because I feel like I will do something stupid. I have been very moody lately. I have low self esteem. I over think. I cry so much. A few minutes ago I bawled like a baby and then stopped almost instantly and had thoughts of ripping my hair out or hurting myself. I constantly have thoughts of hurting myself. I am not on birth control and am not pregnant. I took a test because my mom thought i was and it came back negative. Yesterday I was laying in bed and got extremely aggravated because my tv was too loud and wanted to break something. I felt aggravated and frustrated and wanted to scream or cry. I got aggravated at my sister because she said something. I wanted to grab her and punch her in the face. I get mad very easily. I've been like this for a while. So I decided to call instead of putting it off. I have no motivation to do anything. I live in illinois outside Chicago and I am looking for a psychologist and psychiatrist because I don't want to rely on pills all the time. But I want to know what the hell is wrong with me because this is annoying. My last psychologist and psychiatrist made me feel stupid because I was worried about catching covid and dying. I'm still worried even though I had it but because I felt my fears were invalidated I chose to stop seeing them.
957,Obsessive thoughts instead of sleep,"Hi,

I know I'm definitely not the only person who lays awake at night with an overactive brain, but I seem to have a specific kind of issue. If I ever find 'cursed' images, particularly things that are repulsive, such as certain tripophobia images, I can't stop looking at them. I don't want to describe what goes on in my head but it's not pretty. When I try to sleep the images circulate in my head and become worse.

It's really hard to cope with. Luckily it only affects me like this once every couple of weeks at maximum., but when it does...Oh boy it's torture. I become a prisoner in my own mind. It's also impossible to talk about in detail because I would feel bad to describe the images and thoughts to anyone. Slightly out of shame but also out of not wanting them to suffer through it! 

I've found the best thing to deal with it is to separate my mind from me...Imagine me as being my emotions, feelings, intuition, and my mind as one of my muscles. Then I kind of feel as though I can control it better.  


Not sure why I'm posting this just wanted to share something I suffer with and my way of dealing with it"
958,Do I deserve to be loved?,"I have been suffering from major depression for over 3 (known) years now. 

People that felt an interest on me lost it once they saw me struggling to keep my emotions in check, forgetting many things rather quickly, and just being honest about it to those that I trusted the most and even loved in some cases.

I didn't choose to be sick. I have tried therapy, medicines to no avail. I don't plan on trying soon again, but at least I tried it. Family, friends, known ones - I don't feel wanted because of this. I can pour my soul for these people but nothing fills that void and they all leave because no one wants to deal with someone that is broken.

I am broken. I am hurt, desperate, lifeless. I don't want to die, but the pain is too much. I can't even cry nowadays. I am losing everyone and everything that mattered to me. I am losing myself.

**I just want to be loved**."
959,i’ve started taking sertraline and propanalol!,today was the first day of me taking these medications and beginning my journey to a better mental state :) wish me luck!
960,There is something wrong and I do not know what it is,"Hi, I was severely depressed last year no surprises but I feel like something much worse has been happening. Lately I feel like the way people look at me and talk to me is different. It is very hard to describe but you know that feeling when you’re in a such realistic dream, but know it’s fake? That’s the best way I could put it. The way others talk to me is becoming more and more hard to understand what they are saying and their intentions. It is like I do not belong here and that I’ve completely swapped bodies with someone else and need to go back. The way people look and talk to me makes me queasy and foreign to them. 

I do not know what’s happening, is this common?"
961,Can I ask for advice here about mental health?,"If not, can anyone recommend a place on reddit to seek help on not exactly confirming but giving me an idea of what is causing my problems mentally etc"
962,I quickly got my phone to post this.(body positivity?),"Im not by any means advocating for the use of drugs or hallucinogens or any sort of substance that can very well harm you but on that note, as im writing to you high, i just ended up having a HUGE look at myself and my body. My poor body has been neglected for quite some time as im just starting to realize it and i really do mean realize it. Ive looked at my body hundreds of times but i never bothered even doing anything about it. I do excercise a bit but nothing crazy since its really more about convincing myself that im staying healthy but looking at my body now i feel like i saw it with completely different lenses. Its almost as if its really asking me to please take care of myself from now. The best way i can describe it is that my body is a huge symbol , its really saying something and the only way it can communicate with me is simply by showing it. I really hope this helps some of you. I really cannot wait to get started in really taking care of my body."
963,"I'm extremely depressed because of the worst news from my fiancee, how can I feel better ?",So my fiancee decided to call quits after being engaged for about 2 years. We were supposed to get married this february and the pandemic screwed us up. She is in vietnam and vietnam has suspended all commercial air traffic and barred US citizens from going to vietnam temporarily cause of the high death rate. She decided to break it off and she told me to find someone to date in my country. Well the reason why I was with her was because I had a hard time trying to get a date here in the US and my family set me up with her cause I had no luck with women here. I'm now so screwed and I don't know what to do. I'm so miserable and I haven't been able to eat or drink. What should I do so that I can feel better ?
964,How do I win my family back?,"I am bipolar 1. So in May of 2020, my girlfriend and I had a baby boy at 21 &amp; 22 years old. The day he was born was the best day of my life. Everything was awesome until July. When our boy would wake up in the middle of the night, I would take care of him first every time because mama was recovering from labor. I would only get 1-4 hours of sleep a night because I had to get up early for work. I was working for her dad at the time, and he was extremely disorganized and had poor communication skills because he has social anxiety. Everyday I would be running around trying to find tools he misplaced, and he had unclear expectations. He ended up firing me because I became irritable and I told him he was a poor employer. This put us in a pickle because now we had no money coming in. So I went back to an old manual job I had. I got paid well, but was treated like shit. In the meantime, I began to lose my mind due to sleep deprivation. I became a different person. I didn’t love my partner like I did before. I resented her father. I accused him of being a pedophile and went to Facebook and starting spreading bullshit about him. I threatened her father that I would fight him. I became homicidal and was proud of it. I started smoking cigs and dipping, but it was like a whole can in a day or two packs a day. I was extremely condescending and self righteous. A lot of stupid shit. I don’t remember a lot of things people told me. I was hospitalized several times last summer. I was wildly over-medicated with drugs that didn’t work, and it just made things worse. After the second hospitalization, it was just me at the apartment. Girlfriend moved in with her dad. She cut me off and I didn’t get properly medicated until October, and I had to break the lease and move back home. We talk everyday since I have leveled out, and I see her and the boy 2-4x a week. Over Christmas to New Years her dad was out of town, so I stayed there. We bonded well together and as a family, and we even slept together a few times (she generally doesn’t let me kiss or touch her anymore). It was great. I want to marry her one day. She is the most wonderful woman I’ve ever met. I just have no idea how I’d ask for her father’s blessing. Her whole family hates me and wants her to move on. She is casually talking to an ex, and reminds me that she’s being asked out and compares me to him. Typing this at almost 6am, up all night. I am just so burdened by my behavior and full of regret. If I don’t win her and her family back, I feel like I will always be haunted by this and will never forgive myself. Any advice is appreciated."
965,I have some good advice about dating and opening up about your mental health!,"So I’ve recently found myself back in the dating game. OH what a fun place to be 🙄😂.

Those of you who are in your 20s and on the dating apps can probably relate: It’s mostly full of ghosts, dead-ends and rejection if you are ultimately looking for a relationship with substance that will last.

So when I finally hit it off with someone, I got excited. We saw each other for a couple months and I never shared with him that I was bipolar.

I didn’t share because I had never met this guy and I unfortunately, like many others, felt like I had to prove that I was “normal” and not crazy. Which IS crazy, because I live a completely normal life and I’m proud of who I am.

So the longer I waited, the more difficult it became to bring it up. I did some research to see if others in my position were facing a similar dilemma, and they were. Of course they were.

I found that we were all scared.

Scared of being rejected simply because of an outdated stigma that is still sadly very, very present in our society today.

So it inspired me to make this account because I want to prove to the WORLD that you can be “normal” and have a mental disorder. 

Actually, you are probably MORE normal if you have a mental disorder with the fucked up state of our world. (And if so, please seek help- most therapy copays are covered bc of the pandemic)

I respect that we all have vastly different experiences and need to open up on our own time. But I encourage you to join me in starting the conversation so that we can pave the way for people to own their mental health and not be afraid anymore.

And selfishly… You will never have to worry about telling another damn soul about it for the rest of your life. And that might be the most freeing feeling thing in the world."
966,i’ve started to have panic attacks in (online) class,i’ve never had panic attacks until yesterday when i had  one in class and just had to leave and the same happened to me today. until now i’ve thought that i apart of the depression gang (sorry i use stupid humour to get through things) and was going to see a councillor. but now i’ve started having these panic attacks and it’s just making everything worse because i thought that things were going to get better.

968,Mental health update.,I've just painted the hallway. I've been on medication for years for anxiety and depression. I consider this huge for me personally. Stay safe everyone. X
969,Just a reminder: it's okay to cry.,"One way to survive a precarious roller coaster ride is to let it out - scream, laugh or cry – while still being kind to those around us.  You may need a good old-fashioned cry, a method of self-soothing.  While perceptions of crying tend to be culture-specific, in Western cultures crying is often viewed as a stress relief.  

Crying is an area that continues to draw considerable attention from counselors in the client-therapist relationship.  While there have been mixed results in crying studies, after having a good deep cry, you’ll more than likely feel like a weight has been lifted.  In fact, there are those in healing professions that have coined the term “crying that heals” (CTH)  to describe the potential benefits of crying.

Conversely, there may be consequences to the avoidance of crying, including potentially having more challenges emotionally connecting with others.  Those consequences can also include our bodies feeling the effects of holding in stress, including in the mouth and jaw.  Perhaps you’ve been clenching your teeth or feeling tightness in your shoulders or back lately."
970,Does this sound like depersonalization?," Sorry if this sounds a bit sporadic but it's really hard to put in to words the feeling that i get. It is a really scary feeling it sort of feels like i'm a ghost or i'm not real or im kinda in a dream state but its very hard to explain. I had a really bad trip a couple of months ago from an edible and ever since then this feeling has been a lot worse. I do suffer from depression, anxiety, schizoaffective disorder (psychiatrist doesnt even know if that diagnosis is accurate)."
971,I can get help for my IBS but I may be too afraid/anxious/worried (?) to actually go to my hospital appointment,"I got diagnosed with IBS in the summer of 2018, but judging from my symptoms, my doctor at the time (not my doctor anymore as he was a ""children's doctor"" and I turned 18 last year) and me as well speculated that I have probably had IBS for very long, if not my entire life.

I've missed out on a lot of things such as social events because of my IBS, it has not only hindered me physically but more so mentally. When I turned 18, my mom suggested I try to get in touch with a special department at our hospital for gut problems, because the anxiety my IBS gives me is too much and I know I need help with managing it (I don't have diagnosed anxiety but I do feel very anxious and start to panic especially in new situations and places). 

Today I got a letter from the hospital informing me that I had an appointment at this department next month with a physiotherapist and a psychologist, and for some reason, I don't want to go. I would have to go alone because of the COVID restrictions which is one of the problems. I know I'm an adult now but I've always been very anxious and scared to do stuff alone, and my mother, in particular, has always been the one I bring along for certain things, especially to the hospital since I just have a general fear of hospitals.

The letter I got also informed me that we will talk about my problems and examine my stomach, rectum, and vagina. I'm sure no one likes showing your private parts to strangers, but I'm terrified. I'm dreading the day I have to go to the gynecologist for the first time, which will be in a few years or something. I don't want to feel exposed and the thought of the exam makes me feel humiliated for some reason. The letter said that I can say no to procedures but I feel like I would not be able to say no without starting to cry which is a huge problem I have (I'm a crybaby and cry whenever I get anxious).

There's just so much I'm worried about for this appointment and I sort of want to cancel it, I am a legal adult after all so it's my choice, but I feel like my mom and even myself would be so disappointed in me because I know my mom wants me to get help.

For each day that goes by, I'm starting to think that the reason I have a breakdown every time a new situation arises isn't only because of my IBS and worrying about finding a toilet, but instead more of an anxiety issue. And then I feel like I'm wasting the hospital's resources (I live in a country with state-provided/free healthcare) if I say no, or if I go and it turns out I am just an anxious person. I don't know what to do and it's tearing me apart and I'm so afraid and anxious."

973,My mind is... I don't know,"I'm always blocking myself out. My other half is always having constant debate with me.

975,I just cancelled my counselling sessions. Question,"I have a question - is counselling something you feel a tangible benefit from, or is it a subconscious improvement?

For some context, I left an abusive partner 6 months ago and a cat passed at the same time as well as a bunch of other things going on like moving house etc.  I was naturally upset and sought counselling for trauma as had past trauma also.  I've had maybe 6 sessions now. 

However, I just don't think....it helped?

I felt the short awkward silences in sessions were unbearable and I'd run out of things to say far before the allotted 60 minute finish.  There was nothing wrong with my counsellor - lovely lady, easy to speak to, very relaxed.  She was interested in everything I said and we even discussed psychedelic use and other things I'm interested in without judgment.  

I just can't stand being put on the spot to talk if I can't think of what to say!  I am autistic which probably plays a part in struggling with it.

I'm wondering if counselling had a tangible effect for you or did you just think about things less?

Input from other autistic folk would be really useful too :)"
976,I don't know where to go from here,"Hi. I'm 31 and feeling very lost and hoping someone can point me in the direction of the help I may need to figure this out.

Just a TLDR on my life. Mum tried to kill me at knife point and in a car accident, dad used to drag me out of bed and beat me (this was before the age of 13), my oldest brother beat me and kicked me out right before he hung himself and my oldest sister still blames me for mums attempts at suicide (two of which she made me watch). I was in and out of homes and half way houses, homelessness, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, several suicide attempts (many many years ago).

Now I thought I was all good, a warrior who life tried to beat and failed, a fighter not a victim. 31, beautiful son but I had a realisation today that maybe I'm not ok... it was triggered when a colleague probed and probed about my parents because I just say I have none, its just easier, and I mentioned bits and she broke down in tears. She doesn't really know me, to be fair the few people that I have told my story to all cried as well... that's what's normal here right? The crying? Me being numb to it probably isn't?

I barely sleep, the thought of it terrifies me. I am alert at night like I'm ready for the apocalypse haha but I nap easily during the day which is hard given work haha. I feel like I'm constantly ready to fight (not necessarily physically) with every one I meet, my marriage fell apart because of this.

I've kicked the drugs and alcohol many years ago btw.

I know this is probably like googling ""do I have cancer"" but I've just got no idea what to do. It just feels like I'm still prepping for my father to beat me and I've not seen him for over a decade. I can't trust anyone (not completely) and I'm totally apathetic to every emotion that doesn't come from my son.

Don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of this... maybe someone here has had a similar life and found help and came out the other side better for it."
977,Help regarding bipolar disorder,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in June 2019. I’ve been on pills ever since. I used to have episodes of hyperventilation thrice a day. In the whole of 2020 it was hardly 5 times. I’ve recovered a lot. It was all mental. I don’t have any depression not. The doctor whom I was seeing never talked to me. The only time he ever did talk was the 1st time I had visited him. It’s been more than a year now but he has never bothered to question what I feel. He doesn’t treat me like a human. I cannot even go harsh on him because everything bold action I take will be seen as a sign of my degrading mental health. The pills he has been giving me have been negatively affecting me. If anyone’s a professional the pills are : 1. Lithocent 500g and 2. Olaset 5g
Recently I’ve started throwing the pills without my parents cognizance. I feel much better without the pills than with them. Every time I take the pill my mind feels heavy, I cannot concentrate, I’m developing loads of fat and I’m filled with regret. I want to get rid of those pills. The doctor says I’ll have to take them for another 3-4 years. But like I said, I feel a lot better without the pills than with them. I want a doctor who listens to me, who cares about the patient he is treating. I live in Pune, India. If anyone knows a good psychiatrist please do let me know. Also let me know if there is something I can do about these pills and any information you can give me would be very helpful."
978,How to deal with mentally ill mother?," 

Hi! I'm really having trouble with dealing with this situation, so maybe (hopefully) someone else dealt with a similar situation and could help me out.

In short, my mom and grandma traveled to a different country for work . She met her husband their after a year got married and had me. My father however passed away before my birth and my grandma helped her in raising me. My grandma took me to our home country and raised me here while my mother stayed in the other country working. So basically, most of my child years I spent with my grandmother, not my mom.

My mom came back to our home country with her new husband a few years ago when my grandma passed away. I went to University in a different city, started working, found a boyfriend and now we live together, so I don't have that much time to visit her (2 jobs and studying).

My mom is a strongly catholic person and she always believed in ""the end of the world"" coming soon, us paying for our sins. At first it seemed innocent, however ESPECIALLY since the pandemic started she literally started believing that the end of the world is coming, that everybody should repent and that I have to get married NOW so God won't hate me. Honestly, all of this made me so anxious and angry at her, because every visit it was either crying that the end of the world was coming or yelling at me that I'm a sinner for living without a marriage.

The past few months she started feeling worse, so I kept begging her to go get her blood taken and check if everything is ok. I was starting to feel that maybe all her new anxiety may be related to hormones (since she's after menopause). What I'd like to add is that she also doesn't believe in doctor's/medicine, so she almost never goes to any doctors. Finally she agreed and it turned out that she has some slight problems with her thyroid but she just needs to take some medicine for this. The doctor also have her some medicine for anxiety so she'll calm down and suggested she would go to a psychologist.

However here is where the steps begin. Since that visit her mental health is getting even worse. She doesn't take any medicine, she started having ticks, talking about her upcoming death, every small problem seems to be huge to her and she said she won't go to a psychologist because ""she isn't crazy"".

I'm honestly super scared and have severe anxiety myself because of this whole situation, I've been taking some sedatives lately to calm myself down and be able to focus on work. I have 2 jobs and I have to be writing my BA thesis and can't even do anything because all I'm doing is crying non-stop. I love my mom but at the same time I seriously don't know what to do and I'm literally scared to go home and deal with this stuff."

980,Ideas for grant money?,"I work in the counseling center at an undergraduate university in the US. It has been brought to my attention that our department will possibly be awarded some grant money in the near future. My colleagues and I are brainstorming some ways in which to best use that grant money for our education, as well as possible resources for the students? We are all clinical mental health counselors. Wondering if there are any fellow counselors that have any recommendations that may have been in this position before. Any recommendations are welcome. University students are welcome to chime in as well!"
981,how do i begin to move on from my trauma?,"Back in november I went through something really traumatic that caused me to lose my trust in my boyfriend. Basically he is an addict and, I can’t really explain everything that happened, or I might make myself spiral into a rant. Anyways, he ended up going to rehab for a month and came back about 4-5 weeks ago. 

He’s been doing really well since then, he goes to an intensive outpatient program and he has group therapy and goes to NA meetings. All I can see is that he’s been doing better. But, for some reason, I’ve been having really bad flashback, and overthinking  everything. I feel almost as if Im stuck in the past. I keep thinking that maybe he’s relapsed even if theres no evidence that hes done so just because im so anxious and because of the lack of trust. He lied to me for basically a year, so I dont really know him because he had this whole other life that he kept from me. But i know that he’s getting better and that he’s really trying because Im watching it happen right in front of my face and for some reason my anxiety can’t accept it.

But anyways, I feel like Im stuck in the past. I have horrible depressive episodes and flashbacks and I feel like im stuck in the moment when everything happened in the first place. It’s getting really bad, to the point where I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. I disassociate all the time and sometimes I look in the mirror and dont recognize myself, or I look at my boyfriend and can’t recognize him. It’s freaking me out, and I just want to start to move on and heal. What should I do? Would sitting down and talking over everything that happened with my boyfriend help? Or is there something I can do myself? I talked to my therapist but Im finding it hard to explain how bad its getting without feeling like im being overdramatic. I just want to start to heal like my boyfriend has been."
982,At what point does daydreaming become an issue?,"I have had this for as long as I remember. I daydream a parallel life. The life changes according to my real life, based on my real life decisions, etc. Idk how to explain it, so I will try to describe what it is now. As I am typing this post, I am imagining myself talking about how I posted a mental health post to reddit when I was younger to a host in a tv show (and I am in the tv show as a doctor to talk about mental health concerns in general). It used to not be as pervasive; I only daydreamt when I was bored, but then it started getting worse (I want to add that my daydreaming only became more problematic when family issues propped up)

Now it has started to infringe into my 'real life' to the point where sometimes I have to try hard to 'stay' in real life and not slip back into my dream life. I have begun to daydream evem when I am a bit bored. For example, when I am taking notes in class, I am daydreaming about making a youtube video on how to take nltes effectively while I am still listening to the class. 

I must admit that it has helped me in some ways, like helping me to prevent burnout but I feel that real life is beginning to feel bland compared to the other life. I don't have any issues with it now, but can someone tell me when this becomes a problem and when I should seek help?"
983,Going back into a down spiral,Im on medication for depression and anxiety but its not like it makes it go away and in a time period of a month i become suicidal and start talking to people that aren't there which i know is not deppresion or anxiety but this time i fully gave up and listened tp what it said which was to harm myself. Im not joking and im scared of myself now because i fricking cut the crucifix into my arm im going crazy. I dont want to end up in a pshych ward i might take this down because this was very hard to post.
984,What do you do when you feel so unappreciated?,I don't think I'm the type of person to expect a favor to be returned but I expect at least a thank you. I be damned. I'm definitely doing more than my fair share of work here and I don't even get a thank you and other people do the bare minimum and get a ton of gratitude? Is a thank you too much to ask? Is it so unreasonable and dramatic to be feeling so caught up about being so unappreciated? Because it feels like it.

987,Not sure what to do for my treatment anymore,"I've been in therapy for the last six months, and still feeling pretty depressed. My therapist thinks that the counseling I receive from her is not enough, and that I need to join a supplemental program like group therapy or telehealth IOP. However I feel very prohibited by cost and insurance coverage. (For reference, I'm on the US based in Massachusetts, and my employer sponsored insurance doesn't cover much more than the state program.)

The only hospital my therapist is recommending for the IOP is one with very bad reviews, and reviews indicating they are not upfront about insurance coverage. I tried to reach out to the clinic my therapist is based in to join group therapy, but they are filled up for my availability. I'm not on medication, but I am abstaining because I don't want to deal with the side effects, particularly weight gain which is in my family history.

Any recommendations from others with similar experience? I really need the extra help. I keep lashing out at my loved ones and I'm a toxic person right now. I need to get better ASAP."

989,How to deal with negative overthinking &amp; be more optimistic?

But everyday I somehow manage to mess one small thing in the morning and instead of saying whatever and going on with the day, my brain starts telling me how hopeless and useless I am.

There is this constant thinking/voice in my head that says ""You are not good. You won't be able to do anything in life. You are stupid.""  I don't know how to think positively about myself. I am not a negative person in general. I am like that only towards myself.

People I talked to either said I am entering into adulthood(21F) so am worried (cousin &amp; mom) or said I don't love myself enough (close friend). But I don't think I don't love myself."

I enjoy making things. I say that vaguely because I’ve like most of the mediums I’ve touched. Its not just in a sense of art either. I know I want to be a maker of sorts, but I cant decide what kind. The other problem I have is that I have access to an array of tools to make a variety of things. I have ideas that disappear over time because I’m to afraid or unmotivated to follow through. 

All of this sometimes spirals into a nihilistic tornado or self depreciation and depression. It takes a while, but I’ll crawl out of it and the cycle begins again. 

I also am told by someone who is close to me that the my perception of my intelligence and creativity is distorted. 
But what I think they don’t understand is that I feel like it’s something thats been locked away by some complex trauma and I cant access it. Not that its not there. 

Im not sure what I’m looking for by posting this on here, but... hey."
992,My mind is it own person,"I swear every morning or so, my head would shot to making a scene that I really don't want to imagine. For some reason, these would be full of hate. It would make me angry after I finally snap out of it. One morning it a scene of picking a fight with my sibling, a scary situation that could happen, and today I imagine being excluded from family event and they invited my husband instead. Then for some reason it progresses that it be a secret affair between a SIL and my husband. 

If I could stab my brain, I would. Its stupid.

Every morning, once I wake up and try to go back to sleep my mind start a film and I ended up having a pissy morning and stupidly insecure.

There's another thing but its more difficult. My mind has a habit of trying to jump scare me. If I feel confident or I'm growing success; my mind would poke it ugly head in my room and use certain scare tactic to ""keep me in line"". If I tell it to fuck off, sometime it'll leave me alone but other time it'll escalate. I always thought this was something that grew from abused I've endure growing up.

Has anyone experienced this?"

So I did, and it was so good. But 1 month ago I went out of Ambien and my psychiatrist has not called me yet and I don't really think I have a new receipt to get it, so I thought ""ok I'll just stop, this pill it's not even that good for my health anyway"", and the days after I stopped taking it I was sleeping all night. Then I started to get really lucid dreams, I never used to had dreams THIS lucid... it's crazy. And this last week I've been struggling to sleep again. I don't know what to do, I just feel so lost..

996,"Advice on dealing with an incapable, mentally ill/suicidal adult relative (UK)","Hi all

Just a quick disclaimer to say I'm sorry if this post breaks any guidelines or rules. I'm a complete lurker so don't really have any posting experience. That being said I've checked the sidebar and feel this is the appropriate subreddit for the issue at hand.

Essentially, a relative of mine who I'll call S (mid 40s) is not in a good way. S lives alone, is unemployed, overweight and spends all day on the sofa smoking heavily and drinking in the evenings. S does not cook/eat properly and rarely leaves the couch. These lifestyle decisions led to S having a severe blood clot in their leg a couple years back, which has reinforced this sedentary lifestyle and is now causing further health issues. S is essentially living in squalor. Apologies if this sounds harsh, I am just trying my best to relay the facts.

S leans very heavily on their 85 year old widower father for essentially everything, including for company and financial assistance, and the whole family is very worried about the toll so great a responsibility is having on an older man who, by his own admission, just wants to enjoy the final years of his life.

To put it bluntly, S is completely incapable of looking after themselves, and by the looks of it is on their way to an early grave.

From the way S talks, it seems fairly clear that S is suffering from severe mental health issues. I am no doctor, but have been diagnosed with clinical depression myself and can see all the signs that S is heavily depressed. S has been on antidepressants their entire adult life but obviously they do not seem to be doing enough. Today S said they were thinking of taking their own life, and S is currently in A&amp;E at the recommendation of their GP. The call S made was in relation to shooting pains in S' limbs, as well as the suicide remark. 

My family have been trying everything to get S motivated and help S gain some positive momentum in their life, however we now feel like we've exhausted all our options. Every suggestion we make is met with enthusiasm at first, but no eventual action.

We are considering the possibility of having S sectioned under the Mental Health Act, however we have no experience with this and are unsure as to whether it is the appropriate action. If so, how does it work? We are only considering so drastic an option because S is a much loved member of our family and we are very worried for S' safety, as well as S' father's wellbeing. S' father is now open to any options to help his child.

It's also probably worth mentioning that this issue has been going on for many years and is not just a sudden decline due to COVID/lockdown etc. However, the pandemic has made the issues significantly worse.

Sorry for the wall of text. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I will try and provide more information if any is required; just let me know.

Thanks"
997,I find it difficult to process how I feel.,"I've always been the person to keep things to myself and deal with my own problems, but right now I feel so overwhelmed I have no clue where to start. I really just turn my brain off and go into auto pilot. Lock all my bad thoughts and upset feelings away in my brain and pretend they don't exist. 

I had a call today to talk about how I'm feeling and the second I started thinking about it I completely broke down. I have no idea how to help myself. I'm at square zero. 

I don't always feel this way. Some days I'm ready to actually do things. I say to myself that this time I'll hold on to this feeling but it just slips away. That's what I feel like doing sometimes. Just slipping away."

So I’ve been paying attention to him and he seems to be showing minor signs or something but I’m not a professional so I don’t know. I noticed he does seem selfish. He throws tantrums when he doesn’t get his way. When my dad talks to him when he gets in trouble, he starts crying and acting sensitive. He does repeat words or sentences he says sometimes. Yesterday night, he did tel his stepmom that he is afraid to sleep at night and then got all sad. When we were at our mom’s house, he slept fine. Just on the bed, sleeping. Waking up all normal. He told my dad he’s being touched in his private parts but I’ve been keeping a close eye on him and supervising him and nobody has been touching him. Another thing is that he seems sensitive to sound. When we were building shelves for my other brother, we were using the drill. He dropped his toys and had his hands over his ears, just wandering around the room. A few months ago, he was with me when I was cleaning the bathroom. I had the sink running and flushed the toilet and he did cover his ears and say that it’s too loud and it hurts? I’m not sure but I’ve been doing research and I kinda want answers so I can let my dad know."

1000,how am i supposed to talk to my friends about my anxiety and mental health?,"if i continue to keep everything from them, they will keep judging me without the full story. even if i did tell them, they would probably not believe me, because i never told them in the past, and i put on a front/seem happy. i also feel like if i tell them about my mental health and how its affecting my life, they will just see it as fake and me making excuses for avoiding responsibilities or being lazy. what if they learn everything going on in my mind and don’t want to be friends with me anymore because they dislike the person they didn’t realize i was? what if i’m a completely different person than what they thought, and i no longer have any friends? what if they judge me because they don’t think i have any reason to be struggling because my life seems good. most importantly if i tell them, i will just feel like a burden.. if they are supportive and become an outlet for me to vent, what if the things i say trouble them? i do not want to make their mental struggles worse because of mine. in conclusion there is no winning, either way i will be judged or a become burden so i am stuck in the middle. every-time i try to start an attempt to tell them anything, they don’t know how to respond. i obviously make them uncomfortable and it seems like they do not want to know, which is fine. i just feel like i’m going to explode sometimes, i have no one to tell about the things going on in my mind and i just wish i had someone to listen. i know its not in my control, but it makes me so anxious and upset that people will judge me and make assumptions without knowing whats going on in my mind, and even if i do open up and tell them, theres still the possibility that they might not be understanding and judge me regardless. that terrifies me. either way my friends will hate me. why do i even feel the desire to vent my emotions and thoughts? why cant i just be content keeping everything to myself?"
1001,Seeking help on behalf of a friend,"Hello everyone

I'm seeking help on behalf of a friend. He is male, 30 y.o. and from the UK

I've known him for just over a decade and our relationship has always been consistent. He has been through significant trauma (loss of both parents) and has battled addiction (mainly cocaine and alcohol) for his entire adult life so far as a result

His friendship circle which mostly revolved around partying has shrunk significantly over the years as people have gotten sober themselves, found partners, gotten married/bought properties/had children/pursued careers etc. He has a decent job but is very unhappily single

I'm one of the few of his close friends who has never taken hard drugs, and as a result I believe our friendship has stood the test of time, alongside a couple of others. He always asks me for advice and tells me how much he admires me/my relationship with my wife, my job, my morals, always flattering me by says things like 'you should definitely be a councillor' etc. However when I do give him advice on whatever it is he's struggling with, he is always overly enthusiastic (\*literally\* responds with 'yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know I know I know yeah you're right actually' as if he just wants me to stop talking) but never ever takes what I say into account. He almost does the opposite. I'm talking completely sensible advice, I'm not shitting on his dreams or anything, just mentioning things he might not have taken into consideration

He talks and talks and talks about having all these plans with overseas business ventures, things that I honestly can't imagine him being able to cope with. Whenever I ask how his plans are going, it's just a barrage of words and vague ideas that he seems to think count as progress. He is very loud, impulsive and drastic in his communication. Extremely tiring to be around, despite being a very kind and lighthearted individual. He's just A LOT, basically. Everyone is aware of this - including him

He has spoken recently about feeling depressed and sad, is very hung up on a failed relationship that he admits he sabotaged, feeling especially down since the person he broke up with has recently gotten married

I feel an obligation to continue my relationship with him because he doesn't have many others to turn to. He has very little family left, his other friends are mostly distant and I imagine have created distance from him for predictable reasons. However I find it extremely stressful being called upon, asked my thoughts on certain things, investing time and effort in coming up with solutions to his problems, only for them to be completely and utterly ignored. I've tried approaching my frustrations with him but his default response is to just say 'ah sorry man sorry sorry sorry yeah you're right man I'm a dick, fuck man sorry sorry please don't hate me haha'. He seems to have a habit of responding like this when he's being told something he doesn't want to hear

I've asked him if he's thought about getting counselling as I've had amazing experiences of it as a solution to issues of my own, and he say's he's had some, but I don't know if I believe it was particularly thorough

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what else to suggest - I'm exhausted by this friendship and I really want to help him get to grips with things and for him to get emotional assistance from someone other than his friends. The problem is I think he's in blissful ignorance and I can't see him taking control of things on his own accord. I worry that if I make a referral to a mental health organisation that he'll be very upset and even betrayed

TL;DR - a long time friend is struggling with overall life and I don't think I can carry on being his crutch - looking for suggestions of ways to get him to take control of things himself"
1002,I have no idea of what I am,"Hello, I'm 25M

I've been living my whole life in a useless way. I feel I haven't collected enough experiences in life so I could share them in a regular conversation and I don't know what to do about it now. It happens in every social interaction I have. I just don't know how to talk to people properly and it's extremely awkward. It bothers me to the point I feel stupid and it drains my will to do anything else throughout my days. Being in silence is fine for me, but I feel I should talk more, especially to my gf. 
We get along very well and have many things in common but sometimes I have nothing to say and it feels just weird because she's younger than me and it's way more intelligent and she definitely knows how to express herself. She's an artist and a future psychologist.
I feel she's going to get bored of me and eventually dump me (or find someone more interesting) if I'm not enjoyable enough. 
That's how I feel in most social interactions. But I think it's not a relationship problem, it's some kind of social/communication issue I developed during my whole life. Maintaining a conversation is not a problem at all for most people, but it's for me. I stare at the person and my mind goes in circles trying to pop out some random fact or joke. But I just can't. 
I've never been encouraged to express myself in a way everyone does. I spent my life just playing videogames, studying and having minimum social experiences. Is that some kind of blocking that make my mind empty all the time? Despite the fact that I have a comfortable life, a partner who I'm in love with and a slightly promising future, I just cant stand myself to the point I hate who I am. I wish I was someone else just to be a regular person and not an empty one. 

I don't know if I'm making any sense but I don't know what to say. It's just like my head 24/7, empty. I can't think of a cool story to make someone laugh about it. Been going to a a therapist for the last 5 years and got diagnosed with anxiety and light depression. Most of the time I'm silent and trying to figure out something nice t say but I simply don't have. Should I accept it? I don't have social skills, I feel dull and dumb. I feel I'm not a interesting person at all, totally disposable and it's starting to come out stronger and affecting my relationship and life in general. If I don't figure out something I'm gonna spend my days in my room doing nothing and rotting. I feel awkward by just typing this text because it does not make too much sense and I don't know to to express myself"
1003,I can't go to school anymore,"I just can't. Even thinking about it almost gives me an anxiety attack. It's the thing that's done the most harm to me and drove me to this point in the first place. It always was horrible, but this year it reached a new point. I can't think of anything I hate more than this stupid useless thing that is school. It only brought bad things to my life. Literally nothing good. Everything I know that will help me in life I learned on my own. For example, I've learned english from TV shows and YouTube videos (it's not my first language). Everything that school brought into my life is stress and mental illnesses. Mental illnesses from which I can't get better if I have to face the thing that brought them into my life every single day. I just can't go to school anymore, please help me, I don't know what to do. This is a cry for help, if my parents will keep forcing me to go to school without caring even a little bit about what I'm saying, I'm probably going to kill myself. Really soon. I don't want to die yet, but I can't keep going to school. Or it will never get better. I don't wanna die yet.. but I prefer death."

I haven't seen my Psyc in two months because he scheduled me for the 18th of this month for an appoinment. They called me a couple weeks ago and told me they had to reschedule because of the holiday and now I wont see him until February. They assured me they were going to make sure my prescription was refilled and I wasn't worried. Cut to me trying to get it filled Thursday only to find out there is no prescription. I asked RiteAid to contact them to get it refilled and they did, I called them and they sent me to the nurse line. 

I've called everyday and have been sent to the damn nurse line voicemail that they keep insisting is 'checked often' and have yet to get a call back. I called Riteaid today again to see if there was anything they could do, and they've been trying to reach them themselves. 

I haven't been able to sleep in days and it's now affecting my ability to work. I don't know what to do, I need my meds but I can't seem to reach my damn doctor for them. Does anything have any advice as to what I could possibly do?"
1006,Trying to get help,"I have been trying to get help for MONTHS. I am in the worst mental state of my life and know I have more than depression. I’ve been trying to get referred to a psychiatrist and my doctor never tells me anything about where I am on the list or if I’m even referred. My counsellor can only see me every 2-3 weeks. I’ve tried 3 anti depressants in the last few months and nothing. I reached out to a psychologist and they said I need to get my doctor to refer me to a psychiatrist and I can’t go to them for more therapy because I am already seeing a counsellor and can’t see two people at the same time. I have expressed on multiple occasions my SH, ED and suicidal ideation has been occurring for 5+ years and usually on a daily basis. Have experienced mania and auditory hallucinations as well as being extremely impulsive and unable to manage my emotions. I already struggle with feeling invalid towards my mental health, ED and self harming. I have always struggled with maintaining relationships and have almost completely isolated myself other than from my parents because I live with them and my boyfriend. I know if I was able to be completely isolated I would commit suicide. Sorry this is long and if it breaks any rules. The money isn’t an issue for me and I can only imagine how hard it is for people who can’t afford therapy. I have anxiety and it has taken so much for me to even reach out for help and continually call the doctor. I don’t know what to do anymore."

I basically have a cheat sheet to life. Despite my ability I know if I wanted to I could literally achieve *anything* I wanted in life (because of money/status/connections etc). This leads me to my issue.

I feel guilty about being depressed while in this position. People would literally kill to be me but I can't be happy where I am. I am grateful that I was born into such an environment but I always feel aimless and sad. I have no reason to wake up. I'm lonely and have no purpose, and I feel bad about it. I feel like I'm ungrateful and selfish for not fully taking advantage of my situation. 

My parents work so hard to provide me with the life I have and yet i feel unable to fully harness my potential and to really do something productive. In my schooling especially, I know I'm so privileged to be able to go to such an esteemed and expensive institution but I'm unable to apply myself and be genuinely passionate/connected with my schoolwork. This makes me feel guilty on a very personal level as I can see how hard my parents to provide this to me.

I don't really know what I'm looking for by making this post. But I just needed to voice this to someone and don't have anyone else to talk to about it."
1008,Books to help let go of the past,"I've been having a bad problem where my mind is stuck in the past, for every mistaken I've made in my life and what others have done to me. Its trapped me in this cycle of depression and anxiety that isn't leaving me alone. Do any of you have any book recommendations to help break this cycle?"
1009,I feel lost..,"I’m not sure how to start off but these past few months haven’t been so nice to me- I’m tired honestly of having to deal with an alcoholic dad every Saturday and hearing my parents have explosive arguments all the time.. I’m in a safe environment it’s just he won’t get help no matter what , he used to go to AA but when we moved he fell off and now is 10x more addicted and doesn’t hide it anymore :/ As for me I.. I’m tired of dealing with flashbacks of my childhood and teen years filled with trauma even these current days. I noticed for the past 4 years after I left school I keep having nightmares of the people who bullied me all the time , I can’t stop reliving my past and it’s blocking me from moving forward :( not that it’s important but I’m 16 ongoing 17 ."
1010,My mental health is declining and I'm thinking of taking drugs to ease the pain. I'm aware I'm going down a dark road but is there a way without self harm?,"I know for a fact that I cannot deal with the pain sober. I'm 20 and I've never touched alcohol or any narcotics in my life. At this point of time, where the whole world is affected by the pandemic, there's just no hope for a better tomorrow. I have big hopes and dreams in my life but I have too much pressure of achieving my dreams to a point that's it's killing ke inside. I can relate to all rock stars/rappers doing drugs to ease their pain. I'm going to take percs and drink lean to see if I can cope up with the problems. I've tried meditation and walking outside but none f them work. My only concern is that I'll be addicted to it and given my lack of self control I'll overdose and die. A buddy of mine overdosed before the pandemic hit from popping too many pills. I genuinely do not know what to do because if I don't take them I'll do self harm but even I do I'll still do myself harm from overdosing. I don't see a way out, certainly I can't go through this rat race sober.

1012,Will my therapist tell my parents (I hope this us the right place to ask this),I'm a minor. My mom is working on getting me a therapist. If I tell a therapist that I self harm will they tell my parents?
1013,Losing Therapists...Anyone Else Relate?,"Hi all,

I'm feeling pretty sad and drained right now because my therapist just notified me she is no longer accepting insurance. I respect her need to get paid what she feels she deserves and to do what's best for her practice but I also feel so so sad.   


This is also the second time this has happened. I find it really exhausting to find new therapists. I must have gone through five before I found this one, who was great. I'm going through a hard time and though I KNOW A HUNDRED PERCENT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME I can't help but feel a little abandoned (esp bc I deal with abandonment issues!). But more than that I just feel TIRED.  I totally understand also that being a therapist is a job not charity and I respect those boundaries. However, I just find it totally exhausting being dropped with just a quick email after being vulnerable with all your secrets and life progress/stumbles and then have to start all over again!!! Again to be VERY VERY CLEAR, I do not think that the therapists who switch over to private are doing anything wrong, I just find the process, which is apparently a common one, to be personally difficult and am having a hard time processing.  I've had to start all over again before many times with other therapists and I just really thought I had found the one therapist I have seen real progress with.  My issues around my family are very private and intense and having to disclose them each time with someone new, reopening the traumas with someone new...all of that just makes me want to give up and not look for another therapist.

A note: If responding, please be respectful/supportive and refrain from saying things like : Well she's your therapist not your friend what do you expect?  I just want to know someone out there understands how I'm feeling."
1014,There’s always angels looking over us! #GoodNewsNow,"[Chen-Si, A True Hero!](https://thegoodnow.org/chen-si-the-angel-of-nanjing-has-saved-more-than-330-people-from-suicide/)"
1015,Ahhhhhh,"(TW: mentions of suicide and ED)
I’m sorry I just need to really vent bc I can’t deal with this shit anymore and I have no one else to talk to. I find it really depressing how when I attempt I’m seen as the joke of the family. I’m qu33r, I’m a dumbass who’s an attention seeker. My problems aren’t valid bc I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back. I find it really shitty how when I’m suffering from a long term eating disorder it doesn’t matter bc “you’re just fucked in the head” 
But when someone else in the family are struggling mentally they’re seen in a different light. “He needs help we should offer him help” what about me? I really do care for him and I do wish he gets help too. But the fact that my feelings were pushed aside bc I have “responsibilities as the oldest” really fucking hurts. I’m getting called dramatic, I’m getting called all of the names under the sun, but I don’t understand why they couldn’t give me the same energy back? I’m suffering."
1016,What are some things that make you look forward to waking up tomorrow?,"be it a person, an activity, anything really"
1017,so done with fucking school (12th grade btw),"Every time I'm at school, I just fucking hate it. I can't explain why I just fucking hate it. No motivation for it whatsoever. I can't tell of it's because I don't get to talk a whole lot (am extrovert) or what. I hate it. Really the only time I feel good is when I'm playing games with and talking with my group of friends. 


I just hate it. Fuck man"
1018,I've been experiencing random mood swings and I have no idea what it is,"I have no clue what's going on with me right now. I'm having intense mood swings. Like I could be talking to my friends and having a good time then all of a sudden I'd feel this intense need to cry. Like there were tears building up in my eyes and this almost overwhelming feeling of sadness just forms out of the blue. I also get really angry and start snapping at people who try to help which makes me feel guilty.

 All of this also happens very quickly with no apparent triggers. Some days I'll wake up like that, crying, and other days it happens just before I sleep. I'm also loosing my passion and my love for my hobbies. I used to adore studying biology. I'd spend hours learning genetics and have the time of my life, now I can't even look at a book without feeling nauseous. I'm just doing things and studying because I have to. I've lost all my motivation. All I want to do to go to sleep the whole day. I have no energy, even after eating, and I'm constantly tired. I'm also forgetting small things, like where I left my phone or where my charger is. That may not seem odd but before this I used to have an excellent memory. I have no motivation to get out of bed and I'm spending my days scrolling through Reddit or something else. 

I talked to my dad about it and he says it's normal hormonal changes, but sometimes when I'm extremely into a slump my mind goes down this rabbit hole of self pity and self hatred and I just feel like ending it all. That doesn't seem normal but my parents say that all teenagers have such thoughts. Is that true? Is it normal? If not, what could it be?"
1019,Idk if I’m suicidal,"I’ve been having these thoughts lately upon listening to which any sane person would put me in the category of suicidal. But I don’t really feel so. So what my thoughts actually are about is, for example, when I’m on a bus ride to my university I kinda hope the bus tips over the edge and falls down the cliff and kills me (I live in a very mountainous country). Whenever I’m in a large/tall building I hope a massive earthquake occurs and the building collapses on me. Whenever I’m crossing a road I kinda want a 16 wheeler to plaster me to the ground. Whenever I’m walking down a slope I feel like tumbling down and hurting myself. But I don’t wanna die. I am depressed quite badly, but I don’t wanna die. But I keep having these thoughts very often."
1020,During this quarantine i think iam developing mental health issues iam thinkg how could i prevent this,"Hello, im 24 years old guy. During quarantine i xcame to live at my parents, its been horrible and i am going crazy i think. I m totally isolated and meet friends once a week other times i dont communicate with anyone at all. Prior quarantine i was talking to friends all the time, meeting someone.  Now i am all alone all the time, have noone to talk to and i am going insane  i cant find what to do, time goes so slowly.

How do you lonely guys get over this quarantine, what hobbies, activities keeps you alive? I have warched all netflix, all movies i can find, i read more than one book a week, i listened to all podcasts i am interested to, i have no idea what else to do."
1021,Am I bipolar? possible TW,"Hey!  
i normally don’t ask such important stuff on the internet but because of the lockdown, I can’t go to therapy.  


my mental health didn’t got better and just worse, so I started to watch mental health. When I started to watch one of the videos of psychologist talking about bipolar disorder, she mentioned stuff that I was going through.  
like going from a extreme low to a extreme euphoric episode. for example for 2 weeks I’ve been working out extremely at 2am, redecorating my room,dancing in my room with loud music as if I didn’t need sleep to feel energetic. Also spending a ton of money and just being talkative and social. I also felt the need to take drugs and also like I was on drugs without any taking anything. The next to weeks I was just laying in bed and I felt nothing like emotionally numb and I felt the need to harm myself. I just have so many negative thoughts and I just don’t care about anything anymore.

i also have very irrational behaviour and irritability and I sometimes have self harm thoughts.   
i also know that i always go from extreme highs to lows and every time I feel happier I am scared to feel so bad again for longer time episode for no reason  


I hope that anyone can help me

1022,Advice Needed: How do you go about telling your family doctor about depression?,"I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts among other things. I'm planning on talking to a therapist, but I wanted to see a family doctor first. 

Do they usually help treat depression? Is it normal for people to go to family doctors for mental health issues? What kind of questions will they ask and what should I expect? And how do I know if the doctor is the right one?

Sorry for the load of questions! It's my first time going to a family doctor for mental health concerns..."
1023,I feel like I've lost what hope I had.,"There are so many things suffocating me and I've pretty much lost hope that I'll ever dig myself out. I've pushed off talking care of my health for years because I've been afraid that I won't be able to afford it. I have a car that needs fixing that I've avoided. There are so many things I should do around the house that I always push off because I don't have the energy to do them. I never went to college because I was terrified of how much it would cost, so I spent 12 years in a retail job that I hated because I felt too unqualified for most non-retail jobs that I saw, and felt too stupid to be able to learn those jobs. (I finally found a job that I liked at first, but it's been over a year and all the things I still don't know are making me feel like I was right and I shouldn't have bothered, and now I'm back at square one.)

Every problem I have is of my own making and I hate myself for it. My boyfriend and I call the things we feel like we can't possibly do ""impossible tasks"" and EVERYTHING feels like an impossible task to me, because I'm so anxious and depressed so much of the time. Most of the time the only thing that gets me to my job in the morning is the fear of being poor combined with the social anxiety that calling out of work gives me. 

I know its not all bad. Which is good, because if I didn't have that I'd probably be 6 feet underground by now. I have things to be grateful for. I have an absolutely wonderful life partner who always tries his hardest to help me, and family and friends who love me. I have two kitties who I adore. When I'm having a good day I can almost even love myself. But all it takes is one thing to go wrong, even something minor, and I fall apart. And then I feel like I don't deserve anything I have. They all deserve better.

I feel so worthless. I'm so, so exhausted of not being able to escape my own brain. And I know its never really going to change, which makes me so sad because I have things to be happy for, but I can't get out of my own head."

1025,How do I talk to my doctor?,"How do I talk to my doctor?

Hi everyone, I (19 f) have an appointment with a behavioral health specialist this afternoon and I’m nervous to bring up ADHD or maybe having it. It might help that the appointment was previously scheduled for last week and I no showed because I completely forgot. I have never spoken to a doctor like this before. My life is very busy, full-time job, full-time student, significant other, etc. I just have a very hard time doing things. I always set goals for myself, I go to sleep trying to plan my goals for the next day and I wake up thinking about those that I’ve planned, but I just can’t complete them. I have projects at work with deadlines, but I literally cannot do them. I know the consequences of not completing them, and I think about what will happen if I don’t do it, and I still can’t do it. Same with school. I know that if I fail classes I’ll lose my scholarship and have to take out loans, and I care so much about that but at the same time I don’t care. It’s so hard to explain. I find myself starting things and it’s not that I can’t complete them if I really wanted to, it’s that I have a million other tasks in my mind that I might find more important or interesting and start those and it just repeats itself. I bought new electrical outlet covers for my house weeks ago and Changed out 3 of them and then started touching up paint and I stopped doing that and started something else and now my house looks like a mess. I often get overwhelmed to the point where I just break down and cry. I keep up with things that are deemed super necessary to me like my hygiene and my pets, my bills (although until I put those on auto pay I never paid on time) but other than that structure isn’t really there. I really have a hard time deciding if I’m just a lazy fuck or if maybe there’s something that I can do. I’d really appreciate any input!! Thank you"
1026,Is it weird that I feel like self harming even though I don’t have the habit and would hate the sensation?,"Tl;dr at the bottom 

My experience with self harm is 5 years ago I was very depressed and off any type of treatment and I used to hit myself in the face or trying to asphyxiate myself to make my head stop but not enough to pass out or have any type of physical sign of this. Then I was medicated, “cured” and now down the hill again, being treated but off meds. However the treatment is not working. Also, apart from the quarentene I’ve been rigorously respecting for 10 months, now I’m isolated from everyone in the house and stuck in my room cause I got Covid. They do not know about my issues. 
I’m bored as fuck cause nothing seems appealing to me as I dont have the willpower to do anything. And now I got all these thoughts in my head asking “what if I did that?”. At the same time I hate the feeling of cuts or burns and I can’t do anything that would eventually lead my family to find out about my issues.
I’ve thought a lot about it and it seems like way to validate my feelings and be sure that there is definitely something wrong with me instead of self-doubting cause I’ve been taught not to be sure of myself. Also a way to spend time since I don’t wanna do anything I can do. 
Is it weird af?

TL;DR
I’m stuck in my room and bored and I get intrusive thoughts of self harm even though I’m not into most ways of self harm and haven’t self harmed in years. Is it unusual?"
1027,Projecting? Help?,"My dad passed away several months ago due to COVID, ever since for some reason I stopped trusting my boyfriend of three years, no matter how hard I tried to stop I become absolutely furious at him for the MOST simplest of things like a sex scene in a movie or watching anime or having a girl cartoon character as one of his gamer profile pictures, I loved him so so so much we dated for three years, and all the sudden I cannot trust him, I always feel like he wants another girl or is attracted to them or is in constant pursuit of another pleasure, it drives us both mad and so I’ve been trying to break up with him off and on, has this happened to anyone else? I still love him but WHY can’t I just feel normal around him anymore? Some friends said I’m projecting my feelings about my Dad passing onto him, but honestly I don’t get it, is that why?"
1028,What is wrong with me? What can I do to over come this.,"This is something im getting off my chest so I apologize if I sound like imntrying to seek attention.  I want to keep going but every day is such a fucking struggle. There isn't a day where I don't want to punch holes in walls because of the anger I get and how trapped I feel. I feel hated unworthy and dirty around others. I wish I can be as care free innocent and happy as my peers but I simply can't see a way out of this feeling. Every comment and interaction with people just leaves me overthinking that the person hates me or rhinks I'm a fucked up mess or just boring(most bore me and irritate me). I start to doubt if people are even interested and honestly im becoming more disinterested and withdrawn from others every day. I almost never find some one that wants to have a nice conversation that isnt related to the stupid fucking anime or game they play or fandom shit they are into. I can never just connect. And what's more fucked up is i know how wrong it is to disassociate and hate people.  I want to just be alone. Some days or on an hourly basis. I feel empty, Some times even very high energy(adhd). But like a flip of a switch it goes down hill into what I mentioned.  I can't take it any more."
1029,Glad for anyone who listens,"Good on everyone here is who is compassionate and reads peoples stories and provides them with any input that could help. It can be a stressful for some to listen to so many people’s vents all day, you’re a kind and caring person and you are valued"
1030,"The SEEKING system, dopamine, and addictive disorders.","Humans have a wide variety of natural emotional dispositions. Similarly, there are many factors in the development of an addiction — one person might learn to self-medicate for anxiety, depression, or the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder while another addicted person is naturally born with an overactive dopamine-fueled SEEKING system. SEEKING is the first of the primary-process emotions.

All animals, including humans, are emotionally driven to SEEK rewards in the environment, like food, sexual mates, and survival-bestowing plant medications. The SEEKING system is modulated by dopamine and is commonly called the ‘reward’ system, which is a misnomer based on an outdated understanding of the function that dopamine has in the brain.

When this dopamine-based ‘reward’/SEEKING system is stimulated electrically or chemically, mammals energetically engage with their environment in an exploratory manner; the dopaminergic SEEKING system fills us with euphoric excitement and anticipation of rewards in the environment — think of a dog excitedly bouncing around as we walk towards him with his food bowl in our hands.

Those of us who have studied addiction might have heard of experiments in which a rat sits in a cage with an electrical probe implanted in his brain and a lever in front of him. When the rat presses the lever, he triggers an electrical stimulation of the ‘reward’/SEEKING system via the probe. Rats will continuously press the lever to stimulate this dopamine system until they die.

When I first heard of this experiment, I pictured the rat sitting in his cage in a drug-like, electrically-stimulated stupor, completely ignoring his surroundings in favor of repeatedly stimulating the ‘reward’ system, high on pure pleasure from the constant dopamine release. On the contrary, rats don’t act doped up; they actually excitedly explore their environment while the ‘reward’/SEEKING system is being stimulated — they even seem to try to search behind the lever (Panksepp, 2012).

Although Panksepp’s work has been largely marginalized, and many of us have probably never heard the dopamine system called the SEEKING system, the rest of the neuroscientific community is coming around to the perspective of affective neuroscience, and it is now well accepted that the massive dopaminergic system that we previously called the ‘reward’ system is associated with an emotional-motivational state of ‘wanting’ and that entirely different, much smaller neural systems are involved in the actual feelings of pleasure that lead us to ‘liking’ (Berridge, 2016).

Panksepp postulated that animals self-stimulate the SEEKING system not because it feels pleasurable in the way that a wonderful meal is delightful, but because it promotes a powerful internal state of SEEKING that also produces a very special positive feeling that closely resembles how we humans feel when we are full of positive excitement about the good things that are around us in the environment.

Testing and experiments consistently indicate that the SEEKING system first gets mammals excited about newly found rewards, and then learns rapidly to anticipate further rewards, if more rewards are coming. Animals that are having their SEEKING systems stimulated simply do not behave as if they are consuming a delightful treat and experiencing a sensory-affective reward, like we would assume, given that some people still call this system the ‘reward’ system. There are other regions, including the septal region, that produce behavior that is closer to what we would expect from self-stimulation of a ‘reward’ system (Panksepp, 2012).

1034,I'm making better changes in my life for good,"I'm tired of living the average,mediocre life in which I'm always complaining. I always blame my parents for growing up in a sketchy neighborhood and me and my sister always had to struggle for stuff. I'm 20 and it would certainly be a shame if I waste my Youth complaining. Constructive decisions and proper planing is something that I want to invest time in. At times I do feel like I put my mental health on stand by but it's important to take time off and make yourself a priority. Some days I feel like I'm wasting my time aimlessly and compare myself to others but instead we should focus on making my own progress. At times I do skip doing productive things like working out, reading and meditating but it's okay to mess up sometimes. Sometimes you need to close your eyes and tell yourself it's okay. At the end of the day you are your priority and even if you mess up, you can easily overcome it because you, my brother are capable of achieving big this in life 😊.

1035,I don't feel emotions very strongly,"So for my entire life I haven't felt guilt. For anything. I just don't I've lied to and cheated on everyone I loved and I mean EVERYONE, friend, boyfriend or family. It makes me feel like I should be a really bad person but I just don't care and can't seem to make myself want to care about anyone or anything. I don't really know who I am as a person but I'm a social person, I just lie and hurt people as much as I talk. I don't purposely go out of my way to do it and I'm not a spiteful person, I just can't seem to actually care. I like these people, and I get upset if they stop being my friend if I've hurt them but I can't seem to care to stop being this way, it's just how I've always been. I've only ever loved one person, not even my family although I do care for them, I've only loved my ex who I broke up with and even while with him I cheated and lied. I don't know who I am or why I'm like this but I don't know any different.



 The emotion I feel the MOST is definitely anger. I get angry super easily and I get really irritated really quickly. I used to get irrationally angry to the point of screaming and breaking things for hours on end but I kind of grew out of that and into yelling or venting until I tire myself out. I kind of just feel numb or empty a lot of the time, but my entire personality is just contradictions within itself.


I'm friendly and don't like being alone but I feel social anxiety when I'm out in public, I'm nice up-front but I'm so judgemental and awful to people in my head but I can't seem to make myself care (although I think that's most people) everything I feel and don't feel just seem to contradict themselves and I just want to know why. I feel immense sadness and can spot any emotion anyone else is feeling immediately but I don't feel empathy for them.

Sometimes I want to feel the full range of what everyone else talks about feeling but I just couldn't be bothered. Please someone tell me what this could possibly be"
1036,Feeling overwhelmed and hopeless,"So, my mental health has been going down hill since February. I’m no stranger to it being this way, but something just feels different this time around. I’m not sure I can put it into words very well, but I just feel physically uncomfortable with my thoughts. Lately, I’ve been questioning on whether or not I should stay in university or drop out which is a heavy decision to make. When I weigh my options, I get this overwhelming feeling that I can’t really explain with any other word besides uncomfortable. Like I want to have a solution to my problem, but when I think about my options, they all seem like dead ends and it makes me feel hopeless and lost which translates physically (if that makes any sense??). Sometimes I will squirm because I’m so overwhelmed with the feeling.  It happens so often and I’m so sick and tired of it all. Irrationally, I just want to stop existing so that all my problems will go away, but I know that that won’t just happen. I’ve lost almost all my motivation and sometimes getting up to do something is just so exhausting. Im trying to remedy this in anyway I can but nothing feels like it’s working. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t know how else to explain it (which frustrates me tbh)"
1037,"tw: suicidal I don't know how to respond to the question how I am anymore. If one of my few friends ask me how I am, I start crying. I don't have the energy to lie, I don't have the energy to tell them I am suicidal again. I don't know what to do. How do I find the power to lie to them?",
1038,Being short,"I’ve always been insecure about my height (5’0) because it makes me look compressed/squished. I am an average weight (100 lbs or 45 kgs) but being short and being surrounded by taller people can make me feel even shorter, and while I know they’re usually meaningless jokes hearing mean things about short people can be really hard, especially when it’s something I can’t change. This insecurity of mine is often met with confusion because a lot of the time people think that the only people who are insecure about their height are men and boys, so it’s been hard not having anyone to relate to. I’m not very intimidating or mysterious, just some annoying short person who doesn’t REALLY hate their height, they’re just crying about it for attention because no one but men are insecure about being short. (I’m not blaming men for this perception of course! Not what I’m trying to convey at all, I’m just saying that people find it unusual for me to be insecure about my height as a girl)"
1039,Annoying,I always think i annoy people by texting them because i always text a lot. That doesn't feel healthy.
1040,What do I do?,"My friend just got mad at me for liking their meme instead of responding. And I completely handled the situation wrong. Now they’re mad at me and themselves and I really don’t know what to do. I keep hurting them and I think I should dip but idk. I’m so conflicted about this it hurts, on one end I feel like they were overthinking but then again I should have said something more instead of liking it. Idk what to do."
1041,I procrastinate absolutely everything,"I’m not just talking about homework, researching unis and other school related stuff. I also procrastinate having a shower, making food, getting up to go to the bathroom. Even stuff I enjoy like watching a movie/going onto YouTube and gaming. Sometimes, I procrastinate by mindlessly scrolling through Instagram for hours. Sometimes, I just lie in bed or sit on the couch not doing anything while my brain is screaming at me to get up and do shit. Like.. the voice in my head is yelling at me “you need to get up”

As the procrastination cycle normally goes, I do eventually get things done. But my grades are dropping because I can’t study properly, my hygiene sucks and I’m just so tired of moving so slowly through life. I don’t have any low moods or feel hopeless, tearful, angry etc so it’s not a depression thing. Idk maybe I’m just super lazy. 

Does anyone else experience this? How do you deal with it?? Any advice will be appreciated right now"
1042,i think my brain is broken - help??,"sorry, the title might be a little overdramatic but i wanted to get people to read this because i genuinely need help (and i don't find anything about this on the internet). so today i realized that normally i'm miserable - i have no motivation to do anything, i hate my life and i want to lay in bed all day. i know that that alone is something i need help for but i can't go see someone rn. the part of this that caught my attention today was that sometimes it's the complete opposite. sometimes when good things happen in my life (like today i passed a test i didn't think i'd pass) i become... idk... ""manic"" might be the best word to describe it. it feels like i'm high on happiness  hormones. i could party all day because i'm overflowing of energy. i also can't focus and nothing really matters. when i'm in that state, i worry about nothing, not even about the things I KNOW should bother me. it's kinda similar to when you didn't get enough sleep and you get hyperactive, but more intense. it typically lasts for a few hours to about 2 - 4 days and then disappears until something triggers it again.

maybe i'm using the wrong keywords but when i'm searching for that, nothing pops up. does anyone know what this might be? i don't want to self diagnose but it would be nice to have an idea of what's wrong."
1043,You wanna know what’s the best part of the day?,The first 30 seconds after waking up before anxiety kicks in...and the few mins before falling asleep were u feel like you’re floating and nothing matters...

1045,Anxiety,"How do you cope with anxiety. Sometimes  I get overwhelmed  over the smallest things and at that moment I feel like it is the most difficult  thing. Then I start to do it and I realize that I over reacted..for example, when it comes to cleaning my house and I see the mess my kids have I get so overwhelmed  and I sometimes get mad at my husband because he doesn't help right away. So my question is how do you cope with the anxiety  and feeling overwhelmed. I have been like that all my life. In that moment I feel like everything is too much. Idk if I make any sense but that's how I feel and I hate it. . ."
1046,Looking for motivation,"I am 27 years old, with no income, no savings, living with my parents, but I know that I have the skills required to earn money, I know how to make money. What do I lack? Motivation? Will? Strength? Company? 

I am 27 years old, fucked up all my relationships, probably damaged their lives for good, yet I know that I am a decent guy, any girl would love to have me. What do I lack? Courage? Guts? Heart? Emotions? Empathy? Love?

I am 27 years old, I have serious issues with Commitment, Infidelity, Porn, Intoxication. I know how not to indulge, but the thoughts are always there, lurking and waiting for me to slip up. What do I lack? Will? Courage? Motivation? Am I even capable of renouncing all this?

I am 27 years old, I have great ambitions, a huge aspirational list of life goals. I know how to achieve those but have never really started towards anything. What do I lack? Direction? Are my goals not worth fighting for? Are my goals not enough to motivate me? Am I not good enough? Will I always be average?

I am 27 years old, with 65 year old parents. I know how to stay in touch and make sure they are happy, but I never do it. What do I lack? Do I not want them to be happy? Is there some anger towards them?  

I am 27 years old, with 2 nieces that that I love, I know how to stay in touch but I don't do it. What do I lack? Do I not love them enough? Do I not know the value of the time I am missing in their lives? Am I just a sucky person?"
1047,I've been isolating myself so much from the world that Idk what is normal,Since I was 11 (I'm 18 rn) i spend my days locked in my room playing videogames listening music or whatever. The problem is I never had a friend or someone to talk so idk the things that happens in my life or the things I think about are normal. If everything that is going on with my life is normal or it's only me. Sometimes I wish I have someone to talk or spend time with so I can feel how's to be normal or just to feel something.

1050,I'm absolutely terrified of dying.,"A family friend of mine passed away suddenly at 32 at the end of December. I'd already struggled with my fear of death in the past, when losing the few loved ones I have, but this one hit really different.

Someone dying who is just 3 years older than me is scary as all hell. I find myself thinking about dying many times per day, and it's so terrifying to me, I feel hysterical in my brain. Like I can't even wrap my mind around the idea of 'me' just not existing anymore.

I do have a sense of spirituality and a belief in the afterlife most of the time, but it gets shaken when I get close to death. What if it's really just the end? There is no 'me' anymore, and 'I' am not...like I am just not. How does a person even begin to wrap their brain around that idea?

I am in therapy and I'm also taking a class on death right now in college, but I wouldn't mind some support online. Or, just to find some solidarity. Does anyone just struggle to comprehend that they won't exist anymore, suddenly? I feel like I spent my whole life trying to find a sense of self and now the idea that that could be cut off at any moment just bothers me so much.

Any advice, support, solidarity would be appreciated. Even ghost stories, convince me there is something after, please. It's not disrupting my life necessarily, outwardly, but inside my head it's just coming up over and over and I would like some respite."
1051,My mental health is drastically declining and I feel like I am slowly losing myself.,"A little bit of trigger warning before I start... And also I apologize for my poor grammar. 


For three years, I’ve been struggling with my intense fear of developing schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and psychosis. That fear started when I witnessed my Aunt succumb to those illnesses and I saw how it changed her (My Aunt suddenly disappear and it’s been almost 6years since she went missing).. Everyday I am constantly fear that I might end up like her given that we have family history and my age— I’ve read it somewhere that Schizophrenia manifest on women in their late 20s and early 30s up to their 40s. 

And because of that fear I’ve experienced series of severe panic attack and dissociation and was later on diagnosed with clinical depression. I was on medication for half a year before it got better. And I really thought I was already back to normal. To my old ways. You see I grew up not knowing anything about mental illness. I had a rather fun childhood. A Normal high school and college life. I was easy going, happy go lucky, and an ambivert. I like being going out, hanging with friends, going on dates. Etc. I have exactly no idea what mental illness is because I thought I was living the best life.. but things changed and I’ve become the person I’d never thought nor imagined I would be... Someone who is constantly living in fear. 

It was late 2018 when I started having voices in my head. Usually happens when I’m about to dozed off or during an onset panic attack. Random voices that sounds familiar. Random songs that plays on loop. It never really bother me at first because I thought it happen because I’m tired and because I’m already dozing off, though, yeah, it’s was a bit scary and sometimes would freak me out but they’re still
manageable. It doesn’t happen all the time maybe  once a month or every three months. Depends also on days when I feel anxious. But still manageable and tolerable.. 


But last year, it was when I start having bad panic attack again and dissociation. It lasted quite long... then it got better for months again. Until Nov of last year when I started having episodes of panic attack and dissociation and ever since then my symptoms have worsen. For a over a month now, I’ve been worried sick that I might really be showing signs of psychosis and early signs of schizophrenia. I know it is bad to self diagnose but with my symptoms it makes me believe that I am losing my mind... the voices in my head has become louder that it sometimes prevent getting some rest. Been having nightmares and vivid dreams. I would even flashes or intrusive image of myself losing control. I’ve become so fearful of my own thoughts, emotions and surroundings. I fear that I might end up hurting the people I loved, my family, friends or myself.  I even fear going to sleep because I’m afraid that if I wake up I won’t be able to tell apart my dream and reality. I’ve become easily agitated. I’ve lost interest on things that once spark joy in my life.. I’ve become hyperaware of my actions.. my thoughts.. and my senses. And constantly put myself in check to see if I still think, speak and act “Normal”. Not a day in my life that I did not worry that I might be showing signs of schizophrenia or psychotic. I fear of losing myself and developing it. And it’s been really tiring already I haven’t been sleeping well or haven’t had enough sleep for month now. I feel exhausted physically, emotionally and mentally. I feel like I am in a brink of breakdown. I don’t know why I’m like this but it is as if I already Fear living. Like I fear LIFE ITSELF.


These fast fews day I wake up feeling like an empty vessel. I can function well but I am so detach with my body, my surroundings and my mind. Like a puppet... existing but barely living... 

I’ve been contemplating on seeking professional help. Because I am scared of my diagnosis.. WHAT IF I AM ACTUALLY LOSING MY MIND” That’s what run through my head 24/7. I fear that they might diagnose me with Schiz, BPD or psychosis because Of the voices in my head. I am afraid that the psychiatrist will be dismissive  just like my former psychiatrist. 


Sometimes I feel like crying for help. like reaching for someone that would stretch out their hand for me and tell me that I don’t need to feel scared anymore. Someone that can pull me out of this misery that I am going through right now.. I really want this to end I want to be free from this pain."
1052,My (23F) dad (59M) is having a psychotic break and I don't know what to do.,"My dad has been working at the same company for 15 years now. He enjoys work and he's good at it.

The whole pandemic has been very difficult for all of us but especially for him. Not being able to go to the office and knowing that a lot of people were getting fired started stressing him out back in March. The company where he works went through a round of firings but he managed to secure a spot.

He has worked at this new position since August of last year and from the very beginning it has been stressful for him learning to adapt to this job. He did fluff up his resume in order to secure this job and now feels he can't do the work, it's not clicking and it's really difficult.

As a family, we've been saying to him: Give it some time, you're just starting. You will get the hang of it eventually (because he's always learned how to adapt. This isn't the first switch in roles he's made at this company).

Well we're in January now and things have escalated to a whole new level. I have never seen my dad act like this in my life. He has severe delusions that he's being ostracized at work. He thinks people are out to get him (both at work, and on a government level). He told us that the company is after him for downloading some files onto a flash drive (he's had this company flash drive for 3 years and has not sold any information to anyone. He only uses it for work). He thinks that the police and FBI will show up at our door at any minute. He's constantly looking out the window and saying how no one walks around our neighborhood anymore and how it's suspicious or ""all planned"". He is hiding from people at work (always shown as ""away"" on Teams, ignoring emails, not attending meetings).

I don't know what to do here. We'll be taking him to the doctors this week. I'm pretty sure he has some form of schizophrenia or stress-induced delusion disorder. My questions;

1. Should I contact his boss directly and let him know what's going on? My dad supports our whole family and our family back in our home country. This is a big company and even though all companies preach mental health, I'm afraid the second they find out about this, he'll get fired. He's almost 60 so finding a new job won't be an option. I have a job myself but it's not enough to support the whole family.
2. What can I do to help him? I'm trying to talk slowly and calmly to him but he's just not listening. He repeats the same paranoid things over and over.

Thank you for your help, it's really appreciated.

TL;DR: My dad (59M) is suffering from a stress-induced psychotic break, and I don't know what to do."
1053,I’m terrified and can’t stop thinking about death. I’m worried by my mental health.,"I guess this is the right sub to post this. Some background: 25y, living alone and working from home during Covid. I’ve been having thoughts about death everytime. I can not conceive the idea of not existing someday. Just nothing. I’m totally terrified about it. I can’t be productive at work, can’t do anything else without shifting to this thoughts anymore. I had this thoughts before (I guess it is kind of normal in everyone), but I could always think of something else. Now, it is impossible.

Man, it hurts. It physically hurts. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t have anyone to talk about this in order to make me feel a little bit better. It is the first time in my life that I am worried about my mental health. 

I’m leaving this here with hope that someone has already gone through this and has some kind of advice."
1054,living a pathetic life,"i feel as if my life is so pathetic. i've distanced and ignored my online friends so much to the point they don't even care anymore. telling them all i'm leaving them forever even when they are wonderful people. i apparently can't keep up with having friends. or maybe i'm just better alone. it was my decision to leave them all behind. did i make a mistake? is it my fault i'm so lonely? 

i already felt lonely in their company. i constantly upset them with the stupid shit i say. i fuck everything up i'm sure it was for the best as to not keep hurting them. they all just seemed so okay with me leaving - do they hate me? i think they hate me and want me gone. one of my friends who is an ex i broke up with not too long ago said they were happy to see me leave. but said jk at the end. i know that wasn't a joke.

i'm so quick to anger i've never done that before i feel like there's no one there for me ever. i feel venting is stupid to my friends because they probably don't wanna hear it or have it worse than i do. i'm constantly fighting with my family. i'm being neglected by my mother. we were supposed to move into our new house 6 months ago. i've been living in cat shit and filth ever since.

my uncle is an alcoholic and drinks and keeps threatening to kill all of us but no. my family won't call the police on him because he's family. he'll get killed in jail. our house is a mess and cps would take us away if they saw our living conditions. he's creepy and deserves to die. i'm so fed up with all this shit. i don't wanna live like this anymore.

all of us are still staying at our grandparents filthy house while our grandparents are in their new house happy and shit. right now i'm supposed to be cleaning this cat shit filled house. god why the hell do my siblings care about these damn cats so much? they don't wanna be inside they are outdoor cats and they wanna be outside for fucks sake.

i can't sleep because of their constant screaming it's so irritating. i can't even get one hour of sleep in in result just making me more pissed all the time i'm at my worst right now. can't sleep i cut my hair a stupid way and now it's in a ponytail, the same style i had it when i first got my depression two-(three?) years ago. maybe this is predicting something? maybe i'm getting depressed again? maybe my life is just failing so much again.

i can't do anything i'm just a burden to everyone around me no wonder my friends want me gone no wonder my family is constantly mad at me. i'm the problem. i'm the asshole."
1055,Job Rejections,"So its been hurting my mental health that I got two rejections. I know that a better option will come soon, but its frustrating and exhausting. The work is hard, and i wish i would just get a break. The kids at my home site have been missing me, and i miss them too. Its just this company treats us like crap."

1057,Is this considered self-harm?,"Hello, I'm a 17 year old and I've been wondering if what I'm doing is considered self-harm

For a long while now I've been scratching at my wrist till they either become red and bruise or start to become raw (this I'm pretty sure is self-harm). However, along with that I have a tendency to pick at my nails (specifically my toenails) ripping off as much as possible, and typically making them bleed or cause discomfort . The worst it's gotten was I tore off half of my pinky toenail, and it started to bleed all over my floor. I've noticed that I tend to do this when I'm anxious about something."
1058,Feels like a kick in the teeth.,"So, I’ve never been lucky when it comes to jobs.

I’ve always had one, but I’ve always been taken advantage of in some way or another.

I work hard, to the point of exhaustion and to the point where my anxiety (I have General Anxiety Disorder and have betablockers and antipsychotics to control this.) is basically taking over and I don’t function much.

I started my current job this time last year, under the assumption I would get a pay review after 3 months as told by my boss when I accepted the role.

With the whole pandemic and being furloughed earlier last year, I didn’t think it appropriate to ask - so I left it.

Fast forward to now I finally plucked the courage to ask my boss for a raise, given all the positive feedback from clients (I work in conveyancing.) alongside all the additional hours (without pay) I’ve done, to the point where other members of staff have commented on how much I actually do in comparison to others.

The answer I got was no, try again in 6 months time. Sorry. 

Realistically I know that’s probably normal. But it’s the fact that I’ve killed myself these past few months to get things in order and just keep business flowing as usual, despite getting occasionally abused over the phone from ridiculously rude individuals.

It just kinda feels like a kick in the teeth and my self-worth (or lack there of) has just crumbled. 

A couple of diazepam and a hot bath later I’ve managed to calm myself down but I still feel ill at the thought of it. And now I’m questioning what I’m doing wrong or what I could have done better that may have ended with a different result?

I just needed to get it off my chest before I drove myself mad. 

Hope everyone is doing ok! 💖✨"

1060,Can’t bring myself to be positive,"
Hello all

I thought this subreddit would be helpful so I decided to post about my problem, but feel free to inform me of other subreddits. 

I’ve been in a stressful and depressing state for a long time (since May 2020), and I’ve been having depressing thoughts and they’ve gotten worse. What bothers me is that every time I try to be positive and enjoy life I remember that I’m having these negative thoughts and that I can’t be positive after what I’ve been through, so I give up. Does that make sense? 
What do you think I should do to solve this?

Let me know if more clarification is needed. I appreciate your efforts"

1063,"I don't remember life without depression, and I think I'm glorifying suffering","I grew up in a typical small post-soviet village. From the beginning if my memories I was surrounded with some grim hopeless atmosphere - vast fields, mud, dust and rust. Wooden houses turned gray due to aging, paint falling off the walls. Unhappy people who spent their time drinking, smoking, and arguing - because there wasn't much else left to do.

And even then, when I was a little kid I came to conclusion that I belong to this hopeless atmosphere. It felt comforting, maybe.

That's how I discovered i was different.

It was further reinforced when I was in elementary school. My classmate was hit by a car and died. We went to her house to say goodbye. Coffin was opened and I could approach it really close. I should have been sad since I knew her pretty well. But I felt nothing. She looked even better than alive - with some makeup and brand new clothes. Such a depressing beauty.

I don't remember much aside this two things. But I always seen boring and dark side of the world. So when I try to recall what it's like not being depressed there's nothing.

Through the course of my life I got some scars, broke several bones, one time it was so unlucky that couple of  joints on my fingers won't work again, gained weight, started smoking. But I either didn't care or felt that was ok. I never had some annoying birthmarks removed, missed the chance to fix my teeth with bracers, and so on. 

Sometimes I think how it would be if I was blind, or had even more scars, or lost an entire arm. Makes me feel bad but I still do it.

I still can undo most of the damage. But I'm not sure if I want. And If I want, I don't know how much will I be able to do.

I wish to be pretty and more social, have some relationships. But these are things I never had. And unknown scares/demotivates me pretty bad."
1064,I am too afraid to talk to my therapist about this.,"One day in 2016 I ate a Belvita cracker packet I thought was safe until my former girlfriend told me that she got it from some stranger in our enclosed parking garage handing out pack lunches. Now the way she told me this at first was that she received this lunch and the person giving it to her packed up her stuff and left as soon as she was given this lunch.... As soon as she told me that I began to panic, I thought I was laced with LSD or some other hallucinogen at the time. At the time I used to smoke weed pretty often but after that day I wasn't able to touch it without entering a state of extreme panic. I stopped smoking that completely. It didn't stop there though, even though I no longer smoked weed, I still had an extreme panic attack every week. Almost a year I would eat food, thought I got dosed and threw it all up. After I stopped thought I would continue this pattern of extreme paranoia thinking people had dosed me with lsd.... This continues till this day, I cant eat food I havent seen was already wrapped or drinks that wasnt already sealed or water straight from the facet. It's gotten so bad, I have panic attacks about whether or not someone dosed my soap when i showered because I cant remember if I personally opened it. I havent gone to the hospital several times because of it. I stay to myself and myself only because I feel like its too hard to trust people I dont already trust now. I dont know whats wrong with me and I feel like its too hard to meet people without drinking, it's impaired me from being normal and I am too afraid too hear what my therapist sais. What should I do?"
1065,I'm scared,"I've never really done this before, never really posted about all of it anonymously but I've been feeling so horrible lately I just don't know what else to do.  
I've dealt with mental health problems all my life, it ruined so many things for me as a kid/teen but later on I managed to catch up and fix my life, everything seemed okay, it was never supposed to get bad again but it did.  
all I can think about is the fear I have of people lying to me about who I am.  
I feel like people who care for me like friends, family, my boyfriend, his friends, his family are all just pretending that I'm normal that there's nothing too odd about me and i feel like people outside or at work are just being polite, no one talks to me there for long, i get weird looks all the time. there's this one guy at work that genuinely seems like he's having fun talking to me but I have doubts about him too  
I feel like I live in a world where everyone just feels sorry for me. you know how when children see a person without a leg or an arm and they scream out 'mum whats wrong with that guy?' or something like that? but older people try not to stare at all and seem nice about it? make him feel like it's normal?  
(sorry if it seems rude im just trying to explain i really dont mean to be rude...)  
I'm always looking for a kid to notice, to out something that i cannot see about myself since the adults wont, but I dont think kids understand crazy  
I don't like going to work not because i'm lazy or sleepy or a 12 hour night shift is tiring as fuck but because I don't want to be seen. I don't care about it too much if im just taking a walk cause im used to weird looks outdoors cause when I was homeless it was just an everyday thing  
but feeling that same way after i've gotten my shit together, I smell normal, I dress normal, I even wear fucking make-up and style my hair.. and its not even trauma, I didn't feel weird about it when i was homeless.  


I also had an ex, who'd try to tell me in his own ways that I was nuts, and i know i was back then but the panic attacks have stopped, I don't cry at everything anymore and I dont wake up with new wounds every morning anymore, I've done everything to get a better life, I've done everything to be a better person, to be worthy of love and companionship but something still feels wrong, it went away for a few months after i started working on myself but it started all over again.  
My boyfriend is an amazing person, things he does for me truly make me feel special and respected but the thing is I feel like he's like me, I feel like he's just as weird as me and people just wont tell either of us, I feel like there's so many people like us in this world and none of us know, cause the normal ones feel pitiful, they try to protect our feelings and such.  


I wanna run away to the woods or try moving out of my city, maybe even my country and go live somewhere else, see if i still feel the same, leave everything and everyone behind, heck even get a whole new identity. and now another thing that my brain does just when I want to do/say something important, it's basically thoughtless and feels cold, i have no idea if thats normal or not.   


I can't go to doctors, I used to and they gave me drugs that made me worse, changed them to stronger ones and fucked me up even more, it didnt make sense at that point whether i existed or not, didnt feel or remember anything properly.  
i dont want this life, I want to kill myself so fucking badly but the guilt is holding me back, and even if i step over that I'm so afraid of surviving again.  
at this point I just smoke more, eat less and whatever I eat i try to make it junky, I dont talk to anyone, havent seen my friends in months, I feel like maybe I should leave my partner too, I dont want him to get hurt but I'm not sure since I know he needs me I know he will get hurt either way doesnt matter if its by me leaving him or dying in depression and agony."

1068,what does this sound like to you?,"(im not asking for him to be diagnosed over the internet, just looking for advice and personal experience)


my sisters boyfriend lives with us. im 23, my sister and her bf are 24, and my dad is super old, like in his 80s


her bf has really bad anxiety, depression, ibs, and hes also bipolar and epileptic (hes on meds for them all). he had a seizure a week ago (it was his 4th one i think), and ever since then hes been acting weird. hes short and snappy with my sister, hes been throwing up (we think from anxiety of officially being diagnosed with epilepsy? or ibs, or both), hes been extremely anxious and off, like confused and dazed and more ditzy than usual (even after his other seizures, and this one wasnt as bad). hes been to the hospital like 10 times within the past 2 months, either from him freaking himself out and making himself sick, or from seizures/ibs


my sister said today he said he “felt weird” and looked like he was about to pass out. we have all been terrified hes going to have another seizure. while my sister was taking a nap, he got an obvious scam call saying his social security number was stolen, and he FREAKED OUT. he called his dad who said it was fine and it was just a scam. but he didnt believe it, so while my sister was sleeping, he literally called 911...


i know its probably way harder for him right now, but his behavior is worrying and scary to me. i have emetophobia and anxiety so i cannot STAND his constant throwing up. it genuinely makes me want to die and i start sobbing every time


hes also literally like 6’5 and over 300 pounds while im only 5 feet tall and my dad is really old, and i know this sounds stupid and mean but im so scared and anxious hes going to hurt us or hurt himself? i dont mean that like “omg hes bipolar hes going to snap and kill us/himself” 


im just so scared and uncomfortable in my own home because of him. like he called 911 over a scam call and he wanders around the house weirdly and slurring his words and hes been acting so off lately. like mean (to my sister) and snappy and dazed. im so anxious and upset and i dont know what to do or who to talk to"
1069,why do i feel jealous that my best friend now has new friends?,"i moved cities a few months ago. last time i saw my best friend was a few months ago.

we barely text. eventhough we made a promise to check on eachother every day, and im always the first to message him. but i recently stopped because i got bored of the same casual conversation happening over and over again.

whenever were on the phone together, he mostly talks about himself, since im not an open person. we barely call eachother anymore.

he tags me in his stories, in his photos. it always has something to do with one of his 'new' friends. i feel replaced, sad and hurt.

i never get jealous, so i really hate this feeling. what can i do to stop this? my brain wont allow me to accept it, i am unsure why."
1070,i escaped from a hospital and i barely remember it,"so i was in hospital for 5 days, recently, not a mental hospital just a medical one. i had a 1:1 because of the reason i was there. on my 2nd night there i felt really weird and this sudden thought came into my head. “take your iv out”. so i spent the next hour taking my iv out slowly so no one would notice what i was doing. my 1:1 at the time was a student nurse, if there had been a fully qualified one i probably wouldn’t have gotten away with it. i waited for the ward nurse to go on break, then i said that i was going to the bathroom. the 1:1 had to follow me, so i had my iv in my hand and i took the iv pole with me, then when i got to the hall i bolted out the door. i remember people calling my name and someone shouted for security. next thing i’m crouched on the floor with muck and blisters on my feet (i was barefoot), hyperventilating and i didn’t know where i was. a fox walked past me and ran down a lane. then i remember nothing again, until i’m sitting on the handrail part of a bridge over a road with my legs dangling off it. i didn’t know what time it was but it was still dark and birds were starting to sing. a woman on a bike walked past me and said nothing. it goes blank again, and then i’m right outside the hospital with a security guard holding both of my arms  and 2 others following her inside to escort me back to my room. the nurse greeted me back and i saw the clock and it was almost 5am. it was around 11:30pm when i had asked to go to the bathroom. all that plus the reason i was there in the first place and i still got discharged with a “safety plan” of try to sleep, get rid of sharps and medication and here’s some resources."
1071,I've dealt with depression for over 10 years,"I went inpatient, tried many different antidepressants at the sametime, therapy, and now TMS. And I feel like nothing has helped. TMS was my last resort and now that i feel like this isnt working, i dont know what to do about my depression anymore."
1072,"My family is breaking apart, serious advice needed","Hey, thanks for taking time out of your day to listen to some random stranger online, I really appreciate everything and people like you deserve all the love you get. Anyways, to fill you in, I am 16 years old currently, I live in a family of four with my


Mother, (Step)Father, (Step)Sister, and Me.


For the past 6 years that my mother and father had been together, I had enjoyed my life, it was peaceful and I finally felt like I had a father figure again after my biological father left. 


But I am here today to discuss how this seemingly great family, is just crumbling away, and killing me in the process. 


I know reddit is not the best choice for therapy or advice, however, I am broke, most free online therapy sites require you to be atleast 18 years old. So I turned to here, the only site I can trust because some people, like you, are actually serious and are willing to help others. 


Although I have this loving family, regret was all I could feel 2020, regret and anxiety. You see I have a curse as do many others, I overhear on things I shouldn't be, especially when I dont want to. And so this ties in to the card of the deck, around early 2020 once everyone settled in at home because of COVID, I overheard a conversation I wish I never did. 


My mother was talking on the phone to another man, talking about what they're doing, about me, my sisters, and my pets. I could tell it wasnt for work and definitely wasnt my father since he already knew most of the stuff, he was at the gym at the time as well. And my father doesnt just call randomly at the gym unless its important. And so this conversation piqued my interest and caused me to snoop where I wasnt supposed to. I later found a Google Voice account filled messages from other numbers, and it definitely was not for work. I knew that once I found this I jumped to a conclusion, that my mother was cheating on my father.


I made possibly the worse decision and that was doing nothing, I just let it play out as the months passed, hoping that everything would fix itself. And to no surprise I was wrong, she was texting others in public now, still trying to hide it, a lot more frequently. 


I was still scared to confront her, thinking what would it do? I allowed this spark of anxiety to later fuel a dark void that began to consume me.


Any hint of her talking to these other people began to swirl my feelings and gave me this fear I cant even explain. I just felt like it's all going to end once my father finally catches her, the family I had a peaceful life with is now making me contemplate on what's to come next. 


This growing void in my feelings only got worse, until I noticed something, the same curse that started it all picked up something once more. I overheard my mother arguing at my father who was sitting on the couch. She scolded him about how she was doing the laundry, cooking, and giving my sister a bath. While my father does nothing and sits on the couch watching TV. As soon as I heard those words my gut almost turned inside out at that point, everything that I thought my mom did wrong, suddenly had the other end of the spectrum (my dad) in the wrong. 


This is what I meant by the dark void consuming me alive, I dont even know what to do... My mother seems happy when shes talking on the phone to this man, and I want to make her happy. But on the other hand, my father is helpful too I think that because of the COVID and how everyone is at home he's slacking off at home. But then again, just because of Covid doesn't mean he cant do anything while my mother does 3 things at once. But I should also be helping too, but what If I get in the way and cause more harm than good? Then again my father has been loyal from what I know, he may not help as much but I still look up to him. What will happen next? Will I get split from my family, is it going to be like when I was 8, just me an my mother again? All of these thoughts just feed into the fire, and it's going to traumatize me.


I'm too afraid to confront my mother because I doubt anything will change, even so, she might just downright deny it. Or do I tell my father about this possibly making it all worse? Or do I just do nothing like I have for the past year!? 


All of this is a lot to take in, so I once again want to thank you for taking the time out of your precious day listening to me, if you know what to do in this situation that would seriously help please tell me, anything is appreciated and I wish you all a great 2021!"
1073,Me wanting affection from mostly guys or just to be loved,"This grammar is horrible 


This sounds all so weird but I would appreciate if you read and maybe can give me some advice or clearance on why I’m like this.

I’m a straight 19 year Young Man and as a kid I never got along with my dad and we would have our moments where we would get along but most of the time we have always had a not okay relationship,one time when I was little and I told my dad “I love you” and he laughed on the phone and said “whatever lol” it really effected me.

But let’s speed this up I never really got along with my brothers and they have both physically fought me before as a kid and there very delusional and my mom who I love so much would also not stand up for me ,I don’t like them they are my blood brothers but I have no love for them like that.

Fast forward to today it seems like I’m searching for more men friends I can build a brotherhood with or have that bond I never really had it’s like I have gotten so much affection from women in my life and I just really want to be loved in a brotherhood type of way with a man it sounds all so crazy and I don’t know what in my childhood or trauma caused this but,

I did meet some guy and we built a amazing brotherhood together he would call me brother and we would do everything together but after some fights between us because of his racist and manipulative behaviour and me calling him out all the time he just one day dropped me and stopped talking to me.

I was so torn up and lost because that was like my brother ,

I like to be hugged by guy I don’t why but I just want love from brothers since I never had that in my life really."
1074,I'm a little confused,"I'm a 14y old girl and I really don't know what's wrong with me. since the year 2020 existed I've gotten worse, not physically but mentally. (this has been happening since I was in 6th grade)

I've been dozing off ""A lot"" lately and my parents hate it. I am even more hella shy, I literally shake if even try to talk to anyone online. sometimes cry for no good reason at all, now my dad has anger issues so he'll yell at me even if he didn't mean to. once he yells at ill burst into tears or I'll get angry I'll cry. And I'm not even trying to cry but I just do it anyway. And if there's something I don't like or it bothers me I quote ""I will destroy it"". sometimes I can't even control my emotions anymore, such as anger, sadness, or happiness. yes have uncontrollable mood swings. and once the mood swing is over I just don't talk at all and sit in silence. I've been thinking suicidal by not even being suicidal, and it's just weird. oh and I've been getting a lack of sleep too.

my school supervisors say I might have bipolar or mood disorder BUUUUUUT I can't go to the hospital cuz of covid-19 protocols and stuff so I one of you guys can help me out here, that will make things a bit easier. Please and Thank you :)"

1076,"I think I have depression but I don’t really know the symptoms, could you guys help me?","I have been doing online school and have been to a total of 5 places since the pandemic. I have lost pretty much all of my interest in my hobbies. I get no motivation or joy out of playing video games anymore, and it wasn’t like a slow decline, i just suddenly wasn’t motivated to play them. I have no motivation for school and all I want to do is just be on my phone and not do anything. I’m also pretty sure I’m suffering a porn addiction which might be adding to it and I’m trying to fix it.

1077,My parents are very dismissive of my mental health,"Hello, it’s my first time on this subreddit so I’m not sure if this is completely appropriate but I can’t think of anywhere else to say this. This might be more of a vent post but i would appreciate some insight/opinions. So, I’m a junior in high school (16 years old), but living has been (mostly) very difficult for me since around the beginning of 7th grade. I’ve gone through times that were worse than others, but in general, even if I’m somewhat content with life that feeling of despair still lingers at least in the back of my head. I also started being very afraid of social interaction. I’ve always been really good at hiding all of that, though, because my parents are busy people and I didn’t want to add more to their plates. I always thought I would just get over it on my own. Anyway, this past year has diminished all hope for me completely. For context, I moved to America from another country in August of 2019. We were complete strangers in our state; we had no family or friends or anything. Like I said, I’ve grown to become very afraid of social interaction so I haven’t had much success in making friends. As of January 2021 I have made one on/off friend that gives me the impression that he thinks I’m annoying all the time. Basically, everything I’m dealing with I’m dealing with alone. My only emotional support is my boyfriend but he lives in another state so what he is able to do is limited. I struggle with very very bad jealousy and insecurity issues, mainly over my appearance, to the point where we broke up over it until I could get my shit together. I have a very horrible view of myself. Around late October I suddenly developed this overwhelming want to be skinny and even eating just riddles me with guilt now. Im obsessed with counting calories, my weight, and keeping eating to a minimum. I’ve started cutting. It seems like the only thing that helps. There’s also intense pressure on me to excel academically. My mom noticed my cuts one day and just looked at me like I was crazy, then we never brought it up again. I’ve started skipping classes and crying in the bathroom because of random pangs of anxiety and feeling lightheaded all day because the only sustenance I had was a Monster energy drink. I feel so trapped and like nothing will ever get better. One day, my mom asked me about why I’ve been skipping classes and I just broke down and told her everything. I told her I wanted to maybe go see a psychiatrist so I could get a proper diagnosis for anything I might have so I could try and deal with it properly. She said it was all part of being a teenager and that I was delusional and would grow out of it and that it was all because of my perfectionist personality. I think I do agree w her to a certain extent, but I think problems that arise during teenage years should be dealt with, not ignored... I’ve tried talking about it again today and she just got mad and told me that I need to take more vitamins.... yeah idk lol. What makes it all worse is that both my parents are ophthalmologists (aka eye doctors) and have a pretty good idea about every field of medicine besides optics. I’ve considered talking to my father, but I remembered that one time I referred to myself as “emo” as a joke (I meant it more so referring to how I dress all dark n stuff) and he was taken aback and kinda pissed and said “don’t call yourself that. You’re not emo, you’re a normal, happy, life loving girl.” So I think going to him telling him that I might need mental help would just make things worse since he doesn’t even want to consider the thought that there might be something wrong with me. I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do. I’m downright miserable and it feels like I’m just screaming into the void, as cheesy as that sounds. I’ve thought about just raw dogging it until I’m 18 and I can do things and go get checked on my own, but I don’t know if I can last that long. I just want it all to end. So.... yeah. Idk. If you made it this far, thanks for reading =) any replies are appreciated.


TL;DR doctor parents won’t even entertain the thought that I might have a mental illness despite fairly obvious signs and me vocalizing my misery. Refuse to let me get treated or even diagnosed and say I will grow out of my delusional thoughts on my own."

1080,"Anyone else automatically fill in question 9 with a ""0"" every time regardless?",Throwaway. Last time I just ended up getting phone calls about it and I just couldn't be bothered after that. I think I have a dangerous threshold where I just don't want help anymore.
1081,Kaiser mental health,"Kaiser Mental Health program sucks. In my experience, they only want to duct tape those who are admitted then send them out without fixing the core problem.

1) **They only see you in 6-8 weeks**. When I first started seeing my therapist, he would continuously book 6-8 weeks apart.  I didn't have the balls to ask why but when I requested a new therapist recently (see below), preferably one who can see me more frequently, he said that it probably wouldn't happen because it's in a dense population.  He also said he can read between the lines and that a out of network is also probably not going to be an option as they've put a lot of effort in to their mental health branch and are unwilling to send patients away.

2) **They don't explore problems with you, just overload you with info.**  Within 20 minutes of seeing my therapist, he diagnosed me and sent me to the psychiatrist for meds.  Psychiatrist said he doesn't think I need meds, just therapy.  Subsequent sessions were the therapist talking the whole time about him, his patients and techniques of ACT. The whole process felt rushed.

3) **They will kick you out.**  After about a year (\~6-8 sessions) of listening to the therapist ramble on and on, he printed out my mood test results.  He said I no longer qualify to get therapy because the statistics show that I am ""better"".  He quoted that he could probably see me once more but he would get in trouble with the supervisor because the numbers don't lie.

4) **It's a pain to change therapists.**  I've asked early in my sessions if I could, my therapist did not recommend I change therapists in the middle.  I've also asked Kaiser - they said I had to go through my therapist so I gave up.  Recently I called my therapist again (after being kicked out) and requested it.  He suggested I do some alternative program because in his professional opinion I am a little worse than the norm and may benefit me better.  I insisted and he finally said he would contact the people for a transfer.  I haven't received any transfer information but I'm crossing my fingers.

This was my experience, hopefully once the transfer comes through it'll get better.  But if not, the next company I go to, I really truly hope they don't have Kaiser as a health care option."
1082,Can you grow out of hallucinations?,"TW: self harm, paranormal experiences (?)

So, I've been struggling with my mental health for... as long as I can remember. (24 F) 
And the doctors diagnosed me with anxiety &amp; depression when I was about 17. I've seen a few therapists and currently speaking to one at the moment. We've talked quite a bit about trauma that happened during my childhood and adolescents.
Idk, I always felt like the diagnosis never fully got to the bottom of what I have, its just never felt like it fully explained why I'm the way I am. I suspect I may have autism and want to investigate that further but its tricky at the moment due to the pandemic. (I'm not sure if this is relevant to what I'm about to speak about but thought I'd add it just incase to give some back story) 

Anyway I'm kind of freaking out because I feel as though I've suddenly unlocked some suppressed memories. 
When I was a kid, I was convinced my house was haunted. I heard things, like banging and felt people sat on me while I was in bed. It was all I could think about most the time for years and years. I barely slept because I was so frightened. I remember my mum telling me she got a priest to come and exercise the house but they said they couldn't feel a presence. (I was a kid at the time so I have no idea if thats actually true or not because it supposedly happened while I was at school) 
I suddenly remember really vividly a time when I was 10 years old, I woke up with a really strong urge to cut myself with a knife. I went downstairs and picked up the knife and then suddenly I saw a figure run past my kitchen window. Like it was there right im front of me, a real person expect they were completely white and didn't have a face. I was so spooked I think I ran straight back to bed.

I don't think it ever happened again apart from if I had a fever sometimes I would hallucinate shadow figures in my room etc. Eventually as I got older I stopped feeling as though there was a ghost in my room. I don't think the feeling ever necessarily left, but instead of it actually being physical it turned into more of a sensation? Like a tight feeling on my chest sometimes that there's an evil presence nearby. So maybe its a similar thing just manifesting itself differently.

Now, I have a kid and a partner and I'm rarely ever alone so it doesn't really happen that much anymore. But still, I don't really like to be alone in the dark unless there's a TV on otherwise I feel a bit uneasy. 

I never mentioned it to my therapist because I guess id forgotten about all that stuff from my childhood and just pinned it down to being afraid of the dark. I don't know if that makes any sense. I just wanted to know if anybody else had experienced this.

I don't really get urges to hurt myself anymore because I want to be present for my child."
1083,Am I traumatized?,"So retail kinda sucked when I worked it. I’m autistic, so communication with NT’s is *very* difficult. When I first started working it, I would unintentionally offend people all the time, and tbh. I still don’t know how I do it or how to prevent it.

That being said, I got yelled at by customers a lot. Which would cause anxiety attacks, which made things worse. I work at a hospital cafeteria, so it’s not like I got a random group of strangers every day, they were always the same people. Doctors, nurses, ect. Once the cashier got tired of hearing the complaints, she just outright started telling people about my autism, and their attitudes completely changed. They were nicer, didn’t get mad as easily. That sort of thing.

Despite the change, I always had that fear of being yelled at again. So I decided to switch over to being a dishwasher in the back, where I didn’t have to try and mask so much. I wouldn’t have to be afraid of being yelled at, cuz my coworkers know me.

Well today they tried to put me on retail at the last minute. I don’t react well to things unexpected or outside of my routine, but my reaction was a little extreme, and it’s concerning. I had arguably one of the worst anxiety attacks I’ve ever had, and I wasn’t sure if it was going to turn into a meltdown.

Thankfully they didn’t keep me out there long, as I began to feel nauseous from the anxiety. I took a few minutes drinking ginger ale, and went back to doing dishes. Then everything was fine.

Is this a sign of trauma tho? All I could think about was all of my bad memories, being taken to the office to be talked to only for me to tell the manager I don’t understand, being yelled at to the point of of having a breakdown. I’m surprised the retail manager at the time even kept me there! I cannot mask to save my life, and people did not take that very well."

1086,I will never be good enough at anything and I don’t want to live anymore,"I really need help or advice with this, I don’t know what to do. I have convinced myself that I’ll never be good enough at anything or know enough about anything. I’m certain I don’t have a personality or any interests. I have so much school work to do, but I procrastinate on it and then can’t do it when the time comes because I keep crying about how much I hate myself. Every day is terrible, I have constant anxiety attacks where I do nothing but lay on the floor for hours. 

I have very few interests and hobbies, and all of them are mainstream and basic. I’m not a “super fan” of anything and because of this I feel stupid and fake. Not even music makes me happy anymore, because all I care about are my listening stats (I track my music using lastfm) and how diverse i am and how much I know about certain artists. Instead of doing work, I force myself to listen to new albums/interviews/live shows/documentaries constantly, even though I don’t want to, because I feel like I have to know everything. I don’t even pay attention to any of it so I don’t know who I’m trying to impress. 

I want to take a break from social media but I always come back to it. I see people online who seem to know everything and are super interesting, I take a break from social media for a bit, and then I feel like I have to learn more things, not because I want to, but because I want to be perfect. And how do you learn about things? The internet. It’s a viscous cycle and I am spending almost all of my day online instead of doing work because of this. 

Even when I’m not online, I’m doing activities for school. But no matter what I do I always feel the need to do more work, join more clubs, etc. I will never be good enough for myself. I hate myself for being so boring and I have no friends because of this. And the people I do talk to don’t give a shit about how I’m feeling, let alone answer at all. I need help or advice or something because whenever I try to focus on myself and be happy for once it doesn’t work out. I have been contemplating suicide lately and I’m scared"

I tried to stop doing that and i think it worked a little bit. But i get still irritated when they compliment each other in front of me, because i want the compliments and i don‘t want that feeling, i want to be happy for them, i want to not feel that envy and jealousy anymore and just be happy for my friends. I think i‘ll have to learn that myself but can someone maybe tell me a quicker way? I don‘t know i‘d take any help i can get"

Also got head pressure and feel like I'm not me-
Like all my thoughts are the wrong energy and like not my personality/voice

I overanalyse everything and feel nothing but doubt and anxiety, like i can't even be sure if I like anything, i'm just so scared I can't even be sure i believe my own feelings and decisions even when I try to feel/make them

The only thing is fucking meditation but that only helps at the moment like for sleeping. I can't meditate all day. I get so much anxiety and depression that I want to puke. My mind can probably go 20 seconds max with out some sort of worry or fear. I guess the only way they will take me serious is when they find me dead."
1090,Knock knock. Who’s there? No clue.,"So it’s been a year. Pretty sure it’s Bipolar 2. Starting last summer, I was cripplingly depressed for six months straight, maybe longer, I don’t remember. I don’t remember anything from that time honestly, my brain forced it out. I would sometimes have periods where one day I couldn’t get out of bed, and the next I suddenly had inhuman levels of energy. I was the most talkative kid in the school.. for about two days. Then I was depressed again. 

Recently, over winter break, I had this same burst of energy and motivation, and it lasted for a solid 1-2 weeks. I had the urge to learn the entire Japanese language, drop everything going on in my life, and move to Japan. If I wasn’t only sixteen, I don’t doubt I would’ve actually considered following through. 

Every symptom I have matches up with bipolar disorder 2, but I just never know for sure. I have so much other crap going on in my head, it could honestly be anything. Over the past week I’ve been depressed for a day or two, but other than that I’ve felt relatively normal.

 My parents led me on about taking me to a therapist, they asked me what kind I wanted, etc. etc., and then they never followed through. I’m just left in the dark and I don’t really have a good grasp of what’s going on. I feel like I’m making it up, but I KNOW I was suicidal just a few months ago, and I KNOW I wanted to move to Japan just a few weeks ago. 

I used to have really intense mood swings, but now they’re less intense. Sometimes I’m really depressed, sometimes I’m normal, sometimes I’m really hyper (but that’s more rare). I’m just so C O N F U S E D. 

I’m sorry this all seems so convoluted, I did a really bad job of explaining, I just want to know if anyone else is just as confused as me."

I don't know if I'm really planning to do anything with it.

It can't take that long, can it?


I'm probably going to go to the place,

 I was half a year ago.

I haven't changed anything since then.

The fifth opportunity for change missed.

If not by now, why would it ever.

If it's not going to work, there's nothing left.


I guess there is one more try.

Even with that I can't keep up the fassade of optimism.

Others have it so much worse.

I don't have it in me to be satisfied with that.


I don't think I have ever been afraid to be there.

I'm so close to not being afraid to go there.

What could even help me now.

There is no finished state of being helped.


A few people will be hurt that it's done.

They will never not be, when it's done.

They will never not be, when it's not done.

They are few.

They don't know it almost happened.

They don't know it will happen.

They won't know why it happened."
1092,How do you get better at being in your own company?,"A bit of a backstory. 
I have BPD and I'm in a LDR (I see him once a month because we support bubbled with each other). 

He's my person in every sense of the way and I look forward to spending my evenings and weekends with him. He works from 4am til 4pm Monday to Friday. 

The thing I struggle with so much is being left to do my own thing. I literally feel like I'm just waiting for him to finish work for my day to start. I've never been good at being in my own company, I struggle with heavy thoughts and racing anxiety a lot in with a risk of sounding dramatic, the only thing that's ever helped is being with my SO. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to get better at being alone? How to develop a routine when you can't go outside or see anyone? 
I'm really struggling right now."
1093,"I just don't want to ""be"" anymore","I don't know what else to say. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'll feel different tomorrow, or maybe I'll feel the same yet again. Goodnight."
1094,Is there anywhere online that I can get diagnosed?,"For background, I’m a minor with no money. I can feel that my mental health isn’t good but I’m terrified that my brain is copying people I see on the internet (most of the ppl I follow are very open about mental health and disorders) I feel like my brain is telling me that I need help for attention. I can’t talk to my parents and I think I’m getting emotionally abused but I’m scared that my brain is just faking it. Idk how to word it but there’s that. I’m on mobile so there’s probably spelling errors"
1095,Pretending someone is watching?,"Hello! I first want to say, I have a lot of softer trauma, and have dealt with ocd, depression, and anxiety because of this. But something I don’t quite get is something I’ve been doing as long as I can remember.

In middle school, I would watch a show and pretend in my real life that the characters were watching. Pathetic right? Well, I still do. I’m in my mid 20’s, and I still do this. I make up this story in my mind that’s I’m a characters long lost sister, and the characters are watching me on a screen. Or something like that. I can’t say it destroys my reality, but distorts it.

I haven’t admitted this to anybody because it’s truly embarrassing. But I’m hoping someone here can help me out with what the issue is. Thanks!"
1096,How to not get worse?,"I have dealt with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder for many years. 2019/2020 was the first time in my life where I had recovered almost entirely from depression and the eating disorder. 
I had some severe life changes come about in the last 3-4 months, however and now it is all back. I am holding down two jobs and now living with my parents this time, which is wild if you had seen me through most of my teens and early twenties, but I feel like it's just getting worse and worse and I am terrible to be around. I am so angry and cynical. I dont want to be but I feel like I am just barely able to smile and say ""ya"" or ""cool"" or ""no problem"" and not hiss at them to shut up and stop bothering me when my roommate or my colleagues talk to me. I kind of want the world to burn atm. I want to do something to self-distruct or go off the rails in someway and I feel like I'm right on the edge of cracking or having a panic or curling up in a ball and not moving for the next few months all the time. 
I can't breathe. I feel like I'm drowning. My significant other is across the world in my old home and I have no idea when or how ill be able to get back to that life and to him and he is also spiraling and not doing well. 
I am not working towards anything concrete right now, and I dont even know if anything would work anyway. Every time I have tried to find a solution and worked really hard and thought things were going to get better, my hopes were crushed and it made me less willing to fight or to even keep going at all.
I just want to go to sleep and dream forever. 
I dont want to die but I don't want to live if life just keeps getting darker and darker and all my hard work ends up being for nothing. 

How do I stop being so angry so I can be better to be around? How do I stop feeling so low-energy and exhausted and overwhelmed all the time?"
1097,I don’t know how much longer I can hold on,I was discharged from my counsellor just before quarantine and I’ve been on a waiting list about 3 months to see her again but I don’t know if I can hold on much longer. I’m just getting so tired. It’s the same everyday. Getting up is a chore. I’ve become so numb. Of course there’s little moments when I’m talking to friends but as soon as I’m left alone with my thoughts I just kinda go on auto pilot. The only thing keeping going is that I couldn’t deal with the guilt of leaving my loved ones behind. But I’m really struggling right now. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I’ve tried opening up to my friend but every time I end up deleting the paragraph. I just don’t want to dump this on them. Idk what to do at this point
1098,What do you do to help get you through the toughest parts of your day?,"Tips, tricks, advice are all greatly appreciated!"
1099,Can’t deal with mentally ill aunt,I have a aunt that is mentally ill. She suffers from schizophrenia. She’s so annoying and every single day she bothers me so much. I already struggle with my own problems and I’m tired of her constantly bothering me and screaming at the top of her lungs. She’s so mental and constantly cries about her weight and screams at the top of her lungs day and night like a crying baby. Her mental illness isn’t even an excuse because she acts perfectly normal when her psychiatrist comes and checks on her. She eats all my food and then cries about being overweight and she would always scream and say racist stuff no one should say and our neighbor constantly complains and no longer speaks to us like they used to because she would say so much racist stuff about their race. She never listens and is extremely selfish and an attention seeker. She never listens and is constantly screaming at the top of her lungs and crying. She acts like an entitled brat and screams and cries when she doesn’t get what she wants. It stresses me out so much because I can never focus or study and I’m already dealing with depression and my own fucking problems.She’s literally screaming and crying right now because I won’t share anymore of my food with her since she ate all of my fucking food and I had nothing left to eat
1100,What to tell future employers?,"I’ve had a year off work because of how unwell I’ve been. Like ‘can’t get out of bed, ended up in hospital twice’ kind of unwell. I don’t really want to divulge this information in an interview, so how do I go about getting a job without them thinking I’m just lazy? I mean, I can be lazy but that wasn’t the reason I had time off and I’m actually a very dedicated employee usually. I really want to get back to the land of the living. I’m about to start studying nursing anyway but at some point I’ll probably have to explain that gap in my resume and I’m not super keen on it."
1101,Am I repressing something?,"I (29M) have always had trouble sleeping but way beyond the scope of just struggling to drop off.

It’s been less-so in recent years but still has a major effect, I have always for as long as I could remember been overcome with absolute dread when trying to sleep.

I’ve suffered from sleep paralysis and night terrors sporadically through my adult years, and it’s not been so bad since technology allowed me to have a noise of some sort. But I still struggle to sleep in silence, or in the dark. I can’t explain specifically but it’s an expectation of someone or something being in the room, and I must pretend to be asleep out of fear.

This has caused me so much strife for as long as I can remember and I wish I could stop it. I have so many sleepless nights because of this unexplained horror, and it really affects my daily life.

I’m from a single parent family, but my mother is unstable and a compulsive liar; I 100% believe she would hide it from me if something had happened when I was younger, because she would take it as a criticism against her parenting. I honestly don’t know if I want to find out the truth though.

Is it likely that some incident(s) which I don’t remember has left me with some repressed trauma causing all this?"
1102,I have horrible anxiety I need help,"hey all, I have phobia interacting with people. I am having a tough time interacting with people and feel very lost. I do not get out of the house because Im deeply scared to be around people. Can someone help me here? give advice maybe?"
1103,What problem do I have?,"I(17m) I think am not normal. I came from the country where mental health problems aren’t discussed and here I am to share some of my problems to know if this is normal Idk, how to describe this all but today I was in class my brain guide me to scream in class which of course I won’t but I had to battle with my thoughts. Someone even noticed that I had wired expression change while battling with my thoughts. That was just simple accident. It wasn’t difficult to battle with actually it was easy to find inner justification on why I shouldn’t do it but my problem is worst than this when i am alone. My thoughts say to me that I am gay. I’m not! But I was highly doubting at some-stage. I google many wired questions to justify my inner self that I am not gay but my thoughts are so illogical which I know but at some point I believe my thoughts. 
But what if I say to you that it’s also a minor disturbing thoughts compared to what I have to deal with now. Nowadays I am dealing with the fact i.e. “Time is short” and I am not doing valuable things and this time will never return. I’ll get old one day. Even when I see some kids I compare them to myself that why am I not like them not actually but like I feel like I didn’t do something. Blah..blah..blah.. This is hard to describe. But yeah I always imagine wired shit. This probably might not be some mental health issues actually I should stop overthinking but it’s hard to stop these thoughts. Also I forgot to mention when I go near to kids my brain imagine wired sexual stuffs. Not only to kids with everyone even with goddesses. We every day worships and do pooja and we have a big picture of goddesses on other room. I’ve avoided going there cause my brain is so unholy. lol. It really feels wired to write this. Even I stop watching a youtuber. Only thing my brain imagine when I am watching him is sexual stuff and forces me that I am bisexual. Not just unsubscribe and unfollow but I blocked so that I can avoid this thoughts. I blocked him around 2 months ago and now I don’t dare to unblock. Now I have successfully defeated that thought that I am not bisexual but my brain says I am forcing myself that I defect but I didn’t. lol. It doesn’t make sense. English isn’t my native language. Idk, how to describe.

Beside all this wired thoughts I am easily distracted. I’ve heard of AHD or something like that. It’s a mental health condition where you’re easily distracted. So, that isn’t normal to get easily distracted? It feels like it must be normal I’ve seen lots of memes that gets lots of likes about being easily distracted. Does That means Everyone has suffered from AHD? I’ve searched about this and I can relate to the every symptoms but it feels normal to me that I am dealing like everyday since I can remember.

I can’t write everything that I had to deal with here cause if I did. I think a week will be less enough to read all the things but yeah Am I normal?"
1104,I'm scared *TW* suicide/suicidal thoughts,So my girlfriend suffers from clinical depression and tonight at around 12:09 UK time she sent me her final message of the night saying she wanted to kill herself. It is now 1:40am UK time and for the last hour she's been declining all my calls and not answered my texts. What should I do? I dont have her parents numbers or her house address because we live hours apart and I'm not eligible to drive yet. Someone please help me get through this
1105,"Everything in my life is down bad, &amp; I’m convinced I have no purpose.","Honestly I feel like I want to die, everything in my life is down bad, so I really have nothing left to lose. Can’t no one say that I gave up just like that, because I’ve fought through this for 9 months. But I don’t want to fight anymore, after a while fighting gets exhausting.. 

I’m tired of feeling the pressure of having to live or be happy because of someone else. I’m tired of worrying about insecurities, about what “friend” is going to leave me next, &amp; about a future that I probably won’t even live long enough to see. 

&amp; my mom keeps saying how I’m going to make myself go into a deep hole of depression, but I hit rock bottom the first time I lost motivation to get up for school. 

&amp; everyone around me is asking what reason I have to be sad, instead of asking what they can do to help. &amp; when someone is asking me what’s wrong, they just want to be in my business.. because at the end of the day, they could careless about me.

I just need it to go away, because I’m suffering. 
I’m starting to want to put myself first for once."
1106,Mental Wards,"For people who have stayed in them due to depression or suicidal ideation, what was it like? do you think it helped/ was worth it? I think about suicide everyday and I think trying a psych ward is my last attempt but wanna know if it helps. Thank you."
1107,Is Something Wrong With Me?,"I'll admit I watch gore. Most boys my age have porn on their phones but I have a wide collection of gore. I reguarly frequent gore sites and watch people suffering for amusement. I even have some videos that are my favorites. Sometimes I even find myself laughing with the murderers. One of my favorite videos is one from Mexico where a cartel boss's face is burned off while he's still alive. I can't stop watching it and I enjoy it. These videos dont bother me..On the contrary they amuse me.. Is something wrong with me? 

TLDR: I recreationally watch gore..is this normal?"
1108,I feel so. empty,"(trigger warning: self harm, suicide ideation)

so it’s been. a weird few days to say the least lmao.

i moved in to a college dorm room for the first time yesterday (yay freshmen year during a pandemic), and i already feel so alone. everyone else on my floor knows each other and we aren’t allowed to leave our rooms except to get food or go to the bathroom, so i don’t have a lot of opportunities to meet people yet. 

i also have been so depressed and anxious recently, and it’s to a level I’ve never really felt before, and i literally tried to kill myself in the past so let that sink in. but in general the anxiety is really fucking me over, ive developed anxiety tics and have begun to have extreme paranoia over. literally everything. it got so bad that tonight i relapsed for the first time in a year, and before last year i hadn’t done it for four years. i don’t even know why i did it, i just did and now i regret it so so bad. i was doing so well, and i still feel like shit. in general i don’t think i want to die but i do want something to stop, i feel worthless and ugly and so paranoid and lonely. i think i’m finally going to look into getting therapy through my school tho.

wish me luck."
1109,Am I becoming a bad person?,"Lately I haven't been feeling empathy or guilt as much,I have felt that way a week a go very strongly but that's about it,when people tell me there problems I'm just annoyed,I'm still positive towards them but I'm just annoyed,like I understand that they are going through some bad emotions but I'm just annoyed,I sometimes fear that ik becoming a sociopath"
1110,I hate my anxiety,"I recently started a stream on twitch. It's something I've been wanting to do and my husband convinced me I'd be great at it. To a certain extent it's great but, at the same time my anxiety and stage fright is so bad that I have a stomach ache as soon as I think about the stream and I get diarrhea an hour or so before I start my stream.. 

Don't get me wrong I want to keep streaming and I have a feeling that the more I do, the easier it will become but for now... I hate my anxiety. I hate that I was conditioned to not take up space, to make myself small. I hate that I can't just talk to strangers without sweating bullets. 

It's something I will be bringing up in my next therapy session."
1111,my boyfriend broke up with me and i dont even have the motivation to get up,last night my boyfriend left me and ive lost any ounce of motivation i had ive done nothing but sleep and cry all day i haven't done any of my school work i constantly feel like im going to throw up i just feel terrible...
1112,How to cope with the fact that i will probably be a failure?,"Right so, im in 3rd grade of high school, and needless to say, nothing interests me. And i know what you're going to say: ""I was the same when i was your age, you will figure it out"". To be honest, i probably wont. I have no desires, no goals. I dont really care about anything. I say to myself that i do, but honestly id probably get over them if i lost them. The only person about whom i actually care about is my dad. Now, even though i have a platform for success (People keep telling me i have potential, that im good looking, smart, etc) i only see myself as an absolute failure. Ill probably end up working some dead end job for a couple of years before killing myself around my 25th birthday. So uh, is there any hope?"
1113,I have the break downs sometimes where I just end up repeating shut up shut up shut up to sorta stay sane. Does anyone know what’s going on.,"This didn’t bother me too much but it’s becoming more and more frequent. I used to just say “shut up” when my brain would try to tell me I’m worthless and stuff like that, but this is different. 

I just get this overwhelming yet vague sense that everything is just too much. I get all this pent up energy out of no where I don’t know how to handle it. My brain tends to go wild with insults and self destructive thoughts and spirals. And the only thing I can do to stop it is curl up and just repeating “shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up” often out loud. It sort of drowns out everything to an extent. But I look and sound like a crazy person when I’m curled up in a ball in my room mumbling shut up to myself. And it’s only a matter of time before someone catches me saying shut up and thinks it’s about them.

I don’t know what’s going on or what to do. It usually happens when I’m stressed but I hate it. I feel like my ability to handle stress has been deteriorating, at first I would just dissociate but now this happens too. Idk I’m just a bit worried. What is happening here? Is this normal? Am I just overreacting?"
1114,I just want to cry.,"I’m so stressed, my mom is crying because of things affecting her, my dad doesn’t know how to console her. My sister is no help and is always doing things that stress my parents out. I have so much pressure on me to be the good kid and to be there for everyone. My mom is always venting to me and I understand but i can only listen to so much. My parents think that because I see a therapist that I’m suddenly cured and cannot have anxiety. I can’t take this anymore she’s just crying and my dad sounds angry and I have so much homework to do and I’m so anxious that I’m nauseous and feel lightheaded. I’m trying to look strong for my parents but I literally cannot. If I fail my test and if I fail my paper I’m going to be so disappointed in myself and my parents will be so disappointed. I’m so so tired. I love my family but I have issues of my own that I need to deal with. I’m so afraid to go to college and leave my family alone because my mom won’t have anyone to talk to anymore and my sister doesn’t help around the house. Anyways I just needed to vent. So sorry about the long post."
1115,Hey guys! Hello i have a cuestion,"I'm new here. I have 15 and that's my cuestion is: Why i sometimes hates my father and then i really adore him? It's something that really confuse me ( sorry if i wrote somthing wrong, i'm not a native inglish speaker)"
1116,I’ve hit a brick wall,What do you do when you hit a brick wall in life and feel like I’m just better off giving up?
1117,"Im always ""okay"" but it feels wrong","I've struggled with my mental health for a while, probably at least the last 11 years. But lately, even through the whole of 2020, I'm okay. I'm what I'd call ""too well"" and I'm beginning to feel like all the years struggling where nothing, either not real or fake or ""just hormones."" 

I don't believe it i mean technically speaking my hormones haven't died down since I'm not even 20 yet. I'm even on hormonal contraception so theoretically I'd have more hormones.

Google would tell me that taking up smoking over the last 1.5 years can increase mood. Tempting me to never quit. But I just feel too well. I can't tell if something bad is coming or not."
1118,I am sorry for blaming my parents for my illness.,"Its the psychiatrist fault trying to blame everything on parents.


Why don't they ask about highschool, the heartbreak, the cliques. I think that messed me up more than my genes my genes or parents flaws."
1119,I’m going to attempt suicide today.,"I can’t tolerate my own fucking mind anymore. The world will never understand how much I go through on the inside, no one empathises with me. I’m tired of being the only one. I’m tired of fighting my battles alone, tired of trying to cope with my adhd and failing, tired of trying to get my horrible mind in control and failing at that too. I will always resent my mother for denying me psychiatric help. My asshole father backed off from providing me support as a child and my mother had to work hard to support me but it all fucking failed because that lady completely ignored my mental health. I inherited this fucking disorder from that asshole, my mother just nurtured a defected fucking offspring in her womb, she should have aborted me. I hate her for bringing me here. I hate her for not opening up her mind and seeing life from my point of view. I cannot fucking focus. I can’t fucking  FUNCTION normally!!!!  For the past few months I have been so incredibly mentally troubled, I cannot stop imagining myself torturing the fuck out of that asshole father of mine and satisfying myself from that, there’s so much conflict I just can’t deal with anything anymore. The world doesn’t need stupid and inefficient people like me anyway. I am suffering so much and yet I have to pretend like I’m happy and everything is okay, for people to want to spend time with me. So, goodbye. I’m done."
1120,DAE think from the perspective of TV/book characters?,"Just a little interesting post for subreddit to take your minds off the pain. Anyone else think from the perspective of Fictional Characters? For example after watching/ whilst watching a show, I'l think of a made up scenario that could occur but instead of thinking ""damn that'd be cool to watch"" I'l think as if I am the character in that scenario. Sometimes I get pretty into it and have to remind myself I'm not that Character."
1121,Everything's just gone,
1122,Comorbidity &amp; Identity,"I was diagnosed as depressed in 2004-2005 by a college campus LSW. I was put on Zoloft which made me a zombie then Lexapro which made me enraged. I felt they assumed I was depressed because my mother was dying (dead dec 2005; abusive and alcoholic). Also they implied some weird father issues. I stopped going to therapy and spiraled. Drunk most days, drugs, and very unsafe sex and volatile relationships from 2006-2011. I also cut myself routinely. 

I was diagnosed as PTSD by a random LSW in 2010. No meds there. She wanted me to have “conversations” with my dead mother. I stopped going because that’s weird. At the time, I understood the PTSD angle. I got a DUI in early 2011. She made a few house calls but found the approach was just too weird. Almost died in my sleep after I’d lost my license by drunk-vomiting while asleep, but I was saved by the fact that I had been laying on my side that night. I only realized it the next day when my hair smelled like vomit and I examined my bed and pillow. I didn’t stop drinking. 

I was diagnosed as GAD by an internist in 2011 after I went to them sobbing, because getting up in the morning made me freak out - I didn’t understand how people could function and talk about things like the weather. Started Cymbalta. Went on and off Cymbalta due to losing jobs and insurance three times during 2011-2012. The period from 2012-2013 was consistent self destruction like drinking, lying, outbursts of rage and crying.  2013 ended with my father-figure grandfather dying that October and threats to kill myself when my significant other left me via text in December of 2013 because they were afraid of me. Later told me “there is nothing to miss” when I asked if they’d miss me. Went off the rails with drinking and “dating.” 

Started to even out around 2014. At that point I’d been on Cymbalta consistently for about a year. Met my still current significant other in August 2014. I told them a couple of lies but was mostly very clear that I had mental issues and being with me came with those. 

I was diagnosed as borderline personality disorder (BPD) with schizotypal features in August of 2019 after a battery of tests at a neuro cognitive institute. I went because I thought I was autistic or mentally impaired. No meds because I didn’t follow up. My father died right before I’d taken the clinics psych tests, but before the cognitive function testing. We were estranged and I found out abruptly. Also abusive and alcoholic. He actually drank himself to death. Events surrounding his death were further trauma. I spiraled into heavy drinking again. 

I was diagnosed as BPD, PTSD by a psychologist in March of 2020. I’d tried to reign in my drinking by then, realizing something was seriously wrong and I needed help. I was given Risperdal and Seroquel, both ended badly. Later started and stayed on Trileptal and Trazodone. Still taking Cymbalta. My drinking continued to get better. I still had episodes but nothing like before. 

I was recently assessed as BPD not current, MDD moderate recurrent, C-PTSD during my latest treatment plan screening. I don’t drink much these days, but I do drink too much when I have any. 

My current therapist tells me I am no longer active BPD and that most of my recovery I did on my own. She tells me I have good insight, which does save me often, and that my negative self talk can hold me back. That I need to understand my thinking is a choice, and I can choose to change it. That idea still makes me angry, that it’s yet more fallout from my really sh— childhood and young adulthood. I’m tired of trying. I just want it to _work_ already. 

I don’t know what the future holds. I honestly never thought I’d be as old as this (mid 30s). I don’t know how to be hopeful. Hope is a bad word. The worst word. Things were supposed to get better and now I’m an orphan instead of with parents who made it through the bad patch. 

Part of me, though... that small cell in the bottom of my heart is glad I made it through the dark times. Glad I didn’t die with vomit in my hair, glad I was somehow insightful enough to fight the BPD... and maybe even thinking _(hopeful..?)_ that I can get through enough DBT to actually change how I see myself. Maybe... become happy? Normalized?

It’s all very confusing."
1123,Realized I have BDD,"I’m a 21 year old man, about to graduate college. I realized recently that I have BDD. I’ve never been the most confident person, or thought that I was the most attractive person. But now I think that is running my life. Mostly it is in my face. I change my hair all the time and freak myself out when I can’t style it in a way I think looks good. I have a sagging eyelid that i hate more than anything else, they make my eyes look like they’re on 2 separate planes, and when I smile the one is barely open. I have permenant dark circles under my eyes because I have insomnia, and I don’t think I’ve ever slept a full 8 hours in my life. I have a big wide nose, and I have a flat smile. I feel like nothing in my face correlates well with each other. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on different products, hoping that would make a difference but it hasn’t. I’m scared to post on apps like Instagram and Tik Tok because it’s all driven by how you look, especially tik tok. And it’s only all backed up by real life experiences. I go on dating apps and never get matches. I’ve had people add me on Snapchat, and then unadd me when they see what I look like. And it’s not like they’re bad pictures, they are completely normal. I’ve even let it run my life and career. I am in media, and as much as I want to be on TV, I hide behind doing radio because I’m scared of my face being on TV. I don’t want it to come to this but sometimes I wish I didn’t have to go through my life anymore with this running it."
1124,Unnecessary and unjustified restraint by police and sigma racism (UK based),"Myself and so many other people with mental health problems have experienced completely unjustified restraint. I have watched yet another documentary today about how people were killed by unessacery force and restraint these men were both black and were both treated in a horrific manner by the police witch ultimately resulted in their untimely death. One of them presented low manageable risk and the other presented absolutly no risk whatsoever and was obviously just terrified and in need of reassurance, but due to blatant racism and stigma they both were treated inhumainly, were unfairly portrayed and had important details of their cases coved up. This made me reflect on things i have seen and witnessed both when I have been ill and when working clinically in a mental health setting.

One situation i remembered almost instantly was when i was 15 scared and unwell i left home because in my head if i stayed my family would get hurt. I ran away and ended up at a large train  station for around 8 hours until i was found buy the police who treated me horribly spoken to in a degrading manner. I was handcuffed unessaceraly and I was put in the cage of a police van to prove something to me so i learned my lesson I was not resistant or violent whatsoever and this was unessaceraly exsesive and i was terrified.  While i was in the back of the van they often breaked abruptly and sharply and my face slammed against the cage and then stopped to get takeaway and i was left alone. Although this and other scenarios i have witnessed and experienced were humiliating and terrifying i also realized  i was still lucky beacuse if i wasn't 15 white and female  i might not be here at all.

Sorry about the ramble in the simplest way substantially more non white people are subject are subject to violent and unjustified and potentially fatal restraint and this is something that needs to be stopped and i was wondering if anyone had any ideas about ways to spread awareness and support victims and families affected buy this discrimination as this urgently needs to change."
1125,another one of my friends committed suicide today.,"i hadn’t talked to him in a while, but i still cared a lot about him. 

it has also been a year and two days since 3 of my friends were murdered in a homicide, and i still miss their friendships more than anything. 

i don’t really have friends anymore, my main group of people all kinda spit me out after one of them led me on, and i haven’t been able to find new friends since. 

i feel like i have no purpose in life anymore. the ACT test is coming very soon and i still haven’t studied a lit of work. 

someone please help me, i don’t know what to do."
1126,Is it normal to transform your emotions into a different one?,"This might be kinda confusing, but I’m unsure how to word it. When I was a kid, I learned to take anger/being upset with others and convince myself it was a different emotion like sadness and put it more on myself. I think this made it easier to not be angry or lash out at other people. I’m just wondering if other people do this too and if it’s healthy?"
1127,Advice on mental health days?,"I know that your mental health is important. I know that here in recent years, I have struggled. But I think my biggest struggle lately has been allowing my work ethic to diminish to better serve my mental health, and it is extremely frustrating. 

I used to work nonstop. I'd pick up shifts left and right and spend all of my free time at work. I used to think work was the purpose of life. I never took sick days, I never called in. 

Since I was diagnosed with IIH, and the plethora of following medical conditions I've since been diagnosed with, plus loss, I have seen a downhill spiral in my work ethic. I have no desire to be. I have no desire to try. I used to think it was depression talking and the fact that I was going through so much, and still am, that I was succumbing to the loss of interest. 

But the more I try to justify it, the more I find myself telling me ""your mental health is more important than your job."" While in some ways, I will always believe that rings true, in others I find that I sacrifice cost of living and succeeding at the expense of my mental health. It doesn't matter what medications I take, what doctors I see, or how I cope with my challenges. I find myself using the excuse that my mental health is more important than my job 4/5 days a week. 

I am mentally happier than I've been in years. I have so much to look forward to, yet I struggle still with telling myself that my mental health is more important than my job. I find that going to work, being around people I don't want to be around, dealing with challenges in my job and overcoming them are a thing of the past. I don't see things as ""it'll get better when you've pushed through it"" anymore and rather I see it as ""none of this makes sense, I can't change the way things work, these people suck and I'm not going to waste my efforts."" I know much of this is my depression speaking. While things are going absolutely great, (minus my health), I still suffer depression at the core of who I am. I still have lost all interest in succeeding and I know that me telling myself my mental health is more important than my job is just how I am trying to deal with my depression. 

Yet still, I'll take a mental health day. I will do the things that make me feel better. I'll take my meds, I'll clean my house, I'll talk it out with someone I love and trust, I'll reach out to my therapist or doctor for resources and answers. I will feel better. Then I get to work. Then I go to school. Then things start to stack up again. Next day, I'm back to telling myself how much I hate trying, nothing I do will change what I dislike or am struggling with in these areas, and I will be back in the mindset of ""my mental health is more important than my job."" 

Is this a toxic trait that society has imposed on me? Is this something I see others doing and succeeding at that I feel if I do it, too, I'll be okay? Or am I making excuses to be lazy and allow my challenges to set me back? 

What do I do? How do I shake the mentality of my mental health being more important than my job? It's not, and working is exactly what will, eventually, give me success and make me feel better and more accomplished. Yet, I cannot muster the strength I need to overcome it. 

What say you? What are tips, suggestions, and input you guys have with overcoming this mentality? I'm to the point that I am physically exhausted and I don't really know how to find that spark of being a productive human being anymore."
1128,can depression cause memory loss?,"I was wondering if someone has severe depression along with sleep deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle etc, could that cause the individual to lose memory of years of their life?"
1129,I just need to rant,"So I’ve known I’m not ok for awhile. I know I have social anxiety and mild depression. Sometimes my own thoughts scare me. Whenever I tell myself this, I convince myself that I’m faking it for attention and that my friends have it worse. 3 of my friends are in therapy, 2 have called the suicide hotline before, and one has cut themselves. I feel I can’t talk to them because they have enough stress, depression, and anxiety in their life. I have opened up to them a little bit (they know that I have anxiety and depression, but don’t know the extent of it). I can’t go to my mom because she is VERY stressed out, my dad lives in a different state, and I feel like I can’t go to anyone. It doesn’t help that I am closeted gay and half to hide my true self from my family, school, and even kinda my friends (just because I’m not comfortable showing my true self). I’m not nearly ready enough to come out though. Even writing this, I feel like I’m faking it. I don’t know what to do and I just needed to tell all of this to somebody.

Sorry for the bad grammar and such, I’m tired and shaky rn."
1130,I’m sick and tired of being in this world,"18F here. No I’m not some wannabe edgy teen going through a ‘phase’. I’ve suffered with mental illness for a long time and hate being here. I have depression and anxiety which cause me to be very low functioning, to the point where I struggle to do my university work, my hygiene slips and my room becomes a horrific pig sty. Just mindlessly watching videos has been my main source of dopamine for many years, but most of the time I’m bombarded with intrusive thoughts about embarrassing things I’ve done that day, self deprecating and suicidal though. I’m very unattractive from head to toe, I’m skinny (bony) and my facial features are below average and the harmony of my face isn’t good. I’ve recently developed acne which I’ve never had, and my hair is matted and damaged due to my lack of self care. 

I have a visual disability that’s getting worse over time and has deepened my depression. Last semester at university I didn’t engage at all because mentally I could not and still can’t take it. My home life is terrible and is making it harder and whenever I’m trying to work my mind wanders and I get brain fog. I’m always exhausted and upset. I have only one friend who is also depressed and isn’t emotionally available, and I can’t talk to my family about it because they aren’t the best people to talk to. I have a guy that I’ve been seeing but I only managed to find him online, since guys never go for me un real life. We don’t talk about my constant suicidal thoughts  because it’s not fair to spring that on him and I don’t want to seem even more unattractive. I know he’s going to leave me inevitably.  I do have a therapist but I’m so attached to him that it’s inappropriate and the actual efficacy of therapy is low. 

University has been a nightmare because it’s all been online and I’ve made zero friends, and the ones I reached out to online seem to be very uninterested in me. I embarrass myself in classes because I can’t get any prep done for them and the teachers look unimpressed, the students with their cameras on look confused and the students with the ones off are probably laughing at me. 

I hate being the depressed visually impaired girl that is always struggling and people are condescending towards whether they mean it or not. I hate that I don’t feel human and that I’ll never be the successful woman I once wanted to be. I’m done being me, but I’m so scared to act on my constant dark thoughts."
1131,"Welp, Time to empty the botle","Okay, folks here I go. I  am currently having these thoughts that just won't go away or I have the have the bad habit that I tend to overthink the future and sometimes past. Always I am thinking "" what if "" in every scenario every giving time. Like what if I do not exercise myself? now will I get diabetes? or what if I do not grow up as an adult now and still living with my parents will I eventually become a neckbeard without any self awareness due that I am such a loser and depressed to even care? There is always this voice that whatever I want to propose is positive and can help me and other , my mind always find way to remember my flaws and weaknesses. It goes something "" What make you think you can  help other people when you cannot even help yourself and you are just a man-child that cannot even do the basic things without your brother, sister , mother and father helping you and if you were alone you would die alone as a waste pf a sperm that you are"". I should not complain because I have a good parents, a nice federal loan that enables not to work and studies mechanical engineering. My greatest fear is to become the worst version of me whether I become a rapist, killer, loser, obese , ugly , narcisistic , abuser , parasites' and depressed and not able to raise  against the rabbit hole because of my actions. There is a a lot issues in m mind that I wish to fix them and I feel that I have repressed my emotions for since I was in 11 years old and somehow finding a way to flourish within men. In the surface I look like a stoic serious big men who want to kill someone but inside me I am very emotional  young men who afraid of the future . Can somebody here can give me  some advice to stop overthinking and my mind leaves me alone at once?  *I having insomnia because of it.*"
1132,I’m losttt,"so i’m just not sure what to do anymore. am I the only one that constantly battles with myself about simple things like taking meds to feel “better”? idk i just feel panicky atm i’ve been off gaba for 4 weeks and i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety but tbh i wonder how can people simply think that’s what u have 😭 it’s like uGHHHH i’m overthinking everything but i’m tired of feeling medicated esp since typically bipolar people are recommended to remain medicated for their whole lives alongside the “what if”i’m not even bipolar.. (commonly misdiagnosed with other personality disorders anyway) stupidly, I actually really find enjoyment in drinking and my meds seem to fvck w that as well lol. i’m just starting to question if i’m a happier person off of them or on them?? like my anxiety sucks lately but perhaps ill find the will to overcome my fears off my meds? i haven’t been to depressed today was my first day back on vraylar and shit idk i just didn’t have the best day but from what i kno it will prob take around a week to feel anything so i don’t know if it’s the meds screwing w me or other things about the day😟"

1135,6 months into depression and I realized my family is my best fucking support system ever.,"I've been diagnosed with BPD and moderate depression, Self harmed myself many times and severely, tried to commit suicide. I've had depression before in my life but I tried to overcome it alone because I thought my family hated me and was disappointed at me. Little did I know they actually stepped up for me without me knowing in those bad situations against the people who made me feel horrible in school and destroyed my life and I never knew it for 6 years (I am 21 now). I never realized they actually supported the hell out of me and always thought good about me, finally talking about depression and therapy now with them and learning my life with them made me feel so good because I never thought they'd understand me so well. They got really hurt due to my self harm..etc but they never stopped supporting me and always kept their emotions aside because they considered me important at that moment because I couldn't function in life. I cannot be more happier knowing I have support during this horrible time because my friends don't care and most think I'm non existent."

1138,My Facade,"I can't tell if the confidence I show in front of my friends is real or not. I think I've been putting on a confident facade for so long it is hard for me to tell when I am truly feeling confident and when I am pretending. In front of my friends and family I always say things like ""I know I'm attractive"" ""I know my outfit looks good."" , but inside I really feel like I'm useless and that my life is going nowhere and that I don't deserve the praise I'm receiving. I often times think that they are only complimenting me out of politeness, or bc they feel obligated to."
1139,I’m gonna kill myself today,"I can’t tolerate my own fucking mind anymore. The world will never understand how much I go through on the inside, no one empathises with me. I’m tired of being the only weird one. I’m tired of fighting my battles alone, tired of trying to cope with my adhd and failing, tired of trying to get my horrible mind in control and failing at that too. I will always resent my mother for denying me psychiatric help. My asshole father backed off from providing me support as a child and my mother had to work hard to support me but it all fucking failed because that lady completely ignored my mental health. I will resent that piece of shit forever. I inherited this fucking disorder from that asshole, my mother just nurtured a defected fucking offspring in her womb, she should have aborted me. I hate her for bringing me here. SHE BLAMES ME FOR SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF MY MENTAL DISORDER!!!I hate her for not opening up her mind and seeing life from my point of view. I cannot fucking focus. I can’t fucking  FUNCTION normally!!!!  For the past few months I have been so incredibly mentally troubled, I cannot stop imagining myself torturing the fuck out of that asshole father of mine and satisfying myself from that, there’s so much conflict I just can’t deal with anything anymore. The world doesn’t need stupid and inefficient people like me anyway. I am suffering so much and yet I have to pretend like I’m happy and everything is okay, for people to want to spend time with me. So, goodbye. I’m done."
1140,Vent/Question - How can I just focus? I feel like I physically can't do work.,"Hey, I've been going through some depression lately, my mental health isn't in the greatest spot right now and I don't know when it'll ever end. I have online classes and a TON of work is due, with finals next week. I want to get some done before that happens to at least pass my class, as my parents, me and my therapist want me to focus on my health above all, which I'm especially glad my parents understand. All I want is to not fail, I don't care about the grade.

The problem is; I can't focus. At all. Not only just distractions. When I'm in the ""zone"" to get work done even, problems just occur, where I grt a massive headache, tons of thoughts which can't let me concentrate, I just can't do anything without struggling, and I really don't know how to deal with this. 

I get no motivation either. There's no point in these classes. I'm gonna forget this all in a year, and the things I learn don't have any application in the real world. Once I'm in the real world I'll be working my ass off to live, struggling through college, debt, just doesnt seem fun at all. Whats the point in me writing 3 essays over 2 weeks?

I moved 2 hours away to a new state in june. When quarantine started, my grades plummeted and I lost all my friends. Nobody talked to me at all. Moving away made it worse. My house got a big upgrade and I love it, but I really lost everyone now. Never gonna see em again, never got a chance to say bye, lost friends I've had since I was 3. I have nobody and havent gotten to see anybody. Only reason I would go to school is see friends. I want this to stop, but covid is ruining my life and I don't know how many more days I can take

Back on topic, just - How can I get focused and not go through a mental breakdown every fucking time I do online schoolwork? The more things missing the more crap I feel."
1141,Need Advice for my brother (13M),"So for a while, my brother has been having recurring negative thoughts surrounding death. He says that he has a crippling fear of dying or the loved one around him dying. From what I have noticed, these problems arise at night time.
Last night, he came up to me and broke down crying repeating that he doesn’t want to die and he feels that he’s going insane with his bad thoughts. I feel as though he is feeling a tinge suicidal since he said that he feels he just wants to die to escape this fear.
Especially with the pandemic, he’s been bound to the house spending most of his time with video games or classes. Our mom is undergoing treatment for her cancer which is said to be terminal (he doesn’t know the extent of her cancer). 

Does anybody have any advice for how to combat this or any idea of what he may be going through? 
As for location, we’re located in CA."
1142,Experienced growth after loss,"I'm wondering if anyone has experienced personal growth after losing a loved one due to the pandemic? The personal growth I'm talking about is called post-traumatic growth in which you feel like you have an improved outlook on life, better relationships, and greater motivation to help others, to name a few changes. Basically this growth changes you into a better version of yourself before you experienced a traumatic event like losing someone."
1143,I'm losing my mind,"I can't do it anymore, I have a disdain for most people I cannot stand them anymore...... people get on my nerves very bad and I'm losing patience with them, I do not have relationships with anybody because they always do me wrong.......gossip and talk shit about me, I am really done with participating in society I just wanna live in the woods alone with internet that's it, people are also becoming more and more insane as time goes on, you cannot tell me I'm wrong look at what the world is coming to..........people treat everybody like they are disposable, everyone is a narcissist nowadays men act like women and women act like men we are Soo far gone from what we really are as humans, it is over this world is on a highway to hell"
1144,I don’t know if I want to live anymore,"Tw: suicidal thoughts 
I’ve felt suicidal in my past but always denied it, this is the first time I’ve ever contemplated it. I’m 18 years old and I suffer from depression, anxiety, and adhd. Over quarantine I gained weight and became more aware of what I look like. I continue to try to eat better but I’ve grown up in a family of horrible eating habits and I keep binging. This past week went out of town for a baseball tournament and we ate out every single day for a week. All of my social media is full of a bunch of skinny girls who I know I’ll never look like yet constantly compare myself to. I’ve made comments to my mom about how I think I have an eating disorder but she never does anything. I started college this year and my first semester was horrible. I delt with some really horrible girls who backstabbed me and sent me spiraling into this hole of depression. I feel like no ones listening to me and that I’m not being taken seriously. I just saw a video posted online of a woman responding to the call she got when her nephew committed. I’m now in the hotel bathroom having a mental breakdown because it feels like no one care about me and seems to notice that I’m not myself anymore. I just want someone to care."
1145,Discord,A friend of mine is struggling a bit and I remember this subreddit having a discord.  Does it have a discord?  If so can someone give me the invite link.  Thanks!
1146,Idk what else to do.,"Found out I had bed bugs in Mid 2020. Had the apartment treated several times and threw almost every thing away. It wasn’t ever my fault bc the apartment knew they were there before I moved in.
Moved out about 3 months ago and can’t stop obsessively checking for bed bugs. Literally not sleeping. Endlessly searching for them. I think I found a casing after countless hours w a magnifying glass and flashlight but absolutely no other signs. Nobody knows what the fuck it is and different ppl have their own opinions if it’s a bed bug or not. 
Had an exterminator come out and he found no signs I begged him to heat treat my room so he did but I can’t get outta my head. What if they are still there?! Why doesn’t anyone believe me?! The constant search is making me feel crazy and hopeless an desperate. I literally cry myself to sleep every night and live in constant fear. Idk how to move forward. I don’t see an end in sight. I don’t see this getting better bc nobody will listen to me. I just cry myself to sleep every night."
1147,Is my dad emotionally manipulative?," With the current political climate, my father and I have been arguing off and on for about a month. Whenever we talk politics he becomes even more stubborn than usual and says that he ""Doesn't want to talk to a 'child' about this."", he then proceeds to ignore me for the next few hours and occasionally will guilt trip me.

 When we had our first big fight about a month or two ago, I spent about half an hour to 45 minutes in the bathroom crying. Even after I came out of the bathroom I couldn't face him, every time I thought about rejoining him I would break down and start crying again. Another 45 minutes passes and he walks into the dining room where I was sitting and says ""What, you don't want to sit with me?"". I wasn't really ready to rejoin him, but I couldn't say no. 

(My mother and father have been separated since I was about 3-4, my older brother and I live with my mother and see my father twice a week.)

 My father constantly says that my brother and I are the only people in his life (which is true, he has no close friends or relatives that live nearby) and even told me once that I was his best friend. And ever since my brother moved out he has been constantly upset over my brother's lack of contact and always complains to me about it, always asking if I've heard from him (my brother is certainly a man of few words, even I only text him a few times a year, but that doesn't hinder our relationship). 

Our most recent quarrel happened in the parking lot of a grocery store. We had been talking in the car about the Capitol Riots and things got confrontational. Tensions were still high when we parked and I was struggling to hold back my tears, which I am positive he noticed. Once again, I get the silent treatment. I try to make conversation to soothe the tension, but he continued to ignore me. We were walking and I had my phone out, texting my friends for support and he abruptly stops, so I ask him ""Why did you stop?"", he stands their with his arms crossed and said in a rather pointed tone: ""I'm waiting on you to finish."" (which is never a thing he has done). 

I am always worried about my father's mental health, since in recent years it seems to have decline slightly, so I often force myself to give into his guilt tripping in order to not upset him. It's really frustrating."
1148,tw - suicide/self harm,"Is it normal that I (m17) would like to have a gun for self defense when I’m older, but am scared that I would harm myself with it? Sometimes I get down low enough to the point that I feel like if the wrong things were to happen I would end it all."
1149,Mental breakdowns,"Ok so ever since I was young when I get mental breakdowns (which is not very often anymore) I get loud, I cry, and I scream. I used to break things and hurt people which have gotten me kicked out but I’ve learned not to. I still scream and cry and VERY lately I’ve been trying super hard to control those two things. I just moved and on my floor there’s plenty of older ppl who I assume go to bed quite early? 

When I have a mental breakdown they bang on my wall and I feel bad bc it’s not like I have an on/off switch :( I don’t want to be a bad neighbour. What should I do??"
1150,T.W Eating disorder,"I am over 300 pounds I am ashamed of it but at the same time it keeps me at a safe distance from a lot of people. When you're skinny people think better of you and want to be around you. And that very thought terrifies me to be treated kindly and people want to be around me. So I stay this way by over eating but then under eat the very second I feel pressured to and it's this cycle of hell that gets repeated over and over and over. And now I want to get help but I don't know where to begin and I feel scared not sure how to go about it. I know I need to do and get better but the comfort of my eating disorder feels bad but it's what I've been used to. I have a therapist currently but, she isn't E.D trained just trauma trained which she is helpful but not for the part my fixation with food and my body how it looks and how I choose to treat it"
1151,Can adhd give you laughing fits?,"I was never diagnosed with adhd, however I do suspect I have it. I want to talk to a physicist about it however in the moment, im just not able to. However, I suspect I have adhd for a while. I WILL REPEAT IM NOT DIAGNOSED. 

There were times where I just laughed a lot or it was kinda uncontrollable. I just want to know if anyone else particularly someone with adhd also has this."
1152,"Is there a diagnosis for this, or am I just antisocial?","Heya, question in title! &lt;3

Some generalized background: A few years back, my family was very sick/absent. This gave rise to my depression, a buildup of GAD (runs in the family), and extreme social anxiety. I ended up dissociating, and skipped school for most days (saw no point in doing anything). It wasn't until last year did I realize I was ill; I stupidly thought that I was just weak and lazy lol! Went into therapy, and I'm currently off meds thanks to quarantine (no socializing!! woohooo). I have been content with life for a full year now.

The thing is, I left depression as a completely changed person. I used to be loud and fun to be around. I'd go out with friends every week and get to know an acquaintance once in a while. Now, I just want to be alone. Small talk is bothersome, and I don't really desire friendships anymore. I have lost almost all of my friends, and I am 100% fine with that. I feel like no matter what, no one will truly understand me. After depression, I get really irritated when someone misunderstands even a small thing, so I feel that its better (not the best choice) to just live by myself without such frustrations.

I also came out of depression with an unhealthy obsession with art (specifically entertainment design for films/games) and stability. All I could really care about for this past year was how I NEEDED to improve in order to get a nice job at a big company when I'm old enough. It's safe to say that this obsession is my will to live. I throw out all my emotions there and I am always satisfied with living when I draw. In fact, I often feel happy! :D

Additional things about me, no idea if it adds to anything:

* I am extremely awkward in real life. I don't really know how to walk and do things normally in public. I also have trouble forming expressions when I talk to people. The only expression I can confidently show is my smile, so I smile and laugh too much. Also \*insert the usual sweaty social anxiety stuff\*
* I am *not* socially awkward around people I trust (close friends I used to have and family). 
* I had difficulty learning how to sight-read music when I was young. Instead, I memorized the songs and finger positions. I can sight-read now.
* I have trouble paying attention to uninteresting things in general. I always zone out.
* Until high school, I had trouble expressing myself using words.
* I am a poor listener/verbal communicator.
* I am a disagreeable person. If something is not the way I want it, I get uninspired/frustrated.
* My dream life is to live in an isolated foggy mountain with a lover who understands me completely. Maybe a few visitors every few months. Not happening lol.
* I'm aware that a job in the entertainment art industry requires communication and possibly connections. I'll try to get better at being more sociable!

1153,I’m a loser.,"I had all these friends in middle school and early high school... most of them betrayed me and went behind my back so I had to end the friendships. I still have a good number of friends and am continuing to make a few more as I’m beginning my college journey but senior year of highschool sucks. I don’t want to do softball for the high school because if you aren’t popular, you aren’t noticed for your achievements. I just hate this pandemic as well...I can’t see any of my friends.

1155,Mentally unstable but is still maintaining very well until now,"I am not okay at all. I am not ""there"". Yet, I can manage it so well. No one knows. They know I have adhd and depression but they dont understand the severity of how intensely I have them. I'm very charismatic, hardworking, generous but I AM NOT OKAY. Reality isnt real. I have a hard time differentiating my dreams from reality. Literally all that happened today to launch this feeling of mania (that I knew was coming, it was just when)was asking my gf for a hug and she said no I have to sweep (a thing I had done earlier but I guess not to her standard). It was building up and that was the teetering point. So small so fucking dumb. I dont have insurance so it's not like I can get therapy without paying an arm and a leg. I'm just not okay and I need help. Please."

I was in a long relationship (years) with someone who is a serial cheater &amp; liar. The entire relationship was constant feelings of suspicion and anxiety. 
It got to the point where I became so depressed and my self image was damaged, I would cover my body as much as possible. He would basically neglect me and only approach me when ever he needed something. 

A few weeks ago, I became so feed up with his bullshit, I just left. I moved in with a friend but now I’m regretting my decision. The friend I live with also lives with her cousin &amp; her sister’s husband. Today, her sister’s husband came home screaming because the floor was a little dirty and there was a few dishes in the sink.

I can’t stand being around people who yell. I’m already an anxious person and being in this environment is making me think that I shouldn’t have left.

My ex was neglectful but at least he didn’t yell because he was always busy cheating. If I brought up his suspicious activities, he would then yell or gaslight but he wouldn’t walk in the door yelling and angry like this dude does. 

I hate my life right now. It’s hard for me to stay employed due to anxiety issues so I don’t know what to do. You can feel the tension in the air when he comes home. It’s so uncomfortable. However, I’m broke &amp; basically homeless.

I thought about going back to the ex but knowing that he is and always will cheat was emotional torture.

Also, I’m embarrassing myself because I can’t stop crying. I feel hopeless and stupid. If I weren’t afraid to die, I would have checked out a long time ago."
1157,i am bad at relationships,"when it comes to polite society, i am insensitive and one of those people who doesn't get it.  i'm not talking about being an internet person nobody can stand irl, i'm talking specifically about the dynamics of a romantic relationship.  i am not good at starting them and i imagine i'd be equally awful at keeping one going.

i don't blame this on some inherent flaw of mine, i 100% don't blame the opposite gender, i blame it on years and years of isolation and having messed up ideas about relationships and what's expected of me and what's appropriate.  i experienced some grooming as a kid and it messed all of this stuff up.

i know if i tried and just kept trying to build my understanding of romantic relationships through trial and error like everyone else does, i'd eventually get the hang of it.  at this point i've gotten so used to being alone, i don't even want to try.  i think that's a bad thing but i've just gotten so comfortable.  the shitty part will be when i actually meet someone special.  i may even have a shot with them but then blow it because i'm so out of touch.  tbh, even then i might not care."
1158,Blinded by rage,"It is taking all of my willpower to center myself and write this.

First let me say that I'm not going to harm anyone or do anything illegal.

It started Sunday and it's been a slow burn. We've all been shocked by the events of Jan 6th, but for me it is now officially boiling over. The video from the New Yorker from the senate floor; I can't get it out of my head. It feels like my Mother was gang raped by these men and I just have to sit here and watch. The image of a shirtless savage strolling down the senate floor, carrying my country's fucking flag, calling his fellow rapists ""patriots."" and this fucking little weeny cop saying ""C'mon guys this is *like* the most sacred place.""

GAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  THIS IS WHERE I FUCKIUNG LOSE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

its not LIKE the most sacred place, it IS the most sacred place. UNHGHHHHH!!!!@!!!!! i want to reach through the computer screeen and slap this cop in the face and ask him ""WHY ARE YOU NOT BEATING THE EVER LOVING FUCK OUT OF THESE GUYS?!?!?!@?!""

I want to kill Jake Angeli. kill. must. kill. jake angeli.

Okay, I am calming myself down. But this is what I'm dealing with. If someone else was outside just now while I was walking my dog (who is nervous and confused now) they would think I was a crazy person having a mental health crisis. My mind, or at least my id, would play through the above sequence until my rage was audible or expressed in some other way. As I've been writing this I noticed that there's some blood on my knuckles because I punched a couple inanimate objects.

This year has been insane and I live alone (divorced) in a region of the country with no close friends or family. I just want a hug from someone so bad, just so much horrible shit to take in and it won't stop. 

The image of a feral shirtless raccoon man in the Vice President's chair just has this massive weight of symbolism behind it. It looks to me like the deterioration of reason, and law, and order, and democracy, and a turn back into darkness. Back to our most base animal nature.

I don't want to go too crazy on the pride, but that's a part of what's going on here. I'm from Maine. 100% of my ancestors came to this country in the 1600s, and they maybe weren't the best kind of people, but 200 years later their descendants left their homes in Maine to go fight the civil war while their soon-to-be-widows sheltered people on the underground railroad to Canada. In the name of decency, justice, and respect, they gave their lives so that this country would survive. My grandfather up and went off to Europe to fight the Nazis seemingly without even a second thought. He didn't have to think about it. There was a clear violation of civilization and he joined in with everyone else who was awake at the time to just SHUT IT DOWN. And shut it down they did. And what horrors they had to discover that man was capable of.

And now today, I, a middle aged man sit alone in a room watching a degenerate freak show smearing feces in the halls of congress, sitting shirtless on the floor of the senate, putting their feet up on the speaker's desk.

This outrage will not cease, and it comes at such a terrible time for me personally. I'm in school trying to better myself during this shitstorm but now I can't read a single paragraph the whole way through without an image of the QAnon Shaman raping democracy popping up in my head.

I'm nervous to go to the gym because of covid, and that is historically how I let my anger out. I don't know wtf else I'm going to do tho, I think I need to just take the risk and get in there. Anytime I need to push through some extra reps, I'm going to be thinking about strangling Jake Angeli with my bare hands while I watch the life fade from his eyes. I have never in my life fantasized about killing a person like I am right now.

And with that, I'll once again state that I am just venting and I am not going to harm anyone, harm myself, or do anything illegal. I would be very grateful for any advice any of you might have."
1159,how do I tell my parents that I think somethings wrong with me (tw - self-harm/suicide),"I've experienced ""depression"" for about 7 years now. I can't really call it depression because I've never been diagnosed and it sounds stupid saying sadness, so the best way to describe it is feeling depressed. my parents knew when I was younger, they knew I self-harmed even but they never took me to a doctor or anything they just kind of moved on. it's gotten worse and on the 28th of December last year, I had the worst suicidal scare of my life. I got through it but ever since I've felt horrible. my best friend just visited me so that made me feel better but now she's gone and I feel exactly how I did before. that night on the 28th I felt detached like I do sometimes but this time I stood still with no emotion and no thought for about 10 minutes. I stared at myself in the mirror for a couple of minutes and did not recognize myself at all and it was scary. I even relapsed which I'm ashamed of but I haven't since! so that's cool... I've had stuff like this happen before but only really recently and never that intense. other stuff that's happened to me recently has scared me but that night was just different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my question is, how in the world, do I tell my Christian mom and dad that I think I have mental health issues without them telling me I just need to eat healthier and workout. maybe it's true but idk I feel like it's more than that and I believe them, my dad always says I listen to everyone else but him, but just this specifically I wanna make sure nothings wrong with my brain before I execute some hardcore keto energy boosting plan that backfires. I used to be athletic and stuff but I've gained so much weight and have lost so many friends and interests I feel it's more than just my daily habits. something about these last few weeks are different. even if they do just dismiss it again, how would I muster up the courage to tell them what's going on with me. I've only ever been confronted by my parents because my school counselor told them. actually, I've been to a therapist for one session and my mom didn't like how they ran things and never took me back. also, you know what I might go to the doctor for my tailbone pain I've been having recently so maybe I can ask to get some sort of mental health eval or something idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just scared, I'm almost done with my first semester of junior year and I don't think ill make it. I don't have the motivation to catch up on my work and I wanna tell my parents but I don't want them to think I'm saying it to get out of work and I don't think ill make it to the end of the semester. anything will help. special wordage, if I should tell my mom first and then tell my dad together, or wait it out for 2 years and go to a doctor when I'm 18 if I make it that far. what was your experience telling a guardian or someone about your health, how'd you do it, did you wish you would've done it some other way"
1160,It does get better,"TW: sui*cide, d*epression and possible o*verd*ose TW


When I was 14, I remembered this one time I was crying so hard and had basically a bottle of pills nearby. I was sitting there crying and trying to convince myself to end it all. Part of me really wanted to do it and the other part of me is mad that I couldn’t convince myself.

That was around June 2019. Which is about a year and a half ago. Im now 15 and turning 16 in 5 months.

I just want to say it really does get better. Im now getting help. Although I still get bad days and days where I do have tendencies, I overall learned that it is better to live life than not doing so. 

I promise to anyone who is reading this, you are loved, you matter and don’t give up hope."
1161,I’m attracted to my doctor,"Help.. I’ve been going to this doctor for my anxiety for about a year now. He has put up with a lot with me. From panic attacks , to word vomit, to actual vomit. Everytime I have to go in, my anxiety takes over. 
But I somehow I’ve gotten attached to him. He’s attractive, and around my age. But he also listens to me, and cares. 
Well today I went in.. and admitted to being raped. Which I’ve never told anyone about. I trust him more than anyone else right now. He gave me some very comforting words, and it just felt nice.. he told me that he would call me when he was done with his patients at the end of the day, to clarify if he had to report it. ( thankfully he doesn’t). But the conversation was just so warm, but definitely awkward. He followed his comfort with telling me to call him at his work anytime. That he will call me back at the end of the day. If I needed him. 
I’m afraid I’m actually attracted to him, but thinking I only am because he was given me the time of day. 
I have never been the social type, more like avoid all feelings and contact. All relationships of mine have been abusive, starting with my mother’s. My mother started the trend and I think I’m just now curious what it’s like to have someone actually notice that you have feelings."
1162,"""Approval addiction"" and anxiety","I feel that I don't have a personality.  I have spent so much of my life trying desperately to be what I think others want me to be, and actively trying to attract the sorts of people I think I might want to like me (in platonic ways as well, I don't just mean romance) that I seriously struggle to figure out what aspects of myself are ""me"" and what aspects are chosen, fabricated, manipulated.  I hate it.  It makes me feel empty and I'm constantly terrified that someone will find out that there's nothing behind the carefully-curated mask.  When I meet someone new I feel like I'm following a script, and if they say something I don't expect or I haven't accounted for and I can't react quickly enough, or if I begin to think that I'm not bringing across the image I am bringing across, I panic, and proceed to use the next opportunity to bail.  

I read the words ""approval addiction"" for the first time recently, and in some ways they resonated with me, but I don't know if it's a real thing, and I'm not even sure it's a good description of what I'm experiencing.  I have a careful curated image.  There is nothing wrong with this inherently.  But I do not feel that behind it, there is a person.  The image I'm trying so hard to show is not, in fact, me.  I'm just along for the ride.  Like a video game character piloting a hyperrealistic android, except video games typically have goals at the end.  I don't know what the purpose of lying to the whole world is.

Sometimes I have desires that feel like my own, but even then I can't always tell if they're real or just something I made myself want in order to be a certain way I think I have to be.  I feel so much external pressure when in fact there is none.  It doesn't matter what I do.  No one will care.  I hardly know anyone and those I do know are good people.  I don't understand and I don't know how to break the cycle.

I realized the extent to which my ""drives"" and ""wants"" were fabricated at the beginning of the pandemic, and I fell into a severe mental pit, complete with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.  I've since done my damndest to pull myself out of that pit, but since then I keep yo-yoing.  Sometimes I feel liberated, finally able to be myself, and then sometimes I realize, horrifically (it actually feels like a horror scene - That moment you realize you've played RIGHT into the hands of the killer or something) that I'm doing it again - not being me.  Doing something because I think ""someone like who I might want to be"" would do it rather than because it's something I want to do.

I also am constantly thinking of ""reasons"".  Reasons to do a hobby.  Reasons to learn something.  Reasons to wear a certain kind of clothing.  Justifications for everything. I have to fulfill a certain role, be a certain type of person, so I can point to that role and say ""that's why you should care about me"" or be my friend or whatever.  But I would never feel this way about someone else.  Others just exist.  They are themselves.  I like some of them and don't like others but they're all humans and almost all of them are more or less worthwhile.  So why am I constantly rationalizing and tailoring my existence?  Nipping and tucking so I'm in nice consumable pieces.

What is this? How do I stop? I've spent a year trying, and I can't even tell how much progress I've made."
1163,How do I approach my friend about this.,"I dont know where else to go for help on this topic. Im worried my best friend has or is developing an eating disorder, I've noticed she rarely eats and sleeps all day, I obviously know I'm not a therapist so I don't want to act like one, i just need help knowing what to say and what not to say. As much as I want her to be better, I don't want to confront her, so just a little help knowing words and phrases to avoid that act as triggers, things I could say to maybe find a way to make her feel better about herself without making it known I have suspicions. Any advice would be amazing."
1164,Can anxiety and depression cause headaches/migraines?,"I’ve been going through a lot lately. Anxiety has been through the roof and experiencing depression. I’ve been diagnosed before and got off medication, but life events have made it come back. I’ve noticed head gets heavy and feel like a headache or migraine is coming on. Could it be related to anxiety/depression? Thank you."
1165,Financial Stability or Physical and Mental Health," 

Short  background: I am 35 years old and have a wife and a 3 year old kid.  I've been with my organization for the past 14 years as the IT guy of  our office. I have chronic migraine and vertigo since I was in high  school and lately my attacks have been getting more frequent - from once  every two months to almost once a week since the pandemic started  causing me to lose weight of almost 7 kilograms now  as I would just  throw up anything I take in during my migraine and vertigo attacks.  While I also do suffer from depression and anxiety from time to time as  well, since last July when my grandfather died I've been having more  frequent concerns and anxieties about our situation and my spiraling  health, that it is affecting my performance at work which is already a  relatively stressful environment due to strict policies, deadlines and  management. I've been having a lot of screw-ups lately and is having  difficult task of focusing na rin, which is causing anxiety attacks, to  the point I sometime pray that I would not wake up the next morning.  last weekend until yesterday I completely broke down and cried, locked  myself in a room thinking how stuck I am and when I finally got a hold  of myself talked to my wife about all the things that have been causing  my anxieties and my depression. I told her the solution I see is for me  to resign from work to take a break and focus on my physical and mental  health as well as finally chase the career path  I truly want (I am a  mass communication graduate, long story) but at the same time I have  apprehensions with regards to our financial stability. She does earn  more than me but I still have concerns of burdening her although we  already talked it out and she was willing to support whatever decision I  choose.

So if you were me, would  you stay or resign? I have already prepared my resignation letter this  morning. Thanks in advance for your suggestions."
1166,i feel like i can’t do anything without taking a shower first,"I don’t know what has happened to me and i’ve tried researching this but i have no idea what’s wrong with me. I physically cannot leave my house unless i shower, i cannot go to sleep unless i shower first. It’s become a somewhat serious problem as i dread showering at night and go to sleep very late as it is 2am right now and i need to wake up at 7:00. if anyone ever invites me to hang out i will always shower first and if i can’t or don’t have the motivation to shower then i simply won’t hang out. I just want to know if this is something i should get serious about looking into."
1167,What wrong with me?,"So much has happened in my life and nothing feels the same anymore. i am so overwhelmed by so many different emotions, i feel crazy. i feel like I don’t even know what’s real or fake anymore. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know what to do."
1168,Please help I don’t know what to do,"I just need someone to listen and please give me some mental support. 

I can’t get out of my bed for the same reason as everyone else. I hate life. 
I don’t know what to do I’m screwed. 
I’m currently half sitting in my bed shaking and my eyes hurt from crying as I just sat down to type this. 
I’m the only one of everyone I know who’s not going to school cause my mother won’t let me cause of covid. I’ve never had too horrible of mental problems, no more then everyone else
My mental health has gone so downhill since I haven’t seen any of my friends or anyone and I’m failing school (I’ve never had problems with my grades before online school) 
I can’t see my anyone from class. I see my best friends once in awhile and that’s the only thing keeping me going. 
My room and the house is a disaster cause I won’t get up and clean. I try but it’s never good enough. I just cry until I can’t anymore because me and my mom just fight all day. We never laugh or talk, it’s always fighting, crying and screaming.
I can’t tell her I’m struggling so badly mentally but she’s getting emails on how I’m not doing school work or how I’m now failing my quizzes (even though I seriously am trying my best in them) 
I’m trying to get up and do it but I feel like there’s literally no point cause I won’t get to go back to school. 
I’m a straight female, the guy I’m with is trans.(FTM) My mother is a homophobic transphobic person and every time I try and stick up for them she argues and makes it about her. I usually leave it alone and tell her she’s right when we fight about things but I can’t take it anymore. 
I’ve always been a respectful happy person. She’s always been horrible to me mentally making me feel like shit and abusive physically in ways I’m not comfortable with talking about
And I’ve always stayed quiet. So fucking quiet. 
Today I broke down during one of our little “fights” that may I add I never try and start cause I can’t handle it but everything thing I do somehow leads to one Anyways. 
I broke down and yelled how I just wanted to “fucking kill myself and be done with everything and everyone. I can’t see anyone I know. I’m failing at school and life, I don’t see my father and my mother hates me to fucking death.” My mom has always made me feel unloved, lonely and hated. She went quiet after I yelled that, turned off her tv and went to sleep. I went into the bootroom and broke down on the floor for an hour cause I was too scared to get up.
it’s just me and her in the house. I don’t know what to fucking do anymore I want out of here so badly but I just can’t. For so many reasons. I’m still shaking writing this please I have no one to talk to right now. I don’t often have my phone cause she always takes it and goes through it, so I’m writing this on a old iPad I have in my room at 12am. I have no one to turn or talk to, I don’t want to bother my best friends about this bull shit and I already vent about some of this stuff to my boyfriend enough I don’t want to bother him anymore about it. 

my mother doesn’t know anything about what’s going on with me cause I don’t talk to her about anything cause we just fight and I know it sounds so “pathetic” but if I did, she’d just make fun of me and somehow make herself the victim again. 
but man I just want out of this horrendous loop of pain I can’t fucking take it. I’m still so young and I already just want out. Life is a fucking joke. I never asked for this. I’ve been a Christian my entire life. Obviously I was just fucking dumb. God doesn’t exist."
1169,Accepting Myself and Actually Liking Myself,"Hey, I’ve [F24] never posted here before and I’m working on mobile so please excuse if the formatting is weird 
Recently I asked a guy I liked out and he ghosted me, then in our group zoom calls he starts flirting with my good friend. This sent me in a weird self destructive rage and I feel like I lost to her. I have been cheated on before by my ex who upgraded to a small cute light skin girl and that just sort of keeps replaying in my head, how this is the same set up. 
I stopped talking to everyone, I don’t want to be friends with her anymore. I feel bad even being around her that he chose her when she wasn’t even trying. I feel physically pained by this rejection. 
Everyone is saying I have to work on myself and I need to stop comparing myself, so that’s what I’m here to ask. 

What are the first steps to just liking myself? How do I keep it up?"

1171,Important step forward,
1172,"3 years after a PTSD-inducing teaching gig that led to me (31F) moving back home, my parents are implying they want me out of the house — but do I take a job that would make me miserable just for the sake of independence?","Long story short, my first teaching experience was horrid and traumatic (unhelpful colleagues, mean students, not really knowing what I was doing, throwing up daily, lost 20 lbs in three weeks, etc.)

After a panic attack, I resigned, and wound up at my parents' house. It's been a long, slow recovery process, full of varying antidepressant types and dosages, therapy, crying just reading job applications, and the like. At long last, I started subbing, which took a few tries because the idea of returning to the classroom was really hard. I started a degree online in a new field, and found myself more or less enjoying it. I continued subbing for over a year, and along the way my mom finally agreed to let me pay them a modified rent (probably about half of what they could be making off of my granny flat).

Then COVID happened, and I lost my subbing jobs. I've been on unemployment, applying for 3+ jobs a week in my new field, and continuing my degree. I'm 2 classes away from finishing.

Today my parents suggested I take an administrative assistant job at a nearby college. It's really not the type of job I'd like — since my short-lived teaching career, I have a hard time working with people, being responsible for others, etc. (and I've always hated answering phones, to boot. Stresses me out even in the best of times.) My new field would let me do just what I want to be doing, alone, and I would only be responsible for myself. Minimal teamwork, correspondence only about the work I'm doing, could work anywhere with internet, little to no supervision. Just me and my work.

But I know what my parents are really saying. I've overstayed my welcome. I already felt like the biggest failure a parent could ask for — you don't know how hard it was for me to write ""31"" in the title of this post — and this just tipped me over the edge. I've been crying about it for the past two hours.

My therapist can tell you I've been longing for a place of my own, a good job, to finally be independent. At the start of quarantine my perspective changed a little: I was glad I wasn't (and that my parents weren't) living alone. But things have shifted now. I know healing takes time, but I just feel like I've been spinning my wheels and wasting my life these last three years.

Do I settle? Do I apply for the admin job (or some other similar job that I don't want to be doing)? It might make me miserable, but if that's the price of my independence, of not feeling like a burden, then maybe it would be worth it. Or maybe it'd be less miserable/a different type of miserable than I am now."

1178,I don't know what's wrong with me and my psychiatrist says she doesn't find labels helpful,"I've got long standing addiction and mental health problems.  

I've just quit drugs and alcohol and tbh i feel worse than ever although I hope that is a temporary state. 

My problem being that I've been suffering mental health issues for 25 years. 

Sometimes I get so depressed I'm passively suicidal.  I can't get out of bed,  don't eat,  don't sleep and after that goes on for a while there is a very good chance I will resort to drugs or alcohol for respite.

Other times I get so anxious that I cannot leave the house. 

The NHS have not helped me.  Well I saw one psychiatrist who put me on mood stabilisers and said she didn't think labels are helpful when I said I think it's more than depression.

I've had a serious accident where I almost died when I was 18. Developed an opiate addiction because of the painkillers I went on and then went on to become a drug and alcohol addict. 

I've had overdoses which have traumatised me further. 

My relationships are bad.  Like I've had two serious relationships which both failed due to my mental health and drug problems. 

I'm quitting drugs and alcohol for a better chance of success as NHS won't give me any mental health treatment with ongoing addiction issues.

I'm so depressed. Feel like my whole life is a mess.  I have this really deep rooted sense of loneliness at my core. And just this deep feeling that I'm a bad person which has been there since about age 12. 

My childhood was not good. My parents divorce and my mum left for another country and left me with my dad who became abusive and alcoholic. She took all my siblings too. During the time she left I was 15 and just pretty much left home and started doing drugs then too. Then I almost went to prison.  

I just don't know what to do apart from spend £1000 of my own money and go private for a diagnosis.

I honestly feel like I've just been dealt the worst hand in life possible.

But how can I get right treatment when I don't know what is wrong with me??"
1179,Going to post a message that goes out to everyone everyday fighting their own inner demons.,"I’m basically in the same boat as everyone here that posts about their struggles, their thoughts, imagining how it would be like to end it all. Giving you guys a message that some of us need sometimes when there isn’t anyone else giving it to us. You got this, I believe in you and thank you for being here with us for another day. You are important just as much as anyone else and don’t you ever forget that. You’re here to accomplish many things in life and to make others proud of how far you’ve come, I’m proud of you all for making it this far and to keep going towards working for a better tomorrow. I don’t want to die at all, I don’t want to let anything bother me that’ll make me kill myself, I wanna have a life with people in it, places to go and explore, have a wife and children and wake up everyday being happy I get to see another day cause it’s a scary thought of basically being dead and never knowing if you’ll have another life again like this one. Watching videos or hearing news about people killing themselves upsets me and makes me wish I could’ve done something for them but I can’t save everyone, all I can do is try my best for those around me and to communicate with the people that I met and that continue to stay in my life and ask them about their day and life and wish them the best of luck and offer anything that I can offer if I don’t even have it myself. Wishing everyone here the best and I hope we get the help we need and have those that’ll support us through our own hell. We got this. PMA."
1180,Why Mental Health Will Be a Key Player in the Future of Work?,"Hello everyone! I stumbled upon this interesting blog post that talks about Mental Health in remote working and how it can be critical for the future of work.

The article also explains how mental health can boost employee performance and signifies that the concept is crucial for leaders too, offering few tips for the leaders on how to instill mental health into the company culture.

I think this post will provide value for all members of this subreddit, as it\`s a short and on-point read.

1181,i’m so scared of being a narcissist. what if i am?? i’m freaking out.,what are some traits of narcissistic people. i’m so scared.
1182,Girlfriend negative body image,"I (25m) have been with my girlfriend (20f) for almost 2 years and she's starting to go what I'd call a little overboard about her weight and her figure. It started when she said she wanted to exercise more, about three months ago she was in college learning from home and i was just starting trade school learning from home so i figured why not. We'd dusted off the old treadmill and bowflex and went to town on them together. All was going really good until she felt she wasn't seeing any progress. It continually got worse and now its at the point that she's on the scale in the morning before she goes to work, at lunch when she comes home and before she goes to bed every night.

She also eats healthy and in very small portions for meals, like so small that I'd be starving if thats all I had to eat.

From what I can tell she spends a lot of time comparing herself to models and Instagram or tiktok influencers. 

She attributes it to the BMI scale thing or whatever its called saying she's overweight but I just don't understand because she's already skinny! It doesn't bother me that she wants to be in better shape at all it just bothers me that she's so hard on herself, makes me feel bad cause feeling bad about yourself must be hell.

I asked her if there's anyone making comments about her weight at work or anywhere else and she says no. She's well liked around all her social circles so I doubt it's coming from people picking on her. 

We had a chat about it the other night and she told me that unless she's skinny like the girls in the videos and stuff she doesn't think she can be happy with herself.

So far I've tried
explaining the magic they do with photoshop and other image editing software so they look perfect in every video/picture. 
Asking her if maybe she should see a doctor and get a second opinion on what her weight should be other than something from a vanity fair web article.
Reassuring her that she's beautiful. 
Reminding her to drink more water. 
We've both limited pop and other junk food. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything else I can do from someone in the know about this kinda stuff, I just don't wanna see her feel bad about it any more."
1183,Help?,"Hi everyone, my best friend recently got diagnosed with major depressive disorder after having it for years and well, I just need advice on how do I navigate this? This is all so new to me and I just want her to feel loved and appreciated. So reddit, a helping hand (in this case advice) is really appreciated."
1184,Anxiety and twitching?,"I have been dealing with anxiety for years now. I was on meds, but they made me sick and now I cannot take SSRI’s. Over the last 2 weeks I’ve been under quite a bit of stress with the start of the new semester, and have had “embarrassing” intrusive thoughts (i.e. I need to recheck my emails to make sure I didn’t say something wrong, did I misspell something in my homework, did I say the wrong thing, or did I act off on the phone). Anyway, I’ve started to physically jerk my head or leg, or move my shoulder involuntarily when I think about these things. I also sometimes say an expletive, but not because I actively want to. It just comes out. I do this when I’m remembering something embarrassing or feeling very stressed. However, this isn’t even the most stressed I’ve ever been, and only now is this happening. I’m 21, don’t drink or smoke. Does anyone else do this or know what this might be?"
1185,How long should I reasonably expect to receive a response from private psychiatrist in UK?,"So I’m in the UK and pay quite a lot of money for a private consultant psychiatrist. I had a consultation with him on Thursday and mentioned my sleep was bad, but being me I understated it and said it was probably just a bug and it would sort itself out. The next day I emailed him to correct myself and said it was actually quite severe and was beginning to affect my mood and to ask if I could increase some of my meds. I still didn’t get a response 3 working days later. I know he is probs busy but I kinda would expect a slightly quicker response. Maybe he is just thinking I have access to benzos so why don’t I just increase my dose temporarily and not bother him with it? Not sure. He could also be very busy of course. I have increased increased the benzos which have helped so maybe should have just kept it to myself :/"
1186,i feel like going nowhere,"today is my 25th birthday, even when i know i should be celebrating i just can feel happy, i'm 25 and still living on my parents house, cant find a job of what i studied, 6 months single, and can't stop feeling that is all my fault, even after months of therapy cant stop hating myself, feeling that don't deserve any kind of happiness, love, kindness or compassion, i feel like the lowest creature on the earth."

1188,Has anyones social anxiety increased by A LOT during covid?,"I've been working on not being anxious when i talk to people or when I'm going shopping or somewhere. Everything I've achieved is gone now. 
It has become so bad that i almost vomit every time I write something in the chat during a online meeting for school. Saying something is impossible. 
I'm frustrated because I have to start all over again basically. Has anyone else experienced this?"

1190,It’s late,It’s late and I feel as if my mind is defective again can’t seem to do anything right I try to work for perfection and can seem to scratch the surface I think I suffer from some kind of narcissism and it leads me to feel like garbage because I can not keep the standards up I also have a lack or no emotion in some situations I don’t wanna sound like thoes edgey kids self diagnosing but I am a self aware person and I can see it thoe it’s a odd trait for a “narcissist” I don’t know I just wanted to throw this out into the void
1191,I can’t do this anymore,"It’s almost 3:30 AM and I work in a few hours. Another evening where I laid my head down for sleep and it just turned into me bawling for a couple of hours straight, now. I know it’s something a lot of people are dealing with rn but I am SO lonely and I have been since before the pandemic. It physically hurts in my chest and I can’t stop crying because I can’t get relief and holy fuck how do I keep going on like this? Most nights I can smoke myself to sleep but I ran out of weed earlier today &amp; I got dumped before Christmas and tbh I haven’t been able to share/discuss any of my highs or lows from my life for 3 years and it’s all just piling up on conscious right now, when I’m trying to sleep. I’m tired of not feeling like I exist in the real world and not having any human connections to prove said existence."

1193,"I can't do almost anything, I don't know how to react...","Hi there, I'm looking for help because I don't know what to do and evryone around me seem to not understand. 

I have to do a lot of things, really, a lot, and even if I do one of them, and finish it, I don't feel better and neither that I have less work to do.
It always happens me to promise myself that at one specific time I will do ""that thing"", but when I have to, I start feeling depressed, I lay on my bed and think a lot, for hours, and when it's too late to do the thing I wanted to, I just ignore it, and keep feeling bad. 
A lot of people told me that it's a part of my life, it's just a phase, because I'm 16 and it's normal to feel bad sometimes, I should do what I am told and react. But this happens since I was 9, and I totally can't react when I feel like that, I have like a lock that holds me from doing anything, and I don't know what to do because I can't react and just do what I should, I can't even move sometimes."
1194,"Im exhausted, kinda venting","Im absolutely drained and i dont know how much longer i can last. My family is driving me crazy, i couldnt care less about school, i have health issues, and i feel so alone. I have trauma of sexual abuse and have been used for my body multiple times. I only have one thing keeping me going and its because of the denial and false hope im feeding myself. My parents are extremely controlling and frustrating to deal with. My dad victimizes himself and makes everything about him, and my mom cares more about our reputation than happiness. She controls what i wear, where i go, who im friends with, what i buy, who i talk to, where i’ll go to school at, hell even who i marry. They arent from america so they’re used to their old fashioned culture where reputation means everything, and ive been living my whole life rebelling against it. All they do is fight, my dad has horrible anger issues and controls my mom’s every move. They’ve used me as a venting dumpster since maybe elementary. My moms threatened to move out and take my siblings, and shes threatened suicide. Im the oldest of 3 children and ive raised them both, but the middle child verbally abuses the youngest as she has my dads temper. This has resulted in the youngest to fear her, flinch at every move, and start bawling when she does anything wrong out of fear. I know it isnt their faults but god it hurts seeing it. Over the years of fighting ive secluded myself in my room and stay up at night while its quiet. They hate this about me and use it against me. They force me to do whatever they want and i cant get out of it. Im 18 with no car, no job, no license, no money, and no will to live. They’re my only transportation as theyre the type to call the police if i went on the bus. I beg them to help me get a license but it fails as they just forget about it. Ive recently developed a tempter as i just get mad at everything they do, ive grown to resent them. I try my best in school but i struggle with depression, its undiagnosed but its been 6 years and i have no doubt. Ive begged for therapy for years but they shame it and dont believe in it. They blame me for my laziness and lack of motivation, and when i think ive done something to make them proud, they shut it down. I have one thing, just one and that is this boy. Hes seriously an angel sent straight from heaven and i’d do anything for him. Hes the only thing keeping me alive but doesnt know it, id never put any of this on him. There is no future with him as my parents would disown me before letting me be with someone out of our community. On top of that, i have chronic back pain that doesnt let me sleep in any position and makes my hell of a life even more hell. My future consists of jail cell after jail cell, i have no choices, and i dont have the heart to completely disconnect myself from them. At least while being alive anyway. I dont know what to do. Ive been gradually taking more pain relievers than im supposed to. I dont want to die but i dont want to live either."
1195,I'm scared of living life.,I am always avoiding things from homework to friends to email and text messages. This avoidance has caused more problems than I would have if I just faced up to everything. What is your advice for living life with courage?
1196,I feel so alone,"I feel so alone and lost like so many other people. I have never really felt like this before. Being isolated so long. Yes I actually stay home most of the time minus dog walks and supermarket runs. I went out this past weekend with my sister for specialty stuff. This was first time in forever that I actually did something. And it felt so normal. 

But now that I’m back to my routine of not seeing people and on the brink of my birthday plus hormones (sorry I can’t really handle them at times) it is really affecting me and my relationship. I have a boyfriend who I see maybe once a week or more likely every two weeks and honestly I feel like that should bring me more comfort and it doesn’t. This relationship is complicated on its own and I have always felt like an outsider in it and I can’t tell if that is my own doing or what. 

I feel like I never get to be me and therefore lost myself in the silence of living with only my dog for so long. How does one cope with this sense of self loss?

I am seeking therapy and it will happen I. The near future but even choosing someone to see is like throwing darts and overwhelming."
1197,Words of affirmation mean nothing to me why,"Whenever someone tells me ex: “I’m so sorry dude youre doing amazing!” it doesn’t effect me i don’t feel Anything to it I don’t feel anything when people try to reassure me I quiet (and I don’t mean to sound mean) don’t care 
Why? Why do I do that :("
1198,I feel terrible (repost from r/depression)," Recently my life has been going downhill. I'm failing all my subjects and disappointing my parents, and I don't trust anyone except strangers to talk to. I relate to most of the posts on this sub and found that most of the symptoms apply to me. But I come from a middle-class family and my life has been going extremely smoothly up until now. I have no reason to be depressed. I might even be faking it and fooling myself to believe I have it. I don't even feel sad and have never felt sad in my entire life. My parents tell me that I'm worthless without even knowing it. I pride myself on my intelligence, but recently everything I do is irrational and stupid. I pride myself on my resilience, but I break down in front of any mild stress. I know that I won't commit suicide because it will definitely hurt, but I'm useless anyway, and just a money drain on my family. My dad just told me that he worries about my future and about how at this rate I will never become a successful programmer. I agree. If I don't exist, my future won't exist. I just failed my favorite subject because I was scared. I don't even know what I'm scared about. My mom tells me that I won't be able to achieve anything if I don't face my fears, but I can't. Something's keeping me back. My parents hint that if I wasn't their child, I would be disowned. If I mess up one more time, they will withdraw me from school. I'm afraid. I feel tense all the time, and sometimes I'll cry for no reason at all. I just wish I could start again from a new save file and undo everything that I ever did. I hate myself as much as I hate my current situation. Why do I lie in times of stress? Why can't I just do just one thing logically instead of being held back by my emotions? Why can't I get rid of emotions anyway?

I feel terrible."
1199,Correlation between Anxiety/Depression and diet?,"I’ve had my issues since I was little, now that I am 20 almost 21 and have been on SSRI for a couple months now, started working out again, things have gotten better. 

However, I want the best for myself. 

You are what you eat seems to be the case with a lot of other things... 

Can anyone link some science backed articles on diet when it comes to Anxiety and Depression? 

I truly am tired of not living to my maximum potential.

1201,I just exploded at someone who told me to get therapy,"I've already tried therapy a lot and it's not for me. I feel much worse and only triggered afterwards, so have made the personal choice to not persue that option at least at this time. 

Someone I barely know suggested I try therapy. I politely declined saying it doesn't really work for me. Then they went on to give the most scripted and generic response to why therapy works. I again said no thanks I really don't want to right now. Then they said only I  can make the decision to change, and blah blah blah more extremely generic reasons why therapy is better than chocolate. So I told him, you really don't know me, I don't want to discuss this with you. At first they apologized saying they understood but not even five minutes later did it again saying that I just don't understand that therapy can help me for extremely generic reasons.

I fucking lost it. I really said a lot of extremely nasty things. I compared him to a rapist saying he didn't understand what the word no meant. I just got so triggered by this person half my age trying to say these things to me after I told him three times to stop. 

I might be in trouble here and he got really mad and said I better watch my back. The worst part is, I'm not even sure if I regret doing it."
1202,Has anyone else been completely unable to monitor their mental health?,I had a psychotic break which seemed to come out of nowhere but when I look back I can see that my mental health was seriously off for s long time. I was completely oblivious to this and couldn’t see at all that anything was wrong at all. Has anyone else experienced this and did they ever find out how and why that happened?
1203,Is it normal to cry when you see someone you love,"I know this sounds weird but i guess let me explain. I’m 22. Parents divorced ever since i can remember. Sister is 24, married, 7m pregnant and living in AZ. I live with my mom in FL. Dad is in NC. I have an ok relationship with my dad. No issues. But we only talk once every month or so. My mom is extremely emotionally abusive. She never really was the physically affectionate mother and has even told me she doesn’t say “i love you” back because she says i dont know what love is and that she won’t say it back because “the love isn’t there”

Now. I have a boyfriend. And he has supported me in every way i could’ve imagined. I have so much love for him. When i see him. Like when i stare in his eyes. It makes me want to cry and i do some days. Is that normal? Or why do i feel like this? I feel bad for crying because it worries him because he thinks I’m not okay. Thank you for any help. 


I do have depression, anxiety and paranoia. I dont know if that’s a factor."

1206,Taking off of work once a month because of major depression and anxiety does anyone ele have this issue?,Ive been taking off of work mostly once a month because of how bad my depression is. Ive had bad depression since i was young. Ive tried to kill myself twice and have been institutionalized once. Ive switched around on medications and effexor was finally helping me untill recently. Ive went up on the dosage and i feel just the same. I feel like im the only one with this issue when it comes to mental health and work its so hard for me to get out of bed sometimes or even when i get the energy its just not enough to do anything beside lay back down. IVE GONE FROM JOB TO JOB AND IDK WHAT ELSE TO DO HERE IM STUCK.
1207,I can't do this anymore,There is so much going on in my mind. I can't control my anxious thoughts anymore. I started to cry in school today and I can't explain anything to anyone. Every day feels the same and I'm doing my best not to go crazy. This is so exhausting. Anyone here who feels like this?
1208,"I have an irrational fear of a ""trope"" in fiction that traumatises me and I prioritize it over my life","TL;DR: I'm a sensitive overdramatic degenerate. A scene from a TV show made me uncomfortable but nothing especially terrible because its entirely fictional. It confused the fk out of me when I identified feelings of real-life reoccurring pain from thinking about this fictional event. I watched the entire show, hoping that it would redeem what happened, and being a fan was almost a defence mechanism for coping with that feeling. When I gave up that show, the same feeling started gradually popping up in other shows, movies, fan posts that no one should take seriously. It's surprising how just having negative feelings for what is considered to be entertaining by everyone has made me second guess everything, panic, and spiral. Now I can barely enjoy anything because I'm terrified of it happening again and all I used to enjoy were movies and mindless entertainment and my list of this ""trope"" being used is always in the back of my mind, and is always instinctively making my insides hurt. Being unable to enjoy entertainment would be a minor problem if it didn't conflict with my passion, that I'm still working hard to get a job in and I have no other skills. What I think I've been feeling this whole time is heart-break.

I know this is just reddit but therapy isn't an option for me and I'm desperate for just a direction and everything I've tried has made it so much worse. I know this is long so if someone could at least read the first paragraph. (The rest is just describing the events from when it started to now to understand this in its entirety. I don't know what's relevant or not so its easier to just spill almost everything.)

I've posted about this before which was basically a vent but now I'm asking for help. This entire post is pretty overdramatic and pathetic. I understand how people might think this is disingenuous and hard to take seriously. I dislike fans who act as if a TV show is part of their identity, mostly doing it out of pride but that's not what I'm doing at all, I just happen to have crippling feelings about a reoccurring ""trope"". I've always been a very sensitive person and a massive overthinker. The source of this ""fear"", and for some reason it being fictional still makes no sense to me. I'm guessing understanding entertainment's irrelevancy to real life is something I never learned, and I would hold fiction that I loved to a standard higher than real life which massively backfired. I can't be specific about this because I'm reasonably ashamed of it. All I can say is that it's something weirdly specific that isn't to do with death, a breakup, and not always real life. It isn't really a fictional trope. It happens in real life too which scares me just as much but it's very common in all of entertainment because people enjoy it, which I can't stop and there's nothing morally or critically wrong it. It might be too much to ask for a real therapist or someone with experience to give me a direction. I know you shouldn't really trust strangers on Reddit but I trust Redditors more than my own stupid conscious that I can't understand. Is it because I'm lonely or undeveloped? What do I need? Grieving over a fictional event isn't something you can just google. I find it hard to believe myself. According to human psychology, this doesn't exist. I've never heard of someone grieving over fictional ""tropes"" that weren't related to a breakup or death and ruminated over it for 2 years. The idea of someone being afraid of something happening in real life equally to fiction doesn't make logical sense to me but it's exactly how I'm feeling. Does anyone know what this even is? If this was a form of autism, depression, or a trigger, I'd at least know where to go from, because I can actually google those words. The closest I've got to is ""grief"" and ""heart-break"" but even those words have different solutions depending on the context. I'm convinced that the reason nobody else experiences this is that my maturity is just ridiculously stunted. I've always known that I'm somewhat ditsy and stupid but I think this says something so ridiculously degenerate about me. It seems especially selfish that I'm posting this on a subreddit where people have had real-life trauma and I'm treating my literal made-up problems as the same level which I sincerely apologize for. Something I've learned from this is that death and loss are worth infinitely more attention than what I'm feeling.

I won't be specific about what the trope is or name any franchises. Even though it might help, it's really laughable. Admitting that I'm very sensitive to something that usually occurs in made-up fantasy lands is already hard to admit. I want to describe how my feelings have developed the best I can so that someone can hopefully understand a solution better than I can. In November 2018 I watched a few episodes of a TV show. I wasn't impressed but it held my interest enough to reach a scene that didn't sit right with me. About 5 months after I watched it, I randomly remembered that scene and other contextual scenes which made me feel uncomfortable. I realized that this feeling kept reoccurring, becoming more than just shower thoughts and became real-life achy feelings. This motivated me to finally watch the rest of season 1 to convince myself it doesn't bother me. It didn't until rewatching the triggering scene. I remember the feeling when it occurred to me, realizing that this made up instance is now a genuine problem I have and that I'll probably be ruminating over this fictional event for a while. I wanted to cry but just kept feeling uncomfortable and numb. I bought the original books, videogame adaptation, and watched the entire show. Most of my solutions for getting over this was entirely subconscious. I hadn't bought physical games or books in years and I hadn't (illegally) watched this much TV in years because my naïve subconscious thought ""facing my fears"" was the solution to getting over this. Being a fan of this show was a defence mechanism because I had physical proof on the shelf that I wasn't absolutely traumatized. I also watched anticipating that the show would redeem the event, which it almost did. There was a beautiful scene that unexpectedly teased something better which meant so much to me and kept me carefree and happy for about 2 months. When that happiness fizzled, I stopped watching it entirely. Now I have five books and one game in my house that I'd burn if I wasn't so sentimental. I went on a few vacations around this time and the majority of days out and long walks was just endlessly debating and ruminating, excusing why what happened and why I should or shouldn't feel grief or if this happens or not or if that was even canon. Every time I was silent just watching and arguing to myself in third person. Seeing just a screenshot of the event or someone describing it leaves me physically shivering, heating up, my heart rate goes right up, it almost deafens me, my motivation to do anything plummets while I ruminate over it for the next few days until I find something else to ruminate over. I'm almost glad that when I watched this show for the first time, it 0% concerned me because watching it for the first time as I am now would probably leave me feeling suicidal, just because of television. What happened in this show absolutely crushes my soul. It's now been over 500 days since I watched a full scene or even looked at related screenshots that I still remember perfectly, how can I still be devastated?

Whether I liked it or not, I spent my time away from that show worrying about this happening again, which indirectly caused it to, Through 2020 of all times, more shows, games, online comics, even memes now like this happened regularly. A videogame franchise that I recently got into used this trope and fans are on board with the idea of doing the same trope again in a different instance. This one hurts differently because I use to have fun with these games, and a possible sequel is something I'm absolutely dreading. One show that I loved had this trope which didn't initially bother me until 12 months after not watching it. That one trope overshadows everything I loved about that show and it hurts just as effectively as the show before. I desperately want to forget this one's existents. I even found a real-life example of this trope. As I said, there's nothing morally wrong with it, but that's not how my mind works anymore. In summary, my subconscious misunderstood what the real problem was. It wasn't the trope's fault but the way it was used in that show. Choosing to fear this trope caused a bigger and less reasonable internal reaction of pain each time, with each use of it becoming a less and less reasonable thing ruminate over. It used to take months to manifest in my head but now it happens in an instant, including three video games the previous month, one of which is animal crossing, which I used to love. This is the only franchise I'm labelling because I think it's necessary to know how pathetic I am. I've officially reached the peak.

What makes this so crippling and confusing is that I'm currently doing a media course and I want a job in art and visuals. I'm required to use some of this in my research. Creating art and types of imagery wasn't something I used as a distraction, It's something I've always appreciated and have been very passionate about. I've always wanted to peruse a career in something like concept art or movie visuals. I've reached the point where motivation has become less about what makes me happy and more about avoiding distress, so if trying to be inspired and make myself happy feels like walking on eggshells then what's the point. There's only so much emotional gratification I can get from Tetris. Like the time I pretended to enjoy that show, I've continuously created these fake feelings of relief and believed it's all over for little reason. But my subconscious isn't buying it anymore. The amount of times I've had fake relief to make myself feel better (like when I bought the books and game) just to be disappointed has left me unable to trust when I actually am happy. What I can or can't enjoy is entirely based on past context, I don't know what I'm really feeling, my opinions or what my genuine beliefs are and this very specific fear of something mostly occurring in fiction has established that I could be hurt by absolutely anything, without even considering intentions. I'm aching every fking day, triggered by basically nothing it just happens at this point. My negative feelings towards that show originally came from empathy and morality. I believed it was wrong but the show itself and its fans believed it was cool and admirable. Now my negative feelings have evolved into my own insecurity, my selfishness, feeling threatened, complete loss of faith in anything. Empathy and morality have little to do with the problem now. it's more unempathetic and immoral for me to encourage these feelings. I have no idea what my feelings are even fighting for.

When people describe a breakup or death, I can relate to that but solutions are something I can't relate to. To get over a breakup, you need to be realistic about it but fiction can be literally be anything and do whatever it wants. There are limitless possibilities to how the next thing could affect me. Pretty much anything that makes me feel emotion is motivated by this ""issue"" and avoiding it. I can imagine what it feels like to not be bothered by this, as somebody else or me before 2019 and it seems a lot less complicated, but obviously, that's not my default mode of thinking. If I died any time soon, my dying thoughts will be about one of these made up fantasies of other people. I can't believe that these thoughts have been my priority over any potential problems in the real world, like a virus. I'm fortunate to have never been affected by covid the slightest, but I just can't care. My view on everything has proven to be unreliable so It would mean a lot to get someone else's opinion on all of this, just to hear from a rational person with a brain who identifies real problems like a pandemic to no problems like stupid entertainment. Not that my situation is even worth anyone's time but I'd appreciate anyone reading this have anything to comment on it, and give some guidance on how to get back to how I used to be if possible. I'd love to be able to watch the entire show with no reminder of how I used to feel. Rather than being terrified of sequel announcements, I want to actually get exited again. I'd like to be able to finish my course, create art, and do my job without being traumatized. Please talk to me."
1209,My old friends from school are anxiety triggers for me. It's so bad that I avoid a very large portion of my city just because a few of them live there. If something happens that reminds me of them I feel paralized and my whole day is ruined. Is this normal?,"I associate them with alot of bad memories so ever since I switched school I've been avoiding them. Everything is fine until something happens that reminds me of them. Usually it's that somone says somonething in the group chat (I haven't said a word in there for 3 years). I wanted to leave the group but a part of me still see them as friends, despite that they were horrible to me and I don't wanna burn any bridges. If I ever end up in that part of the city we're a few of them lives, I ger shortness of breath and get tunnel vision and just wanna go home. It usually takes a whole day before I recover from the stress and anxiety, wth is wrong with me?"
1210,"Does this count as an ED? If so, is there a proper name for it?","I never thought I’d end up here. But I’ve been trying to improve myself and I’m tying loose ends.

I have an issue when it comes to drinking any sort of liquids. I’ll limit myself to a small amount of beverages per day. Sometimes I just forget to drink something, while other times forcing myself not to drink is a “punishment” of some sort. I know it’s not healthy and I don’t let myself die or anything. But I can’t help it.

I’m curious if this counts as an eating disorder, since I eat things normally otherwise (minus skipping breakfast). If it does count is there an official name for it. If it doesn’t count though, what’s wrong with me?"
1211,Why dont I feel sad after a death.,So yesterday I found out that my grandmother who meant a lot to me had died. But not only did I not cry but I just dont feel sad at all about it.

1212,"if i no longer live in a toxic environment, why do i still only feel safe at night?","is this something that goes away? my entire life, i’ve only felt safe from 12am to around 5am, because my abusive parents weren’t around. i live on my own now, i figured that i would have adopted a normal sleep schedule but i don’t feel safe during the day. being awake when the sun is out makes me uncomfortable, and even if i DO try to alter my sleep schedule: it can revert that same day. if i go to sleep/wake up earlier, i can still easily stay up until at least 8am. if i stay awake all day/don’t sleep, i can continue that for up to 3 days straight.

i only feel safe at night even though i’m “safe” all the time now. why"

1214,What are the best things for mental health?,"According to a [Poll](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/) conducted in mid-July, 53% of adults in the United States reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus. This is significantly higher than the 32% reported in March, the first time this question was included in KFF polling. All of us must have witnessed the irritated, frustrated, and negative change in behaviors of our loved ones and ourselves. I have seen people around me who had a few daily mental health habits that helped them sail through this pandemic. 

**Below are 5 practical habits to look after your mental health.**  
***1) Practice*** [positive self-talk](https://www.healthline.com/health/positive-self-talk)***:*** Simple rule, Don't say anything to yourself that you wouldn't say to anyone else. Your self-talk should contain less self-criticism and more self-acceptance. Accept the way you are, accepting yourself is the only way to overcome low self-esteem.

***2) Disconnect:*** This can be extremely difficult, but it’s imperative. Put your phone away. Rearrange your apps so the habit of opening Instagram/Facebook/Twitter isn’t so casual. Disconnect from the digital world. If we don’t escape our electronics, it makes it hard to turn off from work. If we can’t turn off, we can’t recharge.

***3) Ask for help:*** For some reason, many of us feel like a burden when we ask for help. The reality is, there are SO many people out there whose purpose and vocation is to help people like us. There doesn’t have to be something wrong for us to have a therapist. Therapy can be a critical component of a healthy life. ([10 Signs it’s time to see a therapist](https://calmerry.com/blog/therapy/do-i-need-therapy-10-signs-its-time-to-see-a-therapist/))

***4) Quit:***  We’ve all got areas of our lives that hold us back from flourishing. It could be a cigarette habit. It could be a relationship. Perhaps it’s our diet. Whatever it may be for you, let it go. Our mental health is more important than anything else &amp; if something is holding you back from happiness, say goodbye.

***5) Having a good night’s sleep:*** [Harvard health mentions](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health): *Americans are notoriously sleep-deprived, but those with psychiatric conditions are even more likely to be yawning or groggy during the day. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).*

This means getting better sleep will directly and positively impact your mental health."
1215,Complex PTSD and in-patient hospitalization,What can one expect if they decide to go to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a recent diagnosis of complex PTSD?
1216,Am I Really Depressed?," I've never thought that I could be depressed. I don't believe that I am, but lately, I have been feeling some symptoms that I didn't know were symptoms. First of all for years, I've always thought that nobody would accept me for who I am, and if they know the real me, they would reject me. Second, I'd always have the feeling that I'm too lucky to be sad. I belong in a middle-class family (in a developing country) and I don't have difficulties with learning in school. I'm not in the lowest of the low, and because of that, I think that I'm too lucky to be sad. So whenever I feel sad, I'd always say that there's no reason to be sad. People always say that I'm a very lucky person and I am privileged, which puts pressure on me to be happy. Third, I'm feeling emotionally numb. Though yes I can feel happiness but not EXTREME happiness. When watching shows, I cannot connect with the emotions, and I feel like I'm becoming cold. I can't even cry anymore. Fourth, I didn't know that I actually had social anxiety, until I tried to read and take an online test (look, I'm a high school senior in a third world country so Psychologists/Psychiatrists are not an option), which states that I do have one. Fifth, I'm also feeling very lethargic. I'm always feeling tired but I cannot sleep early at all. I'd have to wait until 12-2 PM to sleep. Look, I cannot talk to my family about this. I also realized that I'm very secretive about myself, and in no way am I going to share this with any of my family members. I feel like I'm a very horrible and I can't take this anymore. I feel like I'm the least favorite family member of any of my family members. I tried to take an online test (because again, that's my only choice) and I found out that I have severe depression. Am I really? I'd never thought that this was what depression felt like. Am I really depressed? I mean I don't believe that I am. I can still look at things and still say ""I can keep on going"". Someone give me a second opinion, please."
1217,Am I self-sabotaging?,"I'm a 17-year-old male. I feel as if set myself up for failure constantly... 

I heavily procrastinate, I know that if just work on the lessons I have I will get good grades, but I just don't.

1219,My partner's depression is worsening and I feel helpless to do anything,"Hey all, not necessarily looking for answers to my specific problem, but I need somewhere to unload.  


My \[25M\] fiancée \[24F\] and I have been together for going on 8 years, and I was made aware of her depression/anxiety when we first got together. I had no delusions going in, and this post isn't me 'realising' anything, just to be clear.  


Some info: She's on several types of medication and has been for years.

Over the years, her depression has followed the typical rollercoaster pattern. At her highest, she's hyper and giggly, at her absolute lowest, she's attempted her life. I've been there through everything, and while each plummet to rock bottom has of course weighed enormously on me, I've never put the focus on me, because I'm all too aware that she *cannot* help it. 

She's had to leave multiple jobs because she can't cope with the stress, and one manager even sacked her for opening up about being unfairly hazed in her first few weeks at a job she otherwise enjoyed. This, by nature of her anxiety, has further conditioned her to believe she can't talk to employers about her condition. Her current job has been a dream for her, and yes there are the normal work-related stresses, but she's handled everything well.

It's become very clear, however, that her medication is not working, or if it *is,* it's scratching the surface of an even larger beast than the doctor's she seen ever imagined. Life itself is becoming an overwhelming task for her now, though she does find genuine happiness and calm in streaming on Twitch, it goes right back to the darkness as soon as the camera shuts down.  


She has a counselor; who in my opinion isn't offering any insight or getting her to challenge herself or views. She comes out of the session feeling completely unaffected by it, but the waiting list is so long that finding a new one almost seems counter-intuitive given she at least has another person to talk to. 

The doctors she's seen don't seem to understand that no matter what dosage of anti-depressants she's given, it's not working. She's getting worse and deathly afraid she's going to lose another job. I'm frantic because I know where this would put her, and what self-destructive coping mechanisms she'll jump to.  


Now, I'm not after sympathy. Countless others across the globe are facing this too, but I just need to vent. My family have already been through this at my side, and are too, *for want of a better word, '*fragile' to cope with her mental illness. I can't talk to them lest I wish to cause an argument. I don't see a light right now, and if anything comes from this post, it's the hope that someone else is in my position too.  


I'm so sorry to all of you who either live with an illness or are struggling to cope in proximity to it.   


**TL;DR - My partner's condition is getting worse and we can't find a way out.**"
1220,Online Learning Has Been Rough on My Mental Health,[removed]
1221,What the F is happening to me?,"Hey all.

I hate to admit where I am currently at, but things just ain't going right, and I feel like my mental health is suffering, badly, and I can't keep it to myself anymore, how bad things are.

I grew up with a lot of friends, being popular in school and fast forward to the years before high school, in my country around age 14-15, me and a lot of my friends, started to experiment with smoking weed, going to parties etc. Which was definitely the time of our lives at that time haha. We were all really close and pretty much always had a good time. (I smoked a lot of weed in this period from maybe 14-16 years old).

Then life went on ....

I met my ex gf in December 2018, where I was seriously manipulated and controlled for almost 2 years. I broke up with her in October 2020, due to me not even recognizing myself anymore, and because I've felt bad for a very long time, in that relationship. 

New Years Eve 2019/2020, I got drugged by some of my best friends (no one has admitted anything, even though I tested positive for MDMA and I caught one of them in lying), which caused me to then make a decision and decide to cut that friend group off, completely, because they simply didn't serve me. This of course happened before I broke up with my ex girlfriend, so I knew, when I was going to break up with my girlfriend, I would really be a lot on my own. I still have very few friends, but not some that I see that often.

Now I just find myself in despair, excruciating social anxiety, that I have never experienced before. I have dealt with social anxiety before, but not to this degree, it's a whole new level and I just don't recognize myself anymore and I don't feel like I am on the same wavelength as society anymore, at all! 

I am constantly afraid that I am in some sort of dream, and that something horrible will happen. I am so afraid of losing my mind, it's crazy. I have a really hard time deciding to take on a job, but I need money and fuck nothing just makes sense anymore.

I used to be the type of guy who loved to be creative, start businesses, go for runs, go to parties, have fun with girls etc. Now when I go on dates, I even attract the most beautiful ladies, but I just have no interest in them, my libido is absolutely zero!!!  Which is also an indicator, that something is not as it should be in my body.

I constantly worry about what everyone thinks about me, I feel like I am some sort of monster and everybody is afraid of me, or that everybody thinks that I am in some completely other space.. It such a terror feeling..... I can't even describe it.

Sometimes I get confidence for some short time, and everything goes great, and then I am back in this confusing hell. I've been thinking that I might have PTSD or CPTSD or maybe I am just going crazy?

I had an experience with psychedelic shrooms, some months before I broke up with my ex girlfriend, I've tried before, and always been very cautious about doing it right and making it safe for myself and doing it in a responsible way. But this trip was just very very weird, I didn't even hallucinate, but it was like I was shifting between realities, and I couldn't grasp what reality was real anymore. It was really horrifying, but I rode it out and of course got back to reality again, but I can't help but think, that maybe that experience did something to me?

Anyways, I haven't felt like myself since maybe July/August 2019. 

I have been to trauma therapists, coaches etc. I just feel like no one really understands, maybe I haven't been transparent enough about what I experience. 

I also have some sort of problem in my stomach, I got tested positive for some sort of infection, so I am going to the a abdominal lab thing in the beginning of February, maybe that is causing me some problems as well?

Also, I just worry constantly, I get nowhere with my life, I am stuck and I feel like nothing makes sense, I don't know what I am anymore. I feel utterly detached!

Sometimes when talking to people, I just can't get words out, I am forcing myself to talk, but I have just nothing to say, I am afraid of saying something wrong I think, I am afraid of .. I don't really know?! I am writing all this today, because I went to see my sister today and have a coffee with her and a walk outside, and the vibes between us was just weird. She said that I acted really strange and she almost got scared, because she felt I was just staring at her. Which was never my intention, maybe I just were trying to figure out if she thought something about me, or I tried to read her to see if I was acting strange. It was so uncomfortable.

I am afraid, I don't know what's happening, what to do? I have no drive to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Some extra info if that helps:

I am 22 Male btw, and I eat pretty healthy, have always been positive but a deep thinker, I'm often the guy who helps people with their issues, I am a people pleaser, I've become better at knowing my own worth, Maybe this is just me standing up for myself for the first time in life really, and feeling the consequences and the mental labour of that?

TL;DR. 

Decided to cut off my social circle

Broke up with narcissistic ex girlfriend

Feeling detached, like I am in a completely other space

Have had a weird experience with psychedelic mushrooms

I am freeze responding in social situations 

I am not at all able to flow in social situations, I just stay quiet, where I used to be able to flow with conversations and chit chat.

Cymbalta is helping but I’m tired 😴,I have been on cymbalta 60mg for 6 weeks and it has helped my depression and anxiety but I feel very tired/sedated. Has anyone had this side effects lesson or go away. Did you find a strategy that helped with it besides adding wellbutrin?
1223,"Is this type of insecurity? I can't lose, If I lose it's as if I don't exist.","Today I felt this bubbling anger in my gut. Pretty normal for me, I grew up being mostly angry. I'm what they call choleric but only in 2 scenarios: I am forced to do something I hate, It doesn't work but I can't quit until it's done. the second one is games and competition.

Now why I felt the anger today? I figured I might play this game for a bit. It's 3v3 medieval knight simulator. You wave with sword and see who fares better. It's a skill-based game.

I think my rage due to loss is from feeling inferior to other players who've beaten me. And somehow I think I have a fear of the consequence of losing. Nothing really happens when you lose but I feel as if I've lost my value? Or that I don't matter anymore and if I lose again and again I'm at the very bottom of the social pit.

I was the kid that everyone in the group hated and the teachers, I knew hate and rage since pre-school days.

But somehow I always wanted an elder sister. To care of me, show compassion. I tried to strike up a close bond with my cousin sister. But she never cared until she needed my help. I realized, she wasn't the sister I wanted. 

In my culture, girls leave their house after marriage. After they get married they don't call their little brothers daily, don't care for them like before, they lose compassion for their little brothers. 


Whenever I see girls getting married or wedding photos I feel like the little brother(if she has one) is losing the compassion of the sister. I've stopped going to weddings, I've stopped seeing wedding photos. But somehow when I see, my day is ruined for sure. 

Also, when see a maternal uncle holding the baby, I feel like now the sister has become a mother, she'll give him even less time. 

Basically I've gone nuts thinking about it. People around me laugh at it, they say its stupid and embarrassing and not to tell anyone. I don't know what to do.

I looked for free online counselling. But either it was a bot or they wanted credit card. I don't have credit cards, I'm not that rich. 

No one helps me through this, I can't find any solutions. It has made me sleepless for nights. Its been like this for a year. This really hurts. Please help me."
1225,My mother said something that has deeply hurt me (20sF) I don’t know how to cope or if my feelings are valid.,"Hi. I don’t know if this post belongs here but I wouldn’t be posting unless I was desperate. 

A few months ago, my mother attempted suicide, I found her and she was taken to hospital and ended up being okay. I love my mother infinitely and this is without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with, in fact I felt like a big part of myself died that day. My mum has since maintained the stance that this was my fault. I cannot express to you the pain of having my mum, the woman who I always saw as my best friend, looking me in the eyes and saying this countless times, very nonchalantly, even though I have always tried my best to support her. I have always suffered from anxiety but it has been exponentially worse since this event, I have severe panic attacks often and live everyday in fear that she will hurt herself, and am almost afraid of speaking to her because I fear that if I disagree with her over the slightest thing she will try and hurt herself again. 

Many people close to me who know us both have said that she is being manipulative, holding her life over my head in a way. I do feel responsible for keeping her alive, but the mental toll is almost unbearable. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I feel horrible because part of me truly believes she is being manipulative and that suicide / suicide attempts should not be blamed on anyone, but the other part of me feels almost evil for thinking that. Where do I go from here? How do I heal myself and her at the same time? Am I wrong for feeling the way I feel? Sorry if this is confusing, but thank you for reading."

1227,"Do you think that like pain, worrying is our body’s way of telling us that something is wrong and therefore serves a purpose?","The overriding sentiment in popular psychology on “worrying” and anxiety are that they are make believe fairies that can only harm us if we allow them to. 

But is this perhaps a little disingenuous? After all, unless you suffer from a severe anxiety disorder or schizophrenia, isn’t there almost always a reason for these feelings that are rooted in emotional responses to real life events/concerns?

I feel like the majority of the “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” sentiment falls under the archaic “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” narrative that is on its way out. With the exposure of the abundant underlying societal problems that have long been eschewed by the ruling class and accepted by the working class as “life’s not fair” which has been generationally indoctrinated in their children, perhaps we will see this phenomenon addressed more appropriately."
1228,"Fear, anxiety and controlling enviroment.","Hey im (19f) a newbie at this sub so hello everyone!🖐
So im a senior highschooler and im in a very big crisis both in career and mental state vise. These two connected actually.

To be precise when this schoolyear started i just turned on panic mode. I dont know what i want to do with my life and im regretting choiches, though i dont know what would have been better. Im really scared from graduation as well because it dont look like a piece of cake , and a we spent a very big amount of time in online school wich lacking from lot of important stuff. 

Im overthinking, stuck in a facilitating anxiety that paralizes me to the core. Im full of fear and i feel like there could be no happy future for me. Im not just second guessing myself , i go through a simple question like 20+ times and im still not sure. I lack of self worth as well. And in the end these choices are need to made by me.

Its not really helping that i have a kind of manipulating father who dont believe that there is actually a stuff called "" mental illness"". At least he thinks only people with shaking seizures and people whit serious mental incapabilities have mental illnesses. He thinks im hysterical and over reacting. He is matearialistic. Im not saying he is a bad peson, he really loves me (in hi own way) but Im not like that. He wants me to act l/and make choiches like he does.  It is usually "" be determined about something or just do as I say"".He wants to control everithyng in spite of saying the opposite. He has a very big effect of my life and i uncoucosly want to satisfy his expectacions but i dont want to. But every time i want to share an idea with him wich dont meets his expectacions he starts to ramble about the disadvantages , the bad effectors and its really not helping since im not a determined person. We cant even sit down to talk about important maters of my future because he takes over the conversations and i just get loaded of anxiety and shame at the end. 

My time is soon ending and this is my time to make choiches but im still paralized. Im full of fear that every choiche i make i cant turn back from and my life will break dow more into sadness. I cant make decidions because im scared and I feel my head is not clear but im afraid of missing more and more opportunities. I know its better to do something than not fo anything but IM SO SCARED.( sometimes thinking i just want to be gone) . Im just working on half power and my results are getting worst and weaker as I am even after im going to a pschigologyst. Like one step forward but two steps backwards.

1229,Is it normal that I prefer to be alone?,"I (15,M) prefer to be left alone most of the time. I tend to not enjoy being with other people often even if it's just a few. Don't get me wrong I do have friends and in the instances that I do want to, let's say, play pool or go shopping I very much do like to be accompanied sometimes by my friends. It's just that those instances are few and far between. I'd rather spend majority of my time by myself like going for a walk in the park or eat alone at some small diner or going to the movies (well not that often anymore especially going to the movies because of quarantine). It's also something my family (and some of my friends) address to me, ""you should go out more with us,"" you're always too quiet,"" ""you should join us more often next time,"" etc. Is there something wrong with me? How do I improve this? Should it even be something that I should improve upon?

and i don’t care. i feel like i’ve now trapped myself into a career i cannot stand. i put in so much work for 5 years being a full time student working 30-40 hours a week, all for something i hate. it feels like i missed out on so much by choosing the wrong major. i don’t know what i’m going to do from here honestly. i’m just sad about what my life is.

1231,How to come back from bad parenting.,"I'm in my mid 20s, still living with my family, single, and with mild autism. Parents didn't know how to deal with an autistic kid, so they would send me to a relatives house or just let me game alone in my room. It taught me many bad habits, mainly being bad with laundry. My self-esstem and image is low. I have gained several physical issues, such as my neck and back constantly cracking, and needing several pillow support for me to go to sleep. My parents don't think my issues are a serious matter. They conditioned me to think any issues I have are temporary or just a mental issue. My saving grace is that I'm almost done with computer programming at college, to which if I'm successful will get me a lot of money for the future. I keep telling myself that others have it way worse than me, but I don't know if I can truly be a good potential partner for someone, or if my career will actually take off, if I've been raised to be ""a loser"""
1232,Weird Hallucinations - Have you felt them? Do you know someone with similar behaviours?,"Sorry for the long post, but here it goes:  


Often I have been some this depressive episodes (its almost cyclical) where I feel, from 1 to several days, hopelessness, worthlessness, oversleep, dont have motivation to do anything, even the simple tasks. But lately, I've become aware of somethings that happens in and out of this episodes. I tend to see things where they aren't, but they aren't full on hallucinations (e.g. i was walking behind my gf lookin at the floor, and when i look up i see she climbed the stairs - only saw just a little of her legs and back climbing - of our house, when I asked where she was going she told me but she had entered in the bathroom, not the stairs, and to which she said ""i'm in the bathroom, why you asking why i am climbing?""), other times it feels like I see partial people as well from the corner of my eyes (a pair of legs, a arm swinging, etc, where there was no objetcts that could be moving to cause the illusion). Another curious stuff, yesterday i was talking with my girlfriend, wishing her a good night and said ""i love you, sleep tight and have great dreams"" (and i vividly remember of opening my mouth), she sweared on her hands and knees that i stopped talking at ""i love you"". This last thing happens a lot, where in my mind I say and do stuff that I didnt actually do. I've grown worried about this, adding the cycilcal depressive episodes, but since we are in confinement I'm unable to talk to psychologist. And I know I shouldn't be asking here on the internet, but I'm just curious to see if any of you can connect any of this strange behaviours to a known mental issue, or by chance been going through the same thing.

1233,How do people not get stressed out from employment and career decisions?,"For me, decisions coming from employment and career changes are among the most stressful things to manage because they determine the course of your life for the forseeable future.

Any job you take will last at least 6 months, and this is the minimum. People generally advise that you shouldn't change job frequently to give the impression that you are unreliable and can't hold a job. This means any decision you make to accept a job, or do a career change would affect you life for a year. A person doesn't have this many years to get this right?

The process of finding employment is also creates a lot of mental stress and ambivalence. For example, just how much do you want the job or like your existing job? How much effort should you put into it? One starts to think things such as ""I don't care if the interview went badly, I didn't like the job anyway"". These sorts of thoughts drives indicision and stress. 

I am currently dealing with other person al issues that giving me a lot of mental stress. I know some people can make these decisions very easily without troubling themselves to much. How do these people do it?"

1239,What's my first step?,"Hi all, I'm using an alt account because frankly I'm insecure about what I struggle with. Currently going through a rough breakup around some messy circumstances that perfectly ping my insecurities (self worth, being replaced, not being good enough, etc.). I've always struggled mentally and I figure now is as good a time as ever to try getting help. I just don't know where to start. I haven't seen a therapist in probably 4 years, and even then I don't think it was really help I was looking to get.

About me if it helps, I'm 21, male, he/him, I've never had a good relationship with my parents (growing up I was always told that I'm worthless and I'm never going to get anywhere in life). When I'm not seeing anyone, I feel like life doesn't really have purpose and I just feel like I'm on auto pilot just going with no goal. Like life is just kinda sedentary if that makes any sense? I'm uncomfortable talking about my feelings, around people (even my friends with a few exceptions) I cover it all up, sometimes I fake a God complex just because it's easier than going into the real story. I know I struggle with body dismorphia, anxiety, codependency (and thus jealousy), and depression. I never feel well rested and half the time call in late to work because I can't be motivated to get up. Sometimes sleeping is weird because it just feels like I'm trapped, just staring at the ceiling but can't move or do anything. I've never tried medication to treat anything, I can't smoke weed because of where I work (and whenever I try I get really paranoid anyways). I've never really thought that I had an eating disorder but I definitely either under or over eat when I'm in a bad mental place. Minor history with self harm and suicidal thoughts, but I haven't really thought about suicide for years now. 

I think if I continue down my same path, I'm never gonna find whatever it is I'm searching for. I really don't want to be this way, and I wish I could have a normal relationship with my family and a normal relationship with my partners. 

I really just don't know where to start. Therapist? Psychiatrist? Just someone to talk to? Anybody have recommendations in the Tempe area? I'm sorry if this isn't the place to ask this. Thanks in advance to whoever sees this, I appreciate it."

You know what hurt me most? I did everything out of love but you didn't take any step forward. You just kept moving backwards. I felt my love needed no effort because I loved your soul but your soul didn't love my soul. 

I don't know what I could've done to ever be enough but I'm tired of fighting these thoughts that why I couldn't be enough and why wasn't I worth it.

I want to let you go and this is why I pen this down today. I'm tired. I can't go on thinking what went wrong or what was wrong with me. 

I questioned my appearance and my personally. Asked people around me for validation like a mad person. I don't think I or anyon deserves it. 

I hate to be so much in love with someone who never loved me even a bit.

I choose me today as I struggle. I will choose me everyday and not you. I will struggle but I know one day I will succeed."
1243,I lost my friends,"I'm a medical student doing my internship in India. My internship year didn't go well as I imagined. My mental health issues started around April last year. I had very good support from my friends. They took me to psychiatrist in our hospital and treatment was started. They did whatever they can to cheer me up. Even after treatment i couldn't sleep for many days. One day one of my  friend met with accident. I couldn't handle that. And I had not slept for 5 days even after taking tablets ( prescribed by my doctor). That day I had to sleep anyhow, I took 5 sleeping tablets and 8-9 anxiety tablets at once just to sleep without any other intention. I knew that dose is not fatal. I texted my friends before taking that I had to sleep, I can't handle this situation, I m not getting sleep even after taking 2 tablets, so I'm doubling my dose . Next day they informed my parents and sent me home for one month. That was the last time I talked with my best friend. He never talked to me when I came back from home. I don't know the reason. I cried, begged to tell atleast the reason for doing like this for me. But still I never gave up. I took my medication, exercised, whenever I had a had day I used to double duty in hospital (That's the only thing that I enjoyed and diverted my mind). I slowly recovered and my treatment was tapered and stopped last month. As I recovered I lost my other friends too. I don't know the reason even why they did like that. I miss my friends and my bestfriend daily. I have frequent breakdown whenever I see him. I blame everything on me. I have done some terrible thing that they left me.I don't know how to handle this situation. I have come here after I lost everyone who can understand me. And I don't want to go to that sabe phase again."
1244,"Episodes of feeling detached from myself, anyone experience this or know what its called?","This happens normally when I can't sleep, and it happened again this morning. I couldn't sleep and eventually I dozed off and woke up around 6am and felt as if I was not fully interacting with reality. It feels like my body is in reality, but my brain is in a dream-like state, and I feel like i'm not fully in control of myself. The scary part is that it doesn't panic me because of how detached I am. My memories of the experience are fully intact, and usually slowly goes away until I feel normal. Usually I just repeat to myself, ""it's going to be ok, it will pass"" over and over and over, but even that is difficult to do. If anyone knows what this is or feels it too, please let me know."
1245,Is there anything like too much focus?,"It's gonna get long so sorry in advance and tldr at the end ^^ 

So, I mostly realize this when playing games but it's a thing that hurts my everyday life at times and makes me depressed/very frustrated at times: basically the more I strive to do something the less I can do it, for example in games if I focus too hard on doing a mechanic or a pattern I can't do it but if the same thing happens when I'm talking or in a less ""serious"" ambient I can do it perfectly. So basically it's not a can I do it problem, 'cause I can, it's not even a performance anxiety 'cause I had/still have it and can recognise when it's that acting. It's more like asking too much out of my brain and he lags out making easy minded environments seem waaaay too much better than intense ones (games are example but exams, work and everyday stuff works the same).

I'd like to know more about this mental pattern of mine so if you know anything, from what it could be called to tips I'm open to em ^^ tyvm (not looking for medical advice, also because that would probably need way more info on myself ahah) 

Tldr: focus = brain lagging, have a name/tips for problem?"
1246,"Something's wrong, but I don't know what","16M here, the past year and a half or so I've been increasingly more concerned of my own mental health.

I ignored all of it, because I couldn't really apply everything to me. I'll list some symptoms and see what y'all think.

- Lack of motivation
- Delusions
- Lack of empathy
- Suicidal thoughts
- Unwillingness to speak
- Paranoia

the best way to explain this is that sometimes, my head will start hurting and everything i think and hear becomes louder and with this specific tone.. i'm not sure how to explain it without sounding crazy. it's almost as if it's meant to annoy me? like, for example, typing on my keyboard right now. normally the sound doesn't bother me, but each click is frustrating and seems like there's intent to get under my skin. typing this out really makes me sound kookoo lmao. for the tone, it's just kind of like... high pitched at the end? and very loud. not like my thoughts are actually yelling at me... but they're just.. loud? i guess. it used to not happen as frequently but it's been happening at least once a day for the past week or so. it lasts for like.. 10 to 30 minutes, and that's it. it doesn't have any effect on me or what i do, it's just incredibly annoying and noticeable, haha. if anyone has any idea what this is i'd appreciate it. it's like, impossible to fit my symptoms into a google search and get normal results. thank you!

1251,I felt lost and alone...,"I’m 24 and I am in an awful situation mentally. I moved 3/4 hours away from home 2 years ago and I have never quite settled down and due to COVID - 19 this will be frankly impossible to do for the up coming future. I moved with my partner but because we are together all the time with no outside hobbies or socialization , I feel further apart from him than ever. 

My friends from home and college have all but disappeared emotionally , they have moved on with their lives (had kids last and this year and got engaged and new jobs). I feel stuck and alone wanting nothing more than something like that to happen me. I have been supportive of my friends through every celebration they had and every cry that they had - but when it comes to me I’m left on my own it feels like I’m my only audience whether I’m celebrating a success or a downfall. I have tried talking to my partner about it all but it’s hard to place this burden on him every time I feel down during the entire quarantine. 

Lately I’ve been more suicidal, I want to do it - I want to end my pain. I want someone to care and listen ,because I don’t want to die but I want to see some relief, but no one does. I’ve reached out to my parents , I’ve reached to who I thought are my close friends , I have laid it all out for my partner and I’ve detailed my feelings to medical and professional help and they all clarify the same thing - get over it. I was starving myself or getting sick if purged (still do) and once I visited a medical professional - they told me I was too fat to have those problems. For my mental health I had described in detail how someone bullied me .... the psychiatrist’s reply? You should have given him a chance I think he had a crush on you. I had a middle class lifestyle growing up and because I never was left without , I shouldn’t be upset over anything (what I’ve been told anyways...).

All I wanted for 2021 (which I had planned mentally) was to start a family ... after traveling the world in 2020 ( I even had all the flights booked). I’ve been with my partner nearly 10 years. But as my mental health deteriorated the last year, so did my support and ties. My family moved on without me as I lived so far away. My friends told me I was stupid for wanting kids but congratulated and expressed nothing but sheer excitement to our other mutual friends that did have babies. One friend even went as far as to tell me I would make a terrible mother and ruin my partners life with my mental health after I voiced my mental health concerns and accidental envy at other new mothers. 

I know this has been a shitty for everyone and I am lucky to be an essential worker and have a job. I am sitting in work typing this wondering whether to go home and just do it at this stage. No one would miss me or care."

1255,Why do I feel sad whenever I see a happy child?,"Pretty much what the title says. Whenever I see a kid smiling or I hear them laugh, I get suddenly and intensely depressed to the point where it almost feels like a panic-attack.

I once almost ruined a play I was in because I played a character comic-relief, and when I heard children laughing at my performance it felt like time came to a stop and my mind went blank. I had to rope myself in to avoid suddenly breaking character and ruining the play for everybody watching.

I don’t get it, I’ve looked it up and I haven’t heard of anyone else having this problem"
1256,I hurt all the time.,"My name is Aaron (22M). Like the title says, I’m really just in pain and hurt all the time. I’ve never posted something like this before, let alone vent and type out coming up to two decades worth of hurt. I don’t know where to start other than when I was little.

I have always had very early memories and recollections as a young kid, maybe 4 at the earliest, where I can recall feeling what I’ve always felt to now- my adult life. My childhood was rather average. Good family, bigger than most, devout believers of their faith, hardworking, family was important. I have 4 siblings. When me and my twin sister were born, there was 12-16 years of age difference between us and our older 2 sisters and brother.
They all moved out when I was younger, long before I was able to make meaningful relationships with them being a child and them being young adults and starting life. 

  Going back to when I was 4, I’ve always felt a very pervasive sense of loneliness and experienced literal loneliness, senses impending doom, sadness and a very harsh feeling of disconnection from people and the world that still persist today with a multitude of other things. I was bullied quite often growing up in school. Constant teasing, ostracizing, intimidation, shaming and always labelled and kept from expressing anything. Never trusted, or picked with delight for something, more so the last option in a bucket. The times I spoke up for help or because it was getting to be too much it was never met with resolve. The same things kept happening, the same people got away with their antics and the same punishment was endured relatively everyday by myself. I can still remember hiding in stalls in locker rooms in gym class to just hope to be left alone. The same guys then we’re the same ones who cornered me in a basement closest at a kids birthday party (former childhood friends) when we we’re 7 or 8 and yelled and shoved me around yelling sexual explicits and making fun of me and my body and refusing to let me leave. Even the friends parents wouldn’t believe me when I was eventually able to tell them and wouldn’t let me phone home to leave. Being the kid from the religious family also didn’t bring any less heat or source for their new ways to hurt me. 

  Making friends was always so hard and still is hard. Even when I played sports and trained heavily, I was still met with the same awful days as I experienced in grade school into high school. There is when things really made my mental health dive deep into hell. High school was and still is one of the most unbelievably lonely and and hard times I’ve gone through. No amount of exercise, training, art ( used to draw a lot), or much reduced, helped, or alleviated anything. Couldn’t against the amount of isolation and disregard my existence had there.
I have a few friends but my constant experience and feeling is I’m more of just a background friend. I feel more of an afterthought. With everyone. All my siblings are older and married, some with kids, even my twin sister is married. All of them have really not taken much interest in my life. Not that my life really has much going on to talk about.

  Sitting on my bed this morning getting out to go do work I just sat there like the many times I have before and just not know what to do with the day. So it can just be done. So I can just be alone and away. I hurt and hurt and hurt all the time. There is almost never a moment when I can just not be in pain or losing myself inside my head. I fantasize in so much anger and violence, I want connections so I can feel normal, but the realities case just says no. The constant anxiety and depression, impending doom, the anger, the boredom, the loneliness, the emptiness, no matter what I’ve tried over the years, if I try to put good into it, with something to try and help me it just brings nothing to me all while feeling so much care and concern for people and a world that i just simply don’t believe would do the same for me. I saw someone post here about the first 30 seconds of waking up to be the only time of a sense of calm before the anxiety sets back in. I don’t even get that anymore. 

All I feel is cold .. numb.. and apathetic. I am simply just not functioning anymore. I don’t know how to believe others feel what I’m feeling. I really don’t have anyone to talk to. My constant survival mode is working slower and slower and the point of it all has left me long, long ago. I simply just hurt all the time."
1257,How do I hold on for another year?,"I recently learned that I need to be at least one year older to be able to seek counseling or therapy without interference from my parents where I live.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can make it through the next few months?"
1258,I have an emotionally draining relationship with my dad,"
My relationship with my dad is emotionally draining.  I don’t know how, but I try my best to look out for him and tell him how much I care for him.  I understand he’s had a terrible childhood and that he tries to be a good person, however the shit he does sometimes really gets to me and my sister.  For example, my childhood has made become a very physiological scarred individual.  I have so many memories of my dad degrading my self-worth and yelling because I can’t answer his questions - these types of questions would best be described as rhetorical - where he had already decided to the answer. A few hours ago, my sister was the victim of my dad’s belligerence.  He was drunk and came into my sister’s room to talk to her. The topic pertained to her not sending out a card saying thanks to her grandma for the gifts she received. This was an interrogation, he said as much. I was there trying to support my sister while also trying to limit the hostility from my dad.  It didn’t work. He kept demanding for an explanation while also denying ever attempt my sister made to explain herself saying things like “don’t you dare say distract. Distract means it’s somebody else’s fault”. He pushed her to tears and even then he barely stopped. He later came into my room to ask if he did anything wrong.  Me being insane and believing I could actually explain, I talked about how his questioning was an interrogation with a sense of hostility rather than an earnest attempt to understand.  He told me I was bullshit and that I would never make a good lawyer with flimsy reasoning.  Tonight, he struck a nerve again somehow. It made me think badly and I considered both self-reflection and the opposite.  I’ve known and felt this in my entire being for the good portion of my life, however, it hasn’t been until tonight that I’ve had the ability to put this into words.  This is it for now.  If you have any thoughts or advice, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for reading my tangent."

But I’ve genuinely haven’t had any interest in anything since I was 12. I know that I want to put myself in a community to be normal but I don’t relate with most things people talk about. I never attach myself to anything and always give up on everything. I don’t see my future going anywhere and find myself a disappointment everyday. Ofc I have good days where I can laugh but I spiral down right after and find myself not taking showers for weeks and binge eating and losing everyone. Later regaining the friendship.

I'm 54, AS degree, veteran, married and feeling very much like a failure. I've let my skills slip and my self esteem is in the toilet.   I'm not suicidal,  I do have a lot to be grateful for but I feel like I'm on the ropes. I don't feel like I'm good at anything at this point. 

My marriage is good, but I'm sitting down with my wife tonight to talk to her about this.  I hate to share this with her.  I know she carries the stress, too. No win situation. I'm not drinking,  no drugs. I feel like I have to reinvent myself as an adult.  Thank you for letting me vent."
1262,"Question, uninsured seeking answers or insight. Anything helps","TW// death, anxiety, paranoia 
For the last 4 years I’ve been plagued with a constant fear I’m going to die. A scenario plays out in my head and it becomes so real that I’m convinced in that moment it’s my truth. Last night for example I was convinced I was going to die from carbon monoxide poisoning (though we have carbon monoxide detectors). I played through my last day/last interactions and how I didn’t pay enough attention to my boyfriend and I didn’t hug him enough because I was preoccupied with school and work. I thought about how my last interaction with my Mabear was her saying she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. I thought about how I didn’t say enough thank yous, I love yous, and I guess accomplish what I want to accomplish. 
There are nights I can’t sleep because the thought of sleeping is scary to me. 
Yesterday was also a REALLY good day, my grandma called and said she’d help me pay for my school, I finished my financial aid application, was able to get things done I needed. It’s always unexpected, this happens maybe 2-9 times a month. Is this maybe a combination of severe anxiety and intrusive thoughts? I currently am uninsured and can’t afford an actual diagnosis so I’m reaching out in hopes someone knows something or can maybe provide insight on their own experience. 
Thank you in advance, have a beautiful day! 
P.S. sorry if this is a mess, running on little sleep and still am shaken up"
1263,Can not get/stay hard with girlfriend (anxiety illness),"Me [20] have been dating my girlfriend [18] for about 2 months. I have never been attracted both physically and emotionally to another person before. 

As a disclosure, I have had social anxiety as well as regular anxiety for about 6 years now but I have noticed that it has been at its worst the last year or so (possibly because of COVID but not too sure).

About a month ago we tried to have sex for the first time but as I went to put on a condom I lost the erection. She has been very supportive and we tried again today, thinking today was the day because I feel much more comfortable with her than I did a month ago. 

As we were getting to it I could not get an erection because I was so nervous and overthinking that I wasn’t going to be able to perform again. After that I wound up apologizing and almost cried because I felt so defeated and disappointed in myself. 

I am very healthy, I workout 6 times a week and eat very healthy so I know it has nothing to do with my body, especially since I am still able to masturbate and achieve an erection. 

My question is: what should I do? I have no idea, my friend (who has the same mental issues as me) had the same issue with his girlfriend and he said it took a few tries until it finally happened. I have considered going on medication for my anxiety but I fear pills like that and the side effects that come with them. 

Any advice is much appreciated!"

1271,I feel guilty for how I’m feeling towards my past trauma (TRIGGER WARNING),"TW: abuse, alcoholism, suicidal thoughts, self harm

Since as long as I can remember to around 12-13 my dad abused alcohol and took a lot of his anger issues out on my mom, both physically, and mentally, I wasn’t really physically abused but I was mentally and emotionally abused with the fights, the screams, the threats, the guilt tripping, the fear that my mom would die by my dads hand any day, having to handle the slurs being thrown my way, having to scream at my dad to stop, the only compassion I got was from my mom after the fights, my dad has never (as far as I can remember) truly shown me any affection, now I crave affection and despise it at the same time, I self harm to cope, I have horrible anger issues, my emotions change randomly and daily, and I’m suicidal, my mom told me that everyone has their own trauma and that I got lucky with what I went through compared to others, then she compared her childhood to mine and said that if that’s the worst thing to happen in my life then I’m lucky, and I know people have it worse, and that I am lucky if that’s all I have to go through, but it still fucks my mind up so much even after my parents stopped abusing alcohol and fighting and I feel really guilty because what I dealt with as a child isn’t as bad as others yet I go through all this mental stuff now, I feel like I’m being dramatic over what happened and could’ve easily avoided this mental pain I’m going through right now if I just tried"

1273,I Don't Know How to Reach Out...,"Hello everyone...

I've suffered from really bad anxiety since I was a little girl. Coming from a Mexican household, it was kind of over-looked? Like my parents care for me, but I think they'd just brush it off as a tantrum... or like a one time occurrence. They got me a therapist in elementary school, but it was a group and at school one (so didn't really help).

It's recently become much more than I can handle because of college. Financial stress, class stress, homework stress, job stress, and so much more is making it unbearable. I've kept my anxiety attacks (and depression) to myself and I've never told my parents; in fear of being a burden or causing them to spend money on me that I feel wouldn't be necessary/help me in any way. 

How do I ask my parents for anxiety medication... I've never reached out to them about my mental health and I'm scared and clueless. But I want to get better so badly. I want to be able to hang out with friends, live my life, and be able to do things with out having multiple anxiety attacks before. I chose a college away from home because I want to be independent and rely less on those around me. But my anxiety is weighing me down so much. It's hard to do anything these days. 

Does anyone have any advice? Or maybe alternatives to anxiety medication that could be less expensive?"
1274,I have a new and really bad anxiety problem. Advice?,"For some reason I have been experiencing very heightened physical anxiety symptoms in the last couple months. It was very bad at first with prolonged and continuous symptoms like intense/fast heartbeat, a pit in the stomach, adrenaline, and chest pain. Then it went away for a few weeks. Now it has resurfaced for the last three days, minus the chest pain. I just scheduled a psychiatrist appointment that will be in two weeks but I honestly don’t know if medication can help. This problem is really beginning to bother me and affect my daily life and quality of life. Please help!!

Edit: There’s no racing thoughts or anything contributing. It’s just, there."
1275,I feel like I don't have any life goals,"For a few months now, whenever I think about what I want to do with my life, I can't come up with any answer.

I'm currently in my last year of MSc in video game development, but I'm not even sure I want to work in that field anymore. Or any field for that matter.

I used to love writing, but not so much anymore either.

It's not that I have dreams that I think are out of my reach, it's just that I don't have any. There's really nothing I can see myself doing daily for the rest of my life. There's not even anything I can see myself doing for the next few years.

I used to suffer from depression, but even back then I had hopes and dreams for what life could offer. Now I don't feel as bad as I did then, I don't feel suicidal, but I do feel quite empty.

I guess I should see a therapist to talk about it, but I can't bring myself to do that just yet."

1278,MEDS yes/no?,"  

Hey, first time poster here, and it’s a little bit scary. I guess I am having what can best be described as an existential crisis, and wanted to hear what some people have to say about Meds? 

Tldr; do you take meds, was it the best/worst decision/made no difference?

I am having a terrible time at my job, I am a foreigner where I live and am quite alienated by language at work (I have tried with the locals, trust me). I work in research and the project is just not working as it should, so there is an element of failure there. I guess when everything was fine (with the world) I didn’t realise how isolated I was, but now that all other social aspects of life have diminished, I think everything negative is just amplified.

I have always been focused on career and work, never really had a relationship, but I used to make friends really easily. As the years have gone by, my social anxiety has just gotten worse and worse, and I just find people harder and harder to be around. Sometimes I get the feeling that now I am just ruined beyond repair. It is also really affecting my work, I can’t concentrate, or even keep a train of thought for more than 5 minutes. I sit in meetings and I have no Idea what people are talking about, and I just feel like I’m stupid. I don’t want to be depressed, but I also don’t feel like I have the strength to make things better for myself. To be quite honest, the best way I can describe how I feel, is I want to lay on a cloud, and float up into the sky forever. I guess the scariest truth is, I just can’t imagine my future anymore.

Every day I leave work, and I try my hardest to hold in my tears until I get home.

I have tried to get help here, Therapy is complicated, I have to undertake it in my second, and not so fluent, language, and also I have been on a waiting list for months to get into a practice, but its forever extended. And I just want to add, I use exercise like an endorphin junkie, min 4 times a week, sometimes it makes me feel good and sometimes I cry while I’m jogging down the street. It’s not great.

Anyway, the doctor offered me medication, I don’t know if it is the stigma, or the fact that this is really then accepting that I am now officially depressed, but I said no. But as the waiting list continually grows, and things are only getting worse in my head, I am thinking about it."
1279,Free online therapy in the UK?,Hello I was wondering does anyone in the UK know where I can be matched with a therapist online to begin counselling for free at all? My local counsellors is only offering telephone consultations and I really can’t speak on the phone.
1280,Coping mechanisms for severe needle anxiety?,"Hi friends! 
I’m getting round two of the covid vaccine tomorrow afternoon and I nearly always panic when walking into appointments like this. I nearly always pass out when I get needle work done and I’d love to find a way to cope with this anxiety. TIA for any tips/tricks you might have."
1281,I don't know what to do,"I've lost all my friends, I'm slowly losing my gf because she has an eating disorder and she wants space. I thought I would spend the rest of my life with her. I feel so alone and it's unbearable. I feel like hurting myself just to numb this feeling. Nothing excites and I only want my relationship like it used to be. Does anybody have advice? I feel really shitty"
1282,Why do I feel sad when I remember my past memories whether happy or sad.,"I been noticing something very strange as early as I was about 10 years old. Currently, I'm 24. Every time my past memories flash back, whether voluntarily or instinctively, I suddenly feel severely depressed and the sooner I block my past memories, the sooner I snap out of this depression. 

While I do not remember myself having any life changing traumatic events in the past, however, one thing I would like to mention is the school environment where I had my education. It was the most scarry place where you would get beaten with anything in the teacher's hand. But still, why good memories too, give me a severe depression?

Also, Sometimes, when I see landscape wallpapers, I also get lost in thoughts and start to feel severe depression.

I asked couple of my friends if they feel the same and they said no. So I'm confused like is it only with me? What is it actually and what should I do?"
1283,What I want changes everyday,"I started to notice my obssesive need to become someone else and I have clearly lost myself in it. Every other day I would be like 'I live nature, I want to live in a cottage with animals. Later on I would be like 'I hate everyone I want to tattoo my whole body and become a somewhat alien' This is not only looks or mindset. I started seeing that I change the accent? For my so called 'personas' and it has gotten to a point where I feel the need to live all of those characters at once. 

It's really frustrating because I can't really do what I want to do cause Simply I don't know anymore what I actually want."
1284,"Is this what ""mommy issues"" cause?","Okay... so... I lost my mother in late 2018 and ever since then I was really dependent on how girls view me. Not even in the way that I want them to fall in love with me, but I just really care about them not hating me or stuff like that. 

I heard that when someone (mostly girls tho) have ""daddy issues"", they tend to be very sensitive, when they for example feel like their bf  texted them ""ok"" in an agressive manner or things similar to that and then they make sure everything is fine and that the guy is not mad etc. 

Bcs this is pretty much exactly what is happening to me. Whenever I feel like I said something wrong to a girl I always apologise 4000000 times and make sure that she is fine, or that I did not hurt her or anything like that. 

So basically I am just curious if what I am experiencing is caused by my Mom being dead, or if it's something else.

PS 1: I know this post is chaotic asf and I am sorry, but chaotic is pretty much how I have been feeling for the past few weeks
PS 2: I am naturally a more dominant person, rather than a sub (wanted to put that here, in case that matters)"
1285,Hereditary Bipolar?,"My mum has Bipolar Disorder and was a nightmare to be around she would constantly drag me. Anyway I don’t talk to her now it’s very rare we message.

I was getting what I think were panic/anxiety attacks when I was speaking to/living with my mother because of the chaotic life she was leading. 
I’m also a university student in my third year so that is seriously stressing me out. Though I deal with stress particularly well as I’ve been my mothers main support for about 9 years I guess I’ve grown with the stress but recently it’s all peaked. It is now calm again as I’ve made decisions that better my mental health and as I’ve said stopped talking to her.

The past week or so I feel like anxiety has come back, I’m getting what feel like anxiety attacks though I wouldn’t know because I don’t know if it’s anxiety??! Im also getting intrusive thoughts and nightmares that really stress me out even though I thought I’d come to terms with what the intrusive thoughts are about.

I’m worried about going to the doctor because I think they’ll tell me I’m making it up? And if they did believe me then I’d feel like I was taking medication for something I’d made up?? 

The back story on my mother is I’m also worried if I have anxiety that I’ll start becoming my mother and I try really hard to not be her and have her toxic ways. In a way it’s easy as the behaviour has repulsed me but in another way there are traits I have from living with her for 21 years; basically I’m scared to have anxiety because what if I have bipolar. 


Anyone I talk to about it laughs about it because they’re like mate, you have anxiety about having anxiety how does this not tell you you have anxiety. But yeah I still won’t accept it and go to the doctors because I’m scared of being my mother or scared of making it up. Ah idk what to do."
1286,i need help,"So im 14 and recently this second lockdown has fucked up my mental health. I just feel like shit. I think i have anxiety as i have these negative thoughts, that im useless and nothing compared to the 7 billion  other people in our world. I feel like i need some help but i feel like i can go through this on my own. Sometimes i think about death but i could never kill myself, i could never do that to my family or the boys. Idk what my part is in life. Sometimes i think about my GCSE's. They are a year away and im already panicking as they ultimately decide wether i live a good life or a shitty one. In my head i feel like the only way to get rid of my anxiety is by keeping my mind busy but I dont know. I know this has been quite long but i would realy appretiate some help."
1287,Has anyone experienced this before?,"This used to happen more when I was younger, but I remember often sitting around the table with my family (parents and brother) and suddenly feeling like they were complete strangers. When I would feel this, I couldn't even focus on what they were talking about like it almost felt like I was completely detached from them and the conversation if that makes sense. I would obviously snap out of it at some point, but now that I am older I realize that that was kind of weird. Has anyone. else experienced this before? If so, what is it called (if it even has a name)?"
1288,"Trigger warning: suicide/mental instability, autism, cancer, covid-19","I don't know how to stop feeling the way I've felt for the last 7 years of my life.
I have been feeling like I'm going to lose my best friend, my mom, for such a long time. 7 years on, she's now waiting for an appointment to see an oncologist.
Due to the current situation in the UK with coronavirus, the NHS is neglecting cancer patients and other people with less chance of survival, as well as people who are potentially waiting for a cancer diagnosis, like my mom, who has had many tumour-like growths appear on her skin. I have offered her my entire life savings for her to go private, but she has refused.
I know I'm not strong enough to go through life without her — I owe that to my autism, anxiety and depression.
She's saying she's not ready to go. I know that at the age of 51 she is far from ready to go anywhere, but I told her, no one gets to choose. The world is a cruel place, especially now with the timing she's had to get these growths appearing all over her and the doctors and nurses are literally having to choose who gets to live and who dies due to the sheer amount of people needing medical treatment because of covid. 
I am feeling so scared right now. For a long time I'd been considering taking my own life but I overheard her talking to my stepdad in the kitchen about my sister's boss, who recently needed time off work as his son ended up in hospital after attempting to kill himself. She said, if it was her in that situation and it was one of us, she would be too distraught to go into work too. I've seen the stress they put her through there as she often brings her work home with her; she never feels like she can take a break from it. It would devastate her to lose one of us — I realise now that I just can't do that to her.
But now I feel like I'm stuck. I'll never be ready or strong enough to go through the pain of losing the best friend I've had for 28 years of my life."
1289,What's Wrong With Me?,"Hi! I'm Mintakey, I am a 15-year-old female, and for the last few years, I've felt really...off. For some context, I'm very sensitive, and I've always been very education driven. (I'm a straight-A student) I didn't have a lot of friends growing up and I still only have one and even they can be kind of wishy-washy. I was always the ""odd one out"", and seeing how people are promoting being "" weird"" or ""quirky"" now is very frustrating because I got bullied for it and I still do.

Lately, I've been struggling to stay afloat in my studies, it feels like nothing is ever good enough for me. I have this horrible brain fog and I've been feeling irritable and tired all the time. On top of that, I've been reminiscing about all the ""dumb"" things I used to do. My Dad says I'm just being lazy and I'm turning into the ""average black female"" and I'll get pregnant in my senior year of high school if I don't dedicate myself to my school work. I have these horrible thoughts of worthlessness, it's gotten to the point where I'm scared of talking to people in fear of making myself look even dumber.

Everything has gotten harder for me. Making friends, talking to anyone, controlling my anger, passing my tests, it's all too much. I don't know what's happening... I have this horrible feeling in my chest and stomach, and I can't control my tears sometimes. What's happening?"
1290,"KI have an awful memory, but only when it comes to the important stuff. Any resources I should look into?"," I know Reddit or any place online isn't the best place to ask about medical/mental health advice, but I dont really know where to start looking. First, let me explain my situation. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar II about 2.5 years ago, but for as long as I can remember (hah) I've been struggling with memory issues, but only when it comes to important stuff. 

For instance, I can probably tell you every single mainline Mario game Nintendo has ever released, every book Stephen King has ever written or close to every one, that the largest trade route was The Silk Road and that part of the reason it shut down was because the Ottoman Empire started to tax parts of it all off the top of my head. Things like that.

I cannot tell you, however, what I had for lunch yesterday, when my next therapy appointment is. If we started an argument, chances are I'll forget what we were arguing about 10 minutes into the argument. I couldn't even remember my older brother's birthday for roughly 15 years of my life. I had to be reminded every year. Chances are if we had an important conversation about stuff I absolutely needed to remember, I'll remember that it happened but not what it was about. Stuff like that.

Is there any resources I should look into? Or is this just more normal than I think it is and I'm overthinking it? Thanks in advance"
1291,how do i get help for my friend?,"When i started at a new school, i got a new friend. She became my best friend for the entire year. But then she graduated and i had two more years left before i graduated. So i switched schools because she was my only friend and i missed my old friend that went to another school. Now, we barely talk. But she sent me a snap about 10 minutes ago. She was crying. i know she struggles because she lives in a foster home. But the foster home is okay. She’s not being treated unfair and stuff. Anyways, she was crying. So i asked her why. She said that she had problems with eating and haven’t eaten anything today. She also said that she had a hard time and all her thoughts was a mess and that she was exhausted and didn’t know where to place all of her thoughts. I talked with her for a while and said that she needed someone to talk to. Not her friends, but an adult or something. I gave her a lot of tips on where she could talk with someone. The counseling in her school, school nurse, mental health help in our town and how to reach out to them and stuff. But she don’t want to talk with them and i’ve explained her how it could develop to the worse. I really want her to reach out to someone, but how do i make her do that? i know it can be hard to open up but i also know what will happen if she don’t. So how do i make her reach out to someone?"
1292,One of my brothers finally cut ties with our dad and I'm so happy for him.,"My dad abused all 6 of his kids to some extent and emotionally, psychologically and financially abused my mother while also being a serial adulterer. I grew up and moved out but somehow always felt intoxicated by him. I worshipped him. But he emotionally manipulated me and was always gaslighting me. His current wife is a clear case of a narcissistic bitch and she also joined in his crusade to harm me mentally. She constantly played the victim whenever she could. I never even lived with her and she still managed to turn my dad against me. Or so I thought. I always assumed my dad was just being played by her. But she and he were working in cahoots. This is not delusional. He would play tug of war with my heart. Summer of 2020 during the BLM protests that I involved myself in, she attacked me on Facebook. After a long conversation where I tried to keep my cool, she decided to cause problems.  Dad took her side and once again after ""writing me off"" several times since I was 18, I decided to pull the rug this time. I blocked him, his bitch wife and deleted all social media accounts. I am on reddit but they are too old school to be on here. Anyway I knew my brothers all had a fantastic relationship with him or at least they seemed to still be won over by that jackass. Recently my brother called me and told me that he is done with our dad. He mentioned all the reasons I am done with him as reasons HE is done. My dad tried to turn my little brother into him. We still have a few other siblings who have a semi working relationship with the asshole.  But for even one other person besides me to see through my dad's ugly is just so empowering and proves to ME that I wasn't imagining it. I wasn't just making excuses to dislike him. I'm done. If I get invited to the funeral nobody will like the petty speech I have planned for that asshole. I just won't go but I did create a speech for my own comfort about why I don't care about him anymore. According to my little brother our other brother has said it for years but it fell on deaf ears. The thought of that narcissistic ass and his match made in heaven narcissistic wife losing everything is such sweet validation. And my brother is in therapy and coincidentally I am also in therapy as of last week. My brother said he finally started crying after years of my dad's oppressive bs. He always told us crying is for saps and pussies. He always told us how stupid our interests are. He didn't even know me. He didn't care about what I liked  Just paraded me around because I was his daughter. Then when his shiny new prize, mistress and second wife gave him a step daughter he threw all of his kids under the bus because she is compliant and a daddy's girl. So he threw us away. I'm glad to see the manipulative turd alienate himself from his own kids. I'm glad my brothers are seeing what I've seen and suffered for years. I was gaslighted so badly. He used them all to hurt me and now they are all slowly seeing him for what he is. My little brother that had the breakthrough recently and wrote that ridiculous man off, he learned to cry, actually cry  and I'm proud of him. If you've never been told your emotions are stupid, you can't understand the release of an adult cry.

 I hope one day my other brothers see it too. I had a lot of siblings so time will tell. Some people always love their abusers and tough it out for a crumb of love. So no telling. But 3/6 ain't shabby."

For a few years now I've been feeling depressed, lonely and anxious (I'm from Europe so the school system is a bit different, just so u don't get confused) for 8 straight years in elementary I've been bullied and I've been dealing with parents that expect WAY too much from me, as the highschool started i got pretty bad grades (40 Fs yeah i jnow i suck at studying) but at the end i managed to pass with a B overall score, while i was having extra classes my dad was beating me and telling me that I'll never pass, that I'll be a loser in life because i never study, a day before the final test he told me that he'll hang himself in front of me if I don't pass, 2nd year came, got maybe a handful of bad grades, but mostly very good ones but my parents still expect too much from me , my dad disrespects my passions and hobbies , I'm always feeling anxious when talking to him or even being around him, a lot of times he'd come home drunk and pissed off at everyone , it has come to the point where i don't even consider him my dad anymore. I started feeling suicidal a few years ago, somehow managed to come over them and move on with my life , but for the past few months I've been falling deeper and deeper into depression which brought suicidal thoughts from time to time, I've always been able to cover up my emotions and always tried to be a cheerful gux around my friends but after some time i feel like my body got tired of it , i just faze out and think about nothing y people started noticing and now I even started considering drugs to juat take the pain away , i know that's a bad thing to consider but idk what to do anymore, i just want a hug damnit I never wanted to be like this , crying every night so my family doesn't hear me , being desperate for at least some sympathy and love . Sorry if this is too long.. i just needed to vent"
1295,Sigh*,O well.
1296,I want to jump to my death already 😞why can’t I do it if other people could. The pain is unbearable,"I’m tired of people telling me not to do it. Loved ones will move on. Everyone has to die. No one understands how much pain I’m in and I’ll finally be in peace. Nothing helps. I’ve been like this for a year. The guilt of hurting loved ones kills me but I can’t be here anymore for them.

I’m so exhausted"
1297,Why do I lose focus and get excited?,"This is pretty hard to explain, but in certain settings (such as school), I'll start becoming unfocused from my schoolwork.  That wouldn't be as weird for me if it was just that, but I've just realized how my behavior started changing while I was bored.  I would start playing with things around me, hugging my laptop, looking around the room, and would get easily amused by almost anything.  I had to start carrying around a fidget spinner to keep myself from completely not listening. This isn't how I usually act, do you know what this might be?"
1298,Poverty and mental illness will kill me,"I've been poor and mentally ill my whole life. I've had ptsd, depression, and severe anxiety since my earliest memories thanks to a horrifically abusive parent. I've had terrible luck (I call it a curse) and every so often a new traumatic terrible thing happens, without getting too detailed a therapist basically told me I have ptsd from like 4 separate events and c-ptsd from childhood. I don't function the way I see other people function and I feel immense guilt and shame. 

I finally got a job I love but they won't make accomodations so it's either stand all day (you'd be surprised how difficult this can be) or nothing, and I've been chosing to take obscene amounts of ibuprofen and commit to working through the pain. Then I got covid and even after recovering I'm so tired I can't imagine going back yet. I'm terrified of falling behind again and losing what little we have. My family is chronically homeless because I just can't seem to hold my shit together. I historically can't hold a job because of my depression and chronic illness, I'm underqualified for a desk job so I wreck my body for a few months at a time and always inevitably have to quit when I can't take anymore. I've been denied disability twice and don't have the energy to fight anymore. I tried going back to school to get qualifications and it was the happiest I've ever been but then coronavirus hit and my brain just can't do online classes, I was tanking my grades so I dropped out when I was given the option to without harming my transcripts. 

I can't keep a therapist because we have to move around so much. I checked myself in for help at the start of 2020 and was prescribed meds that made me have awful side effects and referred me to an outpatient clinic that basically did am eval and said my depression is too severe for their services and sent me on my way, no advice given on how to get off the seizure meds or anti depressants I'd been put on in the hospital with the promise of continued care, so I just stopped taking them. I haven't seen anyone since. I can't find meds that help any of my symptoms at all, and I've tried a lot. I feel like a worthless piece of garbage all the time. I dissociate and feel like I've lived entire years that are just hazy days passing by sequentially, with nothing happening. No memories or joy outside of the little bubble I have with my kids but I often feel like I'm letting them down too. I blink and a month has gone by and I've barely accomplished anything, I don't know how normal productive people have the energy to do what they do. I just want to be normal, I want to provide for my family, I want to be clean. I want stop feeling like I'm drowning when I check my emails because all my bills are past due and I don't know when I'll get paid again.

I don't know what to do to make me work. I don't usually feed in to these woe is me feelings, I try to stay positive and work as hard as I can, but I'm only in my late 20s and feel so empty and exhausted I can't see myself making it through the rest of a lifetime."

1301,I feel like my muscles are non existent. Has anyone experienced this and do you have any advice?,"Hi all. I’m a 23 year old female and for the past year and a half, I’ve been in deep depression. I have been ignoring it all and carrying on like normal. I slipped into a few bad habits like my sleeping pattern, which is non existent. I’ve also been skipping meals. Well what started off as skipping meals soon became not eating at all.

The pandemic has allowed me to work from my bed, as a result I didn’t get up. My problem is now, I’m at a point where I’ve done so much damage, I’m in pain when I use my muscles to do anything.
 
I’ve also noticed my body has been reduced to fat. Naturally I have a firm body and didn’t worry too much about exercising because I’m pretty active. I would go do yoga, cycle and swim. I also used to walk whenever I could. Now my body is very soft, I can feel fat with hardly any muscle.

I think because the absence of my muscles makes it hard to move properly (it’s weird to explain). When I do attempt to move properly I’m in a lot of pain and my body aches. 

I started with trying to wean myself back into eating but I keep throwing up. All I do is drink sugary drinks, tea and water so I can at least function. Sometimes I might eat some fruit but that’s about it.

Since eating wasn’t working, I tried doing a light workout today and had to stop because I couldn’t lift my legs at all. My whole body was trembling. I can’t sit up straight so I have to lay down constantly. My biceps hurt so much and I’m only noticing now that I’ve attempted to use them."
1302,Have so much unbearable guilt. PLEASE help me make it go away. I just want it to go away 😭I want what I want and I can’t with this guilt,How to make the guilt go away when you know you’re going to hurt loved ones? Going to die and it is my time. I can’t handle this guilt.
1303,no motive,"i don't know is this the right place to write this but i have no body else to talk to about this. i am now a dental student in internship year also loved gaming. but now i feel i don't wanna do anything at all i don't wanna play or study or improve myself or get anything done i'm just laying there. i can't feel any motive to do anything, not passionate about anything anymore i'm just passing time. nothing enjoys me at all. i don't know what to do every one are getting with their lives and i'm just standing still. i don't know what to do anymore. thank you"
1304,"I don't know what it is, could you help?","I have been noticing something wrong with me lately and I'd like to ask you what it could be because I honestly don't know. I'll try to describe it, maybe someone who has some more experience could tell me what it is.

Every time I do something where I feel even moderately good/do something amongst others like for example joking with my classmates during online class, I end up feeling completely empty afterwards, sometimes this feeling even comes close to being devastated. Unfortunately, I can't really go into myself and see why it is like this, but a possible reason could be that I think I ""wasted"" my good words or things I directly or indirectly said (about myself). The reason why I think so is because I for example feel like this when I send a picture I really like to someone or tell them something I'm more or less passionate about and they respond with ""ok"" or ""cool"" or ignore me. Honestly, ignoring is the worst thing, my biggest fear.

This feeling that follows is like a mix of ""It's ok, you learned that you just shouldn't show anything of yourself, people don't care"", frustration and regretting what I did.

For instance, I had this feeling for the first time when I first went to a dance class. This was one of the more extreme cases. It was kind of fun and I did something in front of the people, I still was very insecure and felt like I had to go home the whole time. But as I got home, I thought about how bad I was, especially in comparison to the other people there. This physical sadness as I call it (this feeling where you feel your worries under your eyeballs, I also don't really know) took over me and I didn't really feel/think about anything but at the same I indirectly thought I would never go out again and all that typical stuff. Then I started to cry and try to suppress this feeling.

I always blame it on my age since I'm in my teenage years, but now I'm kind of frightened that it will always stay a part of me. I'm sorry if you didn't really understand my weird vent, I don't think would've been able to. It's my first time talking about mental health on reddit/my mental health on the internet and I'm just not good at writing in general (and English I must add). Also, I don't really understand this, how am I supposed to explain it? Anyways, does anyone have anything? I'd appreciate it. :)"
1305,"I don't know who I am, please help.","Dear redditers,

This will probably be a story to long for you to read. I'll be frank with you, I have never experienced anything traumatic in my life, I have no origin story to my sadness, I have no reason to be depressed and I sure as hell can't keep people interested as I write this text. But I want advice. Let me tell you a little about myself so you know where I come from. I am a boy, 15 years old(almost 16, I say like a small child holding up their fingers) and I live in the Netherlands, a perfectly fine country. I've been watching TV, Netflix, films and anime since I was an infant. I've always admired any protagonist in any story and I have always had the desire to copy them, sometimes I wasn't even aware of it. This is pretty common around kids, but with me, it never faded. I have no identity, I have no personality, I only recently realized I am just a white piece of paper. I never really fitted in anyway, I am a person of colour, which is not a big problem in my country. But it does make you feel like an outsider and often that is the case, especially when you're young and in school. I skipped two years of school and people have high expectations of me but I have 0 attention span and motivation. Since I don't know who I am as a person I, of course, have no idea what I like and what I want to study and stuff. But anyway back to the story. I've been copying people since I was a small human. And this was serious copying, everything in my behavior changed, I bought similar clothing styles, got interested in similar stuff and was thinking like those protagonists. I hate myself. A few of the people I've copied are: Sherlock Holmes, Gregory house, kuroko from kuroko no basuke, killua from hxh, yugi from yugioh and about 300 more of these people. I've been doing this since I was a small child so I have no idea who I really am, I can't stop it, I do always notice it and I have no idea what my personality is like. I hate myself because I don't like the way I look, I don't like the fact that I can't be beautiful like the people is shows, that my emotions aren't as beautifully and clearly portrayed on my face and that my real face can't even convey most of those emotions the way I feel them. I just hate myself. I've cut myself, I've beaten myself, nothing special for this reddit page probably. I've also lied, a lot. It's like a chain around my heart and most of my lies I can't unravel anymore. I'm just stuck in this skintight container and I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't do anything except reusing my habits. I don't have a goal in life, I have no reason to get out of bed, I don't have real friends, I don't have a girlfriend(even though I long for one so so much). I don't have anything. The character I felt closest to in all of my life was kaneki ken from Tokyo ghoul. He's basically me, is what'd Im saying right now. Even though I don't know that for sure. I don't even have the attention span to read a book without having to reread every sentence. Sometimes I read entire chapters and I think to myself, wait what did I just read. Like I had read none of it, I would remember none of it anyway. I don't know whether I'm introverted or extraverted, I don't know if I like to be alone or not, if I'm a leader or not, if I'm passionate or not. I don't even know my gender, that's right. I don't. I have been thinking I was transgender since I was 12 years old. But I don't know. My feelings about this fluctuate all the time, the strength too. I can't go one way because I'll get pulled the other anyway. I'm all alone in life, thinking why am I wasting my life like this. I want memories, adventure, something I'm good at, activities I like, a job I want, just a goal to live for. But I have nothing. I am nothing. I don't know what to do. Every second I live in regret of what I could have been or maybe should be. There is nothing in my life I like. Absolutely nothing. I have tried out so many things, I listen to music all the time, yet I don't have the motivation to learn an instrument. I have watched tons of doctor shows and I think I like it and would be good at it, but I suck at studying. I get bored very easily and never really have fun. I want my life to be simpler. I want it to give me memories and stuff. I have been at the edge of suicide for a long time as well, but I don't see the point. I would call myself optimistic but I don't know what the future bears. I know everything is relative and change is always right around the corner, that's why I don't suicide. I don't even know why I'm telling u all this, I'm sorry to disappoint, there simply is no point to this story. I am the definition of a identity crisis. Please help me. Give me an identity. Help me find myself. I don't care just help me in any way possible. I get nauseated by the thought of sitting behind a TV or my phone basically unconscious, all turned off for another minute. I can't stand it anymore. I want to fucking live. One thing, I have a chronic unknown issue in my side, I get severe pain and attacks if I get stressed or something. Noone knows what it is, but It has given me a lot of fear. I want to get rid of that fear mostly.

Tldr: I have no identity and personality, I don't know my gender, personality, goal in life, etc. I can't stand it anymore. Someone help me find myself, please. Btw I do not have memory loss etc, I just suck at life.

Thank you for listening to me."
1306,Plz Help,"So for the past few days I’ve been getting this feeling of like my head is a balloon and being blown up, I’ve felt super disconnected from reality and it’s been causing me some head pains as well.

I tried playing video games too and at times got super out of it and ending up forgetting what I was doing and playing horribly as my coordination screwed up at times. It’s freaking me out and I’m too afraid to say anything to my parents as it’ll just be shrugged off as anxiety and I’ll get a lecture about how I should “get outside more”.

1310,"Seeking help from Ontario, Canada","I don't really know how to go about making this post, I've been putting it off for a while now and just got to a point where I told myself ""Eh, what's the worst that can happen right?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22-year-old semi-recent graduate (April 2020) and have been trying to navigate my way through life in "" \*\*\*The Real World\*\*\* "". I've always considered myself to not be mentally stable as I had a lot of trauma growing up as a kid with my family along with having a really pisspoor way of dealing with my own personal problems. I had always just been able to push those issues aside and take life one step at a time, but that's not really working anymore and I've found myself in a rut for the past few months without knowing how to get myself out.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory time; I studied Architectural Technology for 4 years and had a decent understanding of where I'd want to take my career in said field. I met some really good hearted and like-minded people along the way and even met someone who I consider to be one of (if not) my best friends. I've worked for some hospital facilities planning departments and even under the federal government through co-op's and did pretty well from what my bosses have told me and wrote in their letters of recommendation. After graduating I found a project coordination position in my home town with a well respected family-owned construction company. The people I worked with were lovely and treated me like family but the nature of the business was very stress-inducing, to say the least. Along with being the only person in my field working there excluding my boss (the rest were interior designers) as well as being extremely busy with people diverting their vacation fund to upgrading their house due to the pandemic, it wasn't really an optimal place for a new grad to work. Have you ever had that constant weight on your chest from anxiety and fear? That's basically what I was dealing with for the 4 months I was working there. Stress and doubt started to accrue on whether the I was capable of this position. When I actually managed to pull off impressive tasks, I wouldn't really get that value of gratification of being told ""Hey, you did a really good job on that project!"". Instead, my mind decided to focus on the negatives of what happened there (i.e. messing up a quote,). These negatives started out small in number but I just ended up having my attention focused on them, which in turn caused me to make more of them. Then the small mistakes turned into not so small mistakes. The not so small mistakes turned into, ""Woah what happened here"" mistakes. Eventually, it got to a point where my boss seemed to notice there was something wrong and pulled me aside to talk about it. After making a \*\*very\*\* big mistake, I was given two options on how to continue. Option one was to take things back and start fresh with the caveat of having a lot of work to do as they were insanely busy. Option two walk away from the position and focus on myself. It was clear that without me the company would be ""In a hole that I dug them in"" but he assured me that with or without me they'll get through it. I ended up taking option two and left. My boss was very professional about the whole situation and offered me some advice on how to move forward. Like I said, as much as I hated the nature of the work, I absolutely loved the people I worked with; I just think I didn't deal with the issues I was having at work until it was too late and it all ended up blowing up in my face when I should have dealt with it at the start.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now; it's been about four months since this all went down. At the start, I honestly felt a lot less stressed and decided to have a bit of a break from everything and just unwind. Better it happen during a pandemic where I get to use that as an excuse right? Thing is, I realized after a few days that I wasn't happy and I've been too occupied with life and what not to realize it. Nothing that used to bring me joy does it anymore, I preferred spending my free time during the night versus the day when I had time off and wanted to sleep and stay in my bedroom for as long as possible on weekends. Activities I used to enjoy like videogames, reading, sketching and piano just seemed like a chore. I get irritated very easily and my relationship with my family (mainly my mother and brother) has deteriorated to a point where it's hard to communicate with them anymore. I've felt this way for a very long time (around 2 years now) but never really questioned it because I was so busy with school and co-op. Now that I'm not working and not in school anymore, everything just hit me like a brick wall and I have no idea how to move forward. I went from being someone who was considered to be a natural-born leader who people could rely on to just some kid who can't help himself with his problems. To say I'm depressed about this entire situation is an understatement and the state of the world isn't helping my case one bit (Ontario just went into its second province-wide shutdown). I know that I'm not the only one going through a rough time at the moment and that people are able to get themselves out of these situations. I'm just wondering where do I go from here. I have no idea about to get myself help when it comes to mental health or the resources that are available to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I just felt like I really needed to get all of this off my chest and figured doing it anonymously was the best way to go about it. Thanks for reading and if you have any tips or similar experiences you want to talk about then by all means I'd love to hear them down below.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I pushed my problems away and had a catalyst event where everything just blew up in my face and I'm dealing with the negative repercussions of bottling everything up. Not happy and don't know how to make myself happy anymore. Trying to find help but have no idea how to go about it."
1311,"If you're in need of help, I'm here","Last summer of 2020 I was admitted to a mental health hospital where I was diagnosed with bi-polar manic with schizophrenia. I was always told that it was clinical depression and had to take Lexapro. Lexapro never worked for me, but without it I would bottom out fast. I'm on a new medication called Zyprexa and wow, it actually works. I had symptoms of mental health problems whenever I was 14. It took from then to now to say I've got it under control. I'm 22 now and my life has improved in every way possible. There is nothing wrong with seeking help, but to get the right help is hard at times. I'll be staying on top of my posts on here to talk to anyone who needs a little help."
1312,I know I made the right choice,"I'm sorry if I'm annoying. I don't have anyone who I can talk to that would give me any kind of response I would want to hear. Mainly because I don't know what I want to hear. I know that I ended things with my boyfriend for good reasons. On both parts. Me to him and him to me. We just weren't being positive to each other anymore. Neither one of us were progressing or achieving anything. Stale mode times 2. We became ugly towards each other and in a few instances put our hands on each other. I just miss him so fucking much and I cant stop thinking about him. It was a ""ugh what is he doing, I bet he's with his ex"" bitter thought. But now it's a I hope he's okay and alive considering we both had suicidal thoughts \[ another reason we don't need to be around each other. We need to get better\] his family hates me and I am strongly against the ex reaching out to the family after a break up. I am trying to respect him, and also me in the choice I made to end things. I just want the hurt of missing him to stop. How is time both too fast and too slow at the same time?"
1313,"Hello, please help me.","I can't really talk to strangers even if I want to. I am ok talking with my friends, so it probably isn't social anxiety, maybe I am wrong. But I have read that social anxiety is always feeling fear even though you are really close to that person. But that doesn't bother me so much, it is just when I want to like talk to a stranger that I see on the street or I want to speak up in class or talk to a girl I saw, I feel that my heart rate is really high and my chest hurts and I am really sweating and I am trying to convince myself to do it, but before I do, it's too late and I move on. Is there a way to feel less stressed without being sweaty and my chest hurting? It is really killing my social life. I can't even speak properly in class. For example once a teacher said that I have to do a presentation in front of the whole class. I wasn't scared of people judging or something like that. i was confident that the presenattion was good, but when I started talking it was a disaster, not that people thought of me something, it was just that I found it hard to breath and my chest is beating so fast. Also it happens when I read in front of people. For example I once read something to a friend and I didn't feel any chest pain or lack of breath, but when I tried to read something in front of the class, I started, it was okay and then ten seconds later my chest starts beating and I am having lack of breath, and I can't even control it and only after I read it, I have to wait about ten minutes before the pain goes away, Is there anyway I could be better at these stuff without feeling that pain? Thank you for reading this."
1314,Should i seek help for my mental health?,"OK ill try to keep this as brief as possible but I've been struggling lately and covid has put me off the idea of seeking help, because I know appointments etc will be heavily delayed. This is long sorry.

I dont know for sure what I 'have but I feel burnt out by my own thoughts and am struggling to function properly, though i think from the outside I seem fine. I experience quite sudden and severe pangs of anxiety, mainly at work, when I have to go speak to people I dont really know or take calls when someone else is in the room with me. It just drives the anxious side of my brain crazy and I have a really hard time doing these simple things which other people seem to do with ease. 

I think my social anxiety has gotten worse since I started working full time and I think its stopping me from getting to know people properly. I feel like i never really know what to say to anyone and I dread being caught in conversations with people I dont really know, even if id like to get to know them better. With lockdown, I've started to lose a sense of time and i sometimes feel disorientated, like ibe been at work for days on end and havent left. I've been waking up a lot in the night to check my alarm is on, which is new for me, and it's like my body or mind doesn't really know what time it is. Its quite disorientating and a bit scary. I know this is due to the lockdown and monotony of day to day life, but i haven't experienced this feeling of confusion before. My brain feels foggy and I find it really hard to concentrate.

Don't get me wrong, I do talk to people at work and with the ones I'm more used to, I find it quite easy to just talk freely. I dont think I lack inherent social skills but its the fear of being scrutinised and judged that makes it difficult for me to interact in group settings. I do much better around smaller groups of people and am most content when I'm just sat with one person at a time. Would this be classed as simple introversion or a sign of social phobia? Thankfully I'm not in a job where I have to be outgoing, but there will come a time when I have to be less 'shy' and the thought is terrifying. I have this fear other people know what I'm thinking and can somehow read my mind and will know im scared or anxious. Which equals weakness, and will make them think less of me. I hate the thought of someone being able to pick up on my discomfort and i just wish i could feel at ease. I feel like people get confused by my interactions because some days I'm pretty chatty and then withdrawn the next. Some days are better than others 

If anyone has read this, what do you think - social anxiety or something else? And should I seek treatment?"
1315,Think I have anhedonia,"Late last year since late September early October I have been feeling so numb and uninterested in everything, I have no drive or motivation; I do not see a point to doing anything. It is not laziness, more of a ""I can read, and I should read, but why bother? nothing comes of it"". Everything is so forced but I am not even inconvenienced by forcing myself to do things cause I simply don't care. I hope this makes some sort of sense, my effort is so low I don't even know if I make sense what I am experiencing. I just simply am existing at this point, I don't know how to fix this. If anyone has been in my shoes please explain what you did to get out of this mindset, thank you."
1316,What is going on with me?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey.

I would really like your opinion/thought on what happened to me.

something happened to me, and I really don't have a clue what it could have been.

so, about 10 days ago I was just playing a PC game, while I was talking to my friend

I was having a really good time, but then after maybe 1-2 hours of playing, I just got this feeling out of nowhere.

the first detail that happened to me was that I got this really weird feeling in my body, I have a really hard time explaining this feeling,

it's like I'm almost losing control of reality, but at the same time I know exactly what is happening, I could still play the game, (I probably did not focus at the game that good tho.)

and I still had a conversation with my buddy. But I felt REALLY sick, it was the worst feeling ever in my body, (not that I felt nauseous). At the same time I could almost hear a nasty voice inside my head, also got a lot of anxiety (i would say) Still had a conversation with my friend, about something in the game,

but that did not help me from having this feeling. I also got a bit sweaty on my neck. At some point, I actually thought I was about to lose control and go crazy

I guess I was scared that the feeling would not let go of me, which it did after 15-20 minutes.

I've been searching around on the internet, but the only thing I can find is ""panic attacks"" some symptoms fit in very well about what was happening, for example, Fear of loss of control, Sweating, Feeling of unreality or detachment, and Hot flashes.

but I really don't know if it was a panic attack/anxiety attack? This happened again like the next day, or the next day after that. But has not happened since then.

(other than that the exact same feeling in my body almost hit me again like yesterday, but disappeared after like 1 minute.)

But I can't stop thinking about what happened to me. And also I kind of recognize that feeling I got in my body because of that nasty feeling I'm very sure I've felt when I was a little kid about (10-12 years old) I'm 18 now."
1317,Sending letters to deal with pandemic mental health,"I was feeling really low this fall. The pandemic was taking a toll, and I tried to find a therapist that takes my insurance and couldn't get any to call me back. I decided to start listing all the people who make a difference in my life, from family members to co-workers to neighbors I don't know well but I observe them picking up trash or doing thoughtful things. Making the list was a huge boost to my spirts, especially when I thought about how many of them are still healthy and OK despite Covid.  


I then made cards to send to each person on the list, telling them what I liked about them and what I was grateful for. I tried to focus on their good qualities, and what I admire. That lifted my spirits even more! I realized what wealth I have in my life: people who have qualities and skills and histories and stories that are really special. Then I mailed the cards, and started getting responses. People told me how my card was the highlight of the year for them, or how my card made them cry. One friend told me she rereads it and repeats the words to herself when she is feeling down. Some people wrote really nice letters back about me. It was amazing. I can't believe how much this has helped. Its been several months now and my mindset is in just such a different place, even though things are still hard.

Perhaps this is simple advice that people already do, but if not, I recommend it."
1318,Is there someone I can text with today ?,"Just need someone to talk to atm... if there is someone, just slide in my dm‘s ...
Thank you"
1319,am i actually the victim or am i just playing victim? like can someone please actually answer,"hi. i’m a teenage girl and i have severe depression and OCD. i’ve been diagnosed with both. i have no motivation to get out of bed or do anything. it’s very hard to do simple tasks due to my mental health issues. i have middle eastern immigrant parents and where they come from, mental health is never spoken about or taken seriously. they basically don’t believe in mental health. my mom gets mad at me for never cleaning my room. we get into really bad arguments about how i’m “lazy and unproductive” when i’m actually just depressed. i hate how they don’t believe me. (Trigger warning) it sometimes gets to the point where i almost do something that i couldn’t take back... if you know what i mean. i get mad at her for not taking my mental health seriously and i kinda hold grudges because she never believes me when i say i’m depressed. i always feel like i’m playing the victim card. am i??"
1320,What do you do if you're sick of yourself?,"I'm sick of myself, but I don't know how to get rid of ""me""."
1321,what am i doing?,"sorry if the flair is wrong. i've never been in this sub before, i just kinda eyeballed it

hi, i'm ciel. i'm a 19 year old nb trans man, if those are relevant (i've seen them in a lot of others), and i think i need... some kind of help.

it's only been a year or two since i've realized that my mental health is... *really really bad.* i've sort of repressed it for years, because being ""quiet"" has always been what's kept me safest. repression doesn't really work anymore, so now i'm all kinds of messy. but i've also been taught no coping skills, and am bad at taking help. i'm even worse at giving it to myself.  
i can go into detail about what's up with me, but for now i'll just say ""fucked up;"" i've never been to a psychiatrist, and usually end up not explaining my situation well enough to anyone else but a couple close friends for them to understand. (but oversharing on the internet always ends up being better somehow. long story.) if we wanna get into simple stuff, i dissociate, gaslight myself constantly, and usually feel really, really, really sad. i also get intrusive thoughts of (sui cw) &gt;!suicide and self harm!&lt; almost constantly. i'm losing the ability to function because of how big and unmanageable these things have become.  
i know that there's things like mindfulness, and journaling, and changing my sleep schedule, but that all feels like it'd do so little. i feel like there's a bigger problem that needs to be dealt with before i can get to those, but i almost can't identify it.

i feel like there's too much for some strangers on the internet to pinpoint what would be best to help me, and i feel bad saying that i'm not sure what would either. but i don't really have anywhere else to go to ask... a *general audience,* i guess. my parents aren't supportive, and i think i'd get into more trouble than it's worth trying to ask for help, professional or not.

i guess this is a question of... what do i do? what can i do?  
thank you so much."

1323,I hate that im the bad guy,"Title says it all. I have been having this really strong urges to just end it all because i feel like the world would be better without me. I am the eldest of 5 kids. I am the only one who has graduated. My siblings are all still studying. My dad's a deadbeat but he's a kind guy. Problem is he values his friends above everything else. I once told him that his friend groped me and his response was that it was okay because i was flat chested and had nothing that could be groped. He said sorry after and tried to pass it off as a joke but i'll never forget it. He doesn't like violence as a form of punishment but he has slapped me once because i called him stupid for making my boyfriend stay out late despite us having classes tomorrow morning (they were friends before we started dating). I am the only one he has ever laid hands on. I forgave him for this after a long time but its still something ill never forget. My mom is our breadwinner. She works really hard for us which is why i felt bad when i realized how horrible her parenting was when it came to punishments. She was really violent. From hitting us to drowning us whenever we did anything bad. She basically raised us herself so deep down i understand how she could make mistakes but i hate how much her punishments normalized violence in us. When i graduated college, i started playing a bigger role when it came to our family's expenses. I would repeatedly tell my mom to save or to only buy what we need. She hates this and sometimes would be annoyed at me for reminding here again and again. I feel like a bad guy for doing this but i know we need it cause we have no savings and our budget's a mess. Im also the one that says no and talks to my siblings when it comes to going out or when they ask my mom to buy them things i know we can't afford. Playing the bad or strict one in the family has taken a toll on my mental health but i know someone has to do it. I am also in a 7 year relationship which is going good. He feels like a good friend to me. However i feel that the support is just a one way thing. I feel that when im weak the relationship crumbles as i cant rely on him. We also have this fights whenever we get drunk that escalates really quick. Although it happens rarely like maybe once a year it gets too big that its hard to forget. He's really scandalous (which triggers me as i have anxiety in public or things being shown in public). He also gets verbally aggressive. Its not like im a good person because when this fights happen and i get triggered i would hit him. I hate myself for doing this. We havent broken up as we would always promise to change this and we would be healthy for a while but then it happens again. I hate how toxic i am to everyone around me. I hate how many times i hear voices telling me how horrible i am and how i should just end it and i hate how i know they are right."
1324,Idk what to do,"Right now I feel like my only purpose is to make my loved ones happy, once I give them a comfortable life and they are financially stable for years and I know they are happy I’m going to tell them that I’m moving to another country and disappear but in reality after I accomplish the goal of giving them a comfortable life I wanna die, this life seems so fucked that dying seems like the only peace, I wish this wasn’t the case but the thought of that happening after I give my family and friends a good life in financial terms makes me feel good because I don’t want to be here anymore. I wish I would have another reason to keep living after that but I don’t"
1325,the last straw,"this is like, really bad. so bad. idk how this could even happen???? all my life the only thing holding me afloat and the only thing i was able to fall back on was my art. and now i dont even want to it anymore. ive been unmotivated before, sure, but this is a whole other low. fuck lmao. i know i couldnt do any job besides being an artist and now this is gona too? i cant even explain how i feel right now. just so fucking empty and worthless. in the whole 4 years that i have been self harm clean, i never wanted to relapse so bad. i feel like im spiraling rn."

1327,I'm not sure if I'm depressed or have a mental illness,[deleted]
1328,at what point should i consider going to the emergency room?,"i am struggling with a bad depressive episode and living alone. i have a history of one suicide attempt and many years of self harm. i have a therapist i see once weekly, i can't afford to see her more often. some nights my suicidal and self harms overwhelm me and i'm very terrified that i will succumb to it. right now i am not in crisis but i could be at any point. what i'm not sure about is when i should consider going to the emergency room. feels like if i just go and say ""i really want to hurt myself"" but haven't actually done anything, i'll probably get laughed out of the room. i dont want to waste their services but i dont want to die either.

1329,I'm having a mental breakdown,"I no longer have a therapist or am in IOP/PHP because of insurance. I cant go a day without talking to a therapist. Especially right now. I'm doing so poorly.

I need help. Life is hopeless."
1330,I'mhaving a really hard time right now,"Hi everyone. First post here.

I'm having a really hard time. I don't wanna live life really anymore. I try to glamorize my stress and anxiety and make it funny for other people but really on the inside I'm hurting really badly. I have trouble with thoughts of ending my life and hurting myself. I just got a new job and am moving across the country on the companies dime. A once in a lifetime chance really and I feel like I don't deserve it. I am scared to leave everything I know, but I am also looking forward to new beginnings away from all my trauma here. I get manic and spend a bunch of money that I don't have and that just stresses me out even more. I'm making an effort to get myself together but part of me thinks I can't do it, the other part thinks I don't deserve it. 

I am just reaching out for someone to help. This sounds like a pathetic cry for attention, I'm sorry I know I'm dumb. I just need some encouragement that things get better or that I'm not a giant mistake and waste of space."
1331,How do you guys cope with failure?,"Hi, I was wondering how you guys cope with failure. I realized that the only thoughts I have about failure is that death is preferable to it and I would rather end my life than fail. These thoughts are the most prevalent when its related to things like school (if I fail a class/big test then I get very suicidal), and work (not getting a job soon enough). I feel like if I fail then death seems like a preferable alternative to having to deal with my parents, and the consequences of the failure, however I know this is not the best way to deal with failure, so I figured I'd ask for ideas here. 

I don't know if this helps you with the answer you give, but I am a high school junior (16).

Thanks for any advice you are able to give! :)"
1332,"Wales, UK - Seeking diagnosis for BPD","Hi there, I (20, M) need advice on services I can access in the UK to pursue a medical diagnosis of BPD. I have done a huge ton of research, as well as spoken to many other people with diagnosed BPD, who have all agreed that I likely have it. I tick every single box in the criteria. It is ruining my life and making me miserable. However, the NHS directly turned me down when I asked if I could be referred to a psychiatrist for a diagnosis, telling me that there was ""no point"" because the process is long and arduous and there aren't many treatments out there for it. I don't care about that. What I care about is putting a solid name to the thing that is making my life a living hell. 

The NHS has dumped me onto a mindfulness zoom course, and I think I may be on a long waiting list to see someone, but knowing the NHS it'll be literal years before I get anywhere. I want to know if anyone knows other ways for me to pursue an official diagnosis in the UK. I am willing to go private."
1333,my parents aren’t taking me seriously and they’re just making it worse (a mixture of need support and venting btw),"(this might me a bit long sorry) ok so about three weeks ago i finally started talking to my mum and i thought well now i would be able to see a councillor and that it would start getting better. oh how i was wrong. 

i have now started having panic attacks, and i’m like actually too scared to go to some of my lessons now in case i get asked something. so now instead of probably having depression we now have a sprinkling of anxiety which is so fun. 

and now my parents have decided that even after i told them that quite a few of my teachers suggested that i see a councillor that they would take it into their own hands. (btw i live in the uk so counselling is free so it’s not about money). my dad came and spoke to me today acting like he’s some kind of therapist (trust he is nothing like a therapist). my dad’s advice was ... wait for it ... just don’t feel like that!!????? i mean thank you for the amazing advice so helpful. 

when i pointed out that that advice wasn’t too great he then got angry at me and called me selfish and that i never think about other people and only think about myself. (i think my lack of thinking about myself is probably one of the reasons for this whole situation because i’ve never spoken to anyone about myself and am more of a listener than a talker because i don’t like being a burden). like another big thing of mine is just feeling incredibly guilty anyway for feeling like this so my dad says no that really didn’t help. 

i then complained to my mum and she was just as bad, telling me that i just needed to breath. like i understand where she’s coming from but when i’m hyperventilating, chocking, feeling like i’m watching myself etc. it’s quite hard to ‘just breath’. also my mum doesn’t take my panic attacks seriously. when emailing one of my teachers she said i had a ‘weepy wobble’ and told me not to use the word panic attack but say i was feeling ‘really strange’. 

idk what to do anymore, i’ve tried speaking to them and they’ve done absolutely nothing. i’ve even said that it’s been suggested that i see a councillor so can i and they’re just like nahhh it’s not serious enough. i thought after emailing my mum about how my mental health has been rapidly declining that they may take it seriously. 

i just want someone to take me seriously because i can’t keep going on like this."
1334,I need help with understanding why i can't study like before.,"Why can't I remember things I study? Im a university student my average for the first 2 years was 9/10 I used to study 10 hours every day with full concentration, my brain absorbed information like a sponge. Everything i studied used to repeat in my brain like a song constantly even when i was asleep.(it was like an obsession) But at the end of the second year i started taking antidepressants, anxiety medication and mood stabilizers that is where everything went to hell. I told my doctor that i can't study and he just kept giving me more medicine. Its been 2 years i stopped taking my medication (I decided that on my own) but I still can't focus its gotten so bad im considering dropping out. Im still depressed and this situation is making it unbearable for me i feel like a failure. I don't know if the reason i can't study is because medication messed me up or because of something else. 
Did anyone exspiriance anything similar i really need help. 
( Im sorry for the long post but there are a lot more details, if anyone responds i will elaborate even more) 
Thank you !!!!"

1336,Graphic videos,"WARNING: Mention of really bad violence and gore (does this need to be spoiler tagged too? I'm not showing anything but I'd be okay with adding it, or even removing some details or the post itself since these are really awful things).

Now, I don't want to go into too much detail in case this is like, too dark, but I'm genuinely starting to worry some things I've seen online have had an adverse effect on my already bad mental health.

I've always been paranoid, my brain would play disturbing and graphic scenarios of events that could happen, but I definitely think some things I've seen online have worsened it.

I'd say early last year, maybe late 2019, I was just scrolling online and came across a news article. Me being the curious kid I am, I click on it, not expecting to see some guy's face getting ripped off by a tree and I was horrified, but got over it after a few hours.

Fast forward to June 2020, Pride month, and I just had to get myself involved in fighting against Pride fall. If you didn't know, Pride fall was an online trolling event, and an attack on the LGBTQ+. It seemed some people were getting doxxed due to it, and me, once again, being curious as heck, just had to look at the videos on my Instagram feed, I know I shouldn't have but I did, and with some of them I didn't even have a choice since Instagram didn't censor them despite how graphic they were. I saw videos of LGBTQ+ people getting assaulted, a goat getting it's head whacked off with a club, a 14-year-old having his throat slit open, someone crying on the floor being held hostage with both arms chopped off, and someone getting beheaded. For the entirety of June I couldn't sleep at night, I had to use a VPN 24/7, I would lay awake in my bed thinking somebody was going to torture me to death and laugh, it scared me. It took me a while to get over this, I just had to distract myself and hope I could keep it out of my head.

Until recently I hadn't seen anything graphic online for a while, I avoided that stuff and only ever watched something kinda dark if it wasn't real, mainly South Park since I can handle cartoon violence and dark humor. But the memories resurfaced a few days ago and really messed me up, and today a Pride Discord server I was in had somebody ping the entire server with just a plain video. I forgot this was a WIP server and assumed it was one of the mods since in most servers regular members don't have the permission to do that, but without thinking I clicked on the video,, that same dreaded video of somebody getting their head chopped off I saw last Pride month, which got me to break into tears, I wasn't mentally prepared to see that again, and even with preparation it's absolutely horrifying.

I'm starting to wonder if that stuff had a long term effect on me without me realizing it, because I often see really bad scenarios in my head, way worse than before. I've imagined accidents I could be in and ways I could die, what my corpse looks like, I have a lot of bad habits like banging my head on objects, and I was doing this while failing to focus on school work and suddenly the image of my head being caved in popped into my mind as a possible outcome. I've imagined my limbs being sliced up, my eyes and teeth being pulled out, last time I went to a grocery store I was convinced I was about to get stabbed and die. My mental health hasn't been great since, like, 5th grade, but this stuff might've scarred me and I was wondering if it could have any significant effects on me mentally. I mean, I'm only turning 14-years-old next month, man, I'm pretty sure I'm too young to have seen any of this stuff, let alone a handful or more of it, and then the fear and threats of being doxxed and attacked for being LGBTQ+ as well? I'm kind of worried that this is really...bad for my brain??

I'm really sorry for going so in-depth, I'm really okay with removing this if it's too much, and I'm so sorry if I freaked anybody out and there wasn't enough warning at the beginning!"
1337,Maybe the universe doesn’t want me to get help,"I am finally at a point where I am seeking psychological help in order to get some sort of diagnosis and treatment with the help of a doctor. For now he’s prescribed me Zoloft for my anxiety but that’s a bandaid and I know I need real help (I suspect I’m bipolar). But when I keep trying to call places that accept my insurance I am put on hold only to be told to leave a message and then no one comes back to call me. Or I call one place that’s supposed to have options h to due to Covid they are scaling back whatever out patient insurances they accept. I live in New York so all the big hospitals and universities are available but at the same time in some convulsed way maybe this is a sign from whatever dieties are in control that I’m not supposed to get help and that I’m supposed to be the mess of people that I am. I became solid and with just a dead stare with those thoughts when I had to leave another message 

what’s the point. What’s the point of making myself better if I can’t even make an evaluation to determine what the next step forward should be"
1338,Please help,"
I’m writing here because I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like so many things are wrong with me but I don’t even know what it could be or how to start figuring that out. Could anyone please read and direct me in any direction of finding out what is possibly wrong

So to start with, I’m really impulsive for example I always argue with my managers at work and get sent home and I’ve even quit on the spot many times before, I don’t think before I speak or act it just feels like it happens and I’m just watching. I also get impulsive in the sense that If I want to do something I need to do it right then and I don’t think that through, for example I saw a job sign and wanted to go and ask about it but my boyfriend drove past and I started crying uncontrollably because I felt like I HAD to go ask there and then otherwise it would be gone, this felt silly afterwards. This is similar in personal relationships, in arguments I always get tunnel vision and I find it hard to see things in a balanced way for example if my boyfriend does something that hurts me I find it impossible to understand that he still loves me in that moment and it just feels like he’s a bad person etc but when everything is good I find it hard to think that he could do anything wrong 

Leading on from that I’m really sensitive and cry almost every day over small things because everything seems to overwhelm me for example if I can’t find something in my room or if everything is too messy which it usually is. I’m also sensitive in relationship for example I always question whether people love me and think I’ll end up alone which makes me act crazy.

 I go through a lot of intense mood swings every day. For example I can go from laughing to being really angry and sometimes even feel suicidal for a few moments and then it all seems silly because I feel fine after. On top of the changes during the day, there’s some bigger swings between different days and weeks, I either feel like I’m doing absolutely nothing and I wake up in the afternoon and stay in bed or I try to do everything perfectly and wake up at 5am and workout and eat healthy, I feel like there’s no in between. This is frustrating because I can’t seem to allow myself find a balance, for example if I’m trying to be productive and good and I allow myself to have something unhealthy or dont strictly stick to my routine I immediately switch and become a complete slob again at least for that whole day.

I feel like I don’t know who I am sometimes, I don’t know what my personality is and I feel like I just adjust it based on who I’m with but other than that I just feel like I’m blank.

I also feel like I can’t seem to maintain many close relationships because the thought of communicating with people every day or doing small things like texting overwhelms me so I end up ignoring them for weeks and then feeling guilty and even worse because I feel lonely. 

Every day life just seems too much and I don’t understand why because I try to get organised and I make lists of what I should do but I never seem to finish and I can’t really stay focused, because of this I leave all my uni assignments until last minute, even though I always complete them and do well in the end the habit of leaving it so late makes me feel constantly stressed. Even though I can’t get anything done it feels like I’m always doing something but nothing ever gets done which is frustrating because I don’t feel like I ever relax but I’m not getting anything done either. 

I’m sorry for this rant I just don’t know where to start and my GP keeps dismissing me and it’s especially hard to get an appointment now"

1340,i’m sad,"hey guys. i’ve just recently gone through a breakup and it’s been the absolute hardest thing i’ve ever been through. i have never been this hurt in my entire life. i feel hopeless. we were long distance and we were together 8 months. i know that doesn’t seem like a long time but we were so serious. we never fought over anything major. we had small fights. everything felt so perfect to me. we talked moving in together. she got a job so she could get money to come here and start our life together. once she started working, her priorities changed and i was no longer her number one. she met a girl at work with the same name as me and threw everything away for her. i am the one that broke things off because i did not think i deserved to be treated how i was. they worked together for 8 hours a day, me and my ex didn’t talk the entire day, then when she got off work, she would sit in the parking lot with the new girl for hours after they got off and would barely speak to me. so of course i ended things. it just sucks because she moved on and i am just here being so sad and feeling so helpless. i just want her to come back or i just want it to get better."
1341,Quitting job and depression,"I put in my 2 weeks at work this week after almost a year of feeling burned out and incompetent. I was promoted to a manager role and have since struggled immensely with trying to stay on top of everything. It's the most responsibility I've ever had and also the highest salary I've made by quite a bit. Over time, I've lost all motivation and barely do anything in my job anymore and am just constantly getting further behind. I cry on Sunday nights dreading the next day when I go back to work. I have missed deadlines and feel like I'm a completely different person that I don't recognize compared to who I was in school and previous jobs. Add in the pandemic and political issues in my country (US) and it's been a really tough year all around. I have depression and anxiety and both of those have gotten substantially worse throughout all this, where I feel like I don't do anything well anymore, including outside of work. 

After giving my notice, my supervisor basically told me I'm letting my depression control my life and asked me to reconsider either staying in my position longer, or taking a demotion to remove the manager responsibilities from my plate. I'm truly doubting if I'm making the right decision by leaving. I keep trying to remind myself that no job is worth sacrificing my mental health, but what if the major problem is just my own issues and the job isn't the problem? I just feel so confused. I would love any advice or similar experiences."
1342,Is it normal to get some anxiety/low moods when coming off of anxiety/depression medication?,"*TL;DR at the bottom*

I have been taking 600mg of St Johns Wort daily since the 14th of July (so about 6 months) as I was experiencing really bad anxiety and depression. I had about 4 panic attacks in the span for a few months, and I was having suicidal thoughts and hopelessness fairly often, especially when I drank. I have struggled with mental health in the past, I have had social anxiety for most my life, and have experienced low moods although have only been depressed once I believe. But I have never taken medication for it and have never really had ""proper"" anxiety. I had experienced panic attacks before this, they just happened rarely. 

Well, at the time of all this covid was bad, I had moved cities + house, had to get a new job, and was obviously inside most of he time, specifically stuck in one room of a flat share. So, yeah, not the best combo for someone who's prone to becoming anxious or depressed under stress. Well, I have been feeling a bit better for a little while now, however particularly since December as me and my partner moved in together and I have started a course which will allow me to go to university next year. So, I am a lot more stable in life and have not been experiencing much anxiety or sadness. I have also recently started taking care of my physical health by working out and eating healthy.

So basically, I don't FEEL like I need to take the medication anymore, however I would assume that a working medication might make you feel this way too? Either way, 1 week ago I decided that I wanted to start coming off of it. I have been taking two tablets a day, so this week I have been taking only 1 1/2. I think the first 2-3 days I didn't notice anything, and then one day I randomly got this very strange lightheadedness. That kind of thing gives me anxiety, so it nearly sent me into a panic attack, but I was able to calm myself down and the whole thing only lasted like 5 minutes max. Since then I have been feeling mild dissociating anxiety. I haven't BEEN dissociating, but I have been feeling like I will thus giving me a weird anxiety feeling, however I haven't had any proper anxiety. It's mainly just been little moments. Also, I used to struggle with body dysmorphia, however I have not struggled with it for a while. But, it does tend to act up when I am depressed, stressed, or on my period. Today I was feeling really shit about how I looked in the way that I did when I was struggling with it.

So, is this normal? Or does this mean I should keep taking the medication? I really don't want to take it anymore. I genuinely feel like I am more in control of my anxiety now, I am very good as dealing with the rare panic attacks or anxiety I have. I was going to start taking 1 tablet tomorrow for 2 weeks, but I am going to wait another week until I go down to 1 tablet instead now. Unless someone tells me that these ""side effects"" are not normal?

TL;DR I started taking St Johns Wort 6 months ago when I was anxious and depressed. The past 1-2 months I have not felt like I need to take it anymore. I have been taking 3/4 of my usual dose for a week, and want to go down by 1/4 every 2 weeks until I'm not taking it anymore. In this week I have nearly had a panic attack (but calmed myself down very quickly), have had very mild anxiety since that, and also had low mood today. Is this a sign that I should keep taking the medication, or are these symptoms normal?"
1343,I almost did the worst but I am still here struggling,"WOW! As pathetic as this sounds please don't judge me.   
Back story : I was dating a guy for a month and it was amazing. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING, he bought me flowers, introduced me to his mom, took me out all the time, added himself to my schedule. Said he will do everything in his power to make sure we are together. He showed me love, he did everything with love. He wanted to meet my family but I just was never fully ready. And now that I think about it, he said he knew he was in love with me after the second date. Do I love him? No I don't think so. I think I was in love with the idea that someone could possibly love me. He did get jealous some times, and when I found out his parents had covid I suggested we don't see each other for some time just to be safe. He definitely did not like that answer and felt I was being unfair and being unreliable. But he said he is just in love and doesn't want to go through life without each other.  
We enjoyed our time together one night, it was a perfect night. Walked around town, he wanted to look at houses. He wanted to enjoy dinner and we did some work and then the next morning his tone shifted. I asked what was wrong and he got very upset. Said we don't need to see eachother every day, said we need to be healthy and this is turning into a toxic relationship. Said I need to be my own person and be happy with or without him. I am so confused, he later expressed he is dealing with depression. However after our conversation he has not responded to my text messages, he has not returned any of my phone calls. I was very nervous at first but I see he is active on social media. So I am assuming this is where it ends. I feel very lost and it triggers my abandonment issues. I told him early on that I struggle with anxiety and this triggered my mental health significantly.   


I am hurt. I been crying and felt the urge to do a bad thing, and take my life. I thought for once there was a possibility someone can love me, but obviously not. I feel like I am incapable of being loved by a significant other. I thought I was better, and as I get older, I wonder will I deal with this my entire life. It begins to feel like too much. Like I cant do this anymore. I wanted to just getaway and go to a place where worry does not exist. But I did not act on anything, but my mind is still very much near that place. I have never done this before, but after reading so many of your stories I felt like maybe I can share a little bit of mine.   


Thanks for reading this far. I appreciate you."
1344,"Please sign my petition, about removing ads on YouTube with the subject being mental health.","So I've dealt with mental health for a long time, and I useally find peace if I watch YouTube videos about people going through the same stuff that have gone through, but something keeps bugging me is the fact that YouTube keeps showing me these useless ads about cars or burgerking ads that just pops up in the middle of the video, making it hard to connect with the video, a great example would be ladbibles video about schizophrenia https://youtu.be/mRRUnhIeA_E
I would love and appreciate if everyone that has 2 minutes to spare would sign this petition to end the ads on the videos. http://chng.it/GQwBjDvs"
1345,I can’t tell anymore.,"I can’t tell if what I’m feeling is truly what I am feeling. 
It’s gotten to the point where everything I say and do just feels so pretentious and superficial.
Are the words that are coming out of my mouth just meaningless nonsense or am I just pretending to say things like this to make myself feel real and validated.
I honestly can’t tell anymore. 
And frankly, it’s making me lose motivation to do even the simplest tasks.
I might just be overreacting, if I’m being honest.
I don’t think I need help, maybe it’s just lack of sleep.
I haven’t had a nice, long, deep sleep for a while now.
Let’s just hope I’m better tomorrow."
1346,I didn’t lose hope.,"A few months ago I sat on my bed, crying myself to sleep every night.

The crying later became constant suicidal ideations.

I wanted to end my life, I desperately wanted be free.

Though I could never get myself to take action.

I hated every part of myself, I was suffering every damn day of my life. 

I couldn’t pretend to be happy anymore. 

I was at a job that was eating away at my sanity. 

I was alone and I was miserable.

I felt disconnected from everything.

Anyways... fast forward to present day.

Today I got a call from my dream job.. and I was offered a position.

I began to cry.. but these tears were different.

These were happy tears."
1347,"Cat passed away, kind of lost right now","I don’t know what to do, it’s been two months since she’s passed away and I still don’t know what to do or how to move on from her death, if I’m really being honest she was the only thing keeping me here and everything, I just need someone I guess"
1348,I don’t want to try anymore,"I have things I want and **need** to do, but everything takes too much effort. Breaking old habits is too hard and there’s no reward but really slow improvement and always two steps forward, three steps back. I have a therapist that I don’t feel like talking to right now cause I feel like their response to me wanting to give up on trying will be very predictable. How do I get myself out of this funk...

If there’s any Frazier fans out there, I feel like when he loses his radio job. I don’t feel like caring about anything.

Edit: I just hate the hamster wheel."
1349,Hello I’m just looking for some advice.,So about a month and a half ago my girlfriend of two and a half years dumped me. I’ve been taking it very hard I haven’t been eating and I barely have energy to get up in the morning. It’s really starting to worry me and I want to be able to show her and prove to myself that I don’t need her. I was just wanting some advice on different things I can do to help with that moving on process. And whatever things you guys have used to help you. Thanks.
1350,Criticism makes me doubt myself,"I finally accepted that there is something wrong with me last night. It’s been weeks of me denying it and my friends insisting something is wrong and I need help. I finally did it. But then today a discussion on mental illness came up and my family mocked me for a year ago when I shared I was experiencing anxiety. They laughed and said I said I had “anxiety and depression” when I said I had a problem because I had 6 panic attacks in a week. I had finally accepted myself and then they had to go make fun of me and now I’m right back to doubting myself. What if I’m being dramatic? What if I’m making it up? What if I’m doing it for attention? What if I’m normal and I just think I’m not? What if nothings wrong and I’m being extra?

I do this whenever I finally figure something out about myself. Someone makes a comment or I read something that does quite apply, and I’m spiraling into “I’m fine nothing is wrong”"
1351,WHY CAN’T I FUCKING LOVE MYSELF FOR 2 FUCKING SECONDS!!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!,"Why is it so fucking hard to love or appreciate the tiniest thing about myself? Rationally i know damn well that i’m good at quite a lot of things and that my friends actually like hanging out with me but for some twisted reason my brain tells me to to fucking kill myself every time i have nothing other to do! I’ll never actually do it but thinking that makes me feel like a pussy. Now drugs have been absolutely magnificent, but they’re fucking drugs! They aren’t real feelings, they’re synthetic! Now lately i’m kicking in random shit because of the mildest frustration and then nothing changes (ofc wtf should i expect besides an empty bank)!

Please help i don’t know what to do and neither do the people surrounding me."
1352,My mom just called cps on herself,I was to afraid to do it and i'm still afraid but aperantly she decided that cps will agree with her and force me out of my room. I don't know how a human could be that stupid but i'm saved i think
1353,help ?,"I cut myself in front of my mom and she didn’t do anything to get me some help, now she’s on the phone talking about air plane tickets and laughing"
1354,i cant fit it all in the text so all put the rest in the comments,[deleted]
1355,Taking on too Much,"I have a tendency to take on too much in relationships, work related and romantic and this, in turn, makes me feel really resentful of the people and situations I find myself in. I have a tendency to lose myself in other people and interactions to the point where I feel unable to assert my will upon situations I'm in. There are a couple of key relationships in my life that don't really feel as though they are in my favor. I'm aware the easy thing to do would be to leave these relationships but I know I shouldn't just cut and run at this time, in part because I'm aware that I use avoidance as a strategy for dealing with unfavorable situations and I'm looking to become more assertive and cooperative. 

I've found avoiding situations and people works but only to an extent and I realize that my inability to be confrontational about how I feel with other people can often times be part of the problem. One problem I'm having in particular is people I work with see me as a problem solving type of person with the technical know-how to make certain things happen and it's really frustrating because I've been put in positions where I've had to make up for peoples' deficiencies and make up for the lack of someone else's knowledge which is hard, especially when that person is in a higher position than you....

Anyway, if anyone has any advice for how to be assertive in these types of situations that would be appreciated. I tend to avoid and over-correct later and instead I'm looking to be more direct about my needs and stuff like that."

1357,Mother thinks she is a good confidante. Nope. Told me to end myself.,"Bit of a rant.

 So my mum likes to think she is a good listener and someone you can approach when you're feeling depressed. She likes to think either myself or my dad would open up to her and she'd actively listen. But while talking to her about that, mum says it annoys her that she didn't know dad was depressed until she went through his work diary and discovered he wrote about how depressed he was truly feeling (the entry was already a year old) and she tells me it annoys her when dad doesn't open up to her. Then proceeded to say ""I told him, Just fucking tell me what's wrong!"" and I told her that maybe her attitude and choosing to get angry is the reason dad chooses to not tell her.

I then told her about 2012 when I tried to kill myself multiple times (until yesterday she only thought it was once) and how despite having 200 pills in my stomach she looked me in my eyes while I was laying in my bed and told me to ""just do it then"". She then genuinely told me that I didn't take 200 pills. I explained how I took all of my Cocodamol and Codeine pills left over from Surgery, about 60 altogether and then stole all the paracetamol and ibuprofen in the house. Definitely over 200 pills. She then had the AUDACITY to tell me that if she knew that she would have called an ambulance and not told me to just kill myself.

She said that if I was feeling so depressed why didn't I try talking to her? I told her I did, for WEEKS I tried to talk to her. For weeks I was planning how to do it, and for weeks I was trying to ask her for help. But every time I tried having that conversation she gaslighted me by saying ""you're not depressed, you just need to get out the house and go do something"" and even after telling her my experience yesterday she still proceeded to gaslight me about it by saying she doesn't remember me trying to talk to her about it 9 years ago.

She finally gave in and kinda accepted she failed back then and gave me the weakest apology. So I finished the conversation off with, ""If you didn't listen to me back then, why should me or dad feel safe to open up to you now?"".... And promptly got called a snowflake. 

I didn't have the heart to tell her I've been having those thoughts again for the last 2 months and already know exactly how, when, and where, and know I would not be found for a long time. She'd only tell me I'm just feeling stressed and upset anyway. Clearly."
1358,My mom is judgmental,"She didn’t used to be like this though, I think. I’ve lived a pretty good life, my parents are still happily married and have been nice to me most of the time. When I was younger I got lots of things and my parents loved me. 

Except around when I turned 12, when I started puberty, my mother started to be judgmental of my friends because one of my friends cursed a lot or my mom thought my friend was ‘growing up too fast.’ 

My mother would look through my phone and criticize me for things I had on it, she thought I was being too sexual. She caught me sexting my boyfriend one night and took my phone and called me a slut. She would make sly comments about how ‘I expose myself to all the guys I talk to’ constantly around other people trying to shame me. 

She constantly asked me if I’d had sex yet, even though I never answered her. She got mad at me when she found out I’d had sex, despite putting me on birth control because she knew I’d never tell her when I did. She also threatened my boyfriend after she found out and forced me to stop talking to him after a while. 

I used to self harm and when she found out she told a lot of people in our family. She also put me down about self harming whenever it came up. 

I’m not really sure if this is even a problem or if I’m overreacting. If there even is a problem I have no clue how I’m supposed to go about fixing it."
1359,Vietnam Vent,"Found this on my computer and need it off. and off my chest, but need it out there. and not in here (inside of me) anymore. So thanks for reading and for any help in advance &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

""I posted this on October 29, 2017. It would not let me share the whole post altogether with that picture of the sunset, so I need to share the rest of it... I need to get it off my chest. I want to be listened to. I want others to realize that they are not alone and that there is help.

To check in with everybody: thanks again so much. I cannot thank-you enough. I will not harm myself anytime soon. It was more carelessness of what might happen to myself, or because of all the stress and trauma, that I would simply die feeling loneliness. I know that I have supports, but again, when all you do is bust your ass at work, maybe help listen to a dear friend or two, and go home, cry, and sleep.... .of course I felt alone.

They say that when somebody loses their significant other, that sometimes the widow/widower passes away from loneliness.

Native children who were taken from their parents, grandparents, and families were thrown into residential school. Many MANY children died for many reasons... One huge reason was loneliness - being away from family and loved ones.

I feared that I would die of this loneliness... and I know that I have such a loving husband and family... but I still felt lonely and unheard... Even though I am still constantly trying to speak up to counselors, life coaches, psychiatrists, doctors, and so on... Every so often I remember which friends I can turn to, but I forget in those dark moments...

I will head to the island once I am not sick anymore, so hopefully later on today, maybe tomorrow... I will be home. I did not mean to scare anybody. Thanks again so much for listening and sharing your love. I need it... I need you right now.... Thank you....

""\*Trigger warning\*

Not a day goes by without dreading and being reminded of this day. Keeping quiet keeps us sick. I am still finding my voice. I am still finding my true escapes. I still struggle to remember who I am... who I was. I was diagnosed before Vietnam even happened, let alone corrupt Vietnamese police, ""family,"" ""friends,"" hotel workers (\*PLURAL\*), strangers, disgusting dusty garages the corrupt and ignorant yet naive Vietnamese doctors and nurses called a ""morgue"" and ""a place where they did forensics and autopsies."" The list goes on. To have a near break-in when you are home and your husband wasn't supposed to be there that night... It can be traumatic to be in one car accident let alone five. It is not normal for a child to stay awake cleaning and rearranging their room getting one hour of sleep starting at the age of 8.

Supposedly I'm high-functioning, but what good is it when all I feel is emptiness, guarded, broke, and hurt? When will I simply have a normal day? I hate what I cannot control... Why can't I truly ever be happy? I can't remember if I ever truly was. I can never simply live in the moment. It's all I want.

It's not normal or okay to grow up around one pedophile let alone several. It's not okay or normal to pretend nothing happened, never get an apolpgy, and pretend everything is okay.

I love the people in my life. I forgive and give way too many chances and get burned so often. I pretend to be tough on the outside because I am so fragile on the inside. I help others because I know how it feels to feel alone, helpless, useless, and pathetic... I know that for some of them, it is not their fault, and that somebody else did something to hurt them, too; so I bite my tongue over and over and observe...

If a child says something is wrong, please listen to them, and find them help. If a native person is in that ""downward spiral again,"" listen to them, point them in the right direction, and be there for them. If a Vietnamese person is having a hard time, maybe there are cultural differences to learn about; there are so many resources out there. If a female seems ""out of it,"" there is so much more going on below the surface. If you see a human being having a hard time, fucking be a decent human being and help one another!

Being a half Native half Vietnamese female in Canada has been a treat, let alone being just one of these minorities or ""less fortunate"" with residential school, war, rape, abuse, and the downward spiral/ripple effect goes on.

Nobody is born an asshole. They are influenced, taught, or pushed into being one.

I just want to feel heard. I am tired of feeling alone. If you can't handle it and don't care, have fun without me. Get the fuck out of my life already!

It is ridiculous that in a so-called free country/world, why is there still so much hate spreading and still so much shame around things that do not matter? Such shallow, selfish, manipulative, and insincere people? Why does it twist my guts to share about the truth? When you keep quiet, nothing changes.

I usually try to keep my writing positive and go over it over and over again, but I am tired of pretending to be okay. It should be okay to admit that you are having a shit day. It should be okay to wear whatever you want or have fun with your friends and family without being put down, harassed, abused, or raped. It should not be normal for men to beat their wives and children in third world countries, or for peers to abuse and bully each other...

Fun facts: Vietnam doesn't have rape test kits. Men are above women. They do not know what mental health is. They lack empathy. They do not have counsellors. If you are raped, you are an embarrassment to the family and dumb for getting in that situation in the first place no matter what age you are or who did it - if your relatives/lovers/strangers did it to you, or even if hotel workers lock you up in your own bedroom leaving you with bruises... Abortions are so common (several abortions for each woman in their lifetime) because it is not okay to have sex before marriage, it's normal for men to have mistresses there, and rape, of course. The cops asked me for a bribe. I did not, so they did not give a shit. If I did, it would come up in court. I can go on forever.

I spend so much time and money on counselling, psychiatrists, doctor appointments, and so on. When will I be normal? When will I be better? I was diagnosed about 9 years ago. How many previous years were undiagnosed and could have been prevented?

If somebody cries for help, fucking help them. Stop shaming them.

Substance abuse is emptiness and loneliness which can lead to suicides, overdoses, and other unpredictable behaviours/circumstances.

Stop the hate and negativity.

If I sound like I am ""stereotyping"" and you get butthurt and nitpicky about how this is written and turn this into shit that it isn't, then you are the problem! Victims fear stepping outside while violators fear going to jail. How the fuck is that normal and okay?!

I have had shit sleep since I was a child. Can you fuck off and stop saying ""can't you just go to sleep?!""

I have gained weight from trying medication to medication, and YES, from ALL the stress, so don't tell me how to fucking eat and exercise and as if it's so easy. It's easy, but it's not that fucking simple. If you truly know me, you would know how active and healthy I was.

I don't need solutions.

I need to be listened to, comforted, and hugged. I can go on and on and on.

I am here for you. I care and it is so much easier for me to focus on helping you instead of me.

I need to stop writing and comfort somebody else now. Could you please do the same?

When I said I needed to help somebody, I literally meant it. I have done it all my life, but that particular moment, I needed to help my crying mother-in-law because Brad's father was very sick in the hospital. I put aside my differences with them because in the long-run, that's what they needed. As weak as I felt and angry I have been with them for feeling like they weren't there for me when I needed them most, I fucking stepped up and helped take care of them.

I am still angry for how a lot of the rest of Brad's extended family was not there for their chief. They were there for the last 3 family members who were diagnosed with something similar the previous few years and have died from it... Why was our chief shamed for telling his mother he was sick? Why were people told to come visit and barely did?

So many questions. So much to say... I know there are stories behind this, and someday, I will listen with love, but we all needed you. I need you now...

I need everybody to know this. I am trying to forgive or move on. Carrying this anger is constantly in the back of my mind. To be silenced for whatever reason is killing us.

Residential school took our language, culture, and rights away from us... They brought us religion... Christianity... and people are still falling into being brainwashed... I know that there are good Christians, religions, and so on out there... but more importantly, this was not our culture before colonization. People are still feeling the ripple effects of residential school... The pain... anger... confusion... People still only see the negative stereotypes in native people... So many still don't know, don't care about our on Canadian history. It should be taught school-wide, and not chosen as an option to learn about First Nations history. That is Canadian history!!!

In Germany, they learn about the holocaust, and Germans respect and realize and feel ashamed about the past. There are plaques of Jewish families who were killed all over the country, to remind Germany and pay their respects. They want to prevent this from happening again. Why can't Canada or North America do the same?

I need you to know that there is help out there...

I need you to know that I try to choose forgiveness... and it feels selfish... I feel like this is being selfish, for doing something for me.

Isn't that fucked up?!

This is cultivation that is still trying to get rid of us... keep us quiet... but it will not work on me... at least not yet...

I have had internalized racism on both sides of my family, but deep down, I know that they have suffered and this is why I try to forgive, or at least, for parts of it...

I want to have children someday... I never wanted any in the first place, because I worried that I would fuck them up... but I know that Brad and I can make changes... be the change we want to see in the world...

People have straight up been openly racist sexist and so on right to my face about Asians and natives... I would tell them that I am half Asian and half Native, or that Brad is half native... They always say, ""oh, but not you guys, you guys are different."" This should not be normal!!! To my native and Asian friends, to people of all walks of life, you don't have to fall into those negative stereotypes. You can do this. The world needs you in it. You can be the change you want to see in the world... You can ask for help. I am here... and there are so many others out there.

Please reach out.

Please listen.

Be good to one another.

Stop the hate.

Educate yourself.

Choose love. Sometimes that means loving yourself and letting go of toxic people...

I can go on forever...

Thank-you..."""
1360,"I feel lost and like I'm failing at life, and I have no idea how to get better","I just really need to vent. I'm almost 20, I'm only in my first year of university (for mathematics) I did okay last semester...I mean I failed a class and I've never done that (why tf do I need BIOLOGY for a math degree anyways :/). Other than that I did okay, but I really want to switch out and I have no idea what the hell to do. I have no passion for anything, I have bad social anxiety and despite trying to get better I feel like I'm socially inept...and it's affecting my career choices too. I want to have a job with as little social interaction as possible, I don't really care about making a crazy about of money but my family is oblivious to my mental state (I tried to go to my mom multiple times throughout highschool for help and she brushed me off, even told me I was too 'smart' and functional to have mental problems). I also left my job in the fall to 'focus on school' but tbh it was mostly because of my mental state and being socially anxious/awkward around my coworkers all the time! My sister is soooo much worse than I am mentally, I mean as in it's obvious SHE has issues so it's like whenever I bring my problems up people assume it's really nothing. I want to get help but I have no idea where to even start. I can't afford a therapist. I know I have social anxiety and probably depression but honestly I think I might have some other issues or it might be something else (like I've had periods where I'm literally delusional, I had like a week where I thought I didn't 'need' sleep and that it was a waste of time??? Another time I got really anxious because I thought I had suppressed childhood memories, and I ALWAYS realize how ridiculous these ideas are after I get over it). A lot of my friends describe me as strange/weird and I have never really understood why. I want a full psychological evaluation or something but I don't think I can afford that either. My social anxiety makes it hard for me to even think about talking to a doctor about this, I don't want to go to my family doctor I've known my whole life...ik that sounds stupid...I usually use this online/phone call medical service that's covered for free in ontario so I guess I can talk to someone there? They specifically have a section for mental health on their website. But I feel like they'll give me a referral to a psychologist, which I can't afford, or meds (which i don't know if I really want). I also can't focus on anything...I've always had trouble focusing but online school makes it so much worse. 

Sorry this is jarbled and doesn't really make sense I'm having a bit of a breakdown and I need to get these thoughts out of my head."
1361,Effexor or Escitalopram,"Heyy! So after about 7 months I finally went back to the therapist and we discussed meds. Is anyone on Effexor or Escitalopram at the  moment, and if so how do you feel on it? I'm not anti-med whatsoever, and at this point I do believe it would be something I should definitely try. Just not 100% sure how I might react to it, which is the unsettling part."
1362,Very hard times.,"I don't even know where to start. I'm a male, 23 and I'm an autist. Currently things aren't great, my PC which is the glue in my life broke last week and I didn't know how much it helps me day to day with even little things. If I was stressed, down, bored, lonely, couldn't sleep etc I would get on and play something but now I can't do that and it's really taking its toll on me.

I have insomnia to the max and during the day its alright I sit and talk to mum but nothing much, I always need to keep busy with me or I'll overthink and get annoyed with myself. I go on walks but they only have a short effect. So I find myself right now at 2am bored as hell, wondering when I can fall asleep.

We don't even have cable TV and my phone data is about to run out and it's only been 8 days since it renewed so I wont have any YouTube or anything soon im dreading that. 

Worse things are that I can't really afford to replace the parts and it took me forever to save up. I'm on PIP allowance (UK) but most goes to helping mum with utilities and rent. (Long story really stupid) so I probably won't have a new one for like 8 months. I am unable to work also due to problems so I can't get a job, then again who can in these times.

The thing that stresses me the most is that my slobby, obnoxious, lazy, arrogant brother who shouts all day and throws shit around his room and his smashes his desk gets to play on his PC whilst mine broke after an unfortunate event. It makes me feel so bad and he stays up all night too banging the floor and screaming and I haven't no choice but to listen to it. 

Stressful days right now, not sure what to do."
1363,The Pain of misconceptions and pre conceived notions,"All my life I’ve had everything on the surface and it’s led me to feeling empty inside . I grew up well off in a nice neighborhood my parents weren’t “rich” but they were fresh out of college and into the workforce working all day everyday and had put together a nice life for me to come into .Growing up I was cheerful exuberant and couldn’t help but find the joy In every situation.But after years of abuse ,family separation I started to struggle to deal with my emotions and with my dad out of the oicture not paying child support and mom stuck taking care of smaller children I went out into the world at 12 . This is where the misconceptions started to break me and change me mentally and physically. When I was 12 I was 6’2 and people who were on the street (the only place I felt safe ironically enough ) looked at me as beyond my years and I would often get stared down or mugged by teenagers or even grown men.When I would play basketball my natural size and athletics gave me advantage and when I would play well adults would intimidate me threaten me and physically bully me . Over the years I started realizing I lack confidence because of this . Then someone tried to kill me I won’t go over the details I will never press charges because I want to believe people can be better as some sort of weird karma belief system I have that maybe somehow I will blessed by by wishing nothing but the best for others who have hurt me . I still do but I am in pain . I am 6’5 strong have a bright personality within me and strong social skills -Well read etc etc but once again it just leaves me feeling empty Because people see the outside and assume everything is ok ,little do they know I have the urge to kill my self consistently. My life feels broken and the pain of enduring it for the past 21 years has become exhausting and the center of my intrusive thoughts / impulsive behavior . I need help ,badly"
1364,how to deal with anxiety in public?,just out right now and scared of covid so my anxiety’s kicking my ass
1365,I don't want to live,"I don't see the point in living my life anymore, and I'm trying sooo hard to tolerate it, I'm going to therapy actively but I feel like I'm a burden on my therapist, the people around me are drifting away and I can't handle it, I'm beyond troubled and beyond any help, I feel like ending my life is the only way to finally stop being such a burden on people and a burden on myself.
I can't live with my brain anymore it's too much its too complicated its too messed up. Breathing hurts me and my heart beats are punching me I can't take this life and this self hatred. It's all too much and I'm too weak"
1366,On my own,"I feel like I have no support right now. My mental health is so bad right now and I have no one to talk to about it. I’m waiting on therapy but it’s a long waiting list to get an appointment. I’ve been on the list for 5 months already. My college doesn’t care, my mum doesn’t help, we just end up arguing. I can’t burden my friends with it because they have their own issues without me adding to the problem. I feel like it’s just me, myself and I."
1367,My emotions pop like bubbles,"Recently I’ve been struggling with controlling my emotions and it’s really taking a toll on myself and on people around me. I don’t know why but it feels like my emotions are filled within little fragile bubbles, that can be popped at any given moment. Once they pop, the emotion held within the bubble just floods and takes over my head. I feel so weak and overwhelmed with what I’m feeling to the point where I can’t take it anymore. I just want to be able to deal with my emotions and become stronger so that I refrain from making bad choices and hurting myself or others. I’d really like if anyone left some tips on how to deal with this situation I really need help please"
1368,What now?,Finally managed to push away anyone that ever gave a damn about me. Now what?
1369,An Outlet,"Life feels very dull. It feels like it’s on replay and idk what’s the point if it’s repeating. I’m worried for my friend. Idk I logged into her email on my phone and there’s so many missing work. Its like she gave up on herself. She doesn’t know I know and I’m too scared to ask. I mean, once a wuss always a wuss"
1370,The worst thoughts are hitting me right now.,Can I just talk to someone please? I'm hitting a really bad episode and thinking about how much my life will never matter. Its making me wish I was dead so that my worthless existence won't be a nuisance to anyone.
1371,Venting and Ranting,"Tried to write up a bursary letter which turned into a rant and had to stop. Hopefully now I can sum main points up after getting this shit out. Thanks for reading and for any support.

* TRIGGER WARNING \*

&amp;#x200B;

""My name is \*. My maiden name is \*. I was born and raised in \*. I am half Native half Vietnamese North American. My parents had me when they were 20 and 24. I am the oldest of 4. The age gap is 4, 13, and 17. My grandma is from \* (Native Place). My dad is from \*, Vietnam. My grandma is a Residential School survivor. She was 11-16 years old when she went, and came out as an orphan. My dad is a Vietnam War refugee. He was 13 when he arrived with his 3 brothers, but 2 were old enough to live on their own, and the other didn’t get along with anyone, so my dad and uncle were raised by conservative Christian families, separated. My grandma and dad shared with me about their experiences since I was a child.

Some traumatic things that have happened over the years:

\- Starting around 1993. I was left home alone for hours to look out for my infant sister and have had sleep issues since.

\- Around 1996. My grandma’s late partner touched my sister who was about 4 when she told me. So I was about 8. When I tried telling adults, they told me, “he would never.”

\- Around 1996. I saw my mom with a shotgun in her mouth.

\- Around 1997. My dad went to jail for doing something sexual to my aunty (on my mom’s side) when she was a minor. My dad used to do gamble, do crack and sell drugs. It was one of the only times I ever saw my grandma cry as my aunty had to move away.

\- On top of inter-generational trauma as it is, these incidents made me want nothing to do with the cultures on either side of my family.

\- I was in 5 car accidents:

1. \*, spring 1996. My dad had a side-impact collision with a car. The woman was pregnant.
2. Outside \*, Christmas 2006. My ex and I slid on black ice where we did two spins and ended up on the other side of the road, facing the way we came from in the ditch. The car was totaled underneath supposedly I was given a speeding ticket.
3. \*, Winter 2012. I had a work laptop on the passenger seat. It looked like it was going to fall. I pushed it back up the seat, when I looked up, I almost drove into a huge rock. Steering away, the wet road made me slip and spin at least two times. I was confused why it took so long for the breaks to work and switched pedals. Turns out I slammed it back onto the gas. A huge boulder in the ground prevented me from slamming into a tree, literally an inch away. Since it wasn’t raining by the time police arrived, police gave me a speeding ticket. When I arrived back at work after taking a couple of days off, nobody knew or cared, including the supervisor who knew what happened. She bullied many people into quitting their jobs, including myself, and the lady who took over my position within the same school year. I was an Indigenous Family Support Worker and Indigneous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker.

\- 2007, I woke up to my then boyfriend’s (now ex-husband’s) sexually assaulting me.

\- 2012, my ex and I sheltered his brother so he could work, send money to his wife and kids, one who has down syndrome, and eventually move his family to town. I found out through his wife that he sent pictures and videos of me to his friends.

\- 2013, I was drugged and gangraped by hotel workers in Vietnam. I dealt with the corrupt system and received zero justice. I lost loved ones when I needed them most.

\- 2014. A man drove onto the wrong side of the road (across the yellow line into my lane). We had a head-on collision. We was trying to turn left into an alley to take a shortcut and skip red light and traffic. As soon as we collided, he moved his car right away, so I couldn’t get pictures. We both “lost” the case.

\- 2015. My ex and I worked at two places together. A girl was gangraped outside of one of our workplaces. I was triggered by it. I dropped off lunch to my ex the next day at the other workplace. The boss at our other workplace asked what was wrong. All I said was, “I got off the plane…” He interrupted, that I can’t show up to work dressed like that (I wasn’t glamoured because I was just stopping by) and that people want to see skinny girls with “big fake tits” here. He said mental health isn’t real. People who use medications are addicts. He later brought up how we had this suicide awareness fundraiser “to make ourselves look good”

\- 2016, 3 family members, a best friend and her husband died.

\- 2016. My ex rear-ended a car that suddenly stopped because the car in front of it suddenly stopped.

\- 2016. A manager at work asked if I would “suck his cock” several times that shift. I gave him the cold shoulder. The next day, I was fired.

\- 2018, put aside my issues and helped take care of my ex-husband’s dad while he had cancer. When he got better, his parents went back to treating us like we weren’t good enough.

\- 2018, I went on leave for mental health. When I got back, I was fired. My ex urinated in her coffee mug (they never found out). He was fired two weeks later.

\- 2018, my ex and I weren’t doing financially well. We moved back to my triggered parents’ place for free. My ex still sent me to my room to masturbate while he told me how he would masturbate on my dad’s shed walls.

\- 2020, he threw a coffee mug hard enough to leave a dent in the wall. I sat next to it for months before he finally patched it up """
1372,Another Rant,"Last night's attempt, staying up til like 6 am trying to combine shit and just turned into a ramble about crap but it was going to be a bursary letter. but, venting, ranting, and validation has helped, especially since I haven't had a formal counselling appointment for a month since I moved and waiting for my new counsellor finally next week! Hopefully it's  a great fit!

&amp;#x200B;

* TRIGGER WARNING\*

&amp;#x200B;

""My name is \*. I was born and raised in \*. I am half native, half Vietnamese Canadian. I am the eldest of 4 (4, 13, and 17 year age gap). My grandma is a Residential School Survivor. My dad is a Vietnam War refugee. They shared their life stories with me since I was a child. I lived with a pedophile from each side of my family for 18 years. I grew up practically raising my siblings, feeling like it was my duty to protect them. The incidences and inter-generational trauma broke my family and I wanted nothing to do with either cultures.

I started volunteering at as an elderly caregiver and an ESL Peer Tutor in high school, originally for school credits.

My passion to seek reconciliation accelerated when I was in post-secondary where I wanted to become a family and marriage counsellor. After earning my certificates in \* (2010) and Indigenous Family Support (2011), I have worked as an Indigenous Support Worker/Indigenous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker, an Assistant Manager/tutor, a Community Support Worker/caregiver, and a nanny.

Since then, I experienced even more hardships. Some are car accidents to sexual assaults in the work place and within my ex-huband’s family; bully bosses; 3 family deaths and one of my best friends and her husband passing away in 2016; and being drugged and gangraped in Vietnam, dealing with corrupt cops, medical workers, and government workers with no justice. I was diagnosed with complex-PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychosis, sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, personality disorder, and so on. I left my abusive marriage June 2020. We would have been together for 14 years August 2020.

Over the years, I have explored countless avenues to heal and grow. I worked with many general practitioners, counsellors, couples counsellors, psychiatrists, victim service workers, sexual assault centers, etc. I have tried Dialectical Behavioural Therapy groups, drum healing, sweat lodges, acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupressure, etc. For fun, I have tried kickboxing, yoga, and biking, and have looked into family roots, healing ceremonies, and less known cultural rituals.

Returning to post-secondary will strengthen my passion, cultural knowledge, and independence so I can better serve those in the community. It is rewarding knowing I have made a positive impact on others’ lives. The more I learn about my cultures, the more I love, understand, and grow. I am passionate about building upon the success and fulfillment I have already experienced in and out of the workplace. Connecting with those who experienced similar first-hand has helped, so I want others to realize they are not alone, and there is hope. My passion to help give a voice to those who feel like they cannot speak for themselves. I want to catch things early, before it manifests into hopelessness, the way I felt growing up."
1373,Hate everything,"So I have selective mutism which is super funnnnnn It's super fun when literally I can't talk to anybody without being a fucking loser. thanks to that i really dont have any friends :))) i had some friends as a kid and a friend throughout hs (which i learned to open up to her &amp; be normal around her through years lmao) but yeah she moved bc of college and she doesn't care about me anymore so im back to no friends and i dont think its really getting better. I'm 21 now and so far my college experience has been fucking AWFUL. Basically i talk to no one only being neurotic trying to get good grades (which I hope to not fuck up now because for the past week or so I've been too busy crying about my stupid ass life that i hadn't studied HAHA FUCKSSSSSSSsS). i try to meet new people and I TELL THEM im selectively mute and they're like ""awww thats alright"" but i know thats a lie because after we hang out its radio silence hahaaaa fuckkkkk. But yeah, literally everyone's fake like that. you're not okay with how i am because im not entertaining enough. so yeah love the fact that im literally not enough for anybody &lt;33333333333333333333333 like im tired of each and every day trying to prove my self worth but i fail each time because i SUCK LMAOOOOOOO   


and can i just say how STUPID the whole online dating thing is while im at it? its so fucking stupid when you match w someone &amp; they're all ""you look so cute &lt;33 i think im already falling in love"" &amp; shit like that like no you dont. you dont know me. you're so transparently reading from a mental script like its so not genuine &amp; i hate it. Like why can't you?? talk honestly?? without trying to butter me up??? but im a desperate bitch &amp; am tired of feeling so alone so i try to connect (while telling them i have sm so its not a \~surprise\~) and yadda yadda im just not entertaining enough for them &amp; the cycle begins anew :D all of yall are so unreal i cant. but anyways yeah love the fact that no one understands me and no one cares or could ever care about me to understand me &lt;3 enjoy being stupid and fake with each other i'll just cry hysterically in my room until the world ends"
1374,Broke up with my therapist in a terrible manner,"I've been seeing this therapist for almost a year and I didn't want to see her at our next appointment and so I emailed her and told her. After explaining why I asked if we could say goodbye over the phone, and she didn't respond and so the next day I just said my goodbye in the email - But I was very short and it came off like I was annoyed with her for not getting back to me quickly.

I feel pretty lame about it but I already said my goodbye! I don't want to just keep adding fuel to the dumpster fire lmao - I just hope she understands.

I don't think there is really anyway to salvage it because we already agreed to no session! Oh well, next time I am definitely going to do it in person even if I don't want to ;\_;"
1375,How to sneak a razor blade into a hospital?,"Hi, I'm 19F and I'm going to be spending 8 days in a residential treatment center-part of a psych hospital to complete their assessment and diagnostic program. I'm currently in an actual residential treatment center, and have been since last year. I've been getting worse as more trauma gets brought up, and things are kind of going to shit right now, especially with (newly-discovered/recently-diagnosed) DID/DDNOS. So, they're sending me to the hospital for assessment so we know a) what's wrong with me and b) what to do about it.

But, here's the thing: I cut myself. Big shocker! I use it as a coping tool for when I'm overwhelmed and need help dissociating. I've been doing a lot better about not cutting lately, but especially with everything going to shit right now I have been a little bit more than usual.  
I'm going to try *not* to cut myself while I'm in the hospital, but if I need to, I want to be able to do so safely. Being safe about cutting myself sounds counterintuitive, but I'm a big believer in harm reduction, and I've been in hospitals before, where I used rusty nails, staples, pencils, and plastic to scratch and cut myself, and got lots of infections and complications as a result of that. So, if I need to cut while I'm there, I want to have a clean, sharp blade with which to do so in as safe a way as possible.

They said they'd do a strip search when I first get there, and will definitely go through my stuff. I use double-edged razor blades for cutting, 43mm x 22mm and very thin. How can I sneak a blade in without getting caught?

**TL;DR** I'm going to a psych ward for 8 days and I want to sneak in a razor blade as a practice of harm reduction. How do I do that?

Thanks in advance!"
1376,"Just want to say, help each other and do your best to make someone else's life a little bit brighter today :)","Everyone struggles. I see it all the time. I struggle, a lot. Sometimes, it seems like everyone else is happy and I'm not. Of course, that isn't true. Even the people who seem to always have a smile on their face struggle too. It's just the way of this world, and especially, this society. 

We can all make it a little better if we try to give a little support to someone every day. To listen to each other without any judgement, to be understanding and empathic. It may not seem like much, but each one of our actions have a far greater reach and impact than it seems at first sight. A little kindness can save a life, brighten up someone's day, even change the world. What goes around, comes around, too.

I hope you have a great day."
1377,Weird story,"Alright, so when quarantine started for me back in March I was pretty happy. I had a kind of busy life with going to school and doing other things. But after time I started to realize how much empty time I had. In April/may I started feeling my first signs of depression. Staying in bed all day, watching tik tok all day, not eating as much, etc. I still haven’t told anyone I’m depressed including my parents and I’m 13 also. I haven’t actually gotten a diagnosis but I’m almost sure I’m depressed. Anyways, back to the story. Since it was spring/summer it was really pretty outside and for some reason I have this strange desire to relive quarantine at that time period. I want to relive every experience I had from March to august. Because when august rolled around online school started and my depression got even worse. For some reason I am nostalgic for my early depression and early quarantine. What is wrong with me? Is anyone else experiencing a strong desire/nostalgia for going back in time to early quarantine???"
1378,Should I get help for my eating disorder if I am already self recovering?,"I (16f) think I have an eating disorder. I think my symptoms are pretty similar to anorexia. A few months ago I started trying to recover. I think about food a lot, I restrict (but now not as much), I used do exercise obsessively, I was a little under weight and lost my period. However, after trying to recover, I'm almost weight restored and I don't restrict as often (I eat about 2300 calories a day, but I still exercise daily and still don't listen to my hunger), but I still think about food and weight and body image a lot.

I've been thinking about getting help, but my eating disorder isn't as bad as it was a few months ago. Also, I'm no longer under weight. I feel like if I try to get help, I won't be diagnosed as an anorexic since my weight is ""healthy"" and my behavior isn't as bad as it used to be. The problem is my parents don't want to get help because of this (they think it isn't that serious), and I feel like if I try to get help but I'm not diagnosed, my parents will get mad at me for overreacting and exaggerating my problems (which they already think I'm doing).

Also, I've heard some people have bad experiences getting help, like how sometimes the ""professionals"" don't even understand how eating disorders work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm wondering if it's worth it to get help or if I should just recover on my own since I'm already doing so and my eating disorder isn't as bad as before. My parents think that my eating disorder doesn't exist and isn't a big deal, so I get treatment and I'm not diagnosed, my parents likely won't ever listen to me or believe me again if I talk about my mental health. 

Also I was wondering if I'm not underweight could I still be diagnosed with anorexia?

I feel like restricting all over again just so my parents can see the pain I'm in."
1379,"I can’t cry. I want to, though.",[deleted]
1380,Discord call anyone?,"I'm feeling anxious and stuck today and too scared to talk to anyone without prior confirmation that its ok to talk about heavy shit with them. 

PM me"
1381,You ever cry yourself to sleep?,"Like you get into bed, you just kinda sit there trying to do whatever you do before you go to sleep (for me that’s reading) but the invasive thoughts become too much.

“Why am I so lonely”
“ Do I even need people”
“Why do I feel like I need people”
“ Why don’t I have friends”
“Why don’t I have *anyone*
“Nothing is going well”
“People leave me all the time”
“I’m not okay”
“ I feel so fucking empty”
“Maybe I don’t need to exist”
“Do I even want to live?”

Then you start crying, and it becomes uncomfortably out of control, you cry so hard you don’t even make a noise anymore with your face buried in a pillow. The thoughts become a torrential river of crap that doesn’t stop. You want to stop it somehow but can’t. You just lose your grip, your flimsy grip on things.

I (21F) hate when you think you’re finally better and it all comes crashing down again. I wish I was happy without anyone but I’m not. I guess I feel like it’s too late for me. 21 and alone. Completely. I feel so damn needy. Fuck, fuck, fuck..."
1382,I touch my penis to god images whenever my family member r not a home... i dont know why and i dont feel any bad..also i am fap addict ..does bad thought related to god is some thing of thing,Hiii
1383,I'M Taking To The Blogs Yet Again!,"Unethical, unprofessional, horrible mental health professionals who aren't.   This latest one?   Is one for the history books.   Therapists.   You all need to sit down and rethink what your telling the potential clients.    Some of you can be quite stupid.   You don't tell a client that you don't take 'crisis' clients.   Especially without further investigation of what the client is going thru!  And what you don't do is make the client ( like me) go thru the long drawn out process of:  A 30 min consultation, filling out multiple forms were you have to sign , intial, then sign some more!  Then set up all of this online stuff for the session only to be told the following:

' I can't take you '  'I don't take crisis clients'   when all I actually was , was upset that my Mother said I was a failure as a Daughter cause I didn't live up to HER standards!  Which btw would upset anyone.   Therapist LICSW   you all out there need to THINK before you say such stupid things to someone seeking help."
1384,I can't stop getting into trouble,"I literally just got banned from my own school's sub, and it is devastating for me. I don't know what to do at this point. I am both sad and furious. I literally have been doing my best to follow all rules, yet I still get banned. I don't know what is going on."
1385,I need help figuring out the mess that is my brain :),"So, I have like no clue if this is the right subreddit (or whatever it's called) 🤪

I'm in no way trying to self diagnose I'm literally just looking for answers so if some people could help me that'd be amazing. I've also never gotten testing and theres like a bunch of stuff wrong with so yeah 🤠👍

Okay soo to start this off I'm just y'know going to list some of my ""symptoms""

- Forgetfulness 

- Overthinking

- I don't know what to call it but I need a schedule to feel comfortable with what I'm doing- and then I forget it 😔

- Indecisiveness 

- I get more energetic as the days go on (so like after school/ night) I kind of hold it in I guess you could call it, since I'm like really shy so I cant just start jumping around in class. I think I annoy my sister because I like ram into her and jump all of her and stuff.

- It takes me a while for me to process what people talk about (I also just forgot what I was going to write here✨) (I just remembered- so If like the teacher is talking and I'm trying to do my work I can't focus on what's happening.. basically I can't double task. I'm also a very visual learner if that helps at all 

- I get very irritated way to easily. My mom keeps calling it hormones, but it feels more than that. Kind of think of it as a glass getting filled up with water. Certain things will happen and I cant feel myself getting irritated, but these things just keep on happening until the glass over fills and I break down. And then the process starts over again 🤡 how much ""water"" that gets added and when it's added varies.

- Going off of the last ""symptom"" I mentioned; I had an experience on Tuesday (1/19/20) where I got off my schedule in the morning getting ready for work and everything kept getting out of my way, and everything was too loud. I was trying to ignore it but it got kind of hard when my mom kept yelling ""What's  wrong?"" And I kept saying ""I need quiet, I need to relax,"" but I guess she didn't believe me and thought it was deeper than that I guess 💀 I'll just call that like overstimulating or system overload.

- I tend to like fixate on something really deeply I guess. Like, if it's something I like it'll keep me busy. Right now it's Harry Potter and I go ALL out with what I fixate on. Someone will be talking about something different and I'll just bring up a spoiler or a scene or a character I like or relate to. It kind of feels like I'm from/I should be from that universe I guess. Some of my past fixations were: Marvel (X-men), Hamilton, Homestuck (I know, gross), and there was this horse game I played in like 4th grade called like ""Hill Cliff Horse"" or something of that sort. I had a character named Pepper and she had a backstory and everything. I resonated ✨deeply✨ with Pepper the horse. There's a lot others but of course I cant remember them when I need it most.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I feel like there's something wrong, but I also feel like I'm being over dramatic. I usually think like that when I overthink things, though. I'm kind of leaning more towards ADHD (I don't really know other mental illnesses of that sort- if that is a mental illness) I tried talking to my mom about it but she brushes it off, I guess because I get good grades I guess? 

(OH! I also have trauma if that helps with anything. I've also probably got anxiety and depression, but of course I'm undiagnosed because I seem fine on the outside 😁👍)

Okay bye- thank you to anyone who answers ❤"
1386,Just here to vent,"I honestly never know how to start these. At this point I don't even know if I have anything to live for. Who the hell knows why but I feel my life completely sucks even though theres nothing thats even that bad about it, asides from the ocassional yelling. Everyone else has it so much better than me, and here I am having a mental breakdown over my teacher reading a piece of writing about depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I literally throw up every single meal I eat too, and sometimes I lose weight, othertimes my metabolism is probably stupidly dead from getting no food. And when the numbers do go down I'm happy, but then it just becomes if only i could be a few pounds lighter.

&amp;#x200B;

I bet my friends would care if I told them, they would say I'm there for you, but it's not lie theyre going to do anything. Honestly I don't even know if this is gonna post because I just entered in a random email so I could vent. But I don't want to be seen as that depressed kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally today I read over all of my texts at least 10 times, to look for signs that I didn't say the right thing, places where I could phrase things differently, or maybe if I offended someone and they just weren't showing it. Even how I typed the word ""here"" in the google meet when my teacher was taking attendance.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to relapse and have to hide all the cuts all over my thighs, but then at the same time I want to relapse so freaking badly."
1387,I have my first therapy appointment Feb 1 and I’m wondering how to tell.,I don’t want to get committed or anything for going in depth. I’ve held a gun to my head on more than one occasion and the last time was a few weeks ago. I didn’t do it so much as I want to be dead but more as I could take my life so easily In that moment. Do I keep this a secret or tell rn
1388,"My dad found out my mom was lending me money and got mad, then I felt like my mom was being condescending to me.","Arrrg.... I mean I owe my mom about $600 and I haven’t made many payments but I told her I will soon and I meant it. I mean sure? But then my damn stimulus check never came... so my dad said he’d be happy to loan me the money and I’d just give him the check... cool. I dunno why but I told him I only wanted a few hundred then my parents got talking and apparently they had an argument over money. 🙄

The problem is I’m high and well... not well now and anxiety"
1389,Please. Someone help me,"I've been silent over a year about this and if I keep it in any longer, I'm going to end up doing terrible things. This may sound ridiculous to you, but there is this ""word"" everyone loves to use that, excuse my language, pisses me off. Because of this one word (along with other cringeworthy factors that relate to it), my mental health has been declining to the point that I'm nearly starting my old, destructive habits, such as punching things and hitting myself. I have no idea what I have been experiencing this entire time of being silenced and being told to ""get over it, it's the world"", but if anyone can do anything about this so please help me. Whenever I hear this word from someone, I instantly lose their trust, and tempted to leave that situation. My therapist said avoidance isn't good, but for me it makes me forget about the world and the obnoxious, overreacting electoral disease superfans. Like what's next, blue moon disease? Are we gonna call that some stupid number too? Are we gonna wear hazmat suits? Oh, are we gonna call this some stupid bullshit made-up word aramsdicio that makes me wanna slowly die as well? Why is it whenever I try to become mentally stable, the world comes back and stabs me in the heart and bites me in the ass? I want to learn how to socialize, how to hang out with friends, and how to love. Not to hide from others, and having dumb political bullshit cockblock me. Was that too inappropriate? Sorry... Go ahead, post this to your friends and laugh at me on this, but I need serious help. I have no idea what the hell is wrong with me. (I don't have the app so sorry for no vent flair)
I just wish at least one person that could understand where I'm coming from. I truly do feel alone in this cruel, overly sensitive world. I wish I lived back in 2019, where I was just getting over things that happened in 2018 and then some. Or, I could travel to the future, and just enjoy life. I'm sorry I sound like I'm begging for help, I usually don't. And when I do, people are usually confused and it's just so hard to explain in words. I've been losing sleep at night, not eating as much as I used to, having back pains, extremely unmotivated and emotionless, and I just can't hold it in anymore."
1390,i have uncontrollable emotions???,"if there’s anyone who’s been through this or is a doctor please help. I’ve always been a sensitive person, with terrible, horrible, fluctuating mood swings. I mean complete mental break downs since the age of 5. never in public, but they happened with my parents. i used to hit my mom when i was younger. It was terrible. a part of me believes that’s part of being a child who needs discipline. (And trust me, i got it, lots of time- outs.To the point of crying so hard my throat would ache.) and a part of me believes it’s who I am. I don’t know if this plays a part, but, I have childhood trauma stemming from my father who EMOTIONALLY and VERBALLY abused me. I have a younger brother but he was the “favourite” child so he didn’t get screamed at or stuff thrown or scared the shit out of. ANYWAYS, I’ve been having these rages since I can remember. I don’t know why. Something doesn’t go the way I planned or something frustrates me and I CAN’T deal with it. I feel a burning sensation in my upper diaphragm/stomach/chest, and no matter how hard I try to suppress my emotion I literally have no control over what I do or say. It’s VERY. VERY. Impulsive. I have ruined relationships this way. impulsively saying things that I don’t mean, but simultaneously want to say because I LOOK for fights. especially when I’m in the state of explosive frustration. When I get frustrated I cry. I cry and it hurts me so much worse than when I cry because I’m sad. I know from reading this anyone would think I’m an awful person, but trust me, I put everyone before myself, I’m somewhat shy, I’m really nice to people in general and I can take a LOT of shit from, let’s say, a co worker or boss. It’s my personal relationships that have a hard time. I go crazy and feel the burning emotion and can’t ignore it. My boyfriend is my favourite person in the whole world and I don’t want to ruin another relationship this way. HELP."
1391,Successfully destroyed another relationship. yippeee /s,"I’m 19, been dx with OCD since i was 17, but i think my therapist is trying to tell me i need to get evaluated for BPD. i’ve never ever had a stable friendship that didn’t end in an explosion (almost always me lashing out at them due to a misunderstanding). Tonight, 7 days after my bf broke up with me because of long distance, i broke and texted him obsessively about how “no one loves me” and “this always happens” and “i’m a burden”. it felt like someone else was writing everything, like i wasn’t in control. I felt like i was possessed. He rightfully got pissed off at me because he 1) actually loved and cared about me, and 2) i was being a hugggeee edgy middle schooler a-la “you don’t love me and no one will”.
LogicBrain me currently tried to fix the situation after an emotional meltdown in my car, but EmotionMonster is a tornado and bro i only have a dustpan to clean up with.

How do I cope with realizing i’m a bad person? How do I cope with having absolutely nobody left who I haven’t hurt?"
1392,How do I tell someone about how I feel,"TW self-harm, I don't want anyone to randomly read this and get triggered

&amp;#x200B;

Things haven't been going well for me at all recently, and I've been having very overwhelming thoughts and started self-harming again, badly. Normally I would try and talk to my now ex about how I feel but he's been taking time away from me and barely wants to have a conversation with me, but he's the only one I trust enough to talk about any of this with- I'm scared he won't really give a shit about it, and I don't want him to think I'm telling him to make him pity me and talk to me, I just want to talk to him or someone about it before I do something really bad-  how do I talk to him or anyone about this? or should I even talk to him about this?"
1393,A new kind of depression for me. I’m numb and can’t cry!,"Hi all, 

I’ve struggled with depression before. In my teens and 20s, I would go through bouts of depression where I would cry for hours in my bed and barely eat. These bouts were triggered by feelings of loneliness and self pity.

I’m 30 now and these bouts have become less frequent. Maybe because of the relationship I’ve been in for two years. But I realized recently that I am pretty depressed right now. It’s just manifested itself in such a different way than what I’m used to that I didn’t even recognize it for a while. 

No doubt, the pandemic has got me down. But it’s more than that. 

In October/November, my boyfriend went through a really rough time with his own mental health. He was drinking a lot and sleeping all day and shutting me out. It took a toll on me. I cried a lot and considered breaking up with him for my own mental health.

Then I found out about my moms cancer diagnosis. She had kept it a secret from me because she couldn’t see me anyway and didn’t want to upset me. I cried on the day she told me—even though she was almost done her treatment by then and said the prognosis was good. But I didn’t cry as much as I would have expected for this kind of news.

I guess my boyfriend realized that he had to get better for me during this time with everything going on. He finally started exercising and working on controlling his emotions. I’ve been SO appreciative of his effort to be there for me and I’m so happy to have the old him back.

What’s weird at this point is that I have no emotions anymore. I’m not happy, I’m not sad, I’m not mad. I’m so incredibly numb. I haven’t cried since I found out about my moms cancer in November and that’s weird for me. I have a pretty healthy lifestyle these days. I’ve started running to get outside more and Ive been sleeping pretty well. But I’m a total zombie. Last night I tried to cry, and nothing.

I worry that I’m affecting my boyfriend in a similar way that he was affecting me a few months ago. He definitely recognizes that I’m not myself and keeps trying to get me to laugh but I just can’t. It takes so much effort to even crack a smile.

I know a lot of this is because of the pandemic. The stress of not knowing whats going to happen next and not being able to see my friends/family in person. I also wonder if I just hit a breaking point with my bf/moms diagnosis and part of my brain just shut off.

I hate feeling like this. I worry that I’m bottling up my emotions and that one day they’ll all come out and once. 

This is depression right? Is it a certain type? Should I just ride the numbness until I feel something again? Or will it just get worse?

Thank you &lt;3

TL;DR Haven’t cried in months even when I try. Feel numb. Had a very rough time with my boyfriend in October/November and then found out my mom had cancer. Been an emotionless zombie ever since."
1394,Starting to spiral again,"Where to begin? In 2019 I had what was essentially a nervous breakdown (not the first) and spent the year in and out of hospital, eventually having to quit my job. After about a year I got a job in Oct last year and finally thought my life was back on track.

But my job is so boring and doesn’t challenge me. (PS: I do realise i am extraordinarily lucky to have a job at the moment) To be honest I don’t even think i have enough work to do as I spend a lot of time just staring at the screen. This has done nothing for my confidence and self esteem which are closely tied to me being good at my job. This has lead to me starting to spiral downhill and becoming more anxious and sad. I’m fretting being I think my boss will figure out I’m not doing heaps of work (it’s a new position so they haven’t quite fleshed it out yet), I’m fretting about feeling like a phoney and I’m fretting about a return of my symptoms. The symptoms are low mood, anxiety, not being able to fall and stay asleep, feeling like a fake, not being able to bring myself to do anything.

I am in therapy and my next appointment is on 1st feb so still a few weeks away so I have turned to the people of reddit for support. Thanks for listening."
1395,"When feeling ""good"" is unpleasant, what do recommend?","Hello,

I am 30 and have, over the years, developed an incredibly negative attitude. I had internalized homophobia and have afflicted by pretty severe anxiety for years. Through lots of counseling, I have gotten to the point where emotionally, I'm fairly stable.

Yet recently I've been trying to push beyond ""not hurting"" to ""feeling good"" and the cognitive dissonance is... daunting. I find my mind reeling when I try to think positively about situations and when I start to FEEL good about something I kind of... hmm... disconnect from the feeling? It becomes a more cerebral event.

How would you recommend working through such discomfort, when feeling good and thinking positive are antithetical to who you've been for years?"
1396,Suicidal Thoughts but I am not suicidal,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety and 2020 only made it so much worse. It's been the worst year yet (mental health wise) for so many around the world including me. I have had suicidal/self harm thoughts in the past but they were mostly always come and go. 

But for the past few months I've been getting them more frequently and when they come they feel like a constant presence in my head and I can't shake them off. These thoughts always come when I'm at my lowest but now they also come up out of the blue, even when I'm comparatively feeling better. I know that I am not suicidal. When my head is clear, I know that I won't attempt anything that I see myself doing in my thoughts. Does anyone else experience the same? What do I do about it?"
1397,Im 15 and probably fucked,"Ive recently have had a lot happen to me. Recently me and my mom got into a big fight. This wasn't the first time this has ever happened to me but definitely the worst. I left home after the fight and went to my sisters house. The fight definitely wasn't the only reason I left though. The reasons I left were because it wasn't a healthy environment for me. Her friends were really fucked on the head, she's an alcoholic which doesn't match well with her being bipolar, and theres been times where ive been put in danger just because I lived in that house. I can tell you that me, my two brothers, and my whole family have tried to help her but she doesn't want help. She hasn't been a mom for a long time. Even my older brother hasn't been in contact with my mom for the past about year and a half because of the shit she made him go through.

Anyways, ive been staying with my sister and ive just been thinking about whats gonna happen and how fucked I am. I have shitty grades in school and dont have the motivation to do anything accept think about how fucked I am. I probably wont be able to get the job I want, im alone , and I dont know what im gonna do with my life. Ive honestly been feeling like this for years now. It started when my brothers left like two years ago. Ive always hated living with my mom but without my brothers around it just fucked me more. My brothers were and still are kind of like a dad figure I guess. My dad hasnt been around a lot and my brothers taught me everything I know. But since they're gone ive had no one. For the past few weeks its gotten to the point where I just want to die. Im not suicidal but still want to die if that makes any sense. I dont know why im posting this but I guess it just makes me feel better that at least someone can know whats happening. I guess im just seeking advice for what to do."
1398,How can I be a tattoo artist with panic disorder?,"I'm a tattoo apprentice who unfortunately also has panic disorder and depression. My depression doesn't affect my day to day like as badly as my panic disorder does. Today I was doing a tattoo with my mentor watching over me and I finished one completely and was 2/3rds the way of finishing the second one when I began to have a panic attack. 

I cannot control when they happen nor is there any triggers to make them happen. They are completely out of nowhere and I cant function properly until I take a xanax and go to sleep. What first starts to happen is sweating, a metal taste in my mouth, and nausea followed by vomiting, tingling and heart palpitations, then crying or hyperventilating, and finally all of this lasts throughout the whole ordeal with added pain and fire in my brain. This lasts for hours or until I take a Xanax  and go to sleep. I also take Zoloft daily.
 
The tattoo thing happened just about an hour ago and I quit my old job (retail) cause I couldn't function properly at work due to having regular panic attacks. Like I said they are completely unprovoked and scary and awful. I had to leave and my mentor called me later and asked if I was okay but also what am I going to do if this happens in front of a client? Which is a totally valid question. Excatly like today I couldn't finish the tattoo and immediately had to take a xanax and go home.

What can I do about this for my career? Is there any way I can work around that if It happens again? (and i don't mean work cause I can't work when they happen or when I'm on Xanax) As clients or tattoo artists what should I do? Or am I just not going to be able to live my dream"
1399,Psychosis disorder,"Tldr: I had a three hour episode of acting like I was on meth, and since have hit a low, could it be a psychosis episode. (I have never done meth nor do I actually know what being on meth would feel like) 

I started showing symptoms of phycosis when I was 15. I now have a therapist that deals with my problem and I was told I have attenuated psychosis probably a year ago, (from my understanding, attenuated psychosis means I show signs that I could have a psychotic break.) Along with these problems I also have suffered with anxiety and depression for years and have been on medicine for them. To help my anxiety I began smoking marijuana, which turned into a nightly thing I do. Which I recently learned can make phycotic breaks happen sooner. Anyway, today I had an odd episode of some sort? It was almost as if I had been drugged. I talked really fast, repeated things, and had bad anxiety but I was still able to function, just slower and very weirdly. I didn’t feel I was able to drive myself to work in the state of mind i was in and I had my boyfriend drive me. When I talked to my manager, we decided it’d be best for me to see if my episode would stop before I could go to work. I sat in the car with my boyfriend for an hour, where i did weird things like randomly hit him, hit myself in the legs or in the arms, again repeating things and talking fast, and losing what I was thinking regularly. I was sent home because my episode wouldn’t go away, so I messaged my therapist and asked for help and she gave me some coping skills to calm myself down a bit. After my high of whatever was gone, I got very very sad, anxious and stressed. My episode laster 3 hours and now it has been 6 hours since it ended. I am currently in a sort of dissociated mind state. Things still feel like a dream but I’m no longer energetic at all, I am very tired. I just want some answers as if this could have been a phycosis episode or if it was something different entirely. I apologize for my grammatical errors, my brain is very fuzzy."
1400,My mom suddenly doesn't remember what happened just an hour ago after news,"Hi all, I'm new here and I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to talk about this but as the title suggests, my mom suddenly doesn't remember an event that just happened an hour ago. 

Context: My uncle recently got hospitalized for COVID-19 for a couple weeks and it has been hard on both families. Just 1.5 hours ago, my mom got a call from her sister (the aunt, married to the uncle) that our uncle's condition got worse and was sent to the ICU. Next thing I knew I heard her bawling in the bathroom loudly, and my dad, my brother, and I came to see what happened. We all comforted her while she was crying, sharing our sadness and she asked us to call our aunt, my dad asked her to wash her face after.

As me and my brother call our aunt and check up on our cousins, my parents are talking softly in their bedroom (and it was all in Vietnamese + I'm not fluent), so I didn't know what they were talking about. 

My mom seemed to calm down after what it seemed like 30-45 minutes of talking, then my dad calls us over in the hallway, explaining to us that she's feeling depressed and was worried about us but ""doesn't seem normal"", saying that she apparently doesn't remember anything that just happened. I was confused and went to see her in the bedroom. 

I saw her lying down on her bed watching TV and she asks ""how are you? how was your day?"" as if nothing just happened. She sounded like she just came back home from work and her face looked normal, with no signs of having just cried. I tell her about my day and how I was starting classes, before asking her how she was doing. She just says ""yeah I'm okay! are you okay?"" after noticing I looked concerned. I told her about how we called our aunt and cousins and explained that one of our cousins said she was sad about her dad (the uncle) but was relatively okay. 

My mom responds, ""sad? why is she sad?"" I reply saying that she's sad about what happened to her dad. She then asks ""her dad? why? what happened to her dad?"" 

My dad tells us this is what he was talking about and I told him that she was most likely in very high emotional distress and that possibly her body was responding to this by suppressing it.

Still, I'm shocked to see how quickly she was lost that memory. This is my first time I've ever seen this and we don't have a history of dementia or anything. Even as a psych. student, I'm dumbfounded. I don't know if I should worry about this or not. My dad is planning to stay at home to care for her tomorrow. Should I be concerned about this? Advice on how to handle this?"

1402,I will never be good enough at anything and I don’t want to live anymore,"
I really need help or advice with this, I don’t know what to do. I have convinced myself that I’ll never be good enough at anything or know enough about anything. I’m certain I don’t have a personality or any interests. I have so much school work to do, but I procrastinate on it and then can’t do it when the time comes because I keep crying about how much I hate myself. Every day is terrible, I have constant anxiety attacks where I do nothing but lay on the floor for hours. 

I have very few interests and hobbies, and all of them are mainstream and basic. I’m not a “super fan” of anything and because of this I feel stupid and fake. Not even music makes me happy anymore, because all I care about are my listening stats (I track my music using lastfm) and how diverse i am and how much I know about certain artists. Instead of doing work, I force myself to listen to new albums/interviews/live shows/documentaries constantly, even though I don’t want to, because I feel like I have to know everything. I don’t even pay attention to any of it so I don’t know who I’m trying to impress. 

I want to take a break from social media but I always come back to it. I see people online who seem to know everything and are super interesting, I take a break from social media for a bit, and then I feel like I have to learn more things, not because I want to, but because I want to be perfect. And how do you learn about things? The internet. It’s a viscous cycle and I am spending almost all of my day online instead of doing work because of this. 

Even when I’m not online, I’m doing activities for school. But no matter what I do I always feel the need to do more work, join more clubs, etc. I will never be good enough for myself. I hate myself for being so boring and I have no friends because of this. And the people I do talk to don’t give a shit about how I’m feeling, let alone answer at all. I need help or advice or something because whenever I try to focus on myself and be happy for once it doesn’t work out. I have been contemplating suicide lately and I’m scared"

BARELY!! i feel as if i’m going to become impatient for everything and as if i’m a lost cause at this point. i can’t wait any longer and i have tried to fix myself, why is it so hard for me to feel better mentally? i feel like everyone just tells me it will get better to avoid my mental health being a burden on them and to avoid the negativity i bring to every conversation. i feel like it’s never going to come at this point honestly!"
1404,What should I do during mood swings?,"Hello everyone, I'm a male 16 years old years old student.
These days, there's many things that are bothering me and inflicted too much stress build-up inside me. The most noticeable changes in me caused by stress is extreme mood swings.

I could laugh and joke around with my family and then suddenly feel down with a huge weight on my chest. The stress would go away for a bit when i motivate myself with words and thinking about good things but it will eventually come again. It's been 2 weeks since I'm feeling this way.

Sometimes i feel like I'm wasting my days by doing nothing.  I tried to find fun activities but the motivation would only last for a few hours. I lost confidence and motivation. I'm afraid of the future as well. I feel like wanting to turn back time and return to the happy moments of my life.

1405,My head hurts from thoughts and I don't know how to stop it,"Its a cold, dulled sharp pressure. Like shitty needles made of plastic. And it's been hurting more often, and comes with the stresses of life. Being upset I'm not performing at work, being told off by mom and sis for wanting to take a short term disability to not worry about work, not having food that makes my mouth happy in the house, trying to stay vegan, the heater breaking in the winter, waiting for my medicine to come, trying to figure STILL if I should transition 2 months after starting HRT because people put a seed of doubt in my head of ""But have you thought about it properly""

I have a therapist every two weeks, I'm working the standard 5 days 40 hours, my workload is lighter than ever, I can work from home, I just set up a new desk and monitors and got a new keyboard, I have an incredible game idea about emotions that everyone loves that I'm going to work on for the next 4 years, I'm not in debt or on the verge of losing anything, and I live with my fiance and have friends to talk to

I'm tired of working for now, I was freaking out about attacks across the US and if I'd get attacked for being trans and jewish but that's over now, but my head is still hurting. I'm still crying regularly when I used to not cry at anything. I can't think and I feel like I'm limited by shackles in my head. And I'm not sure what to do to stop it.

1409,lack of attention to anything.,"I apologise in advance if this post does not belong here but this has been going on forever and I'm not really sure what's up or where to ask and this is the best thing I could come up with. So my attention span is extremely short. its ridiculously short and unless I'm in my bedroom on my own on my computer  then I'm always moving or doing something. 

&amp;#x200B;

even on my computer my attention span barely last longer than 10 minutes. for example just tonight I started by watching Netflix and even though it was interesting I got bored and decided I want to play a game of chess but after 1 game I got bored and decided the next thing I wanted to endeavour in is YouTube then from inspiration on YouTube I decided that I was going to get the best rank on a game I sometimes play but I only played 1 game before I got bored so I finished the other half of the episode I previously left before.

&amp;#x200B;

after watching this episode which contained martial arts I thought how hard can that be and decided to search if you can be a martial arts professional without leaving your bedroom and stood on my bed doing roundhouse kicks but then I got bored and thought id play another game of chess which I lost again so I went onto YouTube to watch some chess openings and even though I like chess I only got about 2 minutes in. after that I sat at my front window  and decided that since I have just moved to a new house ill try to take notice of little things in their gardens etc so I can figure out what type of people they are.

&amp;#x200B;

 I browsed reddit quickly to see if anything was interesting but it wasn't so I thought okay well its 5 am lets see how many different porn genres there are and I found one called educational porn and I'm all up for learning but after 5 minutes I got bored again and thought id go make a hot chocolate and here I am. there's other things and I rotate between the same things sometimes but its still annoying I cant commit to or concentrate on one thing for more than 10 minutes.

1411,i can’t stand online college,"I hate my life so much and I want to cry. I hate online college. I’m taking fully online classes at a community college, and It’s so draining and unmotivating staring at a screen all day, talking to no one, just clicking and submitting over and over and over. I didn’t like high school a lot, but I miss it every day because at least it felt like actual school. It’s honestly pretty difficult for me to stay motivated, learn, focus, and stay on track with online college which makes my grade go down, which lowers my chances of being able to go to my college of choice. I hate my college experience so far, I feel like I’ve learned nothing, and I can’t help but think that I’m missing out on life :(

Also my parents bought me a shirt to my college of choice that they didn’t want to pay for (which is okay, I don’t want to complain), which felt like a slap in the face and makes me even more sad and unmotivated because it just reminds me that I’m not there, and maybe will never be able to go there. I just want to cry"
1412,Why am I unable to read any long-form text?,"Hey guys. Didn’t know what particular subreddit to post this query to, but this one seemed along the right lines. 

So I was wondering about something. 

I am nearly-completely incapable of reading any long-form text, such as a book, research paper, etc. 

They specific “symptom”, if you will, is that I will go and start trying to read a paragraph. I read a sentence, but I didn’t actually READ any of it. Like, my eyes laid upon every word, and the words DID enter my brain, but when I’m at the end of the sentence, I realize that I didn’t actually RECEIVE any of the information at all. The result of that is me re-reading sentences or paragraphs MANY MANY times before I could even tell you what the thing that I JUST read actually said. 

It’s kind of hard to describe, but I’ve heard of this phenomena before (a long time ago); specifically, people having to re-read paragraphs of text 5 to 10 times before ACTUALLY being able to retain and reiterate what that piece of text says, even RIGHT after you’ve read it. 

Also, I think a big component of this is that thoughts are swirling around inside my head, and I’m thinking CLEARLY about COMPLETELY unrelated things, but I’m doing what WHILE my eyes are scanning left-to-right along the lines of text. It’s like there’s two “streams” going on- one stream is the words on the page entering my visual cortex, and the other stream is the words of the thoughts that I’m ACTUALLY thinking about. And it’s obvious which one wins lol. 

——————

And, if it helps solve this mini-mystery:

I’m NOT depressed (to my knowledge at least lol), I do NOT have ADHD (I was tested, and they said I wasn’t. I *cannot*, however, speak to if that test was *genuinely* correct, tho), i MAY be a psychopath (impaired ability to experience empathy or remorse; egotistical mannerisms; although no anti-social behavior (I’m highly HIGHLY extroverted)), although I haven’t been tested for that; I do not have any chronic medical conditions (to my knowledge); no OCD, GAD, bipolar, schitzo, or autism; I do have a not-so-great relationship with substances, so I stay away from them, with the exception of caffeine and nicotine. 

Please feel free to ask me if you need any additional information or have any other questions in your attempt to help me identify this peculiarity. 

Thanks, guys!! :)"
1413,Terrifying Images Keep Me Awake,I’ve been having terrible nightmares. And when I close my eyes I feel and see things from the nightmares or things that are just absolutely terrifying. I can’t sleep because I’m scared I’ll have a nightmare and I can’t even close my eyes to try to sleep because I see the images.
1414,"If I talk, I'm screwed; if I don't, I deteriorate","I'm not ok. Not by a long shot. I'm burned out.

If I speak up and get a leave of sickness, it could cost me a lot. Not being hired by the job I'd want as a career, for example, because it requires people with an exemplary health and work past...

If I don't, I'll continue deteriorating. I've asked to reduce my availability at my job. The form, if approved, will take effect... in March.

I've asked my boss to move me on other shifts, that the new hires got. Denied.

I'm at a dead end. I have no way out, because of COVID, because no job hires or is even open..."
1415,At what point should one go to the hospital?,I just got a new therapist and I’m excited to keep going through with it. But my mental health is getting really bad. At what point should one send oneself to the hospital? Like where does one draw the line?
1416,Having to vent my anxiety,"Hey guys. this is kind of arambling.

It is almost 4 am right now. I haven't slept yet neither have been sleeping very well for the past few weeks. On theory my life is pretty good: have a nice wife, starting a new job overseas next month, have a scientific paper on the way, and so on.

The problem is I suffer from panic attacks, and they have becom frequent. had my first one two years ago. I ended up on the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. I did therapy for half an year and took medication for about the same time. I was also diagnosed with ADHD which frankly was a relief and currently I take medication for that.

The approach of the moving to another country is taking its toll. I have paperwork to fill and visa interviews in the next week. I also started to slowly work remotely with my new group, we meet every week on Zoom and I always get extremely nervous both before and after these meetings, fearing I said something stupid all the time and reliving every meeting over and over once they are finished. I feel really dumb when talking to my colleagues, basically as if I am a fraud and they would do better to have hired someone smarter. I get really scared of disapointing them everytime we talk.

I suffer from anxiety and had about 3 or 4 panic attacks in less than a week, I am not sleeping right, having to take alprax everyother day. I don't mind taking meds for ADHD but I really don't like the idea on relying on tranquilizers to not freak out. My wife is great and supports me like no one ever did and even then I've been an asshole to her today without any real reason.

Fortunately I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week but I doubt I will be able to start some new long term medication so close to my trip. 2020 was actually a pretty good year for me but I have to agree that the lack of outdoor exercise sucks.

Now I am not sure of what to do in the next few days. Part of me tells me to take take a few days off work since as I am not officially enroled in my new job I am basically just volunteering by now. On the other hand I hate the idea that people might think of me as lazy. 

I also constantly get restless and I have no fun in doing stuff. Or rather I can't focus on them for more than a few minutes at the time, either a video game or movie or book. ADHD meds help with this but there are days it seems to go out of control. I just feel restless and exhausted.

If someone has any insight on this I would really appreciate it.

I really needed to write this things out, thanks for you attention..."
1417,I (16F) Always Feel So Violated,"Hello. I am new here so I really hope I'm following the rules and doing everything right, if not please let me know.

My mother has a habit of barging into my room without knocking. I've told her to respect my privacy multiple times but she gets very mad at me and tells me that nothing goes on in her home without her knowing, and this always makes me feel so gross.

About a year and a half ago I attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital. While I was in the hospital my mother went through my phone and found out a lot of my secrets, including that I ordered a vibrator off Amazon and some stuff about BDSM. I know that I'm a minor and I shouldn't be thinking about bondage and all that, but the way I see it I'm not hurting anyone and it's not like I'm talking to grown men about it on the internet so I really don't see a problem with it. But anyways she brought this up briefly when all of this happened but we never really talked about it after that. But she ALWAYS hints at it to make me feel embarrassed/ashamed.

Back to the ""nothing goes on in her home without her knowing"" thing, I feel like she says this to break me down and make me feel ashamed because she knows I still constantly think about how embarrassing it was to have my PARENTS know about my sexual fantasies. I feel so gross and violated when she does this, and I feel like I just want to die or hide.

I have a very nice figure (not trying to toot my own horn) and I never like looking at myself in the mirror naked because I look at myself and obviously I see a woman but I feel like my mother would scream at me because I'm not allowed to be a woman and I'm not allowed to have a body like a woman and I'm disgusting for even glimpsing at myself naked. I have been thinking about wearing a corset for a little while, and my mom said, ""You probably want it for that weird S&amp;M shit people do."" This made me feel so bad that I went into my bathroom and tried to hang myself with a belt but it just wasn't working so I stopped.

Imagine someone is making you undress in front of them, that gross feeling where you feel violated. That's how I feel when I'm around my mother, especially when she barges into my room and gets mad at me for standing up for myself about having privacy.

I am not diagnosed with anything, but when I went to a mental hospital after my suicide attempt I was told I have manic depressive disorder but they never touched on this or anything so I'm not sure if that's the case, but I think manic depressive disorder is the same as bipolar and if that's true then I am pretty sure I do have it because I have all the signs, but I'm not going to assume and self diagnose. I also feel like I might have OCD. There are little traits I have that are signs of it and my older sister was told by her doctor that she might have OCD so maybe I have it too, but again, not trying to self diagnose. Maybe these things are reasons why I feel so violated all the time?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks."
1418,Need help my 13 year old niece off the ledge,"tw for suicide and abuse
im sorry if this is a bad place to post this and i understand if so, but i was frantically looking around reddit trying to figure out where to post this bc it is time sensitive.
i have a 13 year old niece, we live close, down the street. her older sister is also my best friend and we are legal age. she has been struggling with depression and mild self harm/self destructive behavior in the past half year or so. her and my best friend come from a household with a severe alcoholic mother and verbally, emotionally, and possibly abusive in other ways that i have not witnesses or heard about, father. they have 6 kids, many times in their lives had have very little to go around. cps has intervened before but nothing came of it. but im afriad that she will act on her thoughts. situation is very complicated because my nieces immediate family and i have very bad relationship with other memebers of household because one of the brothers has had it out for me for something that happened when we were in highschool. can be very manipulative like the father. i cannot go over there and she cannot come here despite living  close for these reasons. i told my friend/her sister but we do not know what to do, partially because my best friend is planning to finally escape and get to a safe house soon. she is not emotionally able to deal with this right now and has too much technical stuff to work out for her to be focusing on fixing this unfortunately. im trying to act in place of her as much as i can and help niece get help. 
problems are, cant go there if she says shes going to attempt, she is not supervised a lot of the time and could slip thru the cracks, has things to od on at her disposal, and i cant really help her go to therapy because her family wont allow or pay, and i cannot afford. also, if i even just get her on a 72 hr hold in the ER if she says she’s going to do anything, which u would think in theory would be the start to her getting help , this will just cause abusive parent to lash out on her and they will actually be less inclined to let their daughter get help unless legally required. and i cant call cps, for the sake of those kids. been there done that and outcome is the same.i know they would not get taken, would get get mandated family therapy that does nothing for them. i don’t know what to do except talk her off the ledge and then if push comes to shove and she is literally attempting, call 911. it feels like a dead end no matter still. 
please, does anyone have any ideas for me that im not thinking of that may work given these circumstances we are under? very scared but dont have enough reason to call on her atm. kind of a waiting game."
1419,I’m getting help.,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety for awhile now, and it’s gotten worse to the point of suicidal thoughts. But I was finally able to talk to my dad about it, and he’s finding me a psychiatrist to help me hopefully recover and be happy again."
1420,I’m worried my brain is broke,Over quarantine my mental health has declined I’m often depressed and worried or hysterical and I only have nightmares I’m wondering if it’s from the things I’ve seen on the internet like I’m not trying to sound edgy but I’ve been on a lot of gore places and seen son many die I don’t even flinch at the sight of death. I’m worried that it’s gonna keep getting worse or am I just overreacting because my brain keeps telling me I’m an attention whore.
1421,Everything is so messed up right now,"I'm just going to shorten everything down, because if I don't there would be pages of this. Ok so first, I was cheated on 3 times in a row, i was lead on purposely, I broke up with a girl over text who I like now, and earlier today I learned her and my best friend are dating. Even after I broke up with her we were still really good friends and in a larger friend group. But now I barley talk to anyone and most of the day I've just been laying in bed. Not only that but my dad is emotionally abusive and my family's too poor to do anything about it legally."
1422,Impostor syndrome flare up,"I feel fake. Like I'm not half of the person I pretend to be. Like I don't actually live up to the image others (somehow) have of me. Like I'm not actually a good person.

I'm not kind, it's fake. I'm not smart, it's fake. I'm not passionate, it's fake. I'm not good at my job, it's fake. I'm not determinated, it's fake. I'm not even a real gamer, it's fake. I don't really like books, it's fake. I'm not cultivated/knowledgeable, it's fake.

I'm not good enough for my boyfriend, I'm not actually the person he sees in me, I'm not worth that much and he deserves someone stronger and more confident. He's an amazing, strong, kind, smart, selfless person who thrives in panic and terrible situations, whereas I just... panic and cry. And seeing him be so awesome makes me feel so small and stupid and weak and like such a bad person... I can't be a good person if I can't try to do the things he does...

It's illogical, I know, and it sucks, but that's how I feel. And I know I'm a terrible person because instead of being 100% supportive of him there's also a big part of me that feels like shit next to him.

I thought it was period brain at first. But now my period's over and it won't pass. I feel like no one knows who I am, because who I am is a pathetic, useless, weak woman, so I can't let them know, and at the same time I wish they knew. Every good thing in my life is luck.

I have a therapist, she's great, but somehow every time I see her I talk about something else. I know I should talk about it next time, and I think I will.

Anyway, just... please help. I'm tired of being alone in my brain and I don't want to talk about it with my boyfriend because I don't want him to be smothered by my issues, and I don't want to make him feel like he can't tell me anything because it'll make me doubt myself... I'm stuck, and I want to be unstuck. I want to feel confident and to deserve him. I want to do better. For others and for myself."
1423,convo with mom,"Had a really good convo with my mum about my problems about me almost commiting suicide and discovered my mom was 3 years on the happy pills when she was around my age also she told me she would find me a better doc because the one i  currently have is like 70 years old and imo doesnt understand  my problems because of his age

just wanted to went and remind everyone that talking to someone isnt always bad, yes sometimes the person youre talking to is a prick but that doesnt mean everyone is"
1424,"!LONG POST AHEAD! i need help, am i doing something wrong?? TW: SH, suicide, pills, slight trauma mention"," so for context, i'm a 13 year old girl who can't really get a diagnosis for mental health due to financial issues and stuff like that, but i'm looking into symptoms for ADHD (which is something i've been told i have all my life, but don't have a diagnosis for) BPD, and depression.  around may of last year i cut off all of my relationships because of how worthless i felt at the time (it's kind of complicated, but that's sort of the gist of it), which spiraled into some of the worst months of my life. i attempted suicide about 4 times within 7 months. during that time i used cosplaying as a coping mechanism, since i'm into anime and stuff like that.  when school started, i never put work into anything because i believed 100% that i wouldn't live to a point where anything i learned mattered. i'm also a band student, and we had to sign up for district honor band (this is sort of significant later) and the only reason i signed myself up was so i wouldn't disappoint anyone at the time, but i didn't practice anything because i expected to die before the auditions even happened (in January 2021). come to around to right before winter break, i was asked what i wanted for christmas by my mom. i said i didn't want anything. i didn't want wigs, cosplays, figures, or anything like that. really all i wanted was to have my friends back. they were the only reason i was supposed to be here (i'm not big on family for many reasons, which is why losing all of my friends affected me so much). on christmas eve, after gathering the courage for weeks, i contacted my online friends and my closest irl friend, to which i had long talks with the two of them explaining my actions and my mental state. i'm so fortunate they didn't react harshly or anything like that. so great, i got my christmas wish sort of, didn't i? not only that, but i got new cosplays for christmas as well, so everything was fine, wasn't it?

**something that's also worth mentioning is that my mom always buys me things. she screams and yells at me one moment and the next she's swiping her card (figuratively, of course). i think the word for this is 'lovebombing' (???) but i'm not quite sure. point is, she will treat me horribly one moment and then buy me things the next. whether that means i'm just acting spoiled or not, idk??** the next day, i woke up at around 12PM, as any teen on winter break would, and when i went downstairs, my mom didn't give me a pleasant look. she asked me when i was going to practice for honor band, but i obviously couldn't tell her what's been happening (for all she knows, i'm just an anime-loving girl who ""spends too much time in her room"") so i just told her i'm being lazy and that i didn't wanna do it. she then went on to scream at me about how much of a disappointment i was, and how i was disappointing everyone, as if i didn't know that already. later on, i decided to get into cosplay to try to deal with the feeling of shame and guilt i got from that event. while i was in the middle of doing that, i was called and got yelled at again for something (it was so trivial, i forgot what it was) being my fault. but this wasn't really like the other times i got yelled at, it was way more intense and angry than usual. she kept telling me about how everything is my fault, and how i'm always going to be disappointing. (another side note, the reason why everything is 'my fault' is because i take blame for my siblings when accidents happen because i don't want them to get hurt) in a fit, i ran upstairs and tore up the makeup and wig that i spent hours on, and hid in the bathroom and self h\*med. after i cleaned up, (it was around 8 or 9pm by now) i layed in bed to try to go to sleep early so i wouldn't have to deal with anything else, however my mom pulled me out and made me spend 'family time' after i clearly was tired and wanted to rest.

my mom apologized and offered to buy me something (which i said no to), and then after about an hour i was finally able to go upstairs. it was about 10PM now and i logged off my phone to go to sleep, but a few minutes later, my mom slammed open the door (not exaggerating here, there's a hole in my door now.) and demanded me to tell her where her phone was. confused and barely waking up, i told her i didn't have it which lead to her, at first, joking around telling me to just give it up. after telling her several times i never even touched it, she yelled more violently than i've ever heard for me to tell her where it was. my dad was screaming as well, waking up my sibling and yelling at them that they couldn't sleep until they found my mom's phone. this was when i told my mom that i 'had' it (i never had it, i just didn't want my siblings to get hurt.) and she started getting more violent. some of it is a blur but i remember she started to resemble my trauma, and i had a panic attack and screamed at her to ""get the fuck away from me."" i screamed at the top of my lungs for her to leave me alone and get away from me. you'd think that if your child was screaming for their life for you to go away, you would, right? no, she just came closer, yapping about ""don't talk to your own mother like that"" and whatever. it's a bit of a blur after that, but i remember being in my room with my head down with my mom trying to hug me, even after being clearly uncomfortable with being touched at the moment. (actually, i did make it clear to her before that i was not comfortable with being hugged or kissed without consent, but i never explained to her that it was because of trauma). she kept saying if i didn't hug her she would take away everything, but i really didn't care. i would rather lose everything than touch her. eventually after an hour of her practically forcing me to hug her, i was in so much pain physically and mentally that i caved in and swallowed 33 pills.

i wrote a note to my friends that i'd just worked so hard to get back telling them that they literally meant everything to me, and i wrote a quick note to my siblings telling them i was sorry for everything. i just wanted to die in peace while i still could. the attempt obviously didn't work, and i spent a few days in bed recovering from being 'sick' (as i told my mom). i'm perfectly ok physically now, but i dont know what to think of this whole situation. i really feel like i'm just being over-dramatic and dramatizing this situation. so dear reader, i leave you with some questions    
am i in the wrong?   
should i have done something better to fix the situation?   
   
does the fact that i don't like physical affection mean that i 'hate' my own mother?  
what can i do to get a diagnosis/help without my parents knowing?  
i'm sorry this was so long, it was mostly a vent, but i really need help as well. also don't worry, these events were from about a month ago. if you have any questions, i'm more than happy to answer (i'm new to reddit though, so excuse me if it takes me a bit to respond)  thank you if you read all the way through, sorry for taking up so much of your time.  TL;DR, my mom yells at me for everything being my fault, and thinks i hate her because i don't like physical affection. after a panic attack when i screamed at her to get away from me, she instead came closer and forced me to hug her. am i in the wrong for not wanting her to touch me? how am i supposed to get help for this??"

1426,How to help friend?,"My friend lives in an extremely abusive family. She basically is not allowed to make any decisions despite being a legal adult. Her parents have full control over her and she is not allowed to disagree with them and constantly forced to do things she doesn't want to do. I can see it in her behavior that this abuse has a bad effect on her. She seems afraid to disagree with us (her friends). I don't want her to blindly obey things even if they are bad for her. She has her own ideas, she's just not allowed to express them. What can I do? I regularly let her vent to me and tell her that her parents are horrible (she agrees) but she can't move out and idk what to do. This situation makes my own mental health really bad because I'm worried."

1429,I need help,"When I was little my mom was severely depressed and when she got out of that my abusive dad started coming around. The experience with him was horrible and left me with PTSD. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD and working on a diagnosis for Borderline.

1432,How to stop being overwhelmed by other people's emotions when you are an empath,"I am really struggling with managing my emotions in relations with other's pain.

I have worked really hard in the past year to get in a good place mentally. I've committed to therapy, got in a good sleep pattern, stopped drinking, and meditate. I see the positive results of all of this everyday and it's great.

However, I can't stop my mood from being negatively affected by those I care about. Whether it's my brother's bouts of depression, my grandmother's isolation, or my partner's struggles with his ex. When they are down it can throw me in an anxiety spiral for days until they perk up. I can't stop worrying about them and stressing about their pain.

How do I sympathize and support without suffering?"
1433,Could Vitamin D deficiency cause Depression?,"Stupid question but I was wondering if this was a possibility. I've just found out I've got low levels of vitamin D and I heard that vitamin D can affect serotonin levels. 

I've been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder a few years back. I stopped seeing a psychologist for 2 years, and last month, I went to see a doctor cause I was getting really bad intrusive  thoughts to a point where I felt like I had no choice but to either speak up and be judged just to see a GP or kill myself (not the best way to put it, im sorry) I didnt want to but it felt like a dead end for me and I couldnt bear it anymore . I got prescribed luvox and its been helping me tbh. Intrusive thoughts are sometimes there but I no longer obsess on it and my moods a lot better now and I can finally say I'm a lot happier, I'm still a bit stressed because of whats happening right now in my life but im in a better place, thats for sure.

 I saw another doctor last week to get a blood test and she told me I'm vitamin D deficit. 
Could it be possible that my depressive symptoms and intrusive thoughts a few month's ago were caused by low vitamin D levels?

My old psychologist i saw 2 years ago linked it to the abuse I went through when I was a kid but im not sure about the more recent symptoms (really disturbing intrusive thoughts).
 I just mentioned an old diagnosis to give more info, not sure if its relevant but i just wanted to let you kind readers know there was already a history before the blood test results came out.

I just cant stop thinking about it and thought this would be a good place to get some answers to feel a bit at ease before I see my GP in a week or so.
Not entirely sure why it matters to me but it does.

Thanks in advance!"
1434,I don't want to try,"It's just really overwhelming to me. I tried and tried but I'm just lazy and too weak. I get physically ill after I try to regain sanity. I don't know why I'm like this. My family members are all doing well, mentally healthy. It's like I'm the only one who cannot get out of this self-made mess. My psychiatrist warned me several times that I should not chock myself but at this point, I'm just tired of everything."
1435,I think i need help,"I'm so useless and stupid. I'm still lying in bed listening to sad music and thinking about death. Sometimes I feel really good, but then only a little thing happens and I want to die. I can't feel all those feelings. I promised my psychotherapist that I would not kill myself until I visited her, but the thoughts are getting bigger. I'm so tired. I have been taking sertraline every morning for 3 months and olanzapine in the evening, but I did not take sertraline this morning. I feel that pills are useless to me and I do not want to take them. It's like I'm attracted to these feelings."
1436,Therapy isn’t helping me as much as it used to.,"Therapy doesn’t help with my problems as much anymore. It’s been helpful to an extent and can be a good vent session but it’s a temporary relief. I’ve done CBT, Compassion therapy and one to one. 

My father is still seriously ill, lives half way across the country and I can’t see him regularly. I still live in a household with my mum whom I have a complicated relationship with. Who was my childhood abuser and is a irresponsible person with mental health issues. We are a lot closer now but have a more roommate/ friend relationship but she’s still a very negative person. She’s a hoarder, irresponsible with money, very messy and judgemental. She is however no longer physically and rarely emotionally abusive. She’s also tried to get to know me a little more but it’s the bare minimum tbh. 

I usually just leave her be and enjoy the sanctity of my clean minimalist bedroom. My sister also still has depression and trauma and I worry about her. But like our mother she’s engaging in self sabotaging behaviour. I’ve recently referred her to the GP to set up some mental health help for her and decided it’s no longer my problem. As selfish as it sounds she’s 17 now and she’s old enough to take initiative to better her own life. I love her to bits but it’s exhausting essentially raising her all these years. 

I feel like most of my problems and stress are the result of other people. I am constantly putting out fires that I have less time to focus on myself. I have an amazing partner. I will be studying a qualification I want to do. I am thankful to have a job with co workers I like especially during Covid. I have personal issues such as weight management and anxiety which I’m working on. I’ve recently tried compassion therapy which has been ok . But I couldn’t even get through my first session due to my mum being panicky wanting me to take a phone call from my sisters school for her.  It’s not my responsibility or fault she’s an absent parent with no idea what’s going in her child’s life. 

It sounds awful but I’m tired of everyone in my house being such negative downers. I’m not the problem. I have my own struggles but am able to deal with them in most cases.  My family members focus on drugs, destructive behaviour, getting into debt, self harm and general poor decisions. I refuse to live like that. I know I can achieve more and I will. 

I shouldn’t have to be on anti depressants because other people’s actions. I have taken steps such as art for relaxation, using essential oils, CBD oils, journaling, exercise etc. I spent 6 months last year living in the same town as my dad to be closer to him until I ran out of savings and honestly besides a bit of social anxiety around people I had no issues until moving back in with my mum. She brings out the worst in me and it’s like childhood insecurities arise out of no where. 

I can’t afford living costs and course fees living independently with my current job but am longing for the day I can move out. Until then I’d appreciate it if anyone in a similar situation could give me any advice or share their story if their in a better place now to help motivate me."
1437,Why do i get so angry so easily?,"Hello everyone.
Im about 30 years of age and have a good life in general.
I have ocd but it's pretty much under control right now.
The problem is i get angry and frustrated at the smallest things and i can get pretty mean to my girlfriend and friends.
I also have a very negative attitude and always think the worst about everything.
Am i depressed or whats wrong?"
1438,TW :// child molestation (intrusive thoughts),"for context i am formally diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

for the past few days a really disturbing intrusive thought has been plaguing my mind.

my intrusive thoughts are usually centered around things like harming myself or being attracted 2 things i shouldnt be (family members mostly) but recently the one that has been tearing me up the most is one that keeps telling me i molested my sister.
obviously i did not molest my sister. and i couldnt ever do that. but my brain will not screaming at me that i did and i do not know how much longer i can take it. i know i sidnt do it, but i feel like i did. i feel disgusting. i feel sick. i cant get up. is there any way 2 stop this that isnt ""just tell ur brain 2 stop"" or ""get prescribed medication"". im gonna go fucking insane."
1439,"Should I tell my bf, the only time I can easily fall asleep, is when we are on the phone?","I have been having troubles falling asleep for a long time now, it takes me usually more than an hour and often involves thoughts, I really don't enjoy, and crying myself to sleep. As in the title, when I fall asleep with him on the phone, none of that really happens. When he calls, I immidiately stop crying, all the bad thoughts go away and I can fall asleep, no problem. He hasn't been really calling me at night for more than a month. He did for the first time last night, because I asked him to (was feeling especially awful) and after half an hour he started telling me to hang up which I really didn't want to do. We said ""goodnight"" and a few minutes later, he said how he told me to hang up, I was a minute away from falling asleep and didn't answer to which he hang up. I haven't cried as badly in over a month. It somehow hurt me so bad, I spent the next 2h breaking down, having full on suicidal thoughts. I kinda hoped, that he would just think that I need him to stay on the line.

I wanted to talk to him about it for a while but I'm afraid that telling him all that would be toxic and I would end up forcing him to call me.
What should I do?"
1440,Intermittent explosive disorder and marijuana withdrawl,"Intermittent explosive disorder and marijuana withdrawl

Intermittent explosive disorder and marijuana withdrawl

Hello! This is my first time writing here. I have a personal issue. My boyfriend who has Intermittent explosive disorder and has been consuming marijuana for the last months on a daily basis, has decided to stop smoking it 3 days ago. We expected him to feel more irritable, anxious and mildly depressed but he’s now feeling absolutely miserable and says that he feels like he has nothing to live for, after having a (not very severe) nervos breakdown yesterday. 
Do you have any idea what will help at this moment? And maybe it was a bad decision to quit smoking so abruptly without having a psychatric backup treatment to help him go through the withdrawl easier? 
I have to mention that he has never taken a medical treatment for his Intermittent explosive disorder. I read that antidepressants combined with anticonvulsivants might help, and also cognitive behavioral therapy. But we don’t know what to do at this right moment. 
Thank you for reading this and for any answer/solution you might have."
1441,I (18) have given up completely on my goals and want to drop out of high school,"Hello, this is my first time on reddit so if something is wrong with my post sorry. So, I (18F) have given up completely on my goals. I just started my last semester of high school virtually, and I'm doing terribly. Normally I have straight As and take numerous APs (Advanced placement classes, I took 5 last year and had a 4.6 GPA), but something about this lockdown is absolutely crushing my motivation. I used to have goals for myself, to go to college and double major in biomedical engineering and molecular biology and someday get a PhD, but now I'm seriously considering dropping out of school. I used to never lie and now whenever my parents ask if my work is done I always say yes. I don't want to fail my classes but I can't seem to do anything. Yesterday I actually did some statistics homework, but what would usually take me 45 minutes took me almost two hours. I've been in lockdown since December 16, and it was just extended to February 15th, and my country is very strict so I've only left the house maybe 3 times since then. I don't know if this belongs on this sub, or something more like productivity I'm new at this... I just need help. I don't have a license, I can't talk to my parents without them getting upset, and I definitely don't have enough money to see an online therapist.  I'm already failing half of my classes. I don't want to but I can't explain it I just can't do my schoolwork. Any advice would be nice. Thanks internet."
1442,My life is currently hell and i don't want to live anymore,"So basically the worst things are:
1 mentally abusive dad 
2 both my brothers dont want to talk to me 
3 my mother and sister dont have time to talk to me and when they do they don't want to 
4 in the last 1 year 3 months i have left my house twice and im currently breaking down
5 i dont want to do anything anymore
6 i have been lonley for a year and 2 months and i have no one other than my best friend who currently doesn't want to talk to me

And yeah i know i may seem like a dickhead because no one wants to talk to me but its because first my brother hates our family my other brother just dosent answer my calls and my sister and mother are really busy and both have depression and i too am suffering from depression 
And lasty to make matters worst we are poor,love in a 3rd world country and barley have any normal things (like actually good food,some sort of entertainment etc etc)
I am suffering from a lot of physical problems but my shit dad doesn't want to take me to the hospital and what makes him shit is he has a lot of money but dosent spend it and keeps telling everyone how he doesn't have money.
To me my dad is dead i dont have a drop of love for him.

Oh,did i forget to mention my brother almost killed himself multiple times,had severe depression and drug abuse alcohol abuse and had ptsd (my dad used to hit them ALOT ALOT ALOOOOT) and the same for my sister and my mom has depression too.
So now you know im not sensitive :)"
1443,"When someone writes something online in mental “health” groups and you don’t like it just don’t comment using harassment, expletives and insults.Just skip that post. Have you been a victim of online bullying because of something you posted?",I have and it’s horrible
1444,I can't let go [long],"It will be almost a year since my wife of 9 &amp; a half years left me and I can't seem to let go. We both changed drastically due to work and health issues and when I thought I was starting to get a hold of my life, she tells me that I need to let her go.

It absolutely destroyed me. I never cried so hard for so long in my life. I am convinced that I am cursed to be alone and miserable for the rest of my God-forsaken life and it took every ounce of will power I had not to jump in front of a moving train. 

I'm glad that she's happier where she is now and we're still on mostly good terms, but a small part of me wants to hate her and wants her to feel as bad and miserable and lonely as I do so much. Am I wrong for feeling this? 

That day has plagued me every single day since and I think I'm losing what's left of my mind. Make no mistake, suicide is absolutely NOT an option, but I just don't want to keep going anymore.

I want to get over this, but I think my perfectionism won't let me. This happened almost a year ago, but I'm still very bitter and I still get nightmares. I just wish I could reach into my brain and switch it off. The pandemic hasn't done me any favors either.

It feels like no matter what I do to  better myself, I will fail and the universe will always inflict pain remind me of of that. I wish I could get professional help, but that won't happen because that's for people with money and happiness is something you must be punished for feeling, at least in my life experiences. 

Apologies for the long and somewhat incoherence of this rant. I woke up in tears before writing this and I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this mess."

1448,Im aging but Im not aging well,"Hello I am just a stranger from the internet and right now currently I'm going through and extreme depressive state which probably will last off till next month or so. **I am depressed and mentally scrambled enough** to come here and write all of what you're about to witness but here it is.

I am Elly, I am 20 years old, I come from Egypt. But I have lived all of my life in the Gulf. Im about to turn 21 this year and I am not happy about it. Typically when you age you look back to see atleast one good thing you did that makes you grateful for who you are as you aged. Aging is supposed to be a good thing that makes us look back and be happy for the memories we have created and such.

Not in my case. I came to realise that I was a result of a forced marriage which connected in my head from all the abuses and the fights and verbal or emotional and physical abuse I have seen and had and listened to. It was gut wrenching to come to understand that all of that was a reality I was part of. It was a weird childhood considering how the childhood itself was a fever dream, both good and bad.

Growing up in a middle eastern society my Autism became undiagnosed and growing to fuck me up even more and more. It screwed me up so bad that It made me think maybe I dont have autism maybe Im just actually stupid enough which is much much worse knowing that you're a normal person but actually cannot give anything your best knowingly to how bad you are compared to people

I failed alot of my studies in highschool and schools. Even though I always given everything my best I just ended up with the same shocked state of ""how can I fail"" when I everytime tried my best but still got met with the same result. and everyone l looks at me and tells me that ***everything is going to be okay. Just try again and things will be fine just keep trying and you'll go somewhere trust me on that***

No this is not okay. I am not okay with this state. I am 20 years old and I am unemployed and I am not in college I dont know how to drive a car or a motorcycle. I dont have proper career choices that I even initiated. I dont have job experiences I dont have money savings, I dont have a good family that loves me for who I am. I dont have someone who I can love. I dont have what I can look forward to.

You all will keep telling me im still young but i am missing out. I have missed out on alot of things when people out there much younger than me did the things they were supposed to do or they were even less fortunate than I am and somehow managed to do it. I am a mistake I am not supposed to be alive. I shouldnt be struggling this much this is inhumane, the amount of mental scarring in me.

Would have made a convicted criminal depressed. That's how awful I am feeling. I wish I can make anyone understand the struggle I am in. I hate how my brains functions I wish I was smart enough to figure out things on my own and make things work in my favor. I struggle at everything. people usually tell me ***you look too beautiful to have Autism like that, you're just faking it honey ......***

Even now I am considering to go to the US and seek Asylum and go to Community College considering I am LGBT and Ex-Muslim, which my family will disown me if they come to discover. But even then that plan in itself is terrifying because I have no one who would help  me. I dont know how things work there and im struggling to obtain a job where I am god knows how hard it will be there so no.

Let me give you a written example on how I picture my emotions and thoughts:

***""As I am walking down the abandoned building. Joyful laughs can be heard from outside as they're living the moments of their time. Coming outside as I am joining them in their playful times, they run in fear, running with them I only come to notice they're running from me. I am the threat. Saddened by the realization of that thought like bitter news, I walk back to the abandoned building sitting on a rotten chair and listening to the same music looped on repeat, staring outside as everything moves in a fastened motion. I am frozen in time yet my body ages, I move forward yet I am in my place forever and forever being put on that like a displaced object only missing from a place it does not belong to""***

I am too old to ask for help and I am too young to complain about alot of things I shouldnt be worried about. I have suffered alot and all of these things combined go through my head for hundreds of seconds on a daily basis. The only forbidden solution that appeals to me is ending it all. I know this is not a good idea and I know that's a bad thing and I keep on battling that thought everyday but,

The state of becoming nothing would be much less pain and suffering from all of that. I see no good outcome that could change away all of that. My childhood is ruined and I am ruined, I shouldn't be existing to this far long because I am damaged being with zero good outcomes that may emit from my side, I just wish I was a happy child. Had a family that loved me. Grew up with a family that helped me at my studies, or even helped me getting a job. been at my side. Anyways, I'll go now thats all."
1449,I have anger issues that cause me to smash whatever is in my hand or is nearest to me,"Hello everyone. First post, I hope that I am not breaking any rules.

I have had anger issues all my life. I have been to many psychologists during kindergarten and first and second grade. I get angry easily, and when that happens, that is usually very destructive.

Whenever I get angry, regardless of the circumstance, I smash whatever it is in my hand to the surface that is nearest to me, let it be my desk or my bed. This is not only not ok, during these breakouts I have caused several hundreds of dollars of damage and I have also injured myself numerous times. Yes, my wounds can heal, but for me initially getting those wounds because my pen dried out and I got very mad over it is a little bit fucked up. 

These issues usually get worse when I am under pressure and when I am tired. Right now, I am experiencing both and for the record, I have broken my second Xbox controller today, got my thumb fucked up badly and this was the thing that drove me to these subreddits and made me re-evaluate my problems and finally made me realize I need help.

I tried all kinds of methods to prevent this, but I have zero self control. I tried stopping whatever I was doing and think, but that made me even angrier and caused me even more damage. I tried putting down whatever it is in my hand, but that does not work consistently and 90 percent of the times I still ended up smashing my things. I tried hitting other things like my pillow, but that also made me even more pumped up and angry. 

Is there any way I can in the very least minimize the intensity or the frequency of these breakouts? I have a feeling if I don't stop this, things will get much, much worse.

The internet is my last resort as I am too afraid to approach my parents with this in order to maybe get me professional help, I don't want to get scolded and grounded for things I have barely any control over."
1450,Dissertation Deadline,"Not about me today, but my flatmate has been really struggling with physical health issues along with anxiety and depression which has made it difficult to complete her uni work. She already had to defer a year and has been as many extensions as the uni can allow to try and accommodate all of this. 

Today was her final deadline for her dissertation, and while not everything was complete or to her high standards she submitted everything she needed to on time, and is accepting that while she might not pass, this time in her life can finally be over. 

I’m just so proud of her, I wanted to share!

I hope you’re all doing well in everything you’re doing, accomplishing anything can be extremely difficult at times but it doesn’t matter how small or big the task seems, you should be able to reward yourself and feel proud all the same. You do deserve good things and you deserve to feel happy without guilt xx"

1452,"Does anyone else think that ""NARCISSIM"" is a toxic trait or is do you have to be cocky to be successful??","While narcissism may be viewed as a negative  personality trait  by many is the society research says that it could also have benefits like reduced chances of depression.According to the study published in the journal of Personality and individual Differences,people who are narcissistic engage in risky behaviour and hold superior view of themselves,are overconfident and show little empathy for others.A key finding of that research was that, people high on GRANDOISE NARCISSIM were mentally stronger and this can help offset the symptoms of depression.

1453,Going to Wilderness Exposure Therapy for the Next 3 Months,"So, yeah the title gives the main premise of this post away, but I’m freaking out a little bit. 

Just to give some background I’m a 17 year old girl from the east coast. My mental health issues came to light October 2018 and even though I was put into therapy I was hospitalized a few months later in January 2019. Life just went off the rails after that and I was hospitalized again last October and I’m really struggling with life and school. Not to give to much away but I used to be a really high functioning student in an honors school and now I’m barely passing special education classes. 

My parents sat me down yesterday and told me that they really wanted me to go to this program and that if I said yes that in about a week I would be shipped out to Utah (yes I understand that traveling during a pandemic is risky and a horrible thing to do, but this isn’t a vacation). After thinking it over last night and doing some research I came to a couple of conclusions. 

1. I will most likely have to repeat a year of school, but the way things are going right now, I probably would have to anyway. 

2. I will be away from everything technology based for months. I am definitely addicted to it, because the first thing that really made me question whether I wanted to go was the fact that I would be phone-less.  

3. I love nature and I genuinely think that Utah is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen (from pictures at least) 

4. This is the opportunity of a life time, but it’s expensive.I was initially really concerned about the cost but my parents told me that they had enough saved up, and they would just hold off on big purchases for a few years (they wanted a new house). 

5. I will learn to take care of myself and have a lot of time for personal reflection. Also I love to write and I think I will find a lot of inspiration in the desert. 

So yeah today I decided that I will go. I’m somewhat at the ends of my wits here and maybe a big change in life and scenery will change things. But still I’m really worried and nervous. Has anyone been on a program like this  or have any knowledge about it? Any info would be much appreciated"
1454,i don’t know what’s wrong with me,"i’m an utterly useless person and i seem to struggle with the most simplest tasks and i don’t understand why. i get overwhelmed so easily and i feel so stupid because there’s literally no reason for it, i know i’m most likely just lazy but it feels like it’s going to destroy my life... like for example i’m struggling to keep up with my college project, it’s not even all that difficult but i feel like i’m constantly behind trying to catch up, i can’t focus because my bedroom is a complete mess and has been for weeks,, i know the obvious solution is to just tidy! just do it! it’s not like it’s hard, and it won’t even take all that long!! but i just.. can’t.

like i think to myself okay let’s start by taking my cups and mugs downstairs, except then i realise that the sink is full of dishes, so i think okay i’ll wash those first, except the drying rack is full so i have nowhere to put them, so i’ll put those away first but i can’t because my house is a fucking mess and there isn’t room to put anything, last night i stayed up until 3am trying to organise my cupboards so i’d have space to put away dishes, and that involved removing a bunch of tupperwares that i never use to make space, but then i realised that i have a weevil problem (even tho i keep food in airtight containers??) so now my kitchen floor is just covered with fucking tupperwares that have nowhere to go and my room is still a mess and the dishes still haven’t been done!! 

normal people don’t struggle with extremely simple tasks like this, but i find them to be crippling, i get so overwhelmed and i feel so useless and i end up hating myself so much and just crying.

i forget things too, like all the time,, i’ve missed 2 assignments just because i was focused on trying to keep my fucking life together. i’ve always been like this but when i was younger my parents helped me, like they’d do the dishes most the time so i’d have less things to focus on, i’m 17 now but my mums in hospital and my dad is at work all day so i’m on my own. i always thought this was something i was just going to grow out of,, but it’s only getting worse.

i’m so terrified i’m gonna fail when i get my final grade this summer, and i have absolutely no plans for next year and it’s freaking me out... how the fuck am i suppose to hold down a good enough job to move out if i can’t even do the most mundane tasks!!!

i’m constantly making lists to remember things,,  but then i forget about the lists.
everyone around me seems to be doing fine, i have a friend who literally does everything right, she’s a perfect example student and does every single task to the highest standard, she’s never missed an assignment and i just can’t understand how it’s so so easy for her but i’m just failing at everything. like what’s the point of even trying to have a life if i’m this fucking useless, i just end up making people mad at me.

what the fuck is wrong with me!!"
1455,thought,"I was thinking to myself and thought why not share my thoughts. 

People ask me why I don't sleep, or why I'm sleeping all the time. Why I'm not eating, and why I'm not sober. From my perspective, I am living to the best of my abilities. Yes, I struggle with a mental conflict on a daily basis. I am battling these thoughts and emotions, and it has an impact on who I am and how I feel. I do not see the display that I am putting off as well as those on the outside. I don't know what the problem is or what the solution is. I want to be good, I want to be at peace with my mind and myself. I have good times, and I cannot shadow those moments with this darkness. But it still lies there. It isn't a big deal, everyone is walking around with a weight on their shoulders. When carrying weight we aren't aware of how much is too much until you fall under it."
1456,Where do I go now?,"Hello everyone,

I've been on this forum for a while now and decided to take the plunge and ask for advice. I was training to become a teacher, and was on a placement in my final year where unfortunately I started to realise I made a mistake and this really was not for me. I became severely fatigued and anxious about going into the school, scared to meet the responsibility of standing and teaching in the class.

After a week I woke up and just broke down in front of my fiance and said that I could not do this anymore. She got worried as we had planned to become teachers and with the job market the way it is, her and I began to worry about our future. I had planned to kill myself after that, to jump in front of train and be done with life. I sought help and now doing a bit better.

I'm now looking for full time employment now and have no idea where to go, I feel that I've doomed myself to a life a meaningless work and have panic attacks when I think about it. If you have any advice for where to go from here, I could surely use some right now."
1457,Considering therapy but I have some questions and wondering if any of you felt the same..,"So I’ve been trying my damndest to be the best that I can for probably 3 years now. I used to self harm a bit, but I’ve been clean in that sense for 2 years. I’ve always just fixed my own problems myself, whether it was exercising, meditating, eating well and what not, I would always do what I felt I needed for myself and not accept any help from anyone. 

Now lately the past 2 months I’ve really been considering a therapist, felt it could help just having someone trained to kind of help me gain new perspective or direction. However I always end up immediately kind of feeling weird, or not up to any therapy when I imagine myself talking about my problems with them. I always kind of default to a “I can just do everything by myself” mindset and write therapy off as stupid. 

Wondering if you all felt anything similar, and how you may have overcome that and gotten the help you need. 

Thanks for reading."

I had depression a few years ago and still suffer from anxiety but it's not even close to what he's going through. So i kinda know what (not) to say and do but not really...

1460,Spontaneous Crying Stress Episodes,"So I (17F) would like some advice in how to deal with what's been going on with myself recently.

In the past month and a half, I have had nothing wrong or particularly upsetting happen in my life. Admittedly, I was stressed before then, but nothing abnormal. I'm usually a stressed person, but what's been going on I've never dealt with before and it's getting to the point where it is negatively affecting other relationships in my life.

For instance, these ""episodes"" typically occur when I'm around my boyfriend, regardless of what we are doing. Sometimes they don't, but there seems to be a pattern when I am with him. They last around an hour, and consist of me uncontrollably shaking and crying. It's embarrassing and the fact that he's trying to help makes it worse because, although I know it is irrational, I become convinced that he's annoyed, frustrated, and will leave. I feel awful during and after these episodes, but I can't seem to stop them either. Sometimes they occur in waves, where I start to feel better again, then everything hits again.

It's occurred to me that these might be panic attacks, but I've had those in the past and they were so physically different and unpredictable. These just consist of feeling awful inside, and I know maybe thirty minutes in advance when I start feeling one coming on. I've had a history with anxiety in the past, but nothing ever like this and I just don't know where to start to get better.

He's so sweet, caring, and considerate; I can tell these episodes worry him greatly and its making me scared to be around him as to make him associate me with these. I desperately want to become better so that things return to normal.

Please help, any advice would be appreciated."

When I look up symptoms I feel like I have anxiety and depression, but I don't know why and I don't know what to do about it. I feel like I have a good life, I've got a job, a great family, I haven't been abused or bullied or put down in any way, so why do I feel like this. I feel like I don' deserve to feel like this. I want to get help cause I don't want to be like this anymore but when it comes time to call my doctor or open my mouth to say something, I just can't.

1463,Medicaid covered services,"Cincinnati area, Ohio, US

My girlfriend is currently on Medicaid due to low income. 

She deeply struggles with mental illness and says herself that she needs to get help with it, but also deals with the hopelessness that anything could even help her.  

Do any of you have an idea of services that are able to help her that she would be covered under? She says she has looked and would be out behind a long list but j also feel that she has just given up on looking for it in general. I’m very lost on how to help her and am obviously not able to as her boyfriend. She needs true professional help.  Thanks for reading..."
1464,"Stopped taking all of my medications, should I see my doctor?","I was diagnosed with bpd (could be misdiagnosed cause apparently it happens..) 

So I stopped taking all of my medications last year. Since end of October till now. The last time i saw my therapist was in February 2020 and none for my doctor that is responsible for the prescriptions. 

I started taking medications in October 2018 and started with 2 types and the dosage increased dramatically. The doctor also prescribed me with new medications along the way. By February 2019 I was on 7 different types of medication. Obviously I wasnt taking all 7 types 3/4 times a day. Some of it was just for before bed. Anyways it was pretty much those 7 medications with probably 1-2 more along the way. I manage to cutdown on the types of medications by myself. By jan 2020 i was taking only 3 types of medications to sleep and 2 anti anxiety ones(reduced from 3 times a day to only when needed. By may 2020 i was only on the 3 types of meds i take for sleeping. 

I started having very minor anxiety issues on and off since end of December 2020. It doesn’t affect me much. 

Should I see my doctor and therapist or do I go to a new one? 

My concern is apparently its unsafe and impossible to get off benzodiazepines. 

Thank you so much in advance!"

My mom and dad are kinda like divorced not by certification yet but it has been more than 5 years that they have never talked with each other even before that they were nevar like couple. My mom is 15 year younger than my father that might be a reason. It was a arrange marriage forced by family pressure.

Back to my mental illness So, I’ve diagnosed with these problems and I don’t think anyone in my family understands this so, since I’ve self diagnosed. I’ll also treat this by myself without medication. I will be active on various community and observe everyone’s problems and help myself relating to them. Search on google about treatment. I believe I can. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Don’t suggest something too fancy for me like going to therapy or talk with my family. That’s too western for us.

1469,Can anyone help me figure out what's happened to me?,"I, as far as I know, am free of mental illnesses. I am a healthy teenaged boy, with confidence in who I am and pride in the things I do. Other than having no real direction in what major to choose, my life is pretty alright.

But last night, something came over me. At first, I was just listening to some sad love songs, like normal, but I got restless, and started playing my guitar. I've only been playing for a few months so I only know one song, but for some reason I kept getting extremely irritated with it. I'm never usually a perfectionist, but any time I made any mistake, I had to start over what I was playing, and I was playing as fast as I possibly could. Eventually I found that it wasn't enough, so I pulled out my sketchbook and started drawing, and I turned on some melancholy post rock, and again it just wasn't perfect enough, and I got irritated with it. Looking at my sketchbook now, I think both of my drawings look pretty good. At the time, though, I got so frustrated that I threw my pencil across my room. 

Then, I decided I needed to leave, like I need to escape my room. I had no idea where I was going, but I felt like throwing things and kicking things on my way there. I got to the top of a hill and threw myself down it, twice. I got up again, wandered for a bit more, and finally stopped at a grotto to pray, where I cried a bit and calmed down.

I've never really felt like this before, and I'm wondering if it was some kind of panic attack, or a symptom of something else. Can anyone help me identify what was going on with me last night?"
1470,emotional neglect from childhood - effects in adulthood,"does anyone else feel that their parents just dont UNDERSTAND? that they dont really listen or HEAR you? sometimes I feel like im overreacting. do I have the right to feel this emotional neglect that I realised I have been carrying all the way into my 20s? then I question why im the one who notices the affects of our parenting and why my siblings dont have the same problem. I feel unheard, there's so much miscommunication, I can't voice the problem or else im ""talking back."" we grew up being cared for, fed, everything. but im talking about a deeper level. as we got older and could feed ourselves and take of ourselves, its as if the parenting job was done. the way im spoken to, with no respect, no care for my feelings, no validation for anything. now I realise I have problems communicating in other relationships because I could never come home and voice what I was feeling. I never thought, ""hey let me talk to my mom about this problem in my life"" because I just didn't feel safe. I felt it would be seen as a weakness or unvalidated. the only thing I can think right now is, im going to parent my kids in a different way. im never eVER going to make them feel this. im never going to be the mom who's sleeping peacefully while her kids are crying in bed feeling like they can't come talk to me. am I making sense? I feel like im rambling. now that I've reflected these past few years, I feel that a lot of my characteristics are a result of neglect and emotional trauma from the way I was raised. im afraid of confrontations, im a perfectionist, I hate things not being in control, im sensitive, im way too attached to my parents and home for some reason that I can't explain? someone please tell me what this all means.

1479,Sleep cycle and hypomania,"It's usually a trigger, but then again, it's not always a trigger which leads me to ask...what comes first?  The lack or sleep or the hypomania?

I miss it.  I miss feeling productive.  I get the best of both worlds.  I get my alone time until 3, sometimes 4, then wake up at 6 or 7 on the dot.  I have energy to get out of bed - no, too much energy, so much that I actually jog.  Me!  To be honest, I probably feel good because society deemed it healthy.  Doesn't matter, I feel good.  

I opt for podcasts on my way to work. TV no longer interests me. I clean, something I usually can't bring myself up to do. I no longer daydream and escape my problems, instead, I'm ready to take on the world.  Sure it has it's draw-backs - lack of sleep will get you that. Paranoia, lack of attention to details, brain fog, unable to empathize with sad people, etc.  But it's worth it.  Because when this short window of opportunity is gone, I go back.

It starts with a few simple, ""I don't want to"" or ""I don't feel like doing..."".  Then slowly it morphs.  I no longer want to clean, not even my body.  I sleep 8 hours yet I crave, no obsess over sleep. I can't get up.  It's no longer ""not about me"", it's ""everything's about me"".  The whole world is against me.  The whole world hates me, why can't they xyz??  The paranoia and anxiety takes a different turn.  I'm bitter. Sad. Mad.  I avoid people.  All I do is daydream or netflix until my brain turns to puddle.

I've tried to keep the hypomania up.  It works, but the anxiety becomes too much.  I wake up with a pounding heart.  I have to talk to someone, right now.  I have to do something, right now.  I get paranoid - like conspiracy theory paranoid.  It turns into anxiety attacks.  Then panic attacks.  But I feel good, I don't need help, no you don't get me, suddenly you're all against me.  But instead of settling enough to netflix and daydream, I turn it into action.  And that's when I know I have to go back to my lazy slob state or I will spiral out of control."

1482,"Sometimes I wonder, when will I actually feel better when everything was made for chaos",".:Trigger Warning Content:.

I don't know if I can go onto details much. I never went into therapy before nor did I call anybody for help that much.

I am just clearly understanding that most of the beginning of school year. I'm so brain dead ever since October came, my concentration was affected badly as well.

Online learning is difficult already, I had no understanding anymore about our lessons but then again, people made me feel worse at this point. I couldn't continue at all after one of my teachers with the similar subject as my junior highschool teacher of 8th grade being slightly strict and mocks other students. I'm usually the quiet type at school. I was literally traumatized knowing I got the same treatment for somewhat being such a weakling, but one thing affected me more was when I was so confused and asking what part of the thing I was supposed to do, the only class member just shames me for what happened to me that day, and I never knew her at all really. I can't really help on school projects nor do my homework/projects anymore after so much time trying to cooperate but everything is just a mess on doing those projects/group activities in a group chat. I feel such a disappointed to my teachers, knowing I'm failing badly.

Other than that, I still live with my own mother whom neglects me for who I am, or at least treats me like I shouldn't have been born at all. I tried asking in another reddit before school became more chaotic for me but it didn't go so well... All I know is that everything affected middle to late childhood years from her side. I can remember things to take care of my pets, I can tell my mum wouldn't care anymore if one of my special cats got catnapped. his name was ""floof"" and was a normal street kitten that had experienced trauma from his previous ""home"" (a.k.a our neighbor's boss' office) at 1 and a half months old I believe, before our neighbor got him and was gently put in a small box. He was my therapy cat to be honest, he helped me out at times when I was having a hard time but had a subtle moments of zoomies which my mum didn't liked at all. 8-9 months of looking for him and sending missing posts in specific groups, nobody replied nor saw him at all. Anyways, my mum never really treated me right at all before much except if I wanted anything from the store/shops when we get money. If I try to clean things specifically (I was not taught properly since growing up, I'd act like a kid a lot but it became less and less), my mum would call me slow and would take that role instead even if there were already similar actions on doing so that made no sense. My mum wouldn't care of my mental state, she would call me an ""addict"" for being on the computer or saying my drawings would usually be ""demons"", even though they are not. Sometimes she would embarrass me to the neighbors or my brother, even would also talk about comparing me to other ""successful"" mutuals which I get easily offended and mad for that reason but I was also brokenly crying at the inside. It's so much discouragement my mum gives me. My mum would tell me I should get a job that even describes something that isn't suitable for me, and I don't want to go underemployment nor unemployed due to low trained skills on socializing or cleaning (I already am planning to have a job that makes me feel comfortable with, and it's not the one my mum picks for me). I can still remember that trauma moment when I was almost woke up early in the morning but my mum had to kick and hit me with a clothing hanger in the back then getting yelled at, which forced myself to not go to school after that day, and I was only at high school that time. Even this decade, she doesn't know I was in contact atm with someone, when she called me an addict, she tried to harrass me verbally so much about my own life being a ""failure"". And he was furious knowing how terrible I felt after the aftermath, even heard the whole conversation (he may have not understand it much but he heard so much fuming in the call).

I really don't know what to do. I tried contacting a suicide help number or at least an emergency number from my country but it's either not available nor does it exist for mobile (those contact number info was most likely found from the internet). I want to get therapy but I don't have enough for it yet. If I asked my older brother for help about the situation, he would just tell my mum the situation too and then fuming will start, which gives me more trust issues into this family of mine. I'm just lost now that most of my life is just being wasted by lack of living what's best for me. I'm very unstable emotionally and mentally, and full of frustration now a days. I can't really relax my mind at all."

Reality is only what I perceive it to be and there's no way to prove that other people are conscious. I've been going down a rabbit hole &amp; feel super paranoid right now. My mind is looking for proof that this is all a delusion, and there's proof everywhere simply because there truly isn't any way to know anything with certainty.

I use to love drawing and I completely quited for over 6 months now

It’s great for days when I’m lazy, but I feel the lack of stimulation is eating away at my brain. I’m considering a new job but I have enough savings to chill for a couple weeks.

I find myself doing things that I don’t want to do, things that I know aren’t constructive, that aren’t going to make me happy. I say things without thinking about the consequences. I behave in a way that just isn’t me. I wish I could just stop everything, hit a reset button and try this whole thing all over again.

I almost feel like I’m not me. Drama, chaos and dysfunction surround me. And the worst part is that I’m attracting it, I’m doing this to myself and I don’t know why and I can’t stop.  I’m saying things that I know will trigger other people, I’m doing things that I know are going to cause my life a great deal of stress and pandemonium. I take action on things that I should just leave alone.  

I don’t know how to stop and relax. I want to find inner peace, I want my life to be at peace. I want to describe my life as peaceful, mellow, quiet and serene. I just don’t know how to get there, I literally feel out of control in every way shape and form and it’s miserable."
1492,4 year tornado of regrets,"So I don't know where to start. I'm 33 and I have 3 kids. A few years ago, I was pregnant with my 3rd child. My partner was a stay at home dad and I really thought that he could be doing more around the house and I used to come home pretty pissed off. I still had to do all the laundry and most of the cleaning while he raised our boys who went to pre-k part-time. We had a dog too who didn't take a liking to me, mostly because I was often filled with anxiety and anger and didn't really know how to work through my emotions. Once he got a job I had to change my whole schedule to fit his job (I worked retail/sales) and had to switch from full-time to part-time which wasn't terrible because I was pregnant and exhausted. I was so sick with this pregnancy! Getting to the regret...

I kind of pushed us to move. See we were living in a 2 bedroom apartment but I felt like it wasn't enough room and I didn't like the area (it was fine, I miss it now) and I was just full of hormones and emotions and thoughts from other people that ""I deserved better."" You know, the shit entitled white people tell underprivileged white people who look know how to dress well with Goodwill clothes :-) So we moved into a ""nicer"" community that was way more than we could afford. I pulled them from a Pre-K that they really liked and carted them to my Dad's or Grandma's in between our work shifts. After I had my daughter, we got rid of the dog because he was aggressive towards me and my oldest and I don't blame the dog, I was a shit owner and didn't see it at the time.

Well, during maternity leave, my job location closed and I was laid off. I was like great! I finally get to be home with my kids and I just got my middle son in Pre-K and my oldest was in kindergarten and I was having a great time with my daughter and then we got a kitten! She was so awesome and was my shoulder kitty and cuddled with everyone, but she did like to get out and it was hard keeping her inside.

I ended up working at an old job I had and it was so toxic, my anxiety took a turn for the worst and I would call out for the most insignificant things and ended up quitting with a 3 weeks notice because I couldn't handle it anymore. My partner was disappointed with this move from the beginning so he definitely was ready to move once my unemployment ran out all together. I was struggling to find any other work and we eventually needed to move and my Dad let us stay with him. We stayed with him for about 6 months which meant I needed to switch my kids school, pull my middle son out of pre-k for the 2nd time and my oldest went from part-time to full-time kindergarten. He did really well and he liked his friends, the parents at this school were absurdly rude but whatever it is what it is.

We moved again, now this time we bought a house... WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING FOR AT THE VERY FIRST PLACE BUT I WAS IMPATIENT AND PUSHY.

Fast forward and I got a full-time job, the kids are in daycare and in a school and it's good but I have mental health issues so they crept up. I had a panic attack at work, it's another toxic environment but it's in an open office so you can't really get away from it. I end up getting a second job at night because it would allow me to quit the first, get the kids out of daycare (it was literally eating my paycheck), and stay home if they are sick without getting in trouble at work.

Well, one day I was rushing to the second job, my cat got out.... We couldn't find her, 2 days later, we get a call that she's dead. I am fucking devastated, she was the chillest cat and every time I think about that day I want to kill myself because I know I am the cause. I was rushing, I told him to look for the cat, but he was home with 3 kids... I was just an ass hole. I cry when I think about her or the place we moved from. Now my middle son needs special education classes and I blame myself because I was always so angry and I couldn't relax and just be there when it mattered for my family. I feel like I'm always stuck in my own head. I don't feel like I ever do anything right and it has been eating away at me for the past 4 months...

I just don't know how to get over these impending thoughts of being a failure. I can't be positive and say I'm a smart wonderful woman because my history shows me I'm not. Every day I wake up and just try to be better for my family but my depression and angry just make me either distant or mean. I've tried medication, I've tried therapy. I've tried mushrooms, I smoke weed for anxiety. I just hate myself most of the time especially when I think about us moving the first time, the poor dog we gave away, and my cat. I know my son will catch up but I just feel a lot of blame inside for that too.

This was really long, I didn't mean for it to be but I really don't have people to talk to. Like I just legit suck as a human."
1493,(Another) Depressive episode.,"So, I've been having depressive episodes that last three or four days, then I have a ""normal"" day or two and then back to a depressive episode. (I'm waiting for a diagnosis). I haven't been able to get up from bed so I decided it will be better if I try to make myself comfortable. My neck and back hurt really bad from laying down all day. I'm about to take a shower and change the bed sheets. I need advice, what can I do while I wait for this to pass? I don't know what to do with my neck anymore, all I do is take painkillers. Also, any YouTube channels/Netflix movies or shows to watch? I'm just too tired to do anything else."
1494,can a bipolar person recognize that he is bipolar?,"hey

can a bipolar person recognize that he is bipolar?

and

can events in the life of a bipolar person influence their episodes, I mean, episodes of depression and euphoria?

ps: sorry for my bad english."
1495,i'm tired..,"i'm in a sticky situation.

i am too mentally unstable to care for myself. i can bathe, groom, and take care of myself in that sense, but i have an eating disorder and quite a few clinically diagnosed mental illnesses that make things like working and going out in public very difficult and stressful.

my mother is the only family i have left and acts as a caregiver for me, but the problem is that i'm more like a caregiver for her because she's a heroin addict. she has ODed twice and i've had to save her, so whenever she's here i hardly ever sleep because i have to watch her.

not sleeping and constantly stressing over whether she's gonna od or not takes a toll on my mental health. 

obviously i know everyone's gonna link recovery sources and such, but she doesn't want to recover. she knows what recovery is and how to go about it, but she just doesn't want to.

i don't know what to do. this makes me feel very exhausted and paranoid 24/7. i'm feeling like i'm almost at my wits end.."
1496,Brain Fog,"Dk wtf is going on rn and it feels very foreign to me even though I’ve been in this same valley of brain fog for a good 2 years now. 

I think my biggest issue is being unsure whether what I think I’m capable of is actually me/ what I am capable of. I question this a lot. I’ve been pretty average in pretty much every sense though I like to think that I can learn pretty quickly and I’m very good with just observing others actions and doing a quick 2+2.

Dropped out of school at age 18 (I turn 20 the coming May) shit I was meant to do (usual entrepreneur bs) just didn’t end up happening, now I’m at my lowest and each day it’s a different issue playing in my mind- different issue out of a catalog of about 173 of them.

I don’t even post anything like this or even anything on anywhere, overall pretty reserved, but it’s just 4 walls and me right now. 

Either it’s a day of being the small me or the person I want to become steering my mind and body, I guess my main question is: 

how do I know if the me that feels better is actually right and not just blinded by optimism?


Genuinely appreciate any traction this gains, hope to help any others that are also feeling this way."
1497,How do I tell my parents that they're punishing my sister wrong?,"My little sister (15) has recently been falling very behind on school work and is being punished for it by my parents. They've decided to take away all of her devices unless it is for doing online school work, and I am not allowed to discuss anything that is not related to school work with her (so no mutual interests like book series and tv shows etc).

Now my sister is a very imaginative girl who can easily get lost in her thoughts of various fictional worlds, choosing to spend her time reading and looking at various fan content of the things she likes. She also has a lot of trouble making and maintaining friendships simply because many people find her annoying. Given we are in a pandemic and she can't go to school to see anyone, her only resort is to interact through social media. However the few friends she has don't seem to be reaching out to her. 

My point is she doesn't have anything else to do outside of school work besides indulging herself into these fictional worlds and her imagination. However, parents believe this is the cause for her struggles with school work (and to a certain degree it is, sometimes she wouldn't put enough time or effort in her work and choose to spend the remaining time reading fanfiction or looking at memes) and have chosen to cut her off from them completely. But from what I know of my sister's personality and behaviour this is not going to help the way my parents think it will. They hope that she'll shift her focus back on school work and abandon her other interests, but all it will do is cause her to become depressed and angry. She'll just end up hating them and when/if she gets her devices back she will be even more obsessive because she'll have been deprived of all her interests. Her school work will suffer because she won't have any real motivation to work hard. 

How do I convince my parents that they are going to cause more harm than good by punishing her like this?"

1499,AIs from AI Dungeon 2 to sexy to funny and one based wholly on Reddit!,[removed]
1500,What are we supposed to do now,I hate it when I have a problem and people tell me to go look things about about my problem like cool now I have information about that what the hell do I do with it now I have no outlet for this information all I have now is more questions now my anxiety and depression are even higher and now
1501,Decided to post here regularly and do some journaling and give updates on my situation,"I'll be posting here every once and a while and try to profoundly articulate my situation of loneliness and isolation. First of all, this is a kind of a long read, sorry I didn't know how to inroduce my self in another way. Context: male 24, MA student, still living with my parents (I'm not from America), I live in a small town yet I lost contact with all of my local acquaintances and friends, my neighbors also. I have three close friends and they all live far away, we meet occasionally, and chatting on social media is starting to feel absurd and meaningless. I fear that I might lose them and become utterly alone. In college, all of the friends I made either moved to another college or dropped and found a job, I don't know my current classmates very well due to pandemic related procedures, and all the talking I do with them online is related to projects and assignments, I didn't make that good of an impression anyway. I have social anxiety, mild depression, borderline disorder, and very low assertiveness and emotional strength because of my damaged self image. To conclude, when I'm home I spend all of my time inside the houe, when I'm studying, I chat casually with my classmates but never go beyond that. Like said I'll be journaling here occasionally in the hope of getting some insights and ideas from people like me. Hope you're all doing well."
1502,Quarantine finally taking a severe toll,"I've been doing a really solid job of managing my mental health throughout the pandemic but I've been kind of scared of my thought patterns recently.  I have high-risk people in my household so I have been only seeing a circle of the same 3-4 people since March of last year. I talk to my friends who live far away from me every now and then, but the longer the pandemic goes forward the more I feel myself being distanced from the people I love. I'm losing interest in most of my goals, I feel very insecure and unmotivated and disconnected and I'm struggling to find a way to feel hopeful. I have had a lot of grief recently due to deaths in the family and have had a lot of past trauma coming up and I don't want to be a burden to those around me who have been so happy that I was doing really well for most of last year. I just feel like I'm getting older, less motivated, less connected to joy, less inspired, and much more insecure and anxious. I am just kind of rambling at this point, I just need to know what people are doing to stay connected to joy and not get consumed by being stuck with your thoughts all day alone."
1503,Why do I always cry over such stupidly small things?,"I mean its so small and stupid but I get so upset and irritated by it. Like for example, I was asked if I wanted to do something and I said yes but now I cant do it and it's just got me lying on my bed crying my eyes out. Its such a stupidly small thing as well like nothing in my life would've changed if I did it and it would barely affect me at all but I'm still all choked up about it."
1504,I am at my breaking point.,"I thought that I would be fine at this point in my life. Backstory is that I grew up with a very manipulative mother due to that, I developed anxiety and am terrified of her. She is not physically abusing, but she indeed is emotionally and mentally abusive.  I left to college in order to be away from her and I had felt like my mental health was at a rise. Due to covid I had to move back home with her and I had thought that things were different. Everything was going fine until she began to go back to her old ways with me. I am 20 years old and I feel so useless. I have goals and dreams I want to achieve, but the way my mom has had such an impact in my mind, no matter what I do, I feel nothing. I seek for her validation and I never get it, as hard as I try to woo her and show her what I am able to do, she seems to ignore every bit of it. If I do not do something she likes, she will simply ignore it or invalidate my efforts. At this point I do not feel comfortable with myself and just spend my days doing what I can to make her happy rather than even consider my own sake. I never am truly happy, I just put a smile on my face because if not, I will get called out and humiliated by my own mom. I wish I could just ignore it but after 20 years of it, I simply can never get it done. I live with the hope of someday she sees what I do for her, because I know my siblings whom she is truly proud of will never sacrifice what I do for her. I feel so lost right now with my own self. I just put a persona with the people around me to show I'm fine even though I am not. I just am alive at this point, but I am not living. It pisses me off how I am so capable of things, but can't do it out of mental blocks. It is more clear than ever that I have anxiety again, and I no longer know what to do mentally with myself. I am at my lowest, but nobody knows."
1505,Sexual problems after partners infidelity,"A little bit of backstory. For the past one and a half years I had a long distance relationship with a girl from another country, unfortunately we weren't able to meet at all last year, due to the pandemic. But at least we were texting and talking every wake minute of every day, besides when she was spending time with her male ""best friend"". I was very suspicious from the beginning, because there were a lot of occasions that seemed unusual for a normal friendship, but she was always able to convince me that they just have an unusual friendship and he's just like a brother to her. I guess love really does make blind. She was often joking about my jealousy and teasing me about them doing sexual stuff. And again I believed that she was only joking. Two months ago she finally confessed to me that they are friends with benefits and that since the beginning of last year and now she developed feelings for him. Now I know that all the, often detailed, ""jokes"" were in fact true and I can't get the images out of my head. So besides the usual heartbreak after a breakup, I now have those painful images of them, that haunt me all the time. But the biggest problem is, that every time I see, read or think something slightly sexual, I immediately think about all the sexual practices with him she ""joked"" about and that creates a feeling similar to a panic attack. By now I feel almost phobic to anything sex related. I have dealt with breakups before, but this is the first time in my life that I've been cheated on, and the first time I'm feeling this way and I really don't know what to do. Has anyone else maybe been in a similar situation and has some tips or advice for me? Thank you all in advance for your help and I apologize for possible grammar or spelling mistakes, english isn't my native language."
1506,"how to not beat yourself up after a ""setback?""","recently, I've been so proud of the healing I've given myself space to do. in fact, just last night I realized how much progress I have made in the past few months specifically in regards to my self-worth and sense of self. 

earlier today I was scrolling through social media (which historically has had negative effects on me, so I've learned to distance myself from it). I saw something on my feed that triggered me and caused me to spiral into old, dangerous thinking patterns before I thought to pause and reground myself. now I can't shake this feeling that I've ruined all of the healing I've done; even going so far as to think that the progress I've made must not be sufficient enough because I was triggered by something that I feel should not cause this reaction in me. 

I'm familiar with the phrase ""healing is not linear,"" and I am trying to remind myself of that right now. it's just so difficult to take it to heart. I know I could have prevented this if I had just not been on social media in the first place. I could have chosen to immediately stop myself from entertaining these anxious thoughts but I didn't. 

how do you deal with discouraging moments like this where you feel like you've been set back?"
1507,NEED OPINION ON RECONCILIATION,"Hey everyone, i am 23yo guy and a middle child. My siblings were better in school than me. i didn't achieve anything in school, while my younger sister went to various competition and my brother had a good rapport. Ever since i was a kid my parents (esp my mother) often used high intonation or comparing me to their friend's children and of course, my siblings. I know their intention was good, but made me struggle back then. I struggled with self-love, self-acceptance and confidence.

Throughout my high school and college years, I was struggling with it. I thought that by talking to her, she would share her pespective and helped me to understand her better. So in my 23rd birthday, I wanted to talk to my mom about this, hoping to understand her better. I tried to explain it slowly without any sarcastic remarks and I apologized to her for my mistakes. However, my mother didn't think what she did was harsh and I just tried to offend her. She never admit that sometimes the way she talked was harsh.

shortly, It became a family gossip, especially when she told my older brother about it and just now he mocked me with it. I love my mother and brother, I really do. But to be honest, I don't know what to do next."
1508,Virtual visit experiences?,"Has anyone had any experience with virtual visits since Covid 19? I was getting treatment a few years back, lost my job, and haven't been able to afford treatment until now. I was recently ""promoted"" to taking escalated calls and I have noticed that since then it is getting harder to manage my symptoms without the help of medications. I wish I could leave my job and find something that doesn't take such a toll on me mentally but finding a work from home position has been near impossible so it looks like I HAVE to find a way to manage my brain to keep myself afloat financially. I was taking Alazopram and Prozac. I know that most virtual doctor's will not prescribe controlled substances but getting back on Prozac should be enough for me to manage getting screamed at by hateful people all day. I am stress eating, can't focus to save my life, always tired but never able to sleep, and my emotions and motivation are spiralling. Any advice on virtual visits would be greatly appreciated so I can get back to normal and manage this awful job."
1509,help me,"hi, guys.  i'm thiago and i'm 15 years old.

 first i want to apologize for my english, i'm from brazil and i don't know how to speak or write in english.  well, beginning ... I wanted to post this here as an outburst, I really wanted to share this anguish within me.  i feel a strange feeling inside me at that moment it is as if the days are all gray and monotonous, and the time is passing very slowly but i want it to pass soon so that a moment of fun arrives soon.

 this is very strange, this feeling of wanting time to pass quickly, because usually I always want it to pass as slowly as possible because whenever I have fun it passes very fast and I keep thinking like uow, that feeling of happiness has already become one  memory, ours passed very fast.  I feel useless now and I just want to advance the death process, because we will die anyway.

 I was doing very well a few months ago, I was exercising, on a balanced diet, studying and I felt happy or at least normal.  now this bad phase comes and hits me all over the face.  I start to see some things, that I didn't notice before, like that we lost our whole life working for a capitalist system and we arrive at death and we are forgotten and we become just one more.

 I can't describe it and it makes me angry. fuck you fyck you 
fuckeveryone im fuckin exhaysted
what should i do"
1510,Getting into old habits after finally getting a job (first time at age 30),"I've always been my worst bully. I think about myself the most terrible things and say the meanest most toxic things. I can't help it just how it goes in my mind. When I'm not doing that , ""I'm second guessing myself at every step you cant do this"" or ""they'll know you're fake or incompetent"" are all I can think no matter how good I am at something.  

For the past year or so , the thoughts have been alot less intense since I took some meds about a year ago.

After a life of being unemployed (and thinking that I was unemployable) , I somehow found a job. It pays next to nothing  and I have to deal with some office drama but beats being at home all the time.

I'm still in my first week but but I feel that old pattern emerging where I doubt myself and talk myself at every thing. I cant seem to let my real self shine through.  I feel my brain is completely locked. I feel much slower that normal and I dont know how to deal with it. I get so insanely nervous over little things that i feel a fire is in my chest in stomach (i have IBS which definitely doesn't make anything easier)

I was a little happy for getting a job on my first day but this feeling is making me hate it."

1512,ECT and memory loss,"Hey there. I just wanted to get some feedback. A few years ago I started receiving electroconvulsive therapy for my treatment resistant major depression and body dysmorphic disorder. Any way I started bilateral but ended up going unilateral. I had a total of 99 treatments and eventually had to stop in Jan 2019 d/t severe memory loss. My short term memory has recovered but my long term hasn’t returned. I don’t remember many major events in my life, such as wedding day, IVF, my entire pregnancy and didn’t really even start to remember things with my daughter until she was about 3 months old. ( I continued with ECT throughout my entire pregnancy)I feel so sad about the loss of these memories. I also had to stop nursing as I forgot all my schooling. Anyway I was just curious if anyone has experience with ECT and long term memory loss. Did your memories eventually come back?  And the kicker is I’m still struggling with my depression. Thanks for any responses."
1513,I feel unloved by my family,I feel unloved by my family because my mum and dad let my older brother get a way with more stuff then I do for example my brother locked me in a pantry for 10 minuets and my mum instead of her helping me she actually told my brother to keep me in longer another example my dad said to me can you get me another beer I said no he got mad and shouted at me my dad Oder brother on the other hand when he declines when my dad asks him to get him a drink he gets a way with it as my dad usually says oh that’s fine I feel like my family are choosing favourites it’s also not as easy when I’m being bullied at school and it continues over into my home by always getting shouted at any advice would help thank you
1514,Coping Skills,"Hello World! 

  I have recently stopped using my two coping skills I’ve relied on for years and years because they are doing harm and no good for my mental health! I’ve been working full time in healthcare during this pandemic and I have two young children so life’s stressful. Most days I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown. 
  I was hoping you all could share your coping skills to help me learn some new healthier ones!"
1515,I am so depressed,I know I have a good life. I know I have a nice apartment and family. I have a boyfriend who I love and he loves me and tolerates all my shitty problems. Found a good job with a good pay but no matter what I do and/or have I feel unhappy. I barely have friends. And the few I have they live 2k miles from me. I cant visit them because all the money I have goes to fucking student loans and bills. Go a certification in a career that I know I like but now that I have a job i dont know what the fuck I am doing and it makes me unhappy. I dont think I am a good girlfriend. Yesterday I got mad at my bf and punched him. I regret it so much. All I want to do is sleep and cry all day. I am always mad. for everything. And therapy is not helping.
1516,"I never realised how bad feeling suicidal was, until I felt it.","I’m suicidal right now. I’m 15F. I’m falling behind on my school work, which is all online. I’ve had 3 of my teachers email me for my lack of work. One of which was checking up on me. I can’t force myself to do anything. I just don’t want to be here anymore, I just want to be gone. I relapsed after one year of self harm (I threw my blades away, 5 days clean today). I can barely function. All I can do is eat and sleep. I need to do my work but I can’t. My physics teacher who checked up on me is nice, but I can’t tell her what’s wrong. I want to tell my history teacher about my thoughts but because I’m at home, I can’t. I can’t just email my teachers saying I’m suicidal, because it isn’t really the sort of thing you can email someone about. I have no idea when I’m going back to school. I have no idea what to do. I can’t do anything. I can barely get out of bed...I’m academically smart, I’ve always been a straight A student, but for the past couple years my mental health has rapidly declined (after being diagnosed with epilepsy, grandpa died of cancer, bullying ect). I don’t know how to tell my teachers I’m struggling without it sounding like a lame excuse or telling them too much and I end up in safeguarding AGAIN. How do I tell them I’m not doing good without it sounding lame?"
1517,How can I stop being obsessive?,"I've always obsessed over things like tv shows, books I'm reading, videogames or doing things like going to the gym, etc. I mean truly obsessed, like pretty much only thinking about that throughout the day.

This may not seem like a  very important thing, which is half true, it's not like a mental disorder or anything like that. But I believe that it affects my day to day, like for example, ill find a show and ill-spent the next 3 days only watching it the whole day, and when it ends I spent a week watching videos on youtube about it or rewatching it and thinking about it all day.

After some time I just forget about the subject until I find another thing that I obsess about. 

I'm sure there's a lot of people who go through this, with varying degrees so I would really appreciate some advice on the subject, thank you!!"
1518,I forget everything ..,"Is that normal?? I tend to forget every big inconvenience that happens to me in detail. For example, If I had a fight with my parents and I’m in a really bad mood, when I try to vent or even write about it, my mind goes blank. I literally remember nothing. It’s a big blur. I started to try to write things right away to remember but still.. I thought that only happened when you have really bad trauma??"
1519,I need help,Hey guys so since the start of my first year in college I’ve been having really bad anxiety and even panic attack recently. I believe it comes from my passion of not doing school due to COVID. And I know many people think this way as well. But recently I’ve been having bad anxiety and panic attack which causes me to have loss of appetite and a high heart rate. Also sometimes I would cry which is something that I would never do. Also I find it hard at night to sleep. Please give me advice thank you.
1520,I'm changing my life for the better (and finally seeing results!),"I'm not sure if anyone will see thisI'm a sophomore in high school, and the past two years have kind of been hell for me. Anxiety and depression led me to procrastinate immensely, and although I've been scraping by with good grades, my mental health's really suffered. I consistently got less than six hours of sleep a night, I felt extremely guilty constantly that I wasn't trying harder, etc.

Now, it's not like all of that's changed. Especially the guilt, that's still a huge monster that I've had to face. But, after vowing to quit watching YouTube and TikTok and BE PROACTIVE, I've really noticed a difference. I'm starting my work earlier, and not having to cram before deadlines. This week, I've gotten at least seven hours or more of sleep each night. I really surprised myself when I had to wake up at 6:15 this morning and it wasn't that difficult! I'm also really taking control of my hygiene; showering every night and being vigilant with my skincare routine, which is really helping my acne, yay! I've also started back therapy, which is putting me in a really safe space. I've got a long way to go, and perhaps I might eventually start to fall back on old habits, but for now, I'm feeling really on top of life!"
1521,Am I Not Okay Or Just Lazy?,"I am a girl, 18 and Distance Learning is giving me daily mental breakdowns, which results in even more procrastination

I've never liked school, I think the system sucks, but since I've always gotten good grades anyway, the whole topic never came up in my family.
When I started the school year, 8th and last grade, I was on the edge of quitting, because the thought of having to deal with the teachers and the stress drove me crazy. The year started out pretty okay anyway, and when we switched to distance learning I was more than happy, since it meant I could avoid meeting certain people and places.
But lately the pressure just completely takes over me. While in school I could at least go home and take a break, school is now all present every single day, even weekends and evenings. If I want to spend some time outside (I have a horse to take care of), it means to spend the whole evening working on tasks just to keep up.
I know my breakdowns, they come and go. Just this last one doesn't seem to go away. For the past two weeks I've cried every evening over all the undone stuff, and barely eat or sleep. This has happened before, but never this long. I try to keep it away from my parents, since I know it's a hard time for everyone, and I actually shouldn't complain about my situation, it could be so much worse. (Parents still got their jobs, own horse)
I'm in my last school year, it is just three more months of school and then my finals. My mom would tell me to keep going since it's not long anymore. But I'm so done with everything. And the worst is I feel so sorry for myself, that I don't even get to work anymore. Teachers keep emailing about missing work and new work and just more work. And I just want to avoid all the negative stuff, which results in even more bullshit do deal with. One week of hard work could probably fix most of it, but simply thinking of it is making me want to hide away. Furthermore I already gave up the idea of going to university (at least right after school) since I wanna give myself time. 

This is so messed up. I'm crying now just as I'm typing about this. I would really appreciate some opinions from strangers on this.

1522,mum won't let me get diagnosed and its seriously effecting me,"hello hi, my names Eddie (16f) and I need some help.
so idk what's happening with my brain but i know its not working how its supposed to, my friends know and so do my teachers.
my mum won't let me get diagnosed, I've been asking for two years and nothin.
every time I tell her i think I should get checked for something (mainly ADHD and autism) she laughs and brushes it off and we never talk about it again
I cannot focus, at all. when we play card games I have to stand up, I get distracted all the time, I disassociate, its all round not good. she keeps telling me to focus in class and I tell her I can't and she asks why but I can't explain it because I don't know.
all this has resulted in depressive episodes, anxiety and general numbness and/or frustration.

idk what to do but this is really getting to me. any and all help is appreciated
big love"
1523,Is there an end to therapy?,Is there any moment where one might realize they don't need therapy anymore or is it a constant battle that just drags on the rest of your life? Thinking about this makes it much harder to feel motivated to keep going to therapy. It makes me want to give up on therapy and just learn how to live with the struggles I have now.

Its hard to be okay. Im alone with my thoughts even when I try to be okay with me. I want to love myself. I want to be okay. Idk what to do. Idk where I am at my mental state. I thought I was okay but when something happens idk how to deal with it. Like my world could fall apart in meer seconds. Idek what makes me happy any more. I try to be self loving. I compliment me n I try to distance myself from others to be good. But idk if it works. 

I try to be a friend and idk how to. I can't have small feelings towards you. Idk what to do. Idk where to be okay. I wanna open up but I wanna shut off. Somedays are amazing n others are just days. I feel like a ghost in my own life. Even if people care, I don't feel good about it. I wanna be different, I wanna be accepted, I wanna be appreciated. But I wanna love myself the most. I'm not sure how to continue a path or selfloving of If I've even started it properly"
1525,Had Med Appt!,"My Probation Officer has been on my ass about not taking medication, so to shut her up, I now have agreed to taking Prozac (OMG sooooo stereotypical lol!) and continue the Melatonin, which helps me sleep. I have to only take a HALF of that medication because the full dose makes me groggy and slow the whole next day.

So good news! I am on something I have taken before (took Prozac a long time ago) and that I know will be OK for me. :) I am actually smiling.

(Besides, I have a whole bag of Tootsie Rolls here--how could I NOT smile about that!!!)

Ciao! Thanks for reading!"
1526,Never taught how to work.,"I(17m) had a realisation hit me very hard when I had to crunch a half year of schoolwork in two weeks and do a research project for school in the next two weeks and over that course I thought to myself why cant I do anything for more than 5 mins at a time and why can others just do schoolwork even when I try my best cant and it hit me. My parents never taught me any self discipline like making me do homework and checking it cuz they were too preoccupied with arguing with themselves. The only time I had some self discipline happened when I went to my grandmas house after school but only for like two months. Now I sleep uneasy because I have to teach myself self disicpline but I need self discipline to dedicate enough energy to do so but I cant, even when I try. And it doesn't help that I feel burned out form the school work. It doesn't help that my parents say ""Just do it. What's stopping you?"" 

Any suggestions on what to do?"
1527,buckle up...,"Hey people. 

New on here and new to seeking advice because I am literally at the point in my life in which my past is going to destroy my current and write off my future. Saddle up and hold on to your butts because this is going to make you think there is no hope for humanity.

Me: 37M, Married for 12 years, with my wife for 14 years. Both working professionals with good jobs, own a house, two cars and next to no debt. Almost the perfect picture. Almost.

Background:

My wife - perfect, cookie cutter background, childhood, education etc. Nothing here to see.

&amp;#x200B;

\*CAVEAT: I am in counseling but I need anonymous open opinions, not ""you need a psych eval."" Thanks. I'm asking for honest and friendly advice. Do not bother responding if you don't have any thing creative to add. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: 

I have a personality disorder, BPD to be specific. Until I was a teen, they had a functional relationship. Then my grandmother died. A catalyst in setting a toxic path. My mother went off the rails and became alcoholic, like uncontrollably and overnight a different person. This, in the same year my father was diagnosed with a brain disease that eventually killed him two years ago. Her erratic behavior resulted in multiple affairs on her part. Nothing my dad found out until at least a year later.      

He had a failed suicide attempt. Mom kept drinking. Kept sleeping around, denying it, disappearing sporadically. I once had a school friend call me (by now I was 15) - she was dead drunk in a local bar, flirting with just about anyone. I had to drive (no licence, took my dads car while he was on a work trip) and effectively rescue her from the bar. She screamed bloody murder at me and so did her friend who was always a slut and had her own fucked up marriage, encouraging my mother to be a free spirit. Now call it what you will - one must never call their own mother a slut but that is what she was. My father was a warrior, he fought and fought and forgave and forgave and believed every dirty lie she told. When he finally lost his shit, she called him a domestic abuser, called the cops and had him arrested. Then, after being charged with drunk driving, she confessed she made it all up.

Fast forward to 18, I met a woman 16 years my senior. Beautiful, bubbly and real breath of fresh air. But I was vulnerable. And I ended up paying. Through my naivety, we moved in after just 2 months. Primarily so I could escape the house from hell. She spent the next four years emotionally and financially abusing me. I accrued a shitload of personal debt while she was self sufficient and we agreed she would take over my finances. Again, through naivety I allowed her - but she did not allow me to see her finances. I missed all the signs - we argued, we made up. One day fine, next day not. I now understand that was a pure narcissist which scarred me for life. She physically attacked me with a wine bottle. This fight caused a neighbor to call the cops. Guess who got arrested? Not the bloodied teenager on  the floor. The screaming a hysterical woman who was 'defending herself' after an argument because she thought I was going to beat her. We reconciled after about 4 weeks. She had always withheld sex as a 'punishment' for each an every time I got on the wrong side of her. Yes - I should have ended it. Yes I was stupid. I get that now.

I had long suspected she cheated. But had no proof. If I asked her, she would fly into a manic rage and lock herself in the bathroom for several hours, not speak to me for at least two days. One day, we were at a traffic signal. A droptop car pulled up and the guy driving with his friends yells ""I've had her! I've had her, just a few weeks ago!""

Again, through my naivety I refused to believe some random asshole who was clearly drunk was a source of truth.

Fast forward to 21. My constant need to resolve blazing rows resulted in me getting fired from my job for spending too much time on the phone, being late etc etc etc. I leave work, go home and there she is, getting fucked by TWO guys. There was violence, people were hurt and I was stabbed. That was the end of it. I am scarred for life. 

\*DEEP BREATH\*

About three months later, I got my fairytale. Through a dating site I met the woman who is now my wife. A year younger than me. Instant love story, happiness. We did move in pretty fast but purely for logistical purposes as we lived so far apart. It was perfect. I shut out my abusive mother, effectively forgot about my poor father (I still regret this) and lived my fairytale. Bliss. We got married and had our first son. I felt like I had been pulled from my own life and dropped into a parallel world. By now, parents were divorced. Thank God. 

My wife knew my story from the outset and suggested I get some mental health guidance. I did and it did nothing but open a can of worms. I hated the world. I hated everyone bar her and was easily triggered by a whiff of infidelity, whether it be on TV or hearing about it through work colleagues. 

I eventually had a mental breakdown. Second son was born shortly after. Divorce was never mentioned. Intensive therapy meant intensive meds. I was diagnosed with CPTSD and BPD. I still to this day suffer flashbacks. My wife was and remained a wall of support, through addiction to Rx drugs - anti-psychotics (thanks to UK medical system) and benzos. Lots of alcohol. She went back to work and I had another breakdown. Our life started to fall apart. Sex has always been a crutch and the way I connect. It became too much and she told me so. I tried to reduce my libido and not bother her. In the end, vanilla sex was all we had. It became less and less frequent to the point that she told me that she just was not as interested in it as I was and tried everything to get me to see that constant sex did not mean a happy relationship. 

I found a sex toy of hers, a new one. I raged, triggered over the past. Was it just a sex toy or a lover? I  ended up self harming while she was at work. Never had I done such a thing, slashed my arms. 

We talked, we healed. Briefly. I carried on with my addiction. I became eternally paranoid SHE was being unfaithful. The sex toy was not the catalyst, as I had accused her before and all she replied with was with love and reassurance. Letters, begging and pleading for me to see that she was nothing of my past. But that was not enough. I became paranoid, frequently accusational. Yelling and screaming, calling her names with absolutely zero evidence and therefore wearing her down. I had security cameras installed because I was so hell bent on catching something that did not exist. I became my ex.

ABUSIVE. 

My stress got so bad, I had a fucking stroke at 30. Not a bad one but enough to fuck up my memory and speech/vision/hearing etc. And I did that to myself. I wish it had taken me. I really do. 

Fast forward to present day and we have emigrated from the UK to the US. I remain traumatized from my ex, the past. But here is the thing. That fairytale? Dead as you would imagine. She has tried to leave me three times now. Each time, I have 'hoovered' her (her words). The last time she tried, it hurt so bad I nearly ended up in the hospital. I acknowledge that this is selfish, but the fear of losing her felt like new trauma. I threatened suicide.  I acknowledge that this abusive. 

Once again, she has given me another chance. But the final one. No ifs, no buts. The last layer of ice. 

I am guilty of being everything that was given to me. I hate myself. I have never cheated. I fear she has. She tells me she is not that kind of person. I believe her. My illness makes me not. I worry, I fret. I look for things that are most likely not there.

The other day, we had good, passionate sex. But her body smelled like cologne  and not mine. (strangely on her thighs and nowhere else?) - Earlier that evening after I got home, she almost ran into the bedroom while I was in there getting changed. She initially said she was looking for a shirt she forgot to put in the washer. Later she changed that to ""I was just coming to see you, say hi.""

The better part of my mind says I am paranoid and I have no reason to believe what I think I am seeing here. She works from home and this is another issue. 

I am at the end of the line here. Even if I did end this relationship, I would never be able to have a functional relationship with anyone - nor would I want to risk fucking up another innocent soul. My kids are now fed up with the arguing and I am worried the cycle is endless. I am scared that they will not be able to have functional relationships if I don't do something. And pretty fucking quick. 

Help me, fellow redditors. I am a lost soul, guilty as charged but am pulling out all the stops to save a marriage and my children's future from complete ruin.  I am NOT, REPEAT NOT suicidal. Say what you want I will not respond to abusive comments. No one is perfect. I simply need some kind of advice. TIA."
1528,Feel like I should never have tried.,"I am having trouble feeling like I should ever have tried to get help. I finally decided to take time from work for the stress/anxiety that has built up for the last couple months to the point it started to cause me physical issues. I speak with my manager and they approve 2 weeks off. I then realize I will need some more time and contact my HR dept. They approve a FMLA leave for 30 days \[including the initial 2 weeks\] and I informed them that I hadn't found any DR. for an appt. yet, they say its fine as long as I get the paper work back to them within 15 days. 

All great, until I try to actually find help in that time. I have new insurance so have to go through 20 doctors to find 1 that can even do a new patient apt. for late January. I get the paper work that needs doctor approval which would be due the 28th. Can't find any in person support for mental health in my area that accepts my insurance.

I try and use the virtual DR. service my insurance provides, speak with a therapist who felt like little help in the short session she had open and was unable to approve a leave; recommends a psychiatrist. Speak with a DR. about my physical issues and he prescribes me medication, but similarly not willing to approve the leave. Decide to finally speak with a psychiatrist; asks me basic direct questions never really going further, he diagnoses me with clinical depression and anxiety, prescribes medication and a follow up a month later. When I ask about help with the FMLA leave, get told its too much work and not something he'd recommend. I pretty much tell him that I am at a breaking point and its the entire reason I did this in the first place, he asks direct questions again finally says he would approve it for Feb-March, but it can take weeks to get it back to me. 

I am now sitting here unsure what to do; I feel like I should never have bothered trying in the first place and just suffered through. I don't know if I can even get approval for my initial leave for Jan. Unsure if I want to bother taking the extended leave, or medication. I felt as if finally trying to get help wasn't any help and has caused me more stress than before."
1529,Don’t feel guilty for relaxing,"This is a goal of mine.

Currently, my roommate is out of town. So after work (I get out of work at 12pm) I decided to feed my dogs, and instead of walking them like I do right out of work, to take a bath. 1:30. I was in the bath. Now it’s 4:30. I’m not having a mental breakdown, I just love being in the bath! It’s so cold where I am, I am finding its warm relaxing. 

I don’t want to get out. I am writing this in the bath. The past hour I’ve been just thinking “I need to get out and do something productive” but I don’t. I’ve don’t need to do anything right now at all. I can relax. I can take a day off from walking my dogs. If I’m feeling at peace taking a day in the bathtub for four hours, I can! I’ve run out of hot water four times already, haha. 

Just know, I am currently in my happy place, and you should be too. If you feel unproductive, being productive could bring you happiness. But taking a day and relaxing should NOT make you feel guilty.

Thanks!"

I recently created my own YouTube channel to help others on their healing journey and raise the collective consciousness. I would love to hear from anyone else doing something similar. :) 

This really pushed me out of my comfort zone however it brings me great joy to know I may be able to help others. On my channel I discuss meditation, self concept, trauma healing and much more to come! 

Thanks for reading and I hope to see you there!

1532,Not getting attached?,I feel like i don’t really get attached to people and am confused as to why. I almost never think what someone might be doing while apart nor do I miss them. During covid I haven’t really missed hanging out with people although it is often nice when the time actually comes. (apart from the anxiety) Connecting with people has always been a struggle :/
1533,I don’t know what to do,"I’m just venting, probably not as bad as it seems to me right now in the moment so I probably just need to get it off my chest.

I live in Sydney, which you might have heard had a bit of a COVID flare-up recently, not huge, especially compared to most other places but enough to put a bunch of restrictions back into place. So I work as a bartender and as you can guess 90% of the restrictions are on bars and pubs or whatever which naturally means very low foot traffic, which is a good thing, I don’t actually want people going out to drink in the middle of a pandemic, but it also means that my shifts have been cut to almost nothing. Worse still, when I am at work I end up getting sent on break a lot more to save the company money, some nights for as long as 2 hours of unpaid breaks. Other nights it seems like they’re ignoring all the restrictions and allowing huge numbers in the door to make up for lost profit (last Friday it was shoulder to shoulder in the main room of the venue from 5pm until about 11:30pm) but despite allowing those numbers they’re only rostering a skeleton crew of staff, including axing security staff entirely. 

Before the restrictions I worked all the public holidays around Christmas and New Years expecting to get paid double time cause that’s the law here in NSW, only to find out I’d apparently signed some enterprise agreement when I started, forgoing any extra loading for public holidays (I also don’t get extra pay on Saturday and Sunday, again kinda an industry standard here, but I already knew about and agreed to that when I started).

We’ve also been accused of “stealing” by management in Facebook group chats because people were free pouring certain alcohols (heard this is pretty normal most places in the world, but NSW has the strictest alcohol laws in the world to my knowledge). Because of this “theft” we were all forced to undergo an exam they wrote up to prove we knew the measurements of all the cocktails on the menu, the punishment for failure being immediate termination. 

To top it all off this week I’ve gotten a bunch of messages from coworkers telling me they’ve been let go outta the blue, and now I’m just waiting to hear the same thing, never being sure whether I’m walking out for the last time after each shift.

I guess it’s just really stressing me out, I’d quit but as it is I’m not getting paid enough to cover basic living costs, having to drain my savings just to buy food. I’ve looked for other work but it’s obviously not a great market at the moment and the only thing I’ve got experience in is bartending, which obviously is an almost nonexistent job market right now.

Just not really sure what to do about it right now I guess."
1534,Hahahhahaa so like maybe something will work but I don’t feel it’s possible to change this! Let’s give it a go maybe? 😎😎,"So basically in summary I have some small fears about like confrontation. Lemme do some reddit stuff hahahah I’m [17M] wait no [18M] I just turned 18 whoops. So with every aspect of my life I won’t take anything seriously, this is with work, with intimacy, I struggle with simple day to day interactions, I can’t speak to anyone about anything going on in my life because- whoops I actually don’t know I just can’t. Anything I take even slightly seriously I hide that thing away from the world and let no one see it. I lie constantly about things that I know are insignificant and are easy to talk about for other people. I mean Jesus man I had a girlfriend last year for like a month- I never even told a single family member about it. Ofc it ended badly because ya know I couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t apply to a university this year and probably won’t go even though I know it’s very important. I don’t know how to believe in myself without fucking up and feeling terrible. I feel like I need to change something fast before shit gets out of hand, how the shit do I do that? 😎😎😎"
1535,I just found out that my friend was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. He wants to talk. How do I act?,"I found out from my (17F) teacher that my friend (18M) wasn't coming to school for two weeks because he's sick. I assumed he was physically sick and just sent him a text telling him to get well soon. We aren't the type of friends to stay in contact all the time, sometimes we go a few weeks without talking which is why I didn't know about this.
He proceeded to tell me that he had experienced ""something called psychosis"" and that it was an eye-opening experience because he ""finally understands the world"". Then he told me that he had met a 34 year old woman and is in a relationship with her (not sexually though) and he also came out to me as bi. For some reason he said that he found out that he is a genius and he understands humans perfectly and can analyse anyone's personality if he wants to (he has always been socially awkward). When he said he was a genius I didn't know that he was in the hospital and assumed that he took an IQ test to which he replied that he didn't. It was just something that ""he knows deep inside"".

After that he told me that he was in the hospital and has been for about 2 weeks now.. he said he isn't allowed to leave until they let him but for some reason he sounded (in some audio messages) really happy and optimistic (like he was maybe on medication?). He said strange things like: I just finally understand life and I finally understand myself and now I can live in peace and use my genius correctly, or something like that. He doesn't seem like himself at all but he said that I played a huge role in this experience for him. I don't know why he was admitted yet but he has already asked me to come visit him. I politely declined due to my full schedule but he really wants to talk to me on the phone tomorrow and tell me everything.
I don't know what he has been diagnosed with but he only mentioned psychosis.
I don't know how to act... I feel like saying the wrong things could maybe make his situation worse and I don't know how to talk to someone in that state of mind.

Does anyone have advice for me?"
1536,Short term disability/leave for mental health,"I’ve taken 2 of the past 8 works day off as sick days, and find myself struggling so much to make it through full 8 hour days. I’ve been working from home since the pandemic but lately I can’t focus. I started taking antidepressants about 2 weeks ago and I feel like I’m unpacking the weight of my mental health issues that I’ve been carrying since adolescence, and along with new side effects of the meds it’s absolutely crushing me.

Work has been incredibly stressful and my manager constantly makes me feel incompetent and struggles with communication. I understand this may partially be my anxiety, however my coworker shares similar thoughts. I feel like I can’t get myself together while working anywhere near 40+ hours a week.

I just had an intake call with a mental health center and have to wait 2 months for a psych assessment. 

HR and my manager are both aware I started medication that has an adjustment period. But I’m wondering what options there are for short term leave and how does it work? Do I go to HR first? Do I tell my doctor first? What kind of questions should I expect to have to answer? Any advice or personal experiences are much appreciated."
1537,Doppelganger hallucination/delusion? Anybody experience this?,"Hey all.

I'm a bit concerned with a recent experience I've had that's been playing on my mind. First of all I should note that I do have Schizoid Personality Disorder, and have thus had a history with mental health services that relate to this. I should clarify right off the bat, I do not believe that this experience is related to the aforementioned disorder, it's far too different and strange. I'd also like to note that I understand the first thing to do in a situation like this is to contact mental health services; I've already done so, and that's gonna' start to go through whenever, I'm mostly looking to get some reinforcement here.

I don't really know quite how to explain the experience other than 'I met another version of myself'. I was reading a book when I heard a knock at the window, I look up, and outside the window I see me. Not wearing the same clothes as I was, not like a reflection, I saw another version of myself at my window. After a second of obvious confusion I opened the window and we spoke. I honestly don't remember the exact words of what we spoke about, only that this other me was about as confused as I was, but that he remembered having the conversation before. After a minute or two he walked away and out of sight.

I live alone, and so I just kind of stood there like an idiot for about a minute before going to the door and looking outside. I couldn't find anything, so I went back in. I immediately got the immediate answers out of the way, the classic 'carbon monoxide' poisoning reddit likes to mention, etc. but I'm honestly at a loss for words. My old psychiatrist never mentioned the possibility of hallucinations but I have no other answers. Is this a common thing in terms of delusions? Should I be worried?"
1538,I don't feel I'm fit for the modern world,"The current pace of life, I just can not cope with it. 

I have burn outs every two years, even when I have things I like. Constant stress makes me thin like a ghost. 

I was doing my masters, that was really stressful. Now three weeks left to submit my thesis, and with homeschooling (I have 5 y.o. and schools are closed)  and some additional problems I just broke. 

It's such a shame to let your own self down just when you needed it most. Not that I am stupid, or lazy. I can't manage stress well. 

This leaves me feel doomed and regret lots of things."
1539,Extremely Strange Thing - When I take a nap (I extremely rarely take naps because of it),"This is kind of hard to explain, so please bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was a kid, if I was a little tired and took a nap I would sometimes go into this strange sleep. I don't consider it a deep sleep, I can hear everything around me and I can move my fingers and move around a bit and I know I am in some kind of rest mode (I feel refreshed after getting up)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so now what is strange about it? well I don't sleep talk but when I am in this mode I sometimes cry or say a few words, and when I was a kid it would warp my reality, sometimes it was stupid stuff like I took out the garbage (in the dream I did, but a few hours pass and my mom is asking why I didnt take out the garbage (it would take really dark turns and I would think it happened). It also makes me feel time differently, like I can sleep a half hour or a hour and a half and it feels like I been alsleep for 3-8 hours)

&amp;#x200B;

So I rarely take naps and I am 30ish now, but the people I am with said I was crying (I remember seeing my mom and was happy but then realized in that trance state , that she had passed away hence I thought I was crying in the half sleeping mode but it verbal?) This was a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

It happened again today and as I said I can hear everything around me as I slept, but my mind keeps moving to new situations and dreams and I noticed that in that dream I felt like I saw these childhood friends not too long ago and there were false memory's where I visited them and that and hanged out(I haven't seen them for over 16 years....) I woke myself up because I knew it was false but it felt like my mind was trying to make them as fact.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds weird or strange and I probably explained it badly, but has anyone have this happened to them? WTF is that about. It really pisses me off a lot honestly and why I refuse to take naps. but my living situation has changed drastically the last year)"
1540,I can only be happy for a week at a time,I don't know why I struggle with this so much but I have this overwhelming misery that I don't know how to deal with. There has been a lot of change in my life lately which might be making things more difficult but this problem isn't new. I'll start being happy and positive and doing really well but it takes a ton of energy and only lasts about a week before self loathing and self doubt creep back in. Why is it so hard for me to be happy long term? It's making my wife crazy and I feel like serious shit about it.
1541,Need help helping a friend,"Ok so my best friend has been dealing with mental health issues for basically her whole life and every since I met her I’ve basically become her therapist. 

The thing is, I have no fucking idea what I’m doing. I kind of just waffle and it tends to work since I guess she just needs someone to vent to. 

Basically, one of her main issues is that she ‘needs’ validation from men in order to feel ‘worthy’. 

I’m not a psychologist but I reckon this is probably because her parents were very distant with her in her early life (they never said they loved her, one of her first memories is her mum holding a knife and shouting at her). 

I was just basically hoping someone could give some advice because all I’ve said is that she needs to try and love herself before wanting other people to. 

TL;DR: Friend needs validation from men to feel good. How can I help her"
1542,Can you get Tardive Dyskinesia from antidepressants?,My mom is on sertraline and olanzapine. I am worried she will develop tardive dyskinesia. I know antipsychotic medication can cause it too but since she is taking olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic) her changes are lowered than with first gen meds. But I read online things that say that you can get it with sertraline as well and i an really curious how likely it is to actually get tardive dyskinesia? Should I be worried?

1544,Am I gaslighted by my mom’s husband about depression and suicide?,"TW: Suicide, Depression (If you don’t wanna read my mom’s husband berating people afflicted with depression and victims of suicide, turn back now)


















I recently got into an argument with my moms husband about some family drama. I’ve been nice to him up until this point, and my first point of contention years back was the weekend after Anthony Bourdain’s suicide, upon which he made a disgusting comment about his suicide (which he repeated in his text to me just now below). At the time, I was cordial, because I wanted my mother to be happy with someone who cares about her and wants to be with her, so for her sake, I kept my mouth shut. Recently, I brought up to my mother that this was my first point of contention with him, especially since I’m someone myself whose battling depression and has struggled with suicidal thoughts. She brings it up with him, and now I got this text from him. I just wanna ask, am I being gaslighted about depression and suicide? [I left my name out below as a matter of privacy, I inserted [me] in place of it]:

“Regarding Anthony Bourdain and even Robin Williams for that matter...I use to be big fans of both individuals. I’m allowed to be pissed that they chose to kill themselves. Yes, depression is a disease and it sucks and it affects many people, some worse than others. It doesn’t mean that it’s ok to kill yourself or that suicide should be condoned. The media spends too much time sensationalizing celebrity suicide and not enough time talking about the people who work their ass off to pick themselves off the floor and turn their lives around. Bourdain and Williams had family, friends and fans who would have done anything to support them. Instead they chose to be selfish and kill themselves. The definition of selfish is lacking consideration of others. These individuals made a decision which caused their families and others to be hurt and to live in regret wondering what they could have done to help. What’s worse, is the impact on all the regular people, who suffer from depression that idolized these folks. No one ever talks about the copy cat suicides that result from celebrities killing themselves. People that work hard to turn their lives around are my hero's. Those who do the opposite and take the easy way out, I feel, are the opposite of hero’s which if you look it up, would be cowards. I’m allowed to have my opinion. I’ve had a close acquaintance in college who killed himself. I also watched my mom who died at 40 of cancer fight with all her might unsuccessfully to stay alive when she could have given up. Just because I think Anthony Bourdain is a selfish coward doesn’t mean that I spat in the face of everyone that has suffered with depression. It’s a silly argument. I don’t see how you can connect the dots. I was talking about Anthony Bourdain. I wasn’t talking about you or anyone else for that matter. If you said something about a person with red hair, I wouldn’t be offended because every person with red hair is not the same. And if I were offended by something you said then I would talk to you about it instead of walking around angry. I feel bad that you suffer from depression. [me], there are a lot of people including myself who are always here to help you.”"
1545,I feel like i have a need to feel pain in order to feel anything at all,"It doesn’t make a lotta sense but i want to feel pain. I wonder if it’s the only way of feeling anything at all. I’m not just talking about physical pain but also emotional pain. The kind of pain that make you nauseous... the gut wrenching pain that you would never want to feel twice.  I think that’s the only way i know how to feel anything at all. Or maybe because it’s the only familiar thing that i know?! I’ve never been in a good or healthy relationship, perhaps that’s the reason why i feel about what i feel. It’s like Stockholm syndrome for me, it’s only that I’m my own predator. The itch for emotional pain is growing louder every day, almost as if a part of me misses being abused in some sort of way. I understand that it’s unhealthy and my mum tries to understand me but fails, i dont blame her tho. It’s complicated, i understand. It’s just that idk how much longer I’ll have to suffer enough to satisfy that itch."
1546,Taking a break from reddit and discord,"I need to work hard so my parents won't punish me. I'm going to zooms again! I stopped because I've fallen back into depression and super high stress levels. Plus it's also giving me major headaches because of how much time I spend on a laptop each day on reddit and shit. No, I'm not quitting just taking a break. My friend is helping me catch up since we are in most of the same classes. Hope to see you all soon :)"
1547,Stoping medication,My mom doesn't want me to take medication for life. I'm 22 years old and she doesn't understand why I have too. I grew up with so much trauma from my mom. That she doesn't understand she doesn't see it as anything WRONG. And I can't even explain it to her because she doesn't understand at all. I try to talk to her about it but she doesn't see what She did as wrong. She's like it's your brain how can you not control it?? It's all in your head. Yeah she's right it's all in my head that I'm not right. I'm thinking about stopping it. I just don't look forward to the withdrawal symptoms. I dont want to be like I was before 4 years ago. Lying to get attention being angry being depressed. She says it's all in my head and I need to stop. So maybe I will stop. But I also need to really move out. She affects me a lot. She says you say one medication doesn't work for you than you move to one or the other and this and that she says she doesn't  get the point. So I just am annoyed. I'll stop and I'll try to control myself. I still do therapy every week. So maybe that would work. I just need to stop. Over thinking and everything else. Do I have enough strength to do it? I hope so.
1548,"Dry crying everyday for months. Feels like I'm crying, but tears don't come out","For the past few months I've been depressed and angry with myself. Also have anxiety. I even get headaches, dizziness, and heart palpitations. It feels unbearable. I feel like crying everyday. Every morning I wakeup, at random times during the day, and sometimes at night before sleeping. I never felt anything like this.  Some days there are tears, but most of the time it's a feeling without the tears. I rather sob and let the emptions out to feel better. Instead of dry crying for sometimes hours

The urge to cry overwhelms me no matter how positive I try to be. It's weird because the amount of emotions I feel lately would make me cry a waterfall in the past. Thinking about my life now is not too depressing. Honestly it's not bad and I've been through much worse.  I would go years without crying up until recently. Am I at a breaking point now? Or does dry crying mean I'm not depressed enough to truly cry."
1549,Would it be rude to switch mental health counselors after mine had to rescheduled 3 times this month?,"For a little background, the last time I saw my counselor was January 2nd. During that appointment we discussed my recent ADHD diagnosis. She didn't get the full report until a few minutes into my appointment, so we agreed to start CBT focused on ADHD at my next appointment on the 8th. On the 8th, 15th, and today she texted me and asked to reschedule. I'll admit that part of my frustration comes from two occasions last fall where she was called to the local school and I showed up to a locked office. I feel bad even considering switching, all of these last minute changes have been because of her mother's poor health and today her mother passed away. But I'm finishing up my second week of classes and feel really uncomfortable with the possibility of changing my study style starting in my 4th week (the earliest appointment she could give me was the 29th). The only other counseling service I've contacted so far is scheduling initial appointments two months out. I'm considering saying screw the therapy for two months and take my recommendation for medication, but I'm also concerned about the adjustment period on that affecting my studies as well. Advice?"
1550,Confused,"Recently I've been having mood swings like yesterday I was very happy hour later I was sad few minutes ago I was neutral now I'm sad for no reason, I thought I might post on here I'm just so confused any suggestions or help or anything would be appreciated"
1551,Lost I guess," **If anyone decides to read this it's just rambling I thought of while setting my mind straight hence it's as organized as Walmart's spices section.**

Escapism is a mental diversion from unpleasant or boring aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism may be used to occupy one's self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness. 

I think I could say I deal with this pretty hard.

I mean I’m not sure if I even enjoy life I want to LIVE but It feels like I’m just breathing as it stands the only enjoyment I get comes from reading/playing games to stop thinking about what will go on in the future.

I don’t think I want kids. I'm not a people person. I'm not sure if I even want a ‘partner’ so to say.

It’s just our world’s boring. I guess that’s why I’m so driven to fantasy my two hobbies are just me escaping to another world so I can enjoy something. 

Personally I struggle to find joy in a lot of things. I mean I’m growing up yeah I’ll be 17 in a couple months from which I’m planning on dropping out.

School isn’t/hasn’t been for me for years the longer I stay in it the worse my mental state gets. I really can't bring myself to care for it at all anymore.

I got into games early and reading a bit later.

Reading I guess is one of the biggest things that led me to this mindset.

I think what got me fully hooked on reading and I guess fantasy as a whole was “Fablehaven” by “Brandon Mull” in the 4th grade the world just hooked me ya know?

From there as years went on I enjoyed school less and less. I started understanding things less. I found it harder to make friends. I didn’t really have anyone. I guess I had my parents and brother. Me and my Brother have never really shared interests, sure we both enjoyed games but that’s where the list ends. School was just... I could talk to people and hold a conversation but I just bounced friend groups trying to find one.

Like sure I’ve had friends but they never stuck besides a few even then I don’t think it’ll last. I'm just not good with people. I prefer solitude.

That’s how it went on for years until I just gave up and put all the time I could into reading and playing games since that’s the only way I could find some enjoyment.

But I’m aiming on getting a G.E.D. and after that do I just live? 

I guess this could be cause I’m terrified of going into adulthood and don’t realize it?

But if I’m not enjoying life itself even if I want to live in the end I’m just breathing not living.

I’ve spent a lot of time going to war with myself and it isn't fun. I've had thoughts I wish I wouldn't due to how little I love this world. I wonder how things would have gone if I didn't love my parents as much as I do. Or if I just ended up with shitty parents. Damn I got lucky in that department.

Scared to admit it but I didn't have the parents I do. I don’t think that I would even be typing this. The biggest thing keeping me from even considering it is I just love my parents, I think it’s an easy way out, and I really want to read the next chapter of that web-novel or the next book in the series!

Things aren't made easier due to my ADHD. I have anger issues I’ve gotten better at controlling.

I have insomnia and it sucks sleeping is hard even with medicine and the nights I do sleep I have nightmares sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep.

Majority of my school years I went to school daily with 1-4 hours of sleep so I was never even able to pay attention. I struggled keeping myself awake. Later on I just became a kid who sat on his phone in class and if it got taken up, died, or I just wanted to prevent it getting jacked for the day I would day-dream the entire period.

And when I’m awake I devolve into reading to keep my mind out of my head and enjoy what people write. 

In the end I’m not sure what I should do. I could try and “Find my path” but how long would that take or would it even happen?

In the end I’m lost. I guess I have some plans like what career I want to go into but in the end I’ll just be breathing and not living. In that case I hope I die early if I don’t find my path.

I just don't want to spend my whole life searching for what might not even be there like the whole debate “would you rather live a long life or a short and happy life” and I pick second option it isn't a thought I hate feeling lost it’s confusing I really wonder if it’s worth trying to find the path."
1552,"feel like something may be wrong with me and i'm spiraling, don't even know who could help","i'm a 20(f) in my first semester of college. in high school i was a straight A student. i studied maybe 6 hours every day. i always had a plan that i'd go to a great college, have my shit together, study and achieve everything i'll put my mind to. 

we've been in lockdown since last march and i haven't been to school since. online school doesn't work for me. i didn't. learn. a. thing. i chose a very difficult college.i guess i just wanted to go in because it has a good name. i wasn't sure what major to take. i ended up with one that i didn't know too much about it, just that it'd get me where i want with my future job. (idk if the major is also somewhere else but not sure if it's the job for me. it sounded great when i imagined it but is it something that i *want* to do? something i'll *enjoy* doing? sounded interesting and looked cool in movies but) i was supposed to write admission tests but since corona happened, i didn't and most of us got in. i have a feeling that if i did write them, i wouldn't get in.

i thought i could probably major in anything and somehow make it. i'm not sure if it's the online situation or me choosing the wrong major. my classes don't interest me one bit, i'm dreading my next semester because all the people there are from specialized schools and i haven't heard/seen most of these things, never worked in a lab. i feel like i am so behind. 

i'm having my first final tomorrow and am writing this pretty much in the middle of a mental breakdown. i barely dragged myself through 3 hour long lectures that are filled to brim with greek letters and formulas and nothing else. i feel like i'm going to absolutely fail. and then more tests. i feel like my mental health has taken such a plunge,  i can't concentrate. i feel like i'm so stressed and stuck and can't do anyhting but at the same time, feel like i'm wasting every second i'm not studying. my whole being is such a wind whirl, i can't put it into words.

this, unfortunately lead to s\*lf h\*rm. i sound so pathetic but i didn't know what else to do with myself. i honestly feel like everyone would be better off if i disappeared. i don't want my parents to see me as a failure, i don't want to just be a dead weight on their shoulders, i don't want to make life harder for them. but college is dragging me down so bad. i'm considering dropping out or taking one year off. but i don't know what else i'd study. i'd like to go work somewhere but everything's closed and i'm not a senior programmer (or at least that's all the jobs i could find). what's worse is that my college is 8 hours away in a different country, i hate my dorm with passion and they're changing their regulations so much, i end up traveling up and down for 16 hours just to do one lab session and then they close again. i've been there for 2 or so days, just go there, sleep, come back maybe 3 times since december. 

i have to go back because of one test. just one. i don't want to, i don't have the energy to but i know i must go. i don't want to disappoint anyone. i don't want to be the shame. i know my parents are having problems with my sibling who is also suffering from a few mental health problems. i saw the toll it took on them and they don't deserve the same from me. i feel like i'm failing in life. being 'kinda smart' was the one thing i had going for me and i can't even complete a stupid uni course without breaking down like this.

i'm always jumping between 'i'll finish college just fine' and 'i can't go through 15 more minutes of this' in a span of like 15 minutes. i'm telling myself i'm probably mentally completely fine and just making shit up for attention or something. but then i think s\*lf h\*rm and considering suicide probably aren't the signs of a healthy mind. i don't know whether i shoud go see a specialist but i also do not want to make anyone pay for one. i feel like everyone would be better off without me and my bullshit.  i just don't know what to do, to me i should like a little whiny bitch but i don't know if i have it in me to tough it out. it feels like my head is in a twister and i can't think straight, can't concentrate and honestly, if i could just poof away, i would. idk if something's wrong with my head and i don't know what to do"
1553,I keep on overthinking,"Recently I’ve been overthinking too much to the point where I have thoughts of harming myself. There’s this empty pit inside myself that I don’t feel like it’ll go away. It’s been happening for almost a week now. Honestly the only reason I haven’t committed myself is because of my girlfriend. I feel like there’s something that I’ve done in the past that’s giving me this feeling but I have no idea what it could be. Perhaps I could just be looking into it too far since I’m growing up in a Catholic household and school and I was told there was a meaning in everything, but I don’t know anymore. I’ve almost lost all my reasons to live. Still don’t know if I’ll end up okay in the future.. hopefully this feeling will end soon in a positive result. I’ll try distracting myself the next time I get too ahead of myself, maybe I’ll look at that list of things I want to do with my girlfriend. I’m hoping to stop overthinking maybe somewhere this month, but I don’t think it works like that. Sorry for the shitty grammar and talking, mental health sucks as you can tell"
1554,Two big things happened this week,"So on Sunday I finally admitted to myself that I was abused as a child. Not just that I had a weird religious upbringing or that my parents had problems or any of that, but that some of the things they did to me and my siblings were abuse. I'm 33 years old. After a long, long time trying to handle it on my own through the lens of fundamentalist Christian religion. I've been getting treatment for anxiety and OCD for about two and a half years now. Finding a therapist was hard for me because my first experience with therapy was very negative, then Covid put another damper on that and I had to switch to tele-therapy and build up s trust relationship with another therapist who isn't even in the same state, but at least I've got access to that. I would say that things were getting worse at the time I started getting treatment and I have not had significant improvement.

On Tuesday, right before the end of my WFH shift, my fianceé who I've been with for five years came home with an envelope containing half of the money in our shared expenses account, and the ring, and took our dog with her to stay with her mom and asked me to decide if I'm going to be the one to stay or move by Sunday, and I'm doing what I can to make sure that I can afford to keep going on my own financially and move out posthaste, but it's a lot to handle in one week."
